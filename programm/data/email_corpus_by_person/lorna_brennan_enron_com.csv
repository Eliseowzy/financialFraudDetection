the Deal Dynegy CEO Chuck Watson told the investment community Monday that he was sure that the riskreward ratio in the planned merger with Enron Corp made it clearly worth doing the deal because the issues that decimated the former market leader were with its noncore businesses Explaining that his team had adequately bracketed the downside as the deal fell together over the past few weeks Watson said he could not be positive but noted that the upside was substantial and said he had a good deal of confidencethat well be absolutely fine here Dynegy which announced a billion cash stock and debt deal with its downtown Houston rival on Friday night joined with Enron executives including Chairman Kenneth Lay on Monday to answer as many questions as they could in about minutes If all goes to plan the two companies would become Dynegy Inc by the third quarter of the clear leader in natural gas and power marketing In the second quarter Enron and Dynegy combined sold a total of Bcfd of gas which represented of the volumes sold by the top gas marketers in North America Bcfd according to a ranking by NGI Enron was the top gas marketer with Bcfd and Dynegy was No with Bcfd Statistics provided by Marylandbased Energy Performance Review EPR show that Enron and Dynegy combined sold million kWh of power in the second quarter That total represented of the power sold by the top largest power marketers million kWh according to EPR Enron was in fifth place among power marketers with million kWh sold while Dynegy was in sixth place with million kWh The blending of the two will not come without challenges but Watson stressed he expects to see more opportunities than problems The opportunity appears to have come none too soon for Enron Greg Whalley Enrons president and a future member of Dynegys executive team confirmed that without some kind of equity investment in the company the once market leader probably could not have sustained its liquidity through the rest of this year We definitely needed to raise some type of equity capital said Whalley Under normal market conditions we would have had adequate liquidity This was not normal for Enron We would not have had liquidity to the end of the year Asked about asset sales in anticipation of meeting federal requirements to merge executives acknowledged there would be some but did not elaborate Whalley said that from an Enron perspective we have not spent a lot of time with Dynegy people to agree on a plan Chuck Watson has to clear what is core to Dynegy There are several assets for consideration to sell on the list Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay who will not be part of the management team but may hold a place on the Dynegy board of directors added that Enron already has billion in sales under contract all expected to close by the end of We also have three other significant international assets under contract said Lay referring to the among other things the Dabhol power plant in India Once the merger of Dynegy with Enron is successfully completed the new Dynegy will become the primary market player in all markets but there will be a significant difference in how the company moves forward noted Dynegy CFO Rob Doty Enrons financialbacked trading strategy will merge with the strong asset base of Dynegys Dynegy has protected itself on the downside however The deal includes an out for Dynegy if Enrons legal liabilities exceed billion Asked about the possibility that some of Enrons marketing and trading team may desert the company for another company Watson stressing that teamwork will be the guiding force going forward said if I were in this industry this is the combination Id work for This is an exciting day here Its been an exciting couple of weeks creating a platform for something really special in the future Enrons Whalley said that he believes the company will keep most of its team intact Theyre accustomed to being part of a winning deal he said and going forward they will be very pleased with the additional infusion of equity and the stability in the marketplace As of Monday morning Whalley said that activity looks pretty good and said there had been a positive reception to the merger Right now people are pleased with the introduction of new liquidity and really want to go about establishing or reestablishing the energy franchise Dynegy President Steve Bergstrom agreed Most traders want to be part of a winning team This is a combination that will be a winning team We have similar issues there as well The A players will stay around to be part of the winning team Bergstrom explained that when the merger is complete the new Dynegy will become the primary player in all markets He said Dynegy has a more assetbacked strategy adding that he has said before that you can only have one market maker and Enron clearly was it By combining the two companies there will be a blend of Dynegys asset strategy with Enrons financial skill set giving the new entity more liquidity marketmaking than Dynegy itself has historically done Added Watson both companies had a successful ratio and nothing is going to change thereIm a strong believer in teams and the team concept I dont want to see individuals do well if the company doesnt do well It will be imbedded in the whole company Ben Schlesinger whose company Schlesinger Associates analyzes the energy industry said Monday that the big problem in the merger is whether these two companies are able to pull togetherto harness whats there He said the two parties are clearly leaders but theoretically they will have to streamline their operations Both books are fairly strong he said and once their efficiencies are put together the new company will offer stable returns In the very short term however Schlesinger said there will be moves to other traders Other analysts also seemed to be throwing support behind the merger UBS Warburg reiterated its strong buy rating on Dynegy noting that if successfully executed this transaction would yield the most widely recognized respected and downright credible wholesaleretail energy merchant in the world However UBS warned that Dynegy still faces a daunting task in merging the operations and employees We are not naive in underestimating the enormous challenge at hand In the nearterm Enron must remain highly liquid investment grade and its employees must remain focused on keeping its core wholesaleretail franchises up and running Merrill Lynchs Donato Eassey reiterated the buy on Dynegy and moving to no opinion on Enron He said Dynegy has all the necessary skill sets and as importantly the financial stability resources and investor confidence and experience to get the job doneEnrons unparalleled online trading business should translate to significant prospects for the new Dynegy Curt Launer an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston added that despite the size of the new company we do not expect major divestitures or closing issues because of the lack of asset concentration and the inherent competitiveness of the natural gas and power marketing business He noted too that with the combination we have modeled a merchant unit that does less business because of cross trading between them and some expectation of a loss of market share Still Launer said Dynegy would become a formidable competitor benefiting from a market share in excess of of US natural gas and power trading markets As expected with most major merger announcements Moodys Investors Service placed the ratings of Dynegy and its subsidiaries under review for possible downgrade noting that notwithstanding the franchise benefits of the proposed merger the financial and business risks associated with the transaction could negatively impact Dynegys credit fundamentals The review affects about billion of Dynegy securities including its subsidiaries Illinova Corp and Illinois Power Co In its rating review Moodys said it will assess Dynegys plans to meet the liquidity needs of the combined entity and to deal with the uncertainty surrounding Enrons offbalance sheet transactions and contingent risksand examine the ultimate structure of the transaction and its impact on Dynegys financial leverage and on managements targeted debt levels The ratings service also plans to consider the governance framework within which the combined trading activities will operate Ratings under review are Dynegys Prime rating for commercial paper Dynegy Holdings Baa senior unsecured debt rating and its Prime rating for commercial paper Illinova Corps Baa senior unsecured debt rating and Illinois Power Cos Baa senior secured and Baa senior unsecured debt ratings and its Prime rating for commercial paper Fitch revised its rating watch on Enrons outstanding securities to evolving from negative where they were placed in late October The rating watch evolving means the ratings may be raised lowered or maintained Fitch also placed a rating watch negative on Dynegy and Dynegy Holdings longterm credit ratings which also means they could be lowered or affirmed The outstanding F rated commercial paper programs for Dynegy and Dynegy Holdings were not affected

FrontierNote I have the Western Frontier certificate filing if anyone wants to see it LB Petal Expansion ANR Lateral Extension Transcos Leidy Project OKd The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC issued several important certificates Wednesday for new gas pipeline infrastructure projects including final approvals for Transcontinental Gas Pipe Lines Leidy East expansion in Pennsylvania for a new pipeline by Petal Gas Storage in Mississippi and for an ANR lateral extension to serve to MW Badger power plant in Kenosha WI The Commission also denied rehearing of its orders granting Kern River Gas Transmission certificates to expand its system by about MMcfd Transcos million Leidy East pipe expansion project would make up for the failed Phase III portion of its MarketLink expansion The Leidy East project will provide up to Dthd of transportation from Leidy PA to northeastern markets in New Jersey New York and Pennsylvania The expansion consists of six pipeline loop segments that amount to miles of inch diameter pipe and about five miles of inch diameter pipe mostly in western Pennsylvania The project also would add hp of compression in Pennsylvania and New Jersey The Commissions authorization is being granted based on our findingsthat the proposed facilities will serve the public interest by increasing the pipeline capacity reaching the northeastern United States thereby helping to meet the rapid growth in electric generation demand in that market FERC said in its draft order Since the overwhelming majority of the proposed facilities will be constructed either entirely within or immediately adjacent to existing pipeline or utility rights of way the projects environmental impact will be minimized Finally Transcos existing customers will not subsidize the project because the expansion shippers will pay an incremental rate Transco said this summer that it expects the Leidy East facilities to be in service by November The Williams subsidiary said Aquila Energy Marketing Dthd PECO Energy Co Dthd Reliant Energy Services Dthd and Williams Energy Marketing Dthd are all customers The incremental reservation rate for service on the expanded facilities is Dthmonth The certificate granted to Petal Gas Storage LLC see related story covers a new pipeline that would extend miles to a connection with Southern Natural at a compressor station near Enterprise

extension will carry about MMcfd of gas to Badger Generating Cos proposed power plant in Wisconsin The project includes miles of inch diameter looping along ANRs Racine Lateral and a mile extension of the lateral to the Badger plant The project would cost million and should be in service during the summer of In the Kern River case shippers had requested rehearing of FERCs order granting Kern authorization for its Dthd Expansion Project and an additional Dthd under its revised California Action project Shippers claimed the project would allow the sale of additional delivery point rights at the Wheeler Ridge point in Southern California causing further pro rata reductions in capacity for existing shippers and diminishing their firm rights Shippers said the Commission should subordinate the delivery point rights of expansion shippers to those of existing shippers until Southern California Gas builds enough takeaway capacity at Wheeler Ridge to accommodate the additional volumes However the Commission upheld its initial conclusion that the benefits of the project outweighed any risks of degrading delivery point rights given the critical need for expansions of pipeline capacity to serve electric and natural gas infrastructure in California Gulf South Sees Strong Interest in Billion Southeast Pipe Houstonbased Gulf South Pipeline Co LP formerly Koch Gateway Pipeline on Wednesday said the open season for the companys proposed billion Gulf Pines Pipeline was extremely successful adding that response to the Bcfd line from the Southeast markets far exceeded the companys expectations The open season concluded on Sept The proposed mile inch diameter or greater natural gas pipeline which was first announced in August is expected to originate in Mobile AL and extend through the states of Georgia South Carolina and North Carolina The open season clearly confirmed that the demand exists for a competitive alternative to serve the growing power generation commercial residential and industrial markets in the southeastern United States said Gulf South President Rolf Gafvert The Gulf Pines project would interconnect with the existing Gulf South pipeline near Mobile Bay enabling customers to access not only Mobile Bay supplies but also gas supplies from Texas and Louisiana including Venice and the Henry Hub according to Gulf South a subsidiary of EntergyKoch LP The proposed pipeline also would have access to multiple thirdparty storage facilities such as Gulf Souths facility in Bistineau LA We anticipate that the projected growth of power plants will far exceed existing pipeline capacity in the southeastern region said Gulf South spokesman Marc Palazzo In addition to serving power generation the company said Gulf Pines would extend farther east into the Carolinas than any existing interstate pipeline bringing interstate pipeline service to a region that historically has not had service before Palazzo said the project would be filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission next year He added that the actual route of the proposed pipeline is still to be determined Gulf South said the anticipated inservice date is sometime in Gulf South currently owns and operates miles of pipeline with compressor stations and major pipeline interconnects extending from South Texas through the Gulf States and into the Florida market area Williams Files to Build Mile Western Frontier Pipe Williams Gas Pipeline has filed an application for a new million pipeline that would extend from the Cheyenne hub in northern Colorado to multiple pipeline interconnections in southwestern Kansas and the panhandle of Oklahoma The Western Frontier Pipeline would consist of miles of inch diameter pipe and horsepower of compression It would transport up to Dthd of gas to markets in the Midcontinent In addition to an interconnection with the Williams Central system Western Frontier proposes access to other major Midcontinent pipelines including ANR Pipeline Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Northern Natural Gas and Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America Western Frontier also would have access to the growing Oklahoma intrastate markets via the Williams Central system The pipeline is anticipated to be in service by Nov Western Frontier Pipeline is a costeffective environmentally responsible way to transport natural gas from prolific Rockies supply basins to markets in the Midcontinent said Kim Cocklin senior vice president and general manager of Williams Central and Texas Gas systems We look forward to building this pipeline to help alleviate the current shortage of interstate pipeline capacity coming out of the region which was recently cited by the US Energy Information Administration Customers interested in

Westpath Expansion plans filed at NEB TransCanada Plans Export Capacity Additions While it will take another two years for a Mackenzie Valley production and pipeline project to come together there are signs that a safety margin is developing in Canadian natural gas supplies Western Canadas established heavily exploited gas fields can still deliver production growth for years to come the National Energy Board has been told TransCanada PipeLines Ltd delivered the reassuring word in an application for a year expansion program dedicated primarily to increasing exports to California and the northwestern United States TransCanada predicted that production from the western provinces can rise by about to a sustained rate of Bcfd until at least Titled the Westpath Expansion TransCanadas proposal calls for million in new facilities to raise capacity on its British Columbia System by MMcfd or to about Bcfd The route crosses southeastern BC from the Alberta boundary to an export point on the US border where it fills PGE Gas Transmission Along with US traders and power generators customers lined up for the added service include Vancouver distributor BC Gas Utility Ltd and Powerex Corp a subsidiary of BC Hydro that procures fuel for gasfired power stations TransCanada told the NEB that it also expects to file a further expansion proposal in secondquarter for the BC System The agenda matches growth under way on PGE TransCanada acknowledges that its forecast of supplies from the western provinces is more optimistic than the current expectations of the NEB the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board and the Canadian Gas Potential Committee The pipeline company said its information goes beyond official public records to include confidential data from customers its own proprietary studies and updated information on results of last years boom in gas drilling The pipeline has told the NEB that with continued demand growth the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin should be able to support increasing levels of gas deliveries of up to Bcfd at least through this decade Production from Alberta BC and Saskatchewan averaged an estimated Bcfd in TransCanada also predicts that unconventional gas chiefly coalbed methane and possibly reserves in tight or difficult geological formations will enter production by about and eventually reach Bcfd But the pipeline projection acknowledges most tight gas is not currently considered economically available within the forecast horizon to the year and current technological assumptions At the same time TransCanada said there is also great uncertainty in predicting gas production from coal deposits because there is none yet in Canada In the absence of a performance record to guide reserves and production projections the pipeline says only that if research and development and economics lead to successful commercial operations these sources may start contributing supply this decade In a separate toll case before the NEB TransCanada predicts it will be before northern gas from either the Northwest Territories or Alaska begins to flow south An announcement Jan by the Mackenzie Delta Producers Group and the Mackenzie Valley Aboriginal Pipeline Corp suggested that TransCanadas educated guesswork is on the money After nearly two years of preliminary feasibility studies and consultations with northern communities the group Imperial Oil Conoco Canada Shell Canada and ExxonMobil Canada declared intentions to go ahead on a second planning stage Next comes the project definition phase or million in technical environmental commercial and consultation work required to make regulatory applications for field gasgathering and pipeline facilities Conoco predicted the package will be completed and placed before Canadian authorities in The group says it intends to tap Arctic discoveries called Taglu Parsons Lake and Niglintgak to send Bcfd south to northwestern Alberta The plan calls for the gas to finish its trip to markets via spare capacity on TransCanadas system TransCanada is in step with the groups expectations in suggesting it will take five years beyond to collect approvals and build the project The pipeline companys forecast suggests northern production will arrive gradually going from a starting rate at MMcfd in to MMcfd in Bcfd in Bcfd in and Bcfd by The new forecast still does not predict which northern gas will flow however As a partner in the reborn Alaskan Northwest Natural Gas Transportation Co TransCanada is teamed up with eight other companies to revive the Alaska Highway pipeline route worked out in the s for production from Prudhoe Bay In the documents before the NEB TransCanada says it recognizes various uncertainties with respect to northern gas supply regarding economics timing routing and scope Its unclear as to which pipeline will be successful in attracting northern gas

updates Enrons Lay Urges Bold Solutions to Power Market Woes As the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission prepared to weigh in this morning with the federal governments answer to Californias bedeviled power market free market advocates issued last minute warnings against taking the price cap route espoused by the CalISO FERCs meeting is scheduled to start at AM EST Check this morning for updates In a letter fired off to FERC Chairman James J Hoecker yesterday Enron CEO Kenneth Lay urged the Commission to find a fix for the underlying structural problems in the power market rather than follow the steps of policy makers who have placed price cap band aids over hemorrhaging wounds Lay told Hoecker the power market is halfway across a busy street in its transition from monopoly to competition It cant stand where it is He said FERC has to make a choice between falling into the same trap of political expediency as Californias ISO leaving the nations electric system in the lurch from one crisis to the next or it can take a big step toward fundamental structural reform At the same time the Electric Power Supply Association EPSA called on FERC to issue an emergency cease and desist order prohibiting the CalISO from unilaterally implementing any changes to its current MWh price cap for wholesale electricity purchases In a motion filed Monday the marketer group specifically asked the Commission to bar the CalISO board of directors from putting into effect its decision to impose a fiendishly complex loaddifferentiated price cap of or less during the offpeak season effective Nov The plan was designed by the states main utility consumer group see Daily GPI Oct In addition the EPSA urged FERC to state explicitly that the CalISO does not have the authority to impose or extend price or bid caps unless expressly authorized to do so by the Commission The CalISOs current authority to set price caps expires on Nov Lay said the CalISOs complicated new formula caps prices below the cost of gasfired generation making obvious errors such as failing to take into account gas transportation costs between the Henry Hub and power plants in California in doing so the bid cap makes it more economic for generators to sell their gas supply rather than use it to make electricity in California The new formula also forces the ISO into the market to buy power on an ad hoc basis to keep the lights on when the capped market fails to attract sufficient supplies which it inevitably will do Lay said In addition the capped formula invites generators to shut in production export power out of state and deploy their turbines in other states or countries He noted that the ISOs Chairman voted against the measure while all of the states utilities voted for it presumably knowing full well that it simply will not work California is just the latest failure of partial or compromised open access said Lay Its time for the Commission to reject this approach The power industry the nations most essential industry is mired in the transition from regulated monopoly to open access and customer choice Every step forward has been compromised out of concern for alienating one vested interest or another As a result utilities are free to slow the interconnection of new generation withhold equal access to the transmission system favor their own sales over those of competitors miscalculated available transmission capacity and exercise control over supposedly independent system operators and reliability organizations Lay predicted that installing price caps for political expediency would plunge markets into greater uncertainty and discourage new supplies and conservation methods FERC has to complete the work that it started said Lay It has to ensure that all parties have equal and fair access to transmission by ending the special priority for utility uses of the system Second FERC must require transmission owners to separate operation of the monopoly transmission assets from their other businesses Third FERC must take politics out of transmission system operations by revising governance structures to ensure independence Finally FERC must end its reliance on shortsighted price caps by putting in place the necessary reforms to allow these markets to operate efficiently to encourage conservation and attract new supplies EPSA said the CalISO board acted in obvious disregard for the Commissions orderly processes It cannot be permitted to make the Commissions decisions for it or to alter so radically market rules thereby injecting more uncertainty and confusion in the market and subverting the process for fashioning fair effective and comprehensive remedies for Californias flawed electric markets the group noted The EPSA believes that any remedial actions taken by FERC with respect to the California markets will be severely compromised if the CalISO boards imposition of new prices caps is allowed to take effect

prices and alternate fuel pricing Note the price differential forecasts by basin CERA Alert Sent Wed November Title Midmonth Report Early Warning Author N American Gas Team EMail Category Alert Product Line North American Gas URL cfmtrackeprofilecfmum Alternative URL clientnagaltnagaltabhtml After a warm October the first cold weather this year has provided an early warning of what winter could bring for the gas market Cold weather across much of the great plains and a cold forecast for larger heating markets in the Midwest and Northeast have driven a surge in gas prices of more than per million British thermal units MMBtu over the past week This rebound in price highlighted the continued tightness of supply and moved the price of gas back above that of residual fuel oil assuring that dualfuel loads remain off of gas Supplies for the winter are not adequate to allow most dualfuel end users to burn gas If this cold snap extends through the remainder of November a heavy earlywinter draw on storage could set the stage for unprecedented high prices through the winter Though storage inventories have reached near the billion cubic feet Bcf level they remain at a record low heading into the heating season and even a normal winter would reduce inventories to a near record or record absolute low by spring This supply tightness places the gas price playing field in the broad territory above the resid price near in the Gulf Coast and into a range potentially testing the next difficult level of demand resistance This resistance could come from switching to distillate oil but low distillate inventories and high distillate prices mean that switching would require a gas price above per MMBtu and any move to switch to distillate would likely drive prices of both commodities higher Rather a combination of some switching to resid in industrial boilers and a shutdown of a few more pricesensitive end users may be required None of these measures comes easily or cheaply however and they can be overwhelmed by weatherdriven swings in demand As a result as cold weather settles in CERA expects heightened price volatility at levels above the price of resid and extreme sensitivity in the market to weather and weather forecasts Under normal weather conditions CERA expects Henry Hub prices to average during December see Table which by itself would represent an all time high for December But even this estimate could prove low If the current cold snap extends through early December prices could easily climb into the per MMBtu range Gas StorageThe Record Low Maximum CERA estimates that storage inventories reached a maximum of Bcf as of the end of October a record low for that month by Bcf see Table Even this level was reached only through a fortunate combination of a lack of storms in the Gulf of Mexico and consistent warmth through most of October The withdrawal season is likely to have begun this week however and in a strong way The cold weather now settling in is likely to offset warmth early this month increasing the withdrawal rate this November to Bcf per day on average well above the Bcf per day average rate of the past two years By the end of this month the US inventory deficit is likely to have widened again to Bcf CERA estimates that normal December weather would require storage withdrawals of approximately Bcf per day which is above last years rate of Bcf per day This year however this withdrawal rate would apply consistent pressure in the market through December and beyond as it would keep inventories on a path to reach Bcf by the end of March just below the alltime endofMarch low of Bcf So long as inventories remain on this path the pressure does not end even with the end of winter as a significant increase in injections next year would be required for inventories to reach even trillion cubic feet Tcf by next fall Although the supply build will begin to help by late winter it is unlikely to be of the magnitude required both to offset power generation demand growth and to allow this increase in storage injections to occurunless demand continues to be priced out of the market DemandKeeping Warm After last years warm winter CERA expects a strong rebound in heating demand and this weeks weather and forecast reinforce that expectation Weather last winter November through March was the warmest of the decade and there will be a significant rebound in heating demand in the residential and commercial sectors as weather returns toward normal this heating season Under normal weather conditions Average heating demand through the winter would be Bcf per day higher than last years Monthly average heating demand through the winter would be Bcf per day peaking at Bcf per day in January December heating demand would increase by Bcf per day relative to last December Weather percent colder than normal could further increase December demand by Bcf per day relative to normal weather likewise a percent warmerthannormal scenario could decrease demand by Bcf per day relative to normal weather Fuel Switching With natural gas markets this tight there is significant pressure for demand to be backed out of the market Residential and commercial demand is inelastic to price in the short run which leaves industrial demand and power demand as the only relief valve for the market This winter we expect all plants capable of burning residual fuel oil as an alternative to gas to do so a loss of million cubic feet MMcf per day of demand for power generation relative to last winter industrial consumers to switch the equivalent of MMcf per day off of gas gas prices to act as a ceiling for residual fuel oil prices as much as resid will act as a floor for gas For December CERA expects an overall demand increase of Bcf per day relative to last December and a Bcf per day increase in demand relative to November with increasing heating load offset somewhat by fuel switching SupplyThe Rebound The pressure from increasing demand and lower storage inventories is intense but US supply is beginning to rebound The recent steep decline in US lower capacity is expected to reverse in late given the soaring gasrelated rig count The success in reversing the decline in the Gulf of Mexico is related to the combination of the rampup of the Hickory and Tanzanite subsalt discoveries on the shelf adding to the recent startup of the Muni field these fields could add over Bcf per day later in the response of the shallow water to the strong late turnaround in drilling activity Other important capacity additions are occurring in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico with Bcf per day in and and onshore led by the Bossier sand play in Freestone County Texas the Barnett Shale play in Wise County Texas and the Powder River Basin coal seam play Further increases in drilling are likely to slow New deep land rigs are under construction and shallow rigs are being refurbished with cannibalized parts from older rigs Producers are experiencing delays in obtaining rigs as the supply of quality rigs depletes and drilling companies struggle to round out drilling crews Regional MarketsWild Winter in the West Extremely cold weather in the West has brought Rockies prices close to parity with Henry Hub prices and triggered early season spikes at Sumas in the north and Topock in the south Pipeline maintenance on El Paso is exacerbating the regional demand pressure and has contributed to Topock differentials of over per MMBtu Tight pricing relationships to the Henry Hub in the San Juan and Rocky Mountains should hold through February with significant widening in differentials as heating loads decline Winter has arrived in earnest across North America but the startup of firm transportation service on Alliance is delayed once again this time until December Nonetheless flows on the pipeline are under way CERA estimates that flows during October averaged MMcf per day During November that total should climb to MMcf per day despite the later published start date With or without Alliance flows a weatherdriven rebound in midwestern demand relative to November and December last year should keep prices in Chicago at a significant premium to Henry Hub prices In the Northeast differentials remain extremely strong and exposed to spikes throughout the winter despite greater flows into the region from Atlantic Canada this year see Table CERAs outlook by region follows Rockies Very cold weather within the region has brought Rocky Mountain prices near parity with Henry Hub prices A break in the cold or a cold snap in the East will likely widen the differentials but strong heating demand in the region will keep differentials within about per MMBtu below the Henry Hub price CERA expects a December average differential of per MMBtu however this differential is expected to show significant volatility based on regional weather A warm week in the Rockies could still push differentials toward per MMBtu San Juan San Juan prices will continue to hold close to Rockies prices through the winter with significant pipeline capacity between the two regions Heating loads in the Rockies will determine the San Juan to Henry Hub differential with extended cold weather in the Rockies pulling both prices close to the Henry Hub price CERA expects the December differential in the San Juan Basin to average per MMBtu Permian and MidContinent Unlike prices within the rest of the West differentials between the Henry Hub and the MidContinent and Permian Basins are likely to trade within a relatively narrow range during the winter as supplies from those basins are pulled either east or west depending on regional weather CERA expects a Permian to Henry Hub differential of per MMBtu and a MidContinent differential of per MMBtu for December Chicago Alliance flows into the Chicago market are now running close to MMcf per day However the onset of the heating season has offset those increased flows and pushed Chicago differentials up to near per MMBtu relative to the Henry Hub despite delays in the completion of the Vector pipeline CERA expects the strong pricing at Chicago to continue and December differentials should average per MMBtu Northeast markets Assuming normal weather we expect to see December basis for New York relative to Henry Hub at per MMBtu New England will likely see prices higher depending on the pipeline Much of this increased basis differential is caused by fuel costs For example with a percent retention rate from the Gulf Coast into New England last December would have seen retention costs of approximately at that same retention equates to Despite additional volumes of gas deliverable into the Northeast from the Atlantic Canadian fields there have been no additional regional pipeline facilities to deliver this gas to the local markets and an additional MMBtu per day of potential demand will compete for the capacity Because of this tightness should this months weather be colder than normal we could see severe spikes in basis similar to those seen in January These spikes could even exceed the highs seen in January depending on the severity of any cold snaps and the extent to which new electric loads are realized Canadian MarketsWinter Begins The colderthannormal weather has increased demand in western Canada but is only now being felt in the East Storage peaked in the West in early October at approximately Bcf below last years level and Bcf below the fiveyear average Even with modest withdrawals since that time storage inventories are still estimated to be adequate to meet winter needs Easter Canadian storage has continued to grow pushing levels to over Bcf Bcf above last year and well above the fiveyear average With the eastward movement of the colder weather withdrawals are likely to begin This higher level of eastern storage will be useful with the expected reduction of flows on TransCanada The good news resulting from the cold is a more normal freezeup which bodes well for a longer winter drilling season Gas well completions are expected to reach for and will likely be even higher next year Further Delays for Alliance The commercial inservice date for Alliance has been delayed until December the result of a combination of problems with clearing the line delays in the completion of the Aux Sable liquids extraction plant the delay of Vector and a lack of supply The pipeline has been flowing gas however with volumes building up since September It is estimated that flows for November will average MMcf per day TransCanada has taken the full brunt of the Alliance flows so far with Northern Border and PGT remaining strong December should see Alliance flows build to between and MMcf per day with modest reductions in flows on Northern Border and PGT Storage withdrawals will likely keep TransCanada reductions close to MMcf per day year overyear until Vector begins service to eastern Canada High Prices Strong Pull West The high demand in the Pacific Northwest has also provided strength for AECO The AECOHenry differential has dropped to the high s and low s as a result of this increased pull For December the differential is expected to average per MMBtu for a resulting AECO average of C per gigajoule US per MMBtu end Follow URL for PDF version of this message with

updates Enrons Lay Urges Bold Solutions to Power Market Woes As the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission prepared to weigh in this morning with the federal governments answer to Californias bedeviled power market free market advocates issued last minute warnings against taking the price cap route espoused by the CalISO FERCs meeting is scheduled to start at AM EST Check this morning for updates In a letter fired off to FERC Chairman James J Hoecker yesterday Enron CEO Kenneth Lay urged the Commission to find a fix for the underlying structural problems in the power market rather than follow the steps of policy makers who have placed price cap band aids over hemorrhaging wounds Lay told Hoecker the power market is halfway across a busy street in its transition from monopoly to competition It cant stand where it is He said FERC has to make a choice between falling into the same trap of political expediency as Californias ISO leaving the nations electric system in the lurch from one crisis to the next or it can take a big step toward fundamental structural reform At the same time the Electric Power Supply Association EPSA called on FERC to issue an emergency cease and desist order prohibiting the CalISO from unilaterally implementing any changes to its current MWh price cap for wholesale electricity purchases In a motion filed Monday the marketer group specifically asked the Commission to bar the CalISO board of directors from putting into effect its decision to impose a fiendishly complex loaddifferentiated price cap of or less during the offpeak season effective Nov The plan was designed by the states main utility consumer group see Daily GPI Oct In addition the EPSA urged FERC to state explicitly that the CalISO does not have the authority to impose or extend price or bid caps unless expressly authorized to do so by the Commission The CalISOs current authority to set price caps expires on Nov Lay said the CalISOs complicated new formula caps prices below the cost of gasfired generation making obvious errors such as failing to take into account gas transportation costs between the Henry Hub and power plants in California in doing so the bid cap makes it more economic for generators to sell their gas supply rather than use it to make electricity in California The new formula also forces the ISO into the market to buy power on an ad hoc basis to keep the lights on when the capped market fails to attract sufficient supplies which it inevitably will do Lay said In addition the capped formula invites generators to shut in production export power out of state and deploy their turbines in other states or countries He noted that the ISOs Chairman voted against the measure while all of the states utilities voted for it presumably knowing full well that it simply will not work California is just the latest failure of partial or compromised open access said Lay Its time for the Commission to reject this approach The power industry the nations most essential industry is mired in the transition from regulated monopoly to open access and customer choice Every step forward has been compromised out of concern for alienating one vested interest or another As a result utilities are free to slow the interconnection of new generation withhold equal access to the transmission system favor their own sales over those of competitors miscalculated available transmission capacity and exercise control over supposedly independent system operators and reliability organizations Lay predicted that installing price caps for political expediency would plunge markets into greater uncertainty and discourage new supplies and conservation methods FERC has to complete the work that it started said Lay It has to ensure that all parties have equal and fair access to transmission by ending the special priority for utility uses of the system Second FERC must require transmission owners to separate operation of the monopoly transmission assets from their other businesses Third FERC must take politics out of transmission system operations by revising governance structures to ensure independence Finally FERC must end its reliance on shortsighted price caps by putting in place the necessary reforms to allow these markets to operate efficiently to encourage conservation and attract new supplies EPSA said the CalISO board acted in obvious disregard for the Commissions orderly processes It cannot be permitted to make the Commissions decisions for it or to alter so radically market rules thereby injecting more uncertainty and confusion in the market and subverting the process for fashioning fair effective and comprehensive remedies for Californias flawed electric markets the group noted The EPSA believes that any remedial actions taken by FERC with respect to the California markets will be severely compromised if the CalISO boards imposition of new prices caps is allowed to take effect

prices and alternate fuel pricing Note the price differential forecasts by basin CERA Alert Sent Wed November Title Midmonth Report Early Warning Author N American Gas Team EMail Category Alert Product Line North American Gas URL cfmtrackeprofilecfmum Alternative URL clientnagaltnagaltabhtml After a warm October the first cold weather this year has provided an early warning of what winter could bring for the gas market Cold weather across much of the great plains and a cold forecast for larger heating markets in the Midwest and Northeast have driven a surge in gas prices of more than per million British thermal units MMBtu over the past week This rebound in price highlighted the continued tightness of supply and moved the price of gas back above that of residual fuel oil assuring that dualfuel loads remain off of gas Supplies for the winter are not adequate to allow most dualfuel end users to burn gas If this cold snap extends through the remainder of November a heavy earlywinter draw on storage could set the stage for unprecedented high prices through the winter Though storage inventories have reached near the billion cubic feet Bcf level they remain at a record low heading into the heating season and even a normal winter would reduce inventories to a near record or record absolute low by spring This supply tightness places the gas price playing field in the broad territory above the resid price near in the Gulf Coast and into a range potentially testing the next difficult level of demand resistance This resistance could come from switching to distillate oil but low distillate inventories and high distillate prices mean that switching would require a gas price above per MMBtu and any move to switch to distillate would likely drive prices of both commodities higher Rather a combination of some switching to resid in industrial boilers and a shutdown of a few more pricesensitive end users may be required None of these measures comes easily or cheaply however and they can be overwhelmed by weatherdriven swings in demand As a result as cold weather settles in CERA expects heightened price volatility at levels above the price of resid and extreme sensitivity in the market to weather and weather forecasts Under normal weather conditions CERA expects Henry Hub prices to average during December see Table which by itself would represent an all time high for December But even this estimate could prove low If the current cold snap extends through early December prices could easily climb into the per MMBtu range Gas StorageThe Record Low Maximum CERA estimates that storage inventories reached a maximum of Bcf as of the end of October a record low for that month by Bcf see Table Even this level was reached only through a fortunate combination of a lack of storms in the Gulf of Mexico and consistent warmth through most of October The withdrawal season is likely to have begun this week however and in a strong way The cold weather now settling in is likely to offset warmth early this month increasing the withdrawal rate this November to Bcf per day on average well above the Bcf per day average rate of the past two years By the end of this month the US inventory deficit is likely to have widened again to Bcf CERA estimates that normal December weather would require storage withdrawals of approximately Bcf per day which is above last years rate of Bcf per day This year however this withdrawal rate would apply consistent pressure in the market through December and beyond as it would keep inventories on a path to reach Bcf by the end of March just below the alltime endofMarch low of Bcf So long as inventories remain on this path the pressure does not end even with the end of winter as a significant increase in injections next year would be required for inventories to reach even trillion cubic feet Tcf by next fall Although the supply build will begin to help by late winter it is unlikely to be of the magnitude required both to offset power generation demand growth and to allow this increase in storage injections to occurunless demand continues to be priced out of the market DemandKeeping Warm After last years warm winter CERA expects a strong rebound in heating demand and this weeks weather and forecast reinforce that expectation Weather last winter November through March was the warmest of the decade and there will be a significant rebound in heating demand in the residential and commercial sectors as weather returns toward normal this heating season Under normal weather conditions Average heating demand through the winter would be Bcf per day higher than last years Monthly average heating demand through the winter would be Bcf per day peaking at Bcf per day in January December heating demand would increase by Bcf per day relative to last December Weather percent colder than normal could further increase December demand by Bcf per day relative to normal weather likewise a percent warmerthannormal scenario could decrease demand by Bcf per day relative to normal weather Fuel Switching With natural gas markets this tight there is significant pressure for demand to be backed out of the market Residential and commercial demand is inelastic to price in the short run which leaves industrial demand and power demand as the only relief valve for the market This winter we expect all plants capable of burning residual fuel oil as an alternative to gas to do so a loss of million cubic feet MMcf per day of demand for power generation relative to last winter industrial consumers to switch the equivalent of MMcf per day off of gas gas prices to act as a ceiling for residual fuel oil prices as much as resid will act as a floor for gas For December CERA expects an overall demand increase of Bcf per day relative to last December and a Bcf per day increase in demand relative to November with increasing heating load offset somewhat by fuel switching SupplyThe Rebound The pressure from increasing demand and lower storage inventories is intense but US supply is beginning to rebound The recent steep decline in US lower capacity is expected to reverse in late given the soaring gasrelated rig count The success in reversing the decline in the Gulf of Mexico is related to the combination of the rampup of the Hickory and Tanzanite subsalt discoveries on the shelf adding to the recent startup of the Muni field these fields could add over Bcf per day later in the response of the shallow water to the strong late turnaround in drilling activity Other important capacity additions are occurring in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico with Bcf per day in and and onshore led by the Bossier sand play in Freestone County Texas the Barnett Shale play in Wise County Texas and the Powder River Basin coal seam play Further increases in drilling are likely to slow New deep land rigs are under construction and shallow rigs are being refurbished with cannibalized parts from older rigs Producers are experiencing delays in obtaining rigs as the supply of quality rigs depletes and drilling companies struggle to round out drilling crews Regional MarketsWild Winter in the West Extremely cold weather in the West has brought Rockies prices close to parity with Henry Hub prices and triggered early season spikes at Sumas in the north and Topock in the south Pipeline maintenance on El Paso is exacerbating the regional demand pressure and has contributed to Topock differentials of over per MMBtu Tight pricing relationships to the Henry Hub in the San Juan and Rocky Mountains should hold through February with significant widening in differentials as heating loads decline Winter has arrived in earnest across North America but the startup of firm transportation service on Alliance is delayed once again this time until December Nonetheless flows on the pipeline are under way CERA estimates that flows during October averaged MMcf per day During November that total should climb to MMcf per day despite the later published start date With or without Alliance flows a weatherdriven rebound in midwestern demand relative to November and December last year should keep prices in Chicago at a significant premium to Henry Hub prices In the Northeast differentials remain extremely strong and exposed to spikes throughout the winter despite greater flows into the region from Atlantic Canada this year see Table CERAs outlook by region follows Rockies Very cold weather within the region has brought Rocky Mountain prices near parity with Henry Hub prices A break in the cold or a cold snap in the East will likely widen the differentials but strong heating demand in the region will keep differentials within about per MMBtu below the Henry Hub price CERA expects a December average differential of per MMBtu however this differential is expected to show significant volatility based on regional weather A warm week in the Rockies could still push differentials toward per MMBtu San Juan San Juan prices will continue to hold close to Rockies prices through the winter with significant pipeline capacity between the two regions Heating loads in the Rockies will determine the San Juan to Henry Hub differential with extended cold weather in the Rockies pulling both prices close to the Henry Hub price CERA expects the December differential in the San Juan Basin to average per MMBtu Permian and MidContinent Unlike prices within the rest of the West differentials between the Henry Hub and the MidContinent and Permian Basins are likely to trade within a relatively narrow range during the winter as supplies from those basins are pulled either east or west depending on regional weather CERA expects a Permian to Henry Hub differential of per MMBtu and a MidContinent differential of per MMBtu for December Chicago Alliance flows into the Chicago market are now running close to MMcf per day However the onset of the heating season has offset those increased flows and pushed Chicago differentials up to near per MMBtu relative to the Henry Hub despite delays in the completion of the Vector pipeline CERA expects the strong pricing at Chicago to continue and December differentials should average per MMBtu Northeast markets Assuming normal weather we expect to see December basis for New York relative to Henry Hub at per MMBtu New England will likely see prices higher depending on the pipeline Much of this increased basis differential is caused by fuel costs For example with a percent retention rate from the Gulf Coast into New England last December would have seen retention costs of approximately at that same retention equates to Despite additional volumes of gas deliverable into the Northeast from the Atlantic Canadian fields there have been no additional regional pipeline facilities to deliver this gas to the local markets and an additional MMBtu per day of potential demand will compete for the capacity Because of this tightness should this months weather be colder than normal we could see severe spikes in basis similar to those seen in January These spikes could even exceed the highs seen in January depending on the severity of any cold snaps and the extent to which new electric loads are realized Canadian MarketsWinter Begins The colderthannormal weather has increased demand in western Canada but is only now being felt in the East Storage peaked in the West in early October at approximately Bcf below last years level and Bcf below the fiveyear average Even with modest withdrawals since that time storage inventories are still estimated to be adequate to meet winter needs Easter Canadian storage has continued to grow pushing levels to over Bcf Bcf above last year and well above the fiveyear average With the eastward movement of the colder weather withdrawals are likely to begin This higher level of eastern storage will be useful with the expected reduction of flows on TransCanada The good news resulting from the cold is a more normal freezeup which bodes well for a longer winter drilling season Gas well completions are expected to reach for and will likely be even higher next year Further Delays for Alliance The commercial inservice date for Alliance has been delayed until December the result of a combination of problems with clearing the line delays in the completion of the Aux Sable liquids extraction plant the delay of Vector and a lack of supply The pipeline has been flowing gas however with volumes building up since September It is estimated that flows for November will average MMcf per day TransCanada has taken the full brunt of the Alliance flows so far with Northern Border and PGT remaining strong December should see Alliance flows build to between and MMcf per day with modest reductions in flows on Northern Border and PGT Storage withdrawals will likely keep TransCanada reductions close to MMcf per day year overyear until Vector begins service to eastern Canada High Prices Strong Pull West The high demand in the Pacific Northwest has also provided strength for AECO The AECOHenry differential has dropped to the high s and low s as a result of this increased pull For December the differential is expected to average per MMBtu for a resulting AECO average of C per gigajoule US per MMBtu end Follow URL for PDF version of this message with

prices and alternate fuel pricing Note the price differential forecasts by basin CERA Alert Sent Wed November Title Midmonth Report Early Warning Author N American Gas Team EMail Category Alert Product Line North American Gas URL cfmtrackeprofilecfmum Alternative URL clientnagaltnagaltabhtml After a warm October the first cold weather this year has provided an early warning of what winter could bring for the gas market Cold weather across much of the great plains and a cold forecast for larger heating markets in the Midwest and Northeast have driven a surge in gas prices of more than per million British thermal units MMBtu over the past week This rebound in price highlighted the continued tightness of supply and moved the price of gas back above that of residual fuel oil assuring that dualfuel loads remain off of gas Supplies for the winter are not adequate to allow most dualfuel end users to burn gas If this cold snap extends through the remainder of November a heavy earlywinter draw on storage could set the stage for unprecedented high prices through the winter Though storage inventories have reached near the billion cubic feet Bcf level they remain at a record low heading into the heating season and even a normal winter would reduce inventories to a near record or record absolute low by spring This supply tightness places the gas price playing field in the broad territory above the resid price near in the Gulf Coast and into a range potentially testing the next difficult level of demand resistance This resistance could come from switching to distillate oil but low distillate inventories and high distillate prices mean that switching would require a gas price above per MMBtu and any move to switch to distillate would likely drive prices of both commodities higher Rather a combination of some switching to resid in industrial boilers and a shutdown of a few more pricesensitive end users may be required None of these measures comes easily or cheaply however and they can be overwhelmed by weatherdriven swings in demand As a result as cold weather settles in CERA expects heightened price volatility at levels above the price of resid and extreme sensitivity in the market to weather and weather forecasts Under normal weather conditions CERA expects Henry Hub prices to average during December see Table which by itself would represent an all time high for December But even this estimate could prove low If the current cold snap extends through early December prices could easily climb into the per MMBtu range Gas StorageThe Record Low Maximum CERA estimates that storage inventories reached a maximum of Bcf as of the end of October a record low for that month by Bcf see Table Even this level was reached only through a fortunate combination of a lack of storms in the Gulf of Mexico and consistent warmth through most of October The withdrawal season is likely to have begun this week however and in a strong way The cold weather now settling in is likely to offset warmth early this month increasing the withdrawal rate this November to Bcf per day on average well above the Bcf per day average rate of the past two years By the end of this month the US inventory deficit is likely to have widened again to Bcf CERA estimates that normal December weather would require storage withdrawals of approximately Bcf per day which is above last years rate of Bcf per day This year however this withdrawal rate would apply consistent pressure in the market through December and beyond as it would keep inventories on a path to reach Bcf by the end of March just below the alltime endofMarch low of Bcf So long as inventories remain on this path the pressure does not end even with the end of winter as a significant increase in injections next year would be required for inventories to reach even trillion cubic feet Tcf by next fall Although the supply build will begin to help by late winter it is unlikely to be of the magnitude required both to offset power generation demand growth and to allow this increase in storage injections to occurunless demand continues to be priced out of the market DemandKeeping Warm After last years warm winter CERA expects a strong rebound in heating demand and this weeks weather and forecast reinforce that expectation Weather last winter November through March was the warmest of the decade and there will be a significant rebound in heating demand in the residential and commercial sectors as weather returns toward normal this heating season Under normal weather conditions Average heating demand through the winter would be Bcf per day higher than last years Monthly average heating demand through the winter would be Bcf per day peaking at Bcf per day in January December heating demand would increase by Bcf per day relative to last December Weather percent colder than normal could further increase December demand by Bcf per day relative to normal weather likewise a percent warmerthannormal scenario could decrease demand by Bcf per day relative to normal weather Fuel Switching With natural gas markets this tight there is significant pressure for demand to be backed out of the market Residential and commercial demand is inelastic to price in the short run which leaves industrial demand and power demand as the only relief valve for the market This winter we expect all plants capable of burning residual fuel oil as an alternative to gas to do so a loss of million cubic feet MMcf per day of demand for power generation relative to last winter industrial consumers to switch the equivalent of MMcf per day off of gas gas prices to act as a ceiling for residual fuel oil prices as much as resid will act as a floor for gas For December CERA expects an overall demand increase of Bcf per day relative to last December and a Bcf per day increase in demand relative to November with increasing heating load offset somewhat by fuel switching SupplyThe Rebound The pressure from increasing demand and lower storage inventories is intense but US supply is beginning to rebound The recent steep decline in US lower capacity is expected to reverse in late given the soaring gasrelated rig count The success in reversing the decline in the Gulf of Mexico is related to the combination of the rampup of the Hickory and Tanzanite subsalt discoveries on the shelf adding to the recent startup of the Muni field these fields could add over Bcf per day later in the response of the shallow water to the strong late turnaround in drilling activity Other important capacity additions are occurring in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico with Bcf per day in and and onshore led by the Bossier sand play in Freestone County Texas the Barnett Shale play in Wise County Texas and the Powder River Basin coal seam play Further increases in drilling are likely to slow New deep land rigs are under construction and shallow rigs are being refurbished with cannibalized parts from older rigs Producers are experiencing delays in obtaining rigs as the supply of quality rigs depletes and drilling companies struggle to round out drilling crews Regional MarketsWild Winter in the West Extremely cold weather in the West has brought Rockies prices close to parity with Henry Hub prices and triggered early season spikes at Sumas in the north and Topock in the south Pipeline maintenance on El Paso is exacerbating the regional demand pressure and has contributed to Topock differentials of over per MMBtu Tight pricing relationships to the Henry Hub in the San Juan and Rocky Mountains should hold through February with significant widening in differentials as heating loads decline Winter has arrived in earnest across North America but the startup of firm transportation service on Alliance is delayed once again this time until December Nonetheless flows on the pipeline are under way CERA estimates that flows during October averaged MMcf per day During November that total should climb to MMcf per day despite the later published start date With or without Alliance flows a weatherdriven rebound in midwestern demand relative to November and December last year should keep prices in Chicago at a significant premium to Henry Hub prices In the Northeast differentials remain extremely strong and exposed to spikes throughout the winter despite greater flows into the region from Atlantic Canada this year see Table CERAs outlook by region follows Rockies Very cold weather within the region has brought Rocky Mountain prices near parity with Henry Hub prices A break in the cold or a cold snap in the East will likely widen the differentials but strong heating demand in the region will keep differentials within about per MMBtu below the Henry Hub price CERA expects a December average differential of per MMBtu however this differential is expected to show significant volatility based on regional weather A warm week in the Rockies could still push differentials toward per MMBtu San Juan San Juan prices will continue to hold close to Rockies prices through the winter with significant pipeline capacity between the two regions Heating loads in the Rockies will determine the San Juan to Henry Hub differential with extended cold weather in the Rockies pulling both prices close to the Henry Hub price CERA expects the December differential in the San Juan Basin to average per MMBtu Permian and MidContinent Unlike prices within the rest of the West differentials between the Henry Hub and the MidContinent and Permian Basins are likely to trade within a relatively narrow range during the winter as supplies from those basins are pulled either east or west depending on regional weather CERA expects a Permian to Henry Hub differential of per MMBtu and a MidContinent differential of per MMBtu for December Chicago Alliance flows into the Chicago market are now running close to MMcf per day However the onset of the heating season has offset those increased flows and pushed Chicago differentials up to near per MMBtu relative to the Henry Hub despite delays in the completion of the Vector pipeline CERA expects the strong pricing at Chicago to continue and December differentials should average per MMBtu Northeast markets Assuming normal weather we expect to see December basis for New York relative to Henry Hub at per MMBtu New England will likely see prices higher depending on the pipeline Much of this increased basis differential is caused by fuel costs For example with a percent retention rate from the Gulf Coast into New England last December would have seen retention costs of approximately at that same retention equates to Despite additional volumes of gas deliverable into the Northeast from the Atlantic Canadian fields there have been no additional regional pipeline facilities to deliver this gas to the local markets and an additional MMBtu per day of potential demand will compete for the capacity Because of this tightness should this months weather be colder than normal we could see severe spikes in basis similar to those seen in January These spikes could even exceed the highs seen in January depending on the severity of any cold snaps and the extent to which new electric loads are realized Canadian MarketsWinter Begins The colderthannormal weather has increased demand in western Canada but is only now being felt in the East Storage peaked in the West in early October at approximately Bcf below last years level and Bcf below the fiveyear average Even with modest withdrawals since that time storage inventories are still estimated to be adequate to meet winter needs Easter Canadian storage has continued to grow pushing levels to over Bcf Bcf above last year and well above the fiveyear average With the eastward movement of the colder weather withdrawals are likely to begin This higher level of eastern storage will be useful with the expected reduction of flows on TransCanada The good news resulting from the cold is a more normal freezeup which bodes well for a longer winter drilling season Gas well completions are expected to reach for and will likely be even higher next year Further Delays for Alliance The commercial inservice date for Alliance has been delayed until December the result of a combination of problems with clearing the line delays in the completion of the Aux Sable liquids extraction plant the delay of Vector and a lack of supply The pipeline has been flowing gas however with volumes building up since September It is estimated that flows for November will average MMcf per day TransCanada has taken the full brunt of the Alliance flows so far with Northern Border and PGT remaining strong December should see Alliance flows build to between and MMcf per day with modest reductions in flows on Northern Border and PGT Storage withdrawals will likely keep TransCanada reductions close to MMcf per day year overyear until Vector begins service to eastern Canada High Prices Strong Pull West The high demand in the Pacific Northwest has also provided strength for AECO The AECOHenry differential has dropped to the high s and low s as a result of this increased pull For December the differential is expected to average per MMBtu for a resulting AECO average of C per gigajoule US per MMBtu end Follow URL for PDF version of this message with

updates Enrons Lay Urges Bold Solutions to Power Market Woes As the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission prepared to weigh in this morning with the federal governments answer to Californias bedeviled power market free market advocates issued last minute warnings against taking the price cap route espoused by the CalISO FERCs meeting is scheduled to start at AM EST Check this morning for updates In a letter fired off to FERC Chairman James J Hoecker yesterday Enron CEO Kenneth Lay urged the Commission to find a fix for the underlying structural problems in the power market rather than follow the steps of policy makers who have placed price cap band aids over hemorrhaging wounds Lay told Hoecker the power market is halfway across a busy street in its transition from monopoly to competition It cant stand where it is He said FERC has to make a choice between falling into the same trap of political expediency as Californias ISO leaving the nations electric system in the lurch from one crisis to the next or it can take a big step toward fundamental structural reform At the same time the Electric Power Supply Association EPSA called on FERC to issue an emergency cease and desist order prohibiting the CalISO from unilaterally implementing any changes to its current MWh price cap for wholesale electricity purchases In a motion filed Monday the marketer group specifically asked the Commission to bar the CalISO board of directors from putting into effect its decision to impose a fiendishly complex loaddifferentiated price cap of or less during the offpeak season effective Nov The plan was designed by the states main utility consumer group see Daily GPI Oct In addition the EPSA urged FERC to state explicitly that the CalISO does not have the authority to impose or extend price or bid caps unless expressly authorized to do so by the Commission The CalISOs current authority to set price caps expires on Nov Lay said the CalISOs complicated new formula caps prices below the cost of gasfired generation making obvious errors such as failing to take into account gas transportation costs between the Henry Hub and power plants in California in doing so the bid cap makes it more economic for generators to sell their gas supply rather than use it to make electricity in California The new formula also forces the ISO into the market to buy power on an ad hoc basis to keep the lights on when the capped market fails to attract sufficient supplies which it inevitably will do Lay said In addition the capped formula invites generators to shut in production export power out of state and deploy their turbines in other states or countries He noted that the ISOs Chairman voted against the measure while all of the states utilities voted for it presumably knowing full well that it simply will not work California is just the latest failure of partial or compromised open access said Lay Its time for the Commission to reject this approach The power industry the nations most essential industry is mired in the transition from regulated monopoly to open access and customer choice Every step forward has been compromised out of concern for alienating one vested interest or another As a result utilities are free to slow the interconnection of new generation withhold equal access to the transmission system favor their own sales over those of competitors miscalculated available transmission capacity and exercise control over supposedly independent system operators and reliability organizations Lay predicted that installing price caps for political expediency would plunge markets into greater uncertainty and discourage new supplies and conservation methods FERC has to complete the work that it started said Lay It has to ensure that all parties have equal and fair access to transmission by ending the special priority for utility uses of the system Second FERC must require transmission owners to separate operation of the monopoly transmission assets from their other businesses Third FERC must take politics out of transmission system operations by revising governance structures to ensure independence Finally FERC must end its reliance on shortsighted price caps by putting in place the necessary reforms to allow these markets to operate efficiently to encourage conservation and attract new supplies EPSA said the CalISO board acted in obvious disregard for the Commissions orderly processes It cannot be permitted to make the Commissions decisions for it or to alter so radically market rules thereby injecting more uncertainty and confusion in the market and subverting the process for fashioning fair effective and comprehensive remedies for Californias flawed electric markets the group noted The EPSA believes that any remedial actions taken by FERC with respect to the California markets will be severely compromised if the CalISO boards imposition of new prices caps is allowed to take effect

FrontierNote I have the Western Frontier certificate filing if anyone wants to see it LB Petal Expansion ANR Lateral Extension Transcos Leidy Project OKd The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC issued several important certificates Wednesday for new gas pipeline infrastructure projects including final approvals for Transcontinental Gas Pipe Lines Leidy East expansion in Pennsylvania for a new pipeline by Petal Gas Storage in Mississippi and for an ANR lateral extension to serve to MW Badger power plant in Kenosha WI The Commission also denied rehearing of its orders granting Kern River Gas Transmission certificates to expand its system by about MMcfd Transcos million Leidy East pipe expansion project would make up for the failed Phase III portion of its MarketLink expansion The Leidy East project will provide up to Dthd of transportation from Leidy PA to northeastern markets in New Jersey New York and Pennsylvania The expansion consists of six pipeline loop segments that amount to miles of inch diameter pipe and about five miles of inch diameter pipe mostly in western Pennsylvania The project also would add hp of compression in Pennsylvania and New Jersey The Commissions authorization is being granted based on our findingsthat the proposed facilities will serve the public interest by increasing the pipeline capacity reaching the northeastern United States thereby helping to meet the rapid growth in electric generation demand in that market FERC said in its draft order Since the overwhelming majority of the proposed facilities will be constructed either entirely within or immediately adjacent to existing pipeline or utility rights of way the projects environmental impact will be minimized Finally Transcos existing customers will not subsidize the project because the expansion shippers will pay an incremental rate Transco said this summer that it expects the Leidy East facilities to be in service by November The Williams subsidiary said Aquila Energy Marketing Dthd PECO Energy Co Dthd Reliant Energy Services Dthd and Williams Energy Marketing Dthd are all customers The incremental reservation rate for service on the expanded facilities is Dthmonth The certificate granted to Petal Gas Storage LLC see related story covers a new pipeline that would extend miles to a connection with Southern Natural at a compressor station near Enterprise MS The million project also includes a new horsepower compressor station The project is designed to deliver Dthd of gas to Southern Companys gasfired generation in the Southeast ANR Pipelines lateral extension will carry about MMcfd of gas to Badger Generating Cos proposed power plant in Wisconsin The project includes miles of inch diameter looping along ANRs Racine Lateral and a mile extension of the lateral to the Badger plant The project would cost million and should be in service during the summer of In the Kern River case shippers had requested rehearing of FERCs order granting Kern authorization for its Dthd Expansion Project and an additional Dthd under its revised California Action project Shippers claimed the project would allow the sale of additional delivery point rights at the Wheeler Ridge point in Southern California causing further pro rata reductions in capacity for existing shippers and diminishing their firm rights Shippers said the Commission should subordinate the delivery point rights of expansion shippers to those of existing shippers until Southern California Gas builds enough takeaway capacity at Wheeler Ridge to accommodate the additional volumes However the Commission upheld its initial conclusion that the benefits of the project outweighed any risks of degrading delivery point rights given the critical need for expansions of pipeline capacity to serve electric and natural gas infrastructure in California Gulf South Sees Strong Interest in Billion Southeast Pipe Houstonbased Gulf South Pipeline Co LP formerly Koch Gateway Pipeline on Wednesday said the open season for the companys proposed billion Gulf Pines Pipeline was extremely successful adding that response to the Bcfd line from the Southeast markets far exceeded the companys expectations The open season concluded on Sept The proposed mile inch diameter or greater natural gas pipeline which was first announced in August is expected to originate in Mobile AL and extend through the states of Georgia South Carolina and North Carolina The open season clearly confirmed that the demand exists for a competitive alternative to serve the growing power generation commercial residential and industrial markets in the southeastern United States said Gulf South President Rolf Gafvert The Gulf Pines project would interconnect with the existing Gulf South pipeline near Mobile Bay enabling customers to access not only Mobile Bay supplies but also gas supplies from Texas and Louisiana including Venice and the Henry Hub according to Gulf South a subsidiary of EntergyKoch LP The proposed pipeline also would have access to multiple thirdparty storage facilities such as Gulf Souths facility in Bistineau LA We anticipate that the projected growth of power plants will far exceed existing pipeline capacity in the southeastern region said Gulf South spokesman Marc Palazzo In addition to serving power generation the company said Gulf Pines would extend farther east into the Carolinas than any existing interstate pipeline bringing interstate pipeline service to a region that historically has not had service before Palazzo said the project would be filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission next year He added that the actual route of the proposed pipeline is still to be determined Gulf South said the anticipated inservice date is sometime in Gulf South currently owns and operates miles of pipeline with compressor stations and major pipeline interconnects extending from South Texas through the Gulf States and into the Florida market area Williams Files to Build Mile Western Frontier Pipe Williams Gas Pipeline has filed an application for a new million pipeline that would extend from the Cheyenne hub in northern Colorado to multiple pipeline interconnections in southwestern Kansas and the panhandle of Oklahoma The Western Frontier Pipeline would consist of miles of inch diameter pipe and horsepower of compression It would transport up to Dthd of gas to markets in the Midcontinent In addition to an interconnection with the Williams Central system Western Frontier proposes access to other major Midcontinent pipelines including ANR Pipeline Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Northern Natural Gas and Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America Western Frontier also would have access to the growing Oklahoma intrastate markets via the Williams Central system The pipeline is anticipated to be in service by Nov Western Frontier Pipeline is a costeffective environmentally responsible way to transport natural gas from prolific Rockies supply basins to markets in the Midcontinent said Kim Cocklin senior vice president and general manager of Williams Central and Texas Gas systems We look forward to building this

Doing the Deal Dynegy CEO Chuck Watson told the investment community Monday that he was sure that the riskreward ratio in the planned merger with Enron Corp made it clearly worth doing the deal because the issues that decimated the former market leader were with its noncore businesses Explaining that his team had adequately bracketed the downside as the deal fell together over the past few weeks Watson said he could not be positive but noted that the upside was substantial and said he had a good deal of confidencethat well be absolutely fine here Dynegy which announced a billion cash stock and debt deal with its downtown Houston rival on Friday night joined with Enron executives including Chairman Kenneth Lay on Monday to answer as many questions as they could in about minutes If all goes to plan the two companies would become Dynegy Inc by the third quarter of the clear leader in natural gas and power marketing In the second quarter Enron and Dynegy combined sold a total of Bcfd of gas which represented of the volumes sold by the top gas marketers in North America Bcfd according to a ranking by NGI Enron was the top gas marketer with Bcfd and Dynegy was No with Bcfd Statistics provided by Marylandbased Energy Performance Review EPR show that Enron and Dynegy combined sold million kWh of power in the second quarter That total represented of the power sold by the top largest power marketers million kWh according to EPR Enron was in fifth place among power marketers with million kWh sold while Dynegy was in sixth place with million kWh The blending of the two will not come without challenges but Watson stressed he expects to see more opportunities than problems The opportunity appears to have come none too soon for Enron Greg Whalley Enrons president and a future member of Dynegys executive team confirmed that without some kind of equity investment in the company the once market leader probably could not have sustained its liquidity through the rest of this year We definitely needed to raise some type of equity capital said Whalley Under normal market conditions we would have had adequate liquidity This was not normal for Enron We would not have had liquidity to the end of the year Asked about asset sales in anticipation of meeting federal requirements to merge executives acknowledged there would be some but did not elaborate Whalley said that from an Enron perspective we have not spent a lot of time with Dynegy people to agree on a plan Chuck Watson has to clear what is core to Dynegy There are several assets for consideration to sell on the list Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay who will not be part of the management team but may hold a place on the Dynegy board of directors added that Enron already has billion in sales under contract all expected to close by the end of We also have three other significant international assets under contract said Lay referring to the among other things the Dabhol power plant in India Once the merger of Dynegy with Enron is successfully completed the new Dynegy will become the primary market player in all markets but there will be a significant difference in how the company moves forward noted Dynegy CFO Rob Doty Enrons financialbacked trading strategy will merge with the strong asset base of Dynegys Dynegy has protected itself on the downside however The deal includes an out for Dynegy if Enrons legal liabilities exceed billion Asked about the possibility that some of Enrons marketing and trading team may desert the company for another company Watson stressing that teamwork will be the guiding force going forward said if I were in this industry this is the combination Id work for This is an exciting day here Its been an exciting couple of weeks creating a platform for something really special in the future Enrons Whalley said that he believes the company will keep most of its team intact Theyre accustomed to being part of a winning deal he said and going forward they will be very pleased with the additional infusion of equity and the stability in the marketplace As of Monday morning Whalley said that activity looks pretty good and said there had been a positive reception to the merger Right now people are pleased with the introduction of new liquidity and really want to go about establishing or reestablishing the energy franchise Dynegy President Steve Bergstrom agreed Most traders want to be part of a winning team This is a combination that will be a winning team We have similar issues there as well The A players will stay around to be part of the winning team Bergstrom explained that when the merger is complete the new Dynegy will become the primary player in all markets He said Dynegy has a more assetbacked strategy adding that he has said before that you can only have one market maker and Enron clearly was it By combining the two companies there will be a blend of Dynegys asset strategy with Enrons financial skill set giving the new entity more liquidity marketmaking than Dynegy itself has historically done Added Watson both companies had a successful ratio and nothing is going to change thereIm a strong believer in teams and the team concept I dont want to see individuals do well if the company doesnt do well It will be imbedded in the whole company Ben Schlesinger whose company Schlesinger Associates analyzes the energy industry said Monday that the big problem in the merger is whether these two companies are able to pull togetherto harness whats there He said the two parties are clearly leaders but theoretically they will have to streamline their operations Both books are fairly strong he said and once their efficiencies are put together the new company will offer stable returns In the very short term however Schlesinger said there will be moves to other traders Other analysts also seemed to be throwing support behind the merger UBS Warburg reiterated its strong buy rating on Dynegy noting that if successfully executed this transaction would yield the most widely recognized respected and downright credible wholesaleretail energy merchant in the world However UBS warned that Dynegy still faces a daunting task in merging the operations and employees We are not naive in underestimating the enormous challenge at hand In the nearterm Enron must remain highly liquid investment grade and its employees must remain focused on keeping its core wholesaleretail franchises up and running Merrill Lynchs Donato Eassey reiterated the buy on Dynegy and moving to no opinion on Enron He said Dynegy has all the necessary skill sets and as importantly the financial stability resources and investor confidence and experience to get the job doneEnrons unparalleled online trading business should translate to significant prospects for the new Dynegy Curt Launer an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston added that despite the size of the new company we do not expect major divestitures or closing issues because of the lack of asset concentration and the inherent competitiveness of the natural gas and power marketing business He noted too that with the combination we have modeled a merchant unit that does less business because of cross trading between them and some expectation of a loss of market share Still Launer said Dynegy would become a formidable competitor benefiting from a market share in excess of of US natural gas and power trading markets As expected with most major merger announcements Moodys Investors Service placed the ratings of Dynegy and its subsidiaries under review for possible downgrade noting that notwithstanding the franchise benefits of the proposed merger the financial and business risks associated with the transaction could negatively impact Dynegys credit fundamentals The review affects about billion of Dynegy securities including its subsidiaries Illinova Corp and Illinois Power Co In its rating review Moodys said it will assess Dynegys plans to meet the liquidity needs of the combined entity and to deal with the uncertainty surrounding Enrons offbalance sheet transactions and contingent risksand examine the ultimate structure of the transaction and its impact on Dynegys financial leverage and on managements targeted debt levels The ratings service also plans to consider the governance framework within which the combined trading activities will operate Ratings under review are Dynegys Prime rating for commercial paper Dynegy Holdings Baa senior unsecured debt rating and its Prime rating for commercial paper Illinova Corps Baa senior unsecured debt rating and Illinois Power Cos Baa senior secured and Baa senior unsecured debt ratings and its Prime rating for commercial paper Fitch revised its rating watch on Enrons outstanding securities to evolving from negative where they were placed in late October The rating watch evolving means the ratings may be raised lowered or maintained Fitch also placed a rating watch negative on Dynegy and Dynegy Holdings longterm credit ratings which also means they could be lowered or affirmed The outstanding F rated commercial paper programs for Dynegy and Dynegy Holdings were not affected

the Economic Development Councils Worth spending some time with them Lorna Wednesday February Nevada Goes for the Gold By Dave Todd mailto Its a reverse twist on Americas economic history One might even call it a case of Eastward Ho For the first time in the nearly two centuries that California has been part of the United States entrepreneurs are talking about leaving not moving into the Golden State because of potential opportunities for doing business to the east Not much farther east only over the mountains into neighboring states but still in that direction as opposed to jurisdictions north or south of California And the biggest lights in the eyes of one particular industry are emanating from Nevada Jack Stewart president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association recently warned that massive power price increases and future rate hikes could be the genesis for industry departures from the state The impact on large industrial users he warned could provide an impetus for a statewide economic downturn in California which accounts for about of the United States GDP Californias mass exodus Since the beginning of the year Nevadas primary economic development agencies have been overwhelmed by California companies wanting to relocate some or all of their operations to the state The bad news for California is that the list includes many Silicon Valley enterprises or wannabes whose growth planning units have been gripped by uncertainty about the dependability of future electric supply delivery Somer Hollingsworth president and CEO of the Nevada Development Authority in Las Vegas said in late January he was urgently asked to meet with corporate officials of a major California company to brief them about relocating to Nevada In meeting with the company he asked Are there others like you And they said yes we can introduce you to company after company after company Overwhelmingly it is hightech California companies that are most interested in moving because of their evergrowing requirements for reliability in their electric service Beyond that We have five power companies that have already come down here and talked to uspower producers he said These companies including Calpine Corp are keen to take advantage of a variety of opportunities made easier by the fact that unlike California Nevada has no state income tax and no general corporate or business inventory tax putting it at both a geographical proximity and tax advantage to California It also puts Nevada ahead of other lowtax Western states such as Arizona Colorado and Utah RenoSilicon Valley share symbiotic relationship Hollingsworths northern counterpart at Renos publicprivate sectorbacked agency the Economic Development Association of Western Nevada EDAWN tells a similar story Chuck Alvey who heads that body says interest in his city from Silicon Valley refugees is becoming intense A mere threehours drive and minute plane ride from the San FranciscoSan Jose area Reno and Lake Tahoe already house hundreds of hightech industry executives who commute back and forth and who have up to now escaped the impact of power drains caused by their energyintensive industries Server farms banks of computers that manage Web sites and related business operations continue to grow in number A single server farm can require as much as MW of power to operate Strict new federal energy efficiency standards to curb demand by other power hogs such as residential central air conditioners and heat pumps clothes washers water heaters and commercial heating and cooling equipment wont be implemented in time to affect the current power crisis The US Department of Energy last month announced that the energy conservation measures could save consumers and businesses more than billion over the next years Though the energy saved would eliminate the need for MW of new power generation the new standards wouldnt be phased in until between and Stan Thomas director of business planning and growth strategies for Sierra Pacific Power Co Nevadas dominant energy company said his business has experienced great success at moving Silicon Valleybased firms divisions into Nevada albeit in a limited way But were seeing a lot more companies saying Wait a minute We cant operate here anymore with power being shut off and having payrolls to meet and not producing any product He added that getting a little more aggressive about enticing electricity supplyconstrained companies to relocate to Nevada is no longer likely to be seen as a cherrypicking operation at another states expense In fact Nevada froze its electric deregulation planning last year pausing to reconsider its options as a direct result of Californias policy confusion We have delayed until we have a plan together where capacity exceeds native instate demand said Thomas Sierra Pacifics power delivery capabilities are being enhanced by its plan to build a new kV line in eastern Nevada to import power from Utah In it also installed a major line into the Pacific Northwest Both developments are significant because the company has switched its strategy to become more of a power transmission distribution company than a generator Were learning our lesson here said Thomas Setting aside the issue of burgeoning energy demand requirements across the West the need to recover stranded costs associated with deregulation is a preoccupation for power plantowners in general he said As for California I think the next couple of years are going to be some tight times no doubt about it And thats why what were trying to do in Nevada is secure longterm contracts as well as shortterm contracts to protect our customers while were in the process of securing capacity to ensure that we have an adequate supply of electricity at reasonable rates Other areas targeting California companies Its not just Nevadas physical proximity to California that helps it attract relocating companies Its also the different opportunities offered by Nevadas two main population centers Reno and Las Vegas Both cities attract different kinds of energydependent businesses from California In this regard We are two different markets said Thomas In any case Nevada isnt the only state thats getting calls and returning interest in kind Half a continent away Tennessees state department of economic and community development recently targeted about California companies with financial enticements and advertisements that proclaim the lights are always on in the electric powerrich Tennessee Valley Authoritys service territory Elsewhere across the nation from Seattle to Manhattan there are initiatives to build or refurbish buildings to make them capable of servicing highenergy demand Internetrelated data centers Nevada however has one giant advantage aside from being closer to California Las Vegas for example has one of the most extensive readily accessible black fiber systems of any major metropolitan area in the United States But of course it would As the Nevada Development Authoritys Hollingsworth joked Most everything we have here is stateoftheart and brand new because we blow everything up every years We just implode it and build something new The most recent casualty to fall to progress was the El Rancho Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip deemed past its prime which bit the dust in October in a televised entertainment spectacle Power to the people

Pipeline launched a major pipeline expansion initiative Tuesday in conjunction with plans announced recently to move forward with the eastern portion of its Southern Trails Pipeline to California and in response to strong demand for capacity on several other downstream pipelines particularly Kern River Questar also said it is moving forward with plans to build the Rocky Mountain regions first high deliverability salt cavern storage operation and will attempt to turn its existing pipeline system into a market hub The company is holding three open seasons including one for the southwest Wyoming storage project another for a northern pipeline expansion and a third for a southern mainline expansion Were moving forward with plans to make Questar Pipeline a major trading hub said Questar President Keith O Rattie during a conference call on the companys strong first quarter financial results Our system already has many of the attributes of a major hub abundant supply multiple pipeline interconnections and abundant storage Were moving ahead with plans to provide parking and loaning nonotice balancing wheeling and exchange etc which together will increase liquidity and facilitate trading and transportation on and between Questar and the other Rockies export pipes In addition the company is expecting to add large amounts of receipt and delivery capacity at multiple points along its system An expansion of its northern system would provide additional deliveries to LDC affiliate Questar Gas at Wasatch Front up to Dthd is expected Kern River at Muddy Creek or Painter potentially Dthd Northwest Pipeline at South Lake Dthd and Wyoming Interstate Company Overthrust Pipeline Colorado Interstate Gas Company and Williams Central Dthd deliveries and up to Dthd of receipts at

reservation charge is Dthmonth the usage charge is Dth the load factor rate is Dth the ACA charge is Dth and the fuel reimbursement charge is Both projects are expected to be in service by Nov There are a lot of customers that have signed up for capacity on other pipelines that are interested in getting gas supplies to those pipelines said Alan Allred vice president of business development for Questar Pipeline There also are a lot of producers who are developing new supplies and are interested in getting their supplies moved Questar Pipeline is fortunate to sit right in the middle of the Rockies in this producing area with growing production and also to be interconnected to most of the major pipelines in the West Weve seen open seasons on Kern River Northwest Pipeline and CIG for its new pipeline Ruby going to California All of that has prompted a lot of interest in moving gas across our system With the current high prices for gas and strong demand for gas I think every available

going on all around our pipeline the Jonah area the MesaPinedale areas And on the other end theres a lot of demand in California He also noted there are multiple gasfired power plants being constructed around Denver and in Wyoming Utah Nevada and in California all of which could be served by Questars pipeline and its new highdeliverability storage project Questars Rattie said the Wyoming Salt Cavern Storage Project is expected to be ready for service in June but partial service could be ready in The project which will be located in Uinta County WY will include four Bcf salt caverns each capable of up to cycles per year That is ideal for peaking power and other flexible services he said This will make high deliverability multicycle saltbased storage available for the first time for customers connected to the longhaul pipes out of the Rockies The proposed storage project near Evanston WY will provide firm storage service with interconnects to Questar Pipeline Williams PipelineWest Kern River and Northwest Pipeline Overthrust Pipeline and Overland Trails Pipeline Ultimate maximum storage capability is expected to be Bcf Depending on market support caverns will be developed on a sequential or concurrent basis The open season for the storage project will close on June To determine rates Questar said it will evaluate the working gas quantity requested the anticipated shipper utilization patterns and the facilities required to complete the project It anticipates that the price of these services will be Dthyear plus usage charges ACA fuel reimbursement or any other applicable charges For a shipper cycling its storage times per year this equates to Dthcycle For more information on the projects see Questars website at wwwquestarpipelinecom

Earnings Theres good news and then theres better news For Houstonbased Kinder Morgan Inc KMI every day just seems to be a frontpage topofthefold story Take Wednesday for instance Delivering on projections made earlier this month that it would meet or beat consensus earnings estimates KMI reported great news with a boost in second quarter earnings over the same period a year ago and yeartodate earnings up However KMIs general limited partner Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP KMP almost trumped the broadcast with its announcement that it would buy a mile Texas natural gas pipeline system for million and split its stock two for one KMIs net income for the quarter was million or per diluted common share compared with million or for the same period of During a conference call with investors CEO Richard Kinder said earnings were driven by its pipeline partner KMP whose earnings more than doubled compared to the second quarter a year ago adding that would be hard to imagine we could have had a much better quarter Calling KMP the real driver of the real growth Kinder said that while no company can escape economic downturn KMI is about as minimally exposed as possible Kinder who said the company is still on track to make additional acquisitions or growth plans before the end of the year also hinted that another pipeline expansion announcement could be forthcoming KMP he said is in discussions about a major expansion in the Rockies Although the West Coast is on most companies radar screens for pipe growth Kinder said he thought that a possible pipeline expansion should go east but were just talking Calling production thus far in the Rocky Mountain basin a great story Kinder said the company had major advantages and it looks pretty good so far He did not detail when any announcements may be made KMPs newest pipeline deal with an affiliate of Occidental Petroleum Corp includes pipe that primarily transports gas from South Texas and the Texas Gulf Coast region to the greater HoustonBeaumont area a very good growth market Kinder said The assets are currently leased and operated by KMP as a major part of the Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline KMTP business unit KMP also signed a fiveyear agreement to supply almost Bcf of natural gas to chemical facilities owned by Occidental affiliates in the Houston area With KMPs earnings tied into KMIs Kinder said that as the operator we are very familiar with the assets involved in this transaction and their excellent growth potential The transaction expected to close in the third quarter is expected to be immediately accretive to perunit distributions by about annually Under the lease terms KMP will pay million annually from through and million annually through On track to deliver more than a increase in earnings per share this year Kinder pointed to KMIs premier feebased portfolio of midstream assets adding that KMI was comfortable with current consensus earnings estimates of per share but said KMI would raise its estimate to between and per share Breaking down its earnings by business segment Kinder said KMI will receive million in total cash distributions from KMP for the second quarter of up from million a year ago As KMPs cash flow grows KMIs general partner share of that cash flow grows dramatically he said KMIs cash flow from KMP increased significantly due to internal growth in KMPs pipeline and terminal segments and the strong performance of recent KMP acquisitions After equity accounting and amortization KMP contributed million of pretax earnings to KMI in the second quarter up from million a year ago The Product Pipelines segment delivered a increase in earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization DDA of million in the second quarter compared to million during the same period a year ago The Natural Gas Pipelines segment produced segment earnings before DDA of million a increase which reflected strong earnings growth from Red Cedar Gathering Company and the inclusion of additional gas assets that were transferred from KMI to KMP at the end of Adding Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline to this segment has made our gas pipeline business more seasonal shifting more of the segments income to the first and fourth quarters Kinder explained For this reason the yeartodate increase of in segment earnings before DDA is more representative than a second quarter comparison Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America NGPL a KMI subsidiary earned million in the quarter up from million in the second quarter of NGPL benefited said Kinder from its successful recontracting of its longhaul transportation and storage capacity adding that the subsidiary expects to add approximately MW of gasfired capacity annually through which should boost demand Power earnings surged recording million compared with million for the second quarter of a jump which the company attributed to growth in feeincome associated with gasfired power plant development Two MW plants expected to come online in the second quarter of are under construction in Little Rock AR and Jackson MI Both of those are on schedule and on budget Kinder said Retail was the only segment that was down but Kinder offered a positive spin on this as well With earnings down million from a year earlier he noted that earnings in the second quarter of were boosted because of an earlier than normal highdemand irrigation season However its precisely that type of volatility that led us to initiate a weather hedging program in late to normalize our summerirrigation and winterheating load With our hedging now in place Retail earnings are up yeartodate and we remain confident that Retail will deliver approximately growth in segment earnings this year By itself KMP the largest pipeline master limited partnership in the United States had a record quarter with every business segment producing increased cash flow and earnings Our results reflect both excellent internal growth and outstanding performance by recently acquired pipeline and terminal assets said Kinder KMP declared a second quarter distribution of an annualized rate of per unit that will be payable Aug to unitholders of record as of July The distribution is higher than the distribution of per unit paid for the second quarter of The two for one stock split will be distributed on Aug to holders of record on Aug This is the second time that KMP has split the units since its formation in February Kinder noted Since then KMP has turned over almost to its unitholders KMP reported record quarterly net income of million or per unit versus million or per unit in the second quarter of

Westpath Expansion plans filed at NEB TransCanada Plans Export Capacity Additions While it will take another two years for a Mackenzie Valley production and pipeline project to come together there are signs that a safety margin is developing in Canadian natural gas supplies Western Canadas established heavily exploited gas fields can still deliver production growth for years to come the National Energy Board has been told TransCanada PipeLines Ltd delivered the reassuring word in an application for a year expansion program dedicated primarily to increasing exports to California and the northwestern United States TransCanada predicted that production from the western provinces can rise by about to a sustained rate of Bcfd until at least Titled the Westpath Expansion TransCanadas proposal calls for million in new facilities to raise capacity on its British Columbia System by MMcfd or to about Bcfd The route crosses southeastern BC from the Alberta boundary to an export point on the US border where it fills PGE Gas Transmission Along with US traders and power generators customers lined up for the added service include Vancouver distributor BC Gas Utility Ltd and Powerex Corp a subsidiary of BC Hydro that procures fuel for gasfired power stations TransCanada told the NEB that it also expects to file a further expansion proposal in secondquarter for the BC System The agenda matches growth under way on PGE TransCanada acknowledges that its forecast of supplies from the western provinces is more optimistic than the current expectations of the NEB the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board and the Canadian Gas Potential Committee The pipeline company said its information goes beyond official public records to include confidential data from customers its own proprietary studies and updated information on results of last years boom in gas drilling The pipeline has told the NEB that with continued demand growth the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin should be able to support increasing levels of gas deliveries of up to Bcfd at least through this decade Production from Alberta BC and Saskatchewan averaged an estimated Bcfd in TransCanada also predicts that unconventional gas chiefly coalbed methane and possibly reserves in tight or difficult geological formations will enter production by about and eventually reach Bcfd But the pipeline projection acknowledges most tight gas is not currently considered economically available within the forecast horizon to the year and current technological assumptions At the same time TransCanada said there is also great uncertainty in predicting gas production from coal deposits because there is none yet in Canada In the absence of a performance record to guide reserves and production projections the pipeline says only that if research and development and economics lead to successful commercial operations these sources may start contributing supply this decade In a separate toll case before the NEB TransCanada predicts it will be before northern gas from either the Northwest Territories or Alaska begins to flow south An announcement Jan by the Mackenzie Delta Producers Group and the Mackenzie Valley Aboriginal Pipeline Corp suggested that TransCanadas educated guesswork is on the money After nearly two years of preliminary feasibility studies and consultations with northern communities the group Imperial Oil Conoco Canada Shell Canada and ExxonMobil Canada declared intentions to go ahead on a second planning stage Next comes the project definition phase or million in technical environmental commercial and consultation work required to make regulatory applications for field gasgathering and pipeline facilities Conoco predicted the package will be completed and placed before Canadian authorities in The group says it intends to tap Arctic discoveries called Taglu Parsons Lake and Niglintgak to send Bcfd south to northwestern Alberta The plan calls for the gas to finish its trip to markets via spare capacity on TransCanadas system TransCanada is in step with the groups expectations in suggesting it will take five years beyond to collect approvals and build the project The pipeline companys forecast suggests northern production will arrive gradually going from a starting rate at MMcfd in to MMcfd in Bcfd in Bcfd in and Bcfd by The new forecast still does not predict which northern gas will flow however As a partner in the reborn Alaskan Northwest Natural Gas Transportation Co TransCanada is teamed up with eight other companies to revive the Alaska Highway pipeline route worked out in the s for production from Prudhoe Bay In the documents before the NEB TransCanada says it recognizes various uncertainties with respect to northern gas supply

especially Gov Tony Knowles who has pinned the remainder of his term toward getting an Alaska Highway natural gas pipeline major producers indicated this week that because the cost would be less they now favor a North Slope pipeline that would move north through the Beaufort Sea instead of across the state Ken Konrad a BP executive testifying during two days of hearings before the Alaska legislatures Joint Committee on Natural Gas Pipelines told the committee that an analysis so far indicates that the northern route appears more cost efficient than a southern route Konrad also noted that with a Beaufort line gas reserves in the Mackenzie River delta also could be taken which would be a major victory for Canadian officials Konrad and other stakeholders including producers analysts and government officials involved in moving gas from the North Slope were asked to speak before the joint committee and offer their insight on where the project could be headed BP and partners Exxon Mobil and Phillips Petroleum the majority property rights holders on the North Slope have been analyzing various routes for a proposed pipe since last fall which basically would either move supply across the state or go north under the Beaufort Sea and into Canada on a trek toward the Lower The producer consortium the North American Natural Gas Pipeline Group is spending close to million to evaluate the routes and has indicated it could file an application on one of the routes with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC by the end of this year Konrads testimony as well as comments made during the hearings indicate that the desire of Alaska officials to keep the pipe inside the state may fall apart What appears to be the deal maker or breaker is cost Konrad said only a few dimes separate the two major proposals but transportation costs per thousand Btus would pick up savings in lower investment costs with a shorter pipe and lower operating costs Economists have estimated the rate for bringing gas to the Lower from the North Slope will be around MMBtu A shorter pipe overall would lead to substantial savings especially on a project that Konrad noted faces serious challenges economically Joe Maruschack Phillips natural gas pipeline chief said his group is aware of the deep reservations Alaskan officials have about a Beaufort route but also indicated that problems associated with the Beaufort route could be risky as well He cited environmental opposition from aboriginal groups which would have to approve the routing construction on a sea route logistical challenges and additional permitting as part of a daunting and lengthy task If the consortium and other producers chose the Beaufort route Maruschack indicated that they could explore some way to bring gas to Alaskas residents south of the North Slope But in Alaska its about more than the supply This past spring the Alaska legislature with strong support from Knowles passed a law to prevent construction of a Beaufort route see Daily GPI March ddhtml Without Alaskas support the Beaufort route could also face defeat Were coming to a divergence said Harold Heinze the former Alaska Natural Resources Department commissioner and a former energy executive Theres a big difference between maximizing the profitability of companies and maximizing the benefit to the state Ken Thompson a former Atlantic Richfield executive and president of Arco Alaska Inc said one compromise would be to offer tax breaks for building along the Alaska Highway They could pressure the governor and the legislature to make a deal he told the committee Roger Marks a State of Alaska oil and gas economist who has studied the proposed projects said the cost savings could be as much as billion using the Beaufort route which would be about miles shorter than an Alaska Highway route Total construction costs according to Konrad now range between billion and billion Several dimes from your transportation costs could remove a lot of risks Marks told the committee Meanwhile Alaska remains committed to getting a pipe through the state Foothills Pipe Lines Alaska Inc signed a Memorandum of Understanding MOU with the state on Thursday to complete its review of the Alaskan Northwest Natural Gas Transportation Cos previously filed rightofway lease application to construct and operate the highway pipe Foothills constructed what exists so far of the Alaska gas line and remains a proponent of the transAlaska route US and Canadian law has designated the ANNGTC a partnership of Foothills and TransCanada PipeLines to construct and operate the Alaska portion Foothills and its affiliates would construct and operate the Canadian portion This agreement is an important step in completing our land position for this project said John Ellwood Foothills vice president Together with miles of rightofway we have on federal lands in Alaska and our extensive rightofway in Canada we are in an excellent position to expedite the building of the pipe Ellwood said the application review together with the existing permits and FERC and National Energy Board of Canada certificates underlines the timing advantage of a transAlaska route advocated by Foothills and its shareholder companies Westcoast Energy and TransCanada One thing that everyone in Washington DC and Anchorage agree on is that getting North Slope gas to the Lower is a priority and our approved route along the Alaska Highway through Canada can deliver that gas twotothree years earlier than any greenfield project Ellwood said We have invested hundreds of millions of dollars to advance this project and that has enhanced our ability to deliver Alaska gas to the Lower

Alaskan competition the next big steps in reviving naturalgas exploration in the Canadian Arctic have begun on sched ule Anderson Exploration Ltd and Akita Drilling Ltd christened a new purpose built Cmillion USmillion northern drilling rig At the same tim e an icestrengthened seismic survey vessel arrived at Tuktoyaktuk on the coast of the Beaufort Sea to work for the Calgary company Canadas fifthr anked gas producer with output in the millioncubicfeetdaily range Both pieces of equipment will make a prompt start on a Cmillion explor ation campaign on million acres square miles of northern resour ce properties held by Anderson The ship the GECO Snapper was scheduled t o start a Cmillion USmillion threedimensional seismic survey pr ogram in shallow waters of the Beaufort as soon as the Inuvialuit natives o f the Mackenzie Delta also known as the Eskimos of the western Arctic wra pped up their annual beluga whale hunt usually by Aug The rig will sh ortly be on its way from the fabrication yard that built it in Edmonton th e Alberta capital and oilfield operational center also known as gateway ci ty to the North to the Delta by truck and Mackenzie River barge It will start its first well for Anderson about miles southeast of Tuktoyaktuk a s soon as the tundra freezes hard enough to support an ice road and heavy e quipment The new rig and associated work camp were built as highrise units with a small footprint or to operate in confined space by Canadian industry stand ards The layout with drilling gear stacked vertically in the feettal l rig and the hands living in a threestory barracks built from portable tr ailers is designed to let drillers venture out into the Beaufort on ice is lands after the ship nails down new targets Nothing has changed really said company founder JC Anderson in explaining the market outlook driving commencement of one of Canadas most ambitious gas exploration campaigns e ver He described the drop in gas prices into the USperMMBtu range this summer from the winter peak near as just confirming that the continent al market is in delicate balance and easily moved Anderson said that put in the longer perspective a senior gas producer nee ds the price movement was generated by a little bit of an excess supply largely owed to reactions to the winter spike among industrial consumers th at could switch fuels or suspend operations while it lasted In the view of Anderson and other top Canadian producers such as Alberta Energy Co the supplydemand balance is close enough that a modest increase in gas use cou ld generate another spike In the Arctic were talking about not producin g for another five to six years Anderson said In the meantime theres going to be a lot of gas burned Even at current annual consumption rates trillion cubic feet in the United States and six to eight Tcf in Canada seven years out we will have burned T cf of gas or so With reserves in the lower US states estimated at Tcf and Canadas connected inventory down to Tcf prices in high enoug h ranges to justify expanding the industry into the north are almost a giv en Anderson predicted When we started doing this everybody thought I ha d a size two hat and a inch belt Now everybody wants to be there He took no sides in the continuing debate over construction of an Alaska or Mackenzie Valley pipeline The market outlook indicates that both will be needed and the only questions center on timing he suggested On the Canadi an side native communities in the Northwest Territories are pressing ahead on coming up with a plan for participation in a Mackenzie line including ownership interests as well as political and environmental support Nellie Cournoyea an Inuvialuit leader and chair of the territorial aboriginal pip eline working group said the next step will be an August meeting to thrash out a native proposal to put before the principal owners of established Ar ctic gas reserves Imperial Oil Gulf Canada and Shell Canada Anderson set a target time of for starting production when it launc hed its northern campaign in mid rapidly becoming the biggest single owner of drilling rights in the Canadian north We dont think thats chan ged the companys founder said It works even if Alaska goes ahead But the transplanted Nebraskan who arrived in Canada with the old Amoco organ ization in the s added we in Canada should beat them to the punch and get ours the Mackenzie pipeline approved first Cournoyea acknowledged that there are divisions within the native community The Inuvialuit armed with a landclaim settlement that includes ownership of mineral rights whe re Anderson is hunting are already partners in the drilling through a joi nt venture with Akita as the principal contractor Among the Dene farther s outh land claims remain under negotiation for some groups and they remain reluctant to make any commitments that might affect potential settlements But any eventual deal with the gas producers on a pipeline does not have to be unanimous on the native side said Cournoyea a former territorial prem ier Were progressing very nicely Cournoyea said One way or another well be moving ahead and working with the exploration companies

on the project now or do I continue to send to someone else Let me know Arctic Resources Gains Key Aboriginal Support for Northern Pipe Arctic Resources Co the upstart that only last year entered the myriad of pipeline proposals to move northern gas into the Lower moved a few steps closer to fulfilling its dream of building a pipeline from Alaskas Prudhoe Bay to Edmonton AB last week by earning the endorsement of key Canadian aboriginal leaders The cornerstone of ARCs approach is to build a consortium of political producer transportation and regional leaders without aboriginal support the plan would never succeed However Bob Murphy point man for Houstonbased ARC said Friday that if all continues to go well gas could be flowing by Last week aboriginal leaders representing the Sahtu landowners and the Alberta First Nations agreed to endorse the project including its approach to providing pipeline management by aboriginal and Native American groups involved in the governance of the project The Deh Cho said Murphy who also occupy a significant portion of the land through which a pipeline will travel are now considering the proposal and Murphy said he was optimistic Together Sahtu and Deh Cho lands represent over of the land in the Northwest Territories through which a pipeline would travel he said Gaining aboriginal support is key to any pipeline to the Lower he said ARCs Northern Gas Pipeline Project would create a natural gas pipeline extending from Prudhoe Bay in Alaska through and under the Beaufort Sea coming onshore in northern Canada and extending through the Mackenzie River Valley to interconnects in Edmonton Following a rampup period ARC estimates it would transport Bcfd through the highpressure mile fully entrenched route The pipeline would cost billion and financing and reserves would add another billion to the cost which would be debt financed The debt financing would lower the tariffs making it attractive to shippers promoters say Murphy said hes hopeful that by the end of the year ARC could begin its preapplication permitting process but he added there was still much to be accomplished The ARC approach is all inclusive Murphy told NGI We fully intend to gain the support of all of the parties because we are offering a balanced approach to project management We believe our approach is far more than just a route Thats important to understand Our approach offers the least expensive the lowest tariff he said Politically we have to take care of Canadian interests We have to take care of the political issues in Canada and that includes bringing the aboriginal regions in You have to do that to succeed ARCs proactive approach combines Canadian aboriginal and Native American interests that line the pipeline route with an independent business consortium under the companys umbrella Murphy said The balance of interests of the competing stakeholders offers the type of business discipline that will be required by the capital markets and industry What ARC gained last week was a Framework Memorandum executed by the Ernie MacDonald Land Corp EMLC one of six Sahtu landowners whose territory would be crossed by the pipeline The memorandum was structured to include participation of other aboriginal landowners following briefings in their communities The Fort Norman Metis Land Corp also agreed to join EMLC as a signatory to the memorandum EMLC President Larry Tourangeau said that he believed the interests of Canada the United States industry the environment and aboriginal people are best served by an initial single costeffective pipeline that connects both northern Canada and Alaska to southern markets without damaging either Canadian or Alaskan resources What EMLC also likes and what Murphy hopes ARC can convince other aboriginal leaders of as well is that ARC will give the affected aboriginal regions control over the pipeline an approach not used by other competing proposals We believe that aboriginal ownership and involvement as proposed in the ARC approach will improve the prospects for a safe timely and economic project said Tourangeau ARC Chairman Forrest Hoglund who spearheaded the efforts of former Exxon Corp in its unfulfilled plans to build a natural gas pipeline from Alaska almost years ago said the endorsement of aboriginal leaders marks a major milestone to getting to the right answer quickly on this important project He called the one pipeline approach with aboriginal support the fastest lowest cost best environmental and best political approach for the region Now its on to gaining more support and beginning the critical step of establishing a special purpose committee Murphy said The SPC would be organized and created under Canadian law and owned by certain aboriginal groups whose lands the pipeline crosses Similar provisions would be offered for the Alaskan region he said Murphy said ARC is now working with the producers interested in an Alaskan pipeline as well as political leaders in Canada and Washington DC When asked how producer involvement was going Murphy said the companies were doing the type of work anyone would need to do to study which option would be best for their companies At the same time were certainly hopeful that theyre going to want to perceive this route as the far more economical one and the one with the best political approach Murphy said Of course the economics of the project matter but politics matter too Pipelines have to work economically and not just at gas This is a longterm project and weve put a great deal of emphasis on the business sense of it ARCs proposal is not the only one on the drawing board but so far none have gotten further than the proposal stage No applications have been applied for yet by any of the competing proposals which include two other major proposals The Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System ANGTS The ANGTS was approved in September by President Jimmy Carter and the US Congress The proposal envisions a mile joint USCanadian overland pipeline that would deliver up to Bcfd to the Lower Portions of ANGTS already have been completed with more than miles along two legs from Alberta into the United States The statutory framework between Canada and the United States also still exists However this project has languished and environmental reviews still have not been completed Costs for the unbuilt segments range between billion The Central Pipeline Route would follow the ANGTS to just below the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge then travel southeast through the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge into the Northwest Territories and south into the Mackenzie River Valley into Alberta This has languished mostly because of environmental protests of the route and less political support

being assured by their two biggest natural gas transporters that they dont have to take sides in the contest over the northern pipelines because they stand to gain no matter which project wins After carrying an estimated C billion worth US billion of exports to the United States in the past years the prebuild of the Alaska pipeline completed by Foothills Pipe Lines Ltd predicts that far from losing Canadians stand to gain if the country can build the missing northern link in the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System ANGTS Permanent benefits for all Canadian users of the pipeline grid are projected by Foothills coCEOs Michael Stewart and Dennis McConaghy Stewart is executive vicepresident for business development for Westcoast Energy Inc and McConaghy is his counterpart at TransCanada PipeLines Ltd Foothills remains the sole owner of ANGTSs sponsor Alaska Northwest Natural Gas Transportation Co after nine US partners in the original s version of the project dropped out during its long dormant spell In an interview Stewart called Foothills a pipeline counterpart to the little engine that could referring to the old childrens story book Except its not so little he said Initially installed as an early start on southern legs in the megaproject in order to help finance the far costlier northern section Foothills now carries about of Canadian gas exports Stewart described the reviving prospects of completing ANGTS as a further service this time in optimizing use of the Canadian pipeline grid McConaghy believes that by completing the missing northern link Canada would benefit and Foothills has taken that case to the National Energy Board NEB The arrival of Alaskan gas into the Bcfd Foothills system would allow Canadian production to move over to TransCanada and Westcoast without forcing them to fight the new Alliance Pipeline and associated eastern links the Vector and proposed Millennium systems As a resultCanadians would shed the burden of costs associated with excess capacity that has emerged as a result of aggressive pipeline construction since the mids Capacity grew so much that Natural Resources Canada estimates refilling the routes to the Lower will require exports from the western provinces of about Tcfyear or nearly onethird more than earlys industry planners estimated the regions gas fields could support on a sustained basis Despite production increases generated by a record drilling pace over the past year McConaghy estimated that the pipeline grid still has Bcf of excess daily capacity That poses a problem of defraying fixed costs in his words The problem drives an application by TransCanada to the NEB for a raise in its effective rate of return to from The hike is sought to cover costs of lost traffic and compensate for increased business risks posed by the glutted competitive Canadian market for gastransportation services Potentially long hardfought hearings are planned into how much of a raise to allow and how to translate it into toll increases for shippers still bound to use TransCanada by long delivery contracts TransCanada has told the NEB it does not expect the cost pressure to end any time soon if ever At current gas discovery sales and reserves depletion rates TransCanada projects that the production capability of the entire Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin is liable to peak and slip into decline within eight to years Some of the strain is expected to originate within the Canadian petroleum industry as it turns increasingly for its oil supplies to heavy crude and the oil

With the FERCordered capacity reassignments at the Topock AZ delivery p oints barely off the ground El Paso Natural Gas has proposed a plan to re allocate shippers receipt point rights across its entire pipeline system i n an attempt to improve delivery and scheduling El Paso seeks to reallocate shippers receipt rights in a manner similar t o the approach that FERC ordered in late February for the redistribution o f firm delivery rights at the Topock delivery points In that order the Co mmission directed El Paso to reassign the delivery rights of the pipeline s shippers to more evenly match the design capacity of each Topock delivery point on the system The latest proposal calls for El Paso to replace the individual receipt points on its system with pooling areas With this move contract deman d CD and fullrequirements FR customers would continue to have systemw ide access to the supply basins San Juan Permian and Anadarko that are c onnected to the El Paso pipeline it just wouldnt be through a differe nt points RP We found it would have been virtually impossible to divide all of those receipt points up in a meaningful fashion said Robert T Tomlinson El Pasos director of regulatory affairs Rate schedule FT shippers whose loads are so small would be served r ight off the topthey would get their gas first under El Pasos proposal he said Rate Schedule FT FR customers would be served next Tomlinson noted They would be required to assign their primary receipt rights to spe cific locations on El Pasos system but they would retain systemwide acce ss to alternate points Under the proposal shippers would be allowed to choose their receipt point right preferences based on their contract rights El Paso told FERC El Pa so then would use the sameiterative process the one it employed in as signing capacity to the Topock points to award receipt point capacity a t the pooling areas El Pasos reallocation of delivery rights at the Topo ck points took effect April In a sampling of opinion from several trader s at the Southern California border they indicated that the new allocation rules have improved deliveries at TopockSoCal but at the cost of degraded service elsewhere Were still seeing some nominations cuts at TopockSoC al but theyre not as bad as before said one marketer adding that out o f MMcfd he had nominated there for Thursday he had lost only about M Mcfd However the marketer and others agreed that as traders have shifted volumes to other border points it is creating the same kind of allocation problems that had been plaguing TopockSoCal Ehrenberg is starting to exp erience overnominations they said and Wheeler Ridge is really a mess no w according to one source The allocation changes have had no impact on border gas prices the traders said This weeks spike in border quotes has been a reflection of high Cal ifornia power prices that are being enhanced by the continuing loss of MWs due to Tuesdays downing of a line on the kilovolt Pacific DC Int ertie With respect to the new proposal shippers with receipt rights in a single basin will be allocated primary receipt rights to each pooling area within that basin based on the proportion of each pooling areass design receipt capacity to the total receipt capacity within that basin El Paso said A ll other shippers will be asked to provide an election that specifies a rec eipt pool where primary rights are desired a quantity of rights desired at that location and the location to which those receipt rights are to be de livered CD shippers primary receipt rights would equal their individual CDs while FT FR shippers share of primary rights would be based on thei r billing determinants BD the pipeline said It noted that shipper elections that exceed the available capacity at a spe cific point will be allocated pro rata After processing is complete each shipper will be notified what portion of its election was successfully all ocated This election and allocation process will be repeated until each sh ippers defined volumetric entitlements full BD or CD have been assigned to primary receipt locations In order to provide greater scheduling certainty and to minimize the pot ential for capacity constraints El Paso seeks to expand the number of poo ling points on its system to from six Although some poolers previously have objected to enlargement of the number of pools saying that fewer poo ls preserve liquidity in the gas sales market El Paso has also been asked by its shippers to provide greater certainty within the gas transportation marketplace This proposal recognizes the pipelines overriding obligation to its shippers To carry out the systemwide allocation process El Paso said it will provi de its shippers with a list of the receipt points within each new pooling area the design capacity of each point and the maximum quantity scheduled through that point during the past year The pipeline believes its propos al will allow all shippers an opportunity to make their preferences known at the outset while providing a mechanism for resolving the inevitable conf licts among those preferences

PM on PM To cc Subject Power Market Caps Lower Prices at Higher Risk CERA Alert CERA Alert Sent Fri July Title Power Market Caps Lower Prices at Higher Risk Author Zenker Mortizburke EMail Category Alert Product Line Western Energy URL cfmtrackeprofilecfmum Recent events in California culminating in new market rules established for the energy and ancillary services markets indicate that legislators and regulators are dissatisfied with the performance of the markets they established The hot weather in California during June triggered high electricity demand corresponding recordbreaking power prices and rolling blackouts in the San Francisco area Although the economic impact of both the outages and the concurrent price spikes is significant a recent decision by Californias Independent System Operator ISO to intervene in the markets by lowering price caps through the summer of from to per megawatthour MWh may prove to be the most important product of the market events Ironically the proclivity to continue to change the market rules whatever the intention could create market distortions that delay the addition of new generating capacity by discouraging plant developers and driving away needed capit al This would only prolong the states supply shortage and resultant high prices Although the recordsetting weather that prompted the rolling blackouts in the San Francisco area is not likely to be repeated the West as a whole will experience higher coincident peak demand under normal weather conditions this summer CERA expects that supplies will be sufficient to meet peak demand this year but the high price levels of June will be repeated during peak demand conditions not only this summer but during the summers of and possibly The Pressure Builds The blackouts were not spawned by a statewide supply shortfall but instead by a transmission constraint that limits the ability to import sufficient quantities of power to the San Francisco area The quantity of generating capacity out of service in the West was near average levels despite a nuclear unit outage in Washington Although the blackouts were brief and wholesale power prices decreased with the temperatures the intense scrutiny over the events and resultant changes to the market rules indicate that legislators and regulators are dissatisfied with the performance of the markets they designed The markets architects assumed that competition would lower wholesale prices in the state However prices in June have been roughly eight times higher than in s prerestructured California market leading many regulators and legislators to conclude that the markets are flawed requiring additional caps and market rules Although some state officials strongly favored lo wering the price caps many within the ISOs Board of Governors strongly opposed intervening in what they consider to be normal market reactions to tight supply and demand fundamentals The current tight supply situation in California and the West as a whole is a product of recent strong economic growth throughout the region coupled with the slow process of permitting new power plants Owing to strong economic growth in California in and and percent respectively capacity margins have shrunk from percent in to percent in Demand growth throughout the West has reduced the amount of energy available for export from the Pacific Northwest and Southwest to California As a result even with optimistic levels of energy imports and the curtailment of approximately megawatts MW of interruptible load within the state California capacity margins will fall well below North American Electric Reliability Council NERC reliability criteria roughly percent this summer The West is the only region in North America that will experience a tightening of capacity margins relative to levels in under normal weather conditions CERA anticipates peak demand growth to continue to outpace new capacity additions through with slightly growing capacity margins in At these levels an unusual amount of either plant capacity or transmission line capacity out of service during peak demand conditions would require the ISO to mandate blackouts of a portion of the states load to maintain the overall stability of the grid Thus the tight capacity situation in the state will continue to pressure prices to high levels which may provoke legislators and regulators to attempt to extend the price caps or implement additional market rules Market Distorting Effects Under tremendous pressure from some legislators regulators and market participants the California ISO Board of Governors lowered the current price caps on energy from to per MWh in a special meeting conducted June Owing to the interconnectedness of western markets the decision to lower the caps and the apparent willingness of regulators to continue to change the rules governing Californias electricity markets will affect power market participants throughout the West Profitability of existing and future generators degraded High power prices and volatility levels in June although detrimental to most buyers provide strong encouragement to plant developers Limiting the level of price flyups degrades the ability of plant owners to recover capital costs plus earn a return on that capital In most periods of the year competition drives prices to levels that provide little opportunity for a return on capital Generators therefore seek to recover their investments with higher bids in Californias energy and ancillary services markets during periods of supply scarcity Existing merchant generators are at increased risk to recover the investments they made based on cash flow outlooks developed prior to the imposition of caps Supply shortfall prolonged The process of siting and permitting power plants in California is cumbersome requiring as long as five years from plant proposal to synchronization with the grid The California Energy Commission CEC the state agency charged with approving new plants has repeatedly expressed concerns about the chronic tight supply situation in the state Pricedampening market intervention indicates to plant developers that California officials may continue to reengineer the states power markets to the detriment of generator profitability and when added to the difficult permitting process potentially delaying the introduction of new capacity to meet rapidly growing state demand Prominent plant developers have recently indicated that markets outside of California may provide a more stable market and a better environment for deploying scarce resources and generating equipment such as turbines Trading positions affected Lowering price caps reduces the degree of price volatility and the level of overall average prices Market participants have executed market positions based on the outlook for prices under the previous higher price cap By lowering the price cap not only are the value of existing physical eg power plant and financial eg forward contracts positions significantly affected but market participants must also incorporate the uncertainty of possible future adjustments to the cap into their trading Circumventing market rules The variety of energy and capacity markets in California as well as the bilateral markets outside of the state provides opportunities to circumvent the intent of the new market rules further distorting the markets in the West Although lowering price caps in California will likely temporarily reduce price levels the new power plant capacity ultimately needed in the state to reduce price levels and improve reliability on a sustainable basis could be discouraged by prolonged and repeated intervention in

Argentine power market were significantly higher in May owing to the combination of continued low hydro output strong demand growth and periodic constraints on natural gas deliveries to power plants in the Buenos Aires region Spot power prices energy component only averaged per megawatthour MWh in May Although average power prices declined from last year price volatility increased with several shortduration episodes of prices over per MWh as gas unavailability in the Buenos Aires region forced several midcost units offline during peak hours In June prices are expected to continue strengthening to the per MWh range on average Beyond June price pressures are expected to remain negative as increasing hydro output new and returning lowcost thermal capacity and the end of gas constraints push average prices back toward per MWh or below by August or September CERA Alert Title US Gas Markets Reach New Heights Where Will It Stop Author N American Gas Team EMail Category Alert Product Line North American Gas URL clientnagaltnagaltabhtml Summary The US gas market enters the month of June with prices at the highest level since deregulation At the Henry Hub prices have surged to as high as per MMBtuup from less than per MMBtu during April Behind this has been a building and serious shortfall of supply the result of disappointing gas production levels and surging gas demand for power generation The gap between these two forces has been met through storage inventories with injections so far this spring running between and Bcf per day below last years rate The continued tension between these two forces will keep the pressure on prices this summer and the need to inject gas into storage will price out increments of demand CERA Alert Title Monthly BriefingThe Pressure Cooker Author N American Natural Gas Team EMail Category Alert Product Line North American Gas URL clientnagaltnagaltabhtml Summary Pressure remains extremely strong in the United States gas market as three factorsthe increasing power generation demand lower storage inventories and US wellhead supply still struggling to reboundcall into question the ability to build storage to a level adequate for next winter Prices are being supported also by concurrent strength in oil and liquids markets making traditional alternatives to gas much more expensive than in recent years In this environment intense competition between power generation demand and storage injections will continue throughout the summerwith pressure increasing into July as temperatures risewith the result that gas will continue to price at the high levels necessary to discourage enduse demand CERA expects a July average price of per MMBtu CERA Decision Brief Title Western Canada Supply Growth Getting Nowhere Faster Author Eynon Small EMail Category Decision Brief Product Line North American Gas URL clientnagdbnagdbabhtml Summary As US supply declines and demand grows current high gas prices are reinforced but western Canadian gas supply growth appears to be faltering when it is needed most Both transitory factors and enduring trends underlie the disappointing production growth results The largely weatherrelated transitory factors have had a nearterm impact on drilling and connection activity The underlying trends have been developing slowly over time More shallow gas wells have been drilled in the past three to four years and created a shift to higher average basin declines and lower average per well production rates Thus more shallow wells are needed just to replace production With a shift to more exploration and deeper drilling higher supply growth rates are possible but if that does not occur other potential supply sources may step in Significant Arctic reserves in the McKenzie Delta and the Alaskan North Slope are once again entering the spotlight Coal bed methane has become a str ong source of US supply Although now ignored in Canada it may become a future source of Canadian gas CERA Watch Title Reaching New Heights Author N American Natural Gas Team EMail Category Watch Product Line North American Gas URL clientnagwchnagwchabhtml Summary Fundamentals have taken center stage as building demand pressure accompanies US supply declines Storage inventories have been significantly reduced and the pressure for storage injections is likely to intensify as we head into the summer months Demanddriven growth continues as completions of gasfired power generation plants accelerate to a pace above megawatts per year and economic growth stimulates electricity demand The result is a higherprice playing field for natural gas with the average Henry Hub price likely to reach per MMBtu for its highest level since the development of spot markets CERA Private Report Title Closing the Utility Stock Valuation Gap Does Strategy Matter Author Parshley EMail Category Private Report Product Line North American Power URL clientnapprnapprabhtml Summary The stock market has been delivering an unsettling message to the utility industry Traditionally undervalued in the market the sector is trading at a historically wide percent discount to Standard and Poors SP The SP Utility Index over the past months gained only percent with huge gains by some energy companies offset by a percent drop in stock price for electric utilities Yet early this year the SPU outpaced all other industry groups How should constantly evolving utilities in this wideopen sector form a strategic plan to maximize shareholder value while achieving success The value of electric utility merger and acquisition deals for a record billionwas double the value But are these choices ahead of the curve And when will the market catch up Three groups of new companies with distinctive strategies may provide clues to the new strategic landscape multiservice and technology providers superregionals and global power and energy companies Three other strategic choices are considered in evaluating responses to these challenges CERA Decision Brief Title The Summer Spot Electricity Markets Outlook Divergent Trends in Price Volatility Author Makovich Sannicandro EMail Category Decision Brief Product Line North American Power URL clientnapdbnapdbabhtml Summary While several regional power markets are likely to see a repeat of price spikes this summer other markets are likely to see a reversal in price volatility as supplydemand balances improve dramatically One way to interpret forward markets is as a consensus of market expectations Therefore forward prices for onpeak wholesale power reflect the common expectation that prices will spike as high asor even higher thanin A significant disconnect exists between the forward market prices and market fundamentals for the upcoming summer in some regional markets CERA Alert Title Atlantic Basin Gasoline Markets Soar Author Meyers EMail Category Alert Product Line Refined Products URL clientrpaltrpaltabhtml Summary Spurred by supply concerns at the start of the summer driving season spot gasolinetocrude oil price differentials on both sides of the north Atlantic have soared to the highest levels seen since the Gulf War In CERAs view this strength in margins is attributable to the convergence of three factors very low inventories tightening gasoline specifications and legal uncertainty CERA Alert Title Refined Products LineUS Markets Author Refined Products Team EMail Category Alert Product Line Refined Products URL clientrpaltrpaltabhtml Summary The US gasoline market exhibited exceptional strength during May US Gulf Coast unleaded gasoline surged to per barrel measured against WTI up per barrel over the strong April value of Apparent demand for gasoline skyrocketed to million barrels per day mbd in response to the start of the summer driving season Despite increases in the reported demand for distillate and jetkerosene these markets did not experience the same monthovermonth strength in differentials dropping to and per barrel versus WTI respectively CERA Alert Title Refined Products LineEuropean Markets Author Refined Products Team EMail Category Alert Product Line Refined Products URL clientrpaltrpaltabhtml Summary As higher crude oil prices started to reduce the high product differentials to Brent and thus lower refinery margins refiners attempted to prevent this situation from worsening by reducing throughputs However very tight markets for gasoline and to a lesser extent for automotive diesel helped to limit the fall in those products values Meanwhile fuel oil discounts to crude oil widened in May driving down simplehydroskimming margins In recent weeks the combination of lower primary products inventories and reductions in operations at some refineries has helped differentials to recover This has pushed margins to above Mays averages although still below Aprils peaks CERA Alert Title Recent Actions Signal Progress Toward MTBE Elimination Author Stackpole EMail Category Alert Product Line Refined Products URL clientrpaltrpaltabhtml Summary The close scrutiny that federal reformulated gasoline RFG now faces from the media and public officials owing to Midwestern market price spikes has not stopped the inexorable political progress toward eliminating methyl tertiary butyl ether MTBE use in the US gasoline pool Additional signposts including heightened congressional debate over legislation eliminating MTBE use and state actions to ban MTBE continue to emerge that point the way toward MTBEfree gasoline in the United States CERA Alert Title Refined Products Market Update Author Refined Products Team EMail Category Alert Product Line Refined Products URL clientrpaltrpaltabhtml Summary Refined products markets continue to display marked regional differences In the Atlantic Basin low gasoline inventories in both the United States and Europe which resulted from many months of OPEC production restraint continue to dominate the market and gasoline differentials above crude are at their highest level in over ten years Although signs are emerging of a possible correction in the North American market in the coming month the gasoline season will almost certainly be the strongest experienced by Atlantic Basin refiners in many years In contrast Asia Pacific spot refining margins were weak through most of June until the recent accident at KPCs Mina alAhmadhi refinery prompted a quick strengthening in prompt Singapore margins However with ample unused refining capacity available east of Suez and the likelihood of a partial restart of the KPC refinery in July CERAs outlook is for that strength to be of short duration CERA Alert Title New Peaks New Prices Author Zenker Moritzburke Snyder EMail Category Alert Product Line Western Energy URL clientcealtcealtabhtml Summary In the West July typically marks the start of the summer cooling season and steadily rising power prices CERA expect the West to be the only region in North America with a yearoveryear increase in peak electricity demand Power prices already established new record highs in June suggesting that as demand reaches its peak in the coming months western power markets will continue to experience increased volatility compared with last years levels The convergence of higher gas prices growing power demand and reduced hydroelectric energy production compared with levels is pushing up western power prices Greater utilization of gasfired generators within the West has supported western differentials and contributed to high gas prices throughout North America Western gas prices should continue to be strong boosted by continuing increases in regional gas demand for power generation and pressure across North America to inject gas into storage in anticipation of summer power loads CERA Alert Title Oil Market Turmoil OPEC Seeks a Shortterm Fix Author World Oil Team EMail Category Alert Product Line World Oil URL clientwoaltwoaltabhtml Summary Driven by strong demandespecially in the recovering Asian economies and the United Statesoil prices both WTI and Brent have again broken the levela mark that is of particular significance in

OPECs Cautious New Agreement Author World Oil Team EMail Category Alert Product Line World Oil URL clientwoaltwoaltabhtml Summary OPECs agreement to raise its production quota beginning July by barrels per day to million barrels per day is consistent with its strategy of restraining supply to maintain oil inventories at relatively low levels The gain in supply is a shortterm fix meant to alleviate political pressure for increased production and to push prices below but keep them in a mid to upper s range end Follow URL for HTML Version of this message only Note Should the above URL

California on the BrinkCERA Alert CERA Alert December Title California on the Brink CERA Knowledge Areas Western Energy N American Power N American Gas CALIFORNIA ON THE BRINK The California Stalemate California moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over creditworthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would avoid selling to the California market While numerous factors have contributed to the high cost of power incurred by Californias utilities the root cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation The current credit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address the situation The collective efforts of all market participants should be focused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible Western power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this summer Perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of California consumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and significant rate increases The California Public Utilities Commission denied the requests of Pacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edison to end their rate freezes forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance the costs of higher wholesale energy This has created an unsustainable accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the California market The current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the galvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to address the underlying structural problems in the industry However there is no guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective solution for customers and the industry as a whole Wholesale and retail markets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain muddled In the necessarily political process that will follow it is possible thatas has largely been the case so farthe steps taken will fail to move the California power market toward a more enduring solution and will instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws In the six months since Californias supply shortfall began plaguing Western markets regulators have done little to address the underlying problem Rather than addressing the cause of the supply shortageestablishing a market environment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and demand side responsesefforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for the crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers Indeed several actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by discouraging new power plant additions These include price caps repeated changes to market rules attempts to seize generator profits and a challenging siting and permitting process Medicine Worse than the Illness Several years of electricity demand growth and low prices in California were accompanied by very few additions to the supply base Regulators did not pay adequate attention to the looming supply shortfall The void of consensus over the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of bandaid remedies that address the symptoms but not the cause of Californias electric market woes Challenging siting and permitting Despite state action to better coordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants power plant developers still face high hurdles Local community opposition alone has struck down some key proposed facilities Price caps discourage investment State and federal proposals to cap prices limit the attractiveness of the California wholesale power market especially for developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment to more stable or more attractive markets outside the state Repeated rule changes Frequent rule changes in the ISO markets including the price caps confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new plant development Calls for refunds Despite reports by the Power Exchange the ISO and the FERC that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the California markets state officials continue to accuse power providers of gaming the market Calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits are a threat to new plant development Facility inspections Recent inspections of power plants by state officials to verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of their generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust CERAs recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the West are not guaranteed to make a profit Prospects of new plant profitability are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants decommissioning of older units demand growth and numerous other difficulttoforecast factors Californias regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers considering entering the state Despite efforts by the California ISO to stimulate new capacity additions in the state with a special limitedterm capacity payment CERA estimates that demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the West in In addition the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until at the earliest Therefore three years remain before a sufficient quantity of capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk of an outage The Road to Recovery There are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity shortfall Encourage new build Supply must be part of the answer This requires a series of steps that can help facilitate new supply build While in principal some have been taken such as new fast track approval the success of these actions can only be measured by the build itself For now there is still not enough new supply coming on until to relieve supply tightness Stabilize investment climate Utilities must have assurance that they will ultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power This provides the credit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new build Move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios One of the reasons the pressure on customers has been so intense in California has been the absence and even discouragement of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in the stateparticularly for residential and small commercial customers With the market at a peak however now is in one sense a suboptimal time to move toward term contracting Yet these contracts provide the foundation for a series of actionsincluding new supply build and demand side investments If they end up above market they will at least have achieved the desired effect of knocking down prices a fact which by itself should provide sufficient justification for recovering the cost of these commitments Encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response Although originally a feature of Californias market design most consumers are insulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates Exposing customers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a demand response Encourage market mechanisms that dampen the Boom Bust characteristic of the market Whether in the form of a capacity payment a reserve requirement or a minimum term portfolio requirement the California power market needs to move to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the market is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to elicit new investment Such a structure can help dampen but not eliminate future price volatility Avoid continuously tinkering with the market While the market does need to be restructured as described above it also needs to be stable and reliable to encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust longterm contractual market for power in California Continually tinkering with the market structuresuch as the three times the price cap has been shifted since Julyonly serves to undermine confidence in the market California needs to do its best to develop a longterm solution and then let the market run its course Allow for greater environmental flexibility The state should explore a more balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply shortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to emissions restrictions Free PURPA power plants to generate Relief should be granted to PURPA power plants that are operational but are restricted by contract from operating to generate only power end This CERA

California power market gone haywire and teetering on the brink of operational and financial disaster FERC Friday issued a series of remedial measures virtually stripping the CalPX and CalISO of their control of the market and calling market stakeholders together to negotiate bilateral forward contracts The Commissions main action effective with the issuance of the order after the Friday afternoon meeting removes the requirement that California utilities buy and sell exclusively through the California Power Exchange CalPX and clears the way for bilateral contracts in the forward market FERC scheduled a settlement conference for Dec in Washington of parties in the states power market to negotiate those contracts California does not have the benefit of a competitive market Chairman James Hoecker said noting he had heard the states power market called crisis by design The design was an unworkable state law the product of command and control that described in detail exactly how the market should function It wasnt competition Hoecker said Its time to get serious about saving the future of competitive marketsCompetition did not fail in principle at either the wholesale or retail level because it was never wellconceived or tried This version of competition was a disaster Commissioner William Massey defended the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions backing away from price caps Rather than cap the spot market created by the state of California the order would simply shrink its size and diminish its influence This will give back participants ability to find the right price This ability is what California has taken away from that market Massey said the action would allow bilateral transactions support forward contracts and allow the parties to manage risk He urged the California Public Utilities Commission to step up to its responsibilities in supporting the FERCdirected activities Massey said the transfer of wealth in what he described as the apocalypse in California is absolutely staggering The two largest utilities are virtually bankrupt He predicted a court acting on accepted law and precedent would eventually rule the utilities are entitled to recover the costs from customers spreading the costs out over the entire state PGE Corp officials lambasted the Commissions actions saying they left Californias electric customers exposed to price gouging and future electric supply reliability uncertainty The California wholesale market is broken And we are extremely disappointed by the insufficiency of todays FERC order PGE officials said in a statement The remedies outlined in the order do not go nearly far enough to provide a solution that ensures reliability of the states electric supply and equally importantly provides relief from future price gouging the Northern California utility company said PGE said it was particularly disappointed that FERC did not call for retroactive price refunds for California electric customers as was requested by Gov Gray Davis The utility also said it was especially troubled that FERC shortened the timeframe for the electric price cap from the end of to April leaving customers exposed during the highdemand summer season Sen Dianne Feinstein DCA said FERCs action was unacceptable Rome is burning our utilities are close to bankruptcy Californians are facing major blackouts and the Commission is fiddling Hoecker said similar competitive problems in states in the Pacific Northwest have led to pleas from governors and others for regional price caps But he pointed to the fact that FERC is severely limited in what it can do in that region For one it lacks authority over the Bonneville Power Authority and other federal operations there which make up a major portion of the market Further there is no Northwest spot market that can be capped in the way caps operate in California There also would be problems with the many purchasers who already had hedged or protected themselves in some way Hoecker strongly urged Energy Secretary Bill Richardson to convene a conference to try to identify regional problems and offered his help in this Commissioners Curt Hebert and Massey said they would issue concurring opinions Hoecker said he will submit a concurring opinion next week on items such as RTOs that are beyond the scope of the order The Commissions actions which went beyond recommendations it had made earlier see Daily GPI Nov came at an emergency meeting following a week of continuous power alerts and emergency measures to avoid rolling blackouts in the state The Commissions reforms call for No retroactive refunds for California customers Elimination of the requirement that Californias three investorowned utilities Pacific Gas and Electric San Diego Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison sell all of their power into the CalPX and buy all of their power from the CalPX This took effect Friday Return MW of generation to state regulation Termination of the CalPX wholesale rate schedule effective the close of the trading day on April Create a benchmark price for wholesale bilateral contracts to assess prices of fiveyear energy supply contracts Create penalties for underscheduling power loads A requirement that market participants schedule of their load prior to real time Violators will incur penalties for scheduling deviations exceeding the greater of MW or of their hourly load Begin market monitoring and price mitigation for the CalISO and PX spot markets FERC will hold a technical conference to develop a monitoring an mitigation program A proposed plan is to be submitted by March so that the measure can be in place by May A singlepriced auction to be used only for bids at or below MW Bids above MW will not set the market clearing price although they will be subject to FERC reporting requirements Replacing the current CalISO stakeholder governing board with a nonstakeholder board On Jan the CalISO governing board members will be required to turn over their decisionmaking power and operating control to the management of the CalISO The members will be permitted to function in an advisory capacity until the new board is selected FERC to discuss with California representatives a process for selecting new CalISO board members and Modify interconnection procedures The ISO and utilities must file generation

<3395720.1075844135498.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,lorna.brennan@enron.com,2000-12-19 01:41:00,Maybe TW Should Build Into Northern Nevada Check This Article OutCondemn Northwests MustFlow OFOs Several northern Nevada industrial gas users have accused Northwest Pipeline of violating its tariff by holding them hostage to the daily mustflow operational flow orders OFOs that it has issued since early December in an effort to compensate for the sizable capacity shortfall on its system In a Section complaint filed Friday the industrial gas customers called on FERC to direct Northwest to cease and desist the alleged violation of the tariff which they claim is forcing them and other customers at the northern end of the pipeline to subsidize the gas acquisition and transportation costs of customers on the southern end of Northwests system The effect of the mustflow OFOs is to compel shippers to make up the capacity shortfall on Northwests system via displacement the industrials noted Northwests firm contractual demand is Dthd but its physical capacity is only Dthd PanAlberta Gas US Inc provides Dthd through a displacement arrangement while shippers are left to make up the remaining Dthd The industrial users contend they shouldnt be penalized for not complying with the mustflow OFOs because Northwests tariff exempts shippers that have made good faith efforts to obtain gas supply but have been unsuccessful At issue is whether the good faith efforts applies to purchasing gas at reasonable costs which is how the industrials interpret the tariff or whether it means that shippers should be required to buy gas at any price to meet a mustflow OFO The latter according to the industrial users is Northwests position The regulatory history of Northwests tariff makes clear that good faith efforts to obtain a gas supply at the Stanfield OR receipt point need not extend to purchasing gas at any price but rather must be viewed in the context of current conditions and circumstances ie available prices and supplies the industrial customers said Where a shipper can secure gas needed to meet a mustflow order only at the basin price differentials that currently prevail and assuming that the shipper can document such efforts and impacts for Northwest verification the shippers request for exemption from penalties must be granted Northwest twice has refused such a request by the industrial customers they noted In anticipation of the high gas prices this month the Nevada industrial users said they chose to switch to alternative fuels where feasible or to curtail operations rather than use their released capacity on Northwest Nevertheless the pipelines daily mustflow OFOs have forced them into the volatile daily gas market to avoid extremely high noncompliance penalties undermining their business decisions to rely on alternative fuels they told FERC RP In order to comply with Northwests orders the industrials said they must ship the gas to a point where they cannot use it and can only sell it at the Rocky Mountain basin prices which is a fraction of the price at which under current conditions they purchased it The industrial users said they have had to comply with Northwests mustflow OFOs given the hefty penalties they would face otherwise The penalties are equal to the greater of Dth or four times the highest spot rate at Sumas Stanfield Kingsgate Opal or Ignacio for the month of noncompliance Based on the spot rate at Stanfield the penalty this month was Dth If one of the Nevada industrial users Newmont Mining Corp had defied Northwests order to flow of its contract demand or Dth on any December day it would have been penalized for that one day they said If all of the Nevada industrial customers had violated the pipelines order the oneday penalty would have been The industrial shippers want FERC to go beyond interpreting the good faith efforts exemption in their favor They contend that Northwest tariff allowing mustflow OFOs as currently structured is both unreasonable and unduly discriminatory Thats because it requires one group of shippers who see no additional benefits to incur gas acquisition and transportation costs solely to subsidize service to another group of shippers they argued They believe the shippers who benefit should pay for the displacement capacity costs Currently the mustflow OFOs result in southbound flows on Northwest that create northbound capacity for the benefit of shippers with southtonorth entitlements Those same southtonorth shippers could however themselves purchase spot gas in the Canadian supply areas and ship such volumes southward on an interruptible basis on Northwest ie do what the industrial shippers and others have been directed to do They could pay the costs of the capacity that they want As an alternative Northwest could require a sharing of displacement capacity costs by all shippers using its system at a given time when capacity is short or it could invest in facilities so that it has the physical capacity to meet all of its contractual commitments the industrial users said

Northwest and California PGE Corps National Energy Group revealed plans Wednesday to begin an open season early next year kicking off a fiveyear expansion effort The first phase would add MMcfd of firm transportation capacity out of western Canada on its Gas TransmissionNorthwest GTN pipeline system The PGE GTN group expects the phase one expansion to be in service by November at the latest As we have been anticipating the western natural gas market is at a critical point in the need for additional pipeline capacity said Thomas B King president of the PGE National Energy Group PGE NEG West Region Gas supplies into the Pacific Northwest and California are very tight At the same time the market is strong and growing and the PGE Gas Transmission Northwest pipeline system has been operating at or near maximum capacity levels for the greater part of the year We believe GTN is now positioned for an aggressive expansion period that will result in additional supplies of natural gas at competitive transportation rates in this region for both directuse customers and electric generation by King noted that the phase one expansion of the GTN system was brought on primarily because of the state of disarray in the California market He cited the growing use of gas to fuel electric generating facilities as the main reason new capacity is needed King added that the GTN pipeline system is the most direct and economic link for tapping the Canadian production basins and bringing the load to California and the Pacific Northwest markets He also emphasized that the expansions would help the market prepare for new supply from Alaska We are constantly talking to our customers about what is the right time for us to expand our pipeline system said Sandra McDonough spokeswoman for PGE Corp With the power plant development both in California and in the Pacific Northwest including plants in the Northwest that are being built right next to our pipeline the time is clearly now to start expanding the system We have gotten more bids for capacity than we have been able to move recently McDonough told Daily GPI last week that the company was looking to expand its mainline in the near future see Daily GPI Dec To gauge demand PGE NEG plans to launch an open season for the MMcfd expansion of the mainline beginning on Jan Bids are due by Feb Following the open season the company will hold a capacity rationalization period which will allow existing shippers to release capacity directly to customers who have expressed an interest The mile dual pipe GTN system begins at the IdahoBritish Columbia border travels through northern Idaho southeastern Washington and central Oregon and terminates at the OregonCalifornia border where it connects with the Pacific Gas and Electric Co intrastate pipeline system Currently the GTN system is the largest US transporter of Canadian natural gas with Bcfd of capacity The expansion was deemed necessary because the average contract term on the line extends through and the pipeline has been operating at capacity or near capacity for most of The method of expansion had not been decided on yet but it is expected to include additional compression and some looping McDonough said PGE has been in contact with its upstream providers including TransCanada Pipelines Limited TCPL to ensure coordination of capacity Doug Baldwin CEO of TCPL said TransCanada will work with PGE NEG to examine and if appropriate satisfy the needs of market participants in both the western United States and Canada If response to the open season is adequate PGE NEG hopes to move along with the project immediately The November in service date includes an anticipated oneyear process to obtain a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC permit We also expect to have an incremental MMcfd of new directconnect gasfired electric generation load along the GTN system in the Pacific Northwest by mid King said We expect to follow the project immediately with additional pipeline expansions to meet the need for additional gas supplies in the Pacific Northwest on both the east and west sides of the Cascade Mountains For the next fivetoeight years PGE Corp expects to be busy with pipeline expansions and new additions The company has planned a second mainline expansion to be in service in with a new interconnect near Spokane WA which will serve the Puget SoundSeattle area The last expansion phase will be brought online sometime after With Alaskan gas fields expected to be ready for commercial service in the next five to years PGE NEG will build an expansion that will facilitate transportation of gas from Alaska and Canadas Northwest Territories to markets in the lower states Overall what we are looking at is the potential to expand the system by Bcfd over the next decade McDonough said

from the marathon governmentindustry negotiations The principals of last Tuesday nights marathon session were expected to meet by videoconference over the weekend to review solutions developed by staff working groups which met through the end of the week see Daily GPI Jan On the West Coast the week ended with emergency legislation starting its dash through the state capital and the governor holding a minute meeting with two neighboring western governors to piece together a regional strategy on joint energy conversationsupply cooperation On Friday Gov Gray Davis said if FERC fails to act he is sure Congress will take up legislation to stabilize power prices throughout the country or at least give governors the option to opt into a stabilized pricing mechanism Sen Diane Feinstein DCA announced she was working on a bill to be offered later this month which would allow the energy secretary to impose price caps Davis indicated that he and federal officials would be working over the weekend and he expects to have something to announce early next week and in the long term he expects to solve this problem in the next days and in six months hopefully this whole episode will be a distant memory Also on Friday Standard Poors assigned an investment grade triple Bplus corporate credit rating to subsidiary PGE Energy Trading Holdings and said subsidiaries Gas Transmission Northwest and PEG Generating also would maintain their investment grade rating based on each entitys own creditworthiness and economic selfsufficiency These units would be insulated from any downgrades of the parent PGE Corp or the utility subsidiary Pacific Gas Electric This action came after PGE suspended its fourth quarter dividend and announced it was cutting staff and services see Daily GPI Jan Following their meeting in Sacramento Friday Gov Davis and his counterparts in Oregon John Kitzhaber and Washington Gary Locke announced a Feb western governors meeting would be held in Portland OR to push for a western region wholesale power price cap and a regionwide push by each state to conserve energy and finally to share energy supplies on a seasonal basis As fellow Democrats Washingtons Gov Locke and Oregons Gov Kitzhaber expressed strong support for Gov Daviss efforts and pushed for solutions from FERC It is extraordinarily important that this not be a partisan struggle between West Coast Democratic governors and the inland governors who are mostly Republican said Kitzhaber noting that not all the solutions have to come from new generation Conservation can play a major role too Both visiting governors said they strongly support the state of California becoming the purchaser of longterm power and then reselling to the utilities They are banking on the fact that the states creditworthiness will gain much better prices than the cashstrapped nearbankrupt two major utilities Southern California Edison Co and Pacific Gas and Electric Co The lower house Assembly of the state legislature cranked out about a dozen proposed laws including one to completely restructure the oversight boards of the statechartered grid operator CalISO and wholesale spot power market CalPX from large stakeholder panels of to industry representatives to small units of three people each all appointed by the governor Another proposed law would prevent the states three major privatesector utilities including the two near bankruptcy to sell their remaining generation units which are comprised mostly of nuclear hydroelectric and interests in outofstate coalfired plants Gov Davis indicated he expects state lawmakers to pass the bill this Wednesday establishing threeperson boards and the members of the ISO panel will be the head of the states three principal agencies overseeing electricity the California Public Utilities Commission California Energy Commission and Electricity Oversight Board of which two of the three are headed by Davis appointees The nearrolling blackouts of Thursday caused by stormdriven wave surges that curtailed power production at coastal plants were eliminated over the weekend through stepped up conservation restoration of major units at PGEs Diablo Canyon Nuclear Generating Plant and by what the grid operator called the biggest singleday lowering of demand he has ever experienced This week CalISO expects to have to MW that were out of service last week back online further improving the chance of avoiding power emergencies Salvaging the states system last week at the critical Stage Three was Californias water resources department which operates the massive northtosouth network of aqueducts It purchased MW from out of state using the states creditworthiness to get around the CalISO financial problems As it has done on a lowerprofile basis in the past the water resources department acted as a quasistate power authority and the CalISO COO Kellan Fluckiger said that other market participants also are providing this sort of intermediary financing in light of the credit concerns surrounding the ISO and utilities The water department also contributed to the supply crunch as it does routinely by shutting down its heavy electricity consuming pumps that move massive quantities of water around the state

shortterm and longterm supply challenges Our action today is designed to give the governor the California legislature and other relevant parties the time to take necessary action I strongly urge the parties to act immediately said Abraham He also said he was keenly aware that other western states have expressed concerns about their own supply situation and the impact the order is having on power prices in their areas Despite the action PGE said it still is having trouble getting gas suppliers to comply with the emergency order originally issued Jan The gas supply situation is not good utility spokeswoman Staci Homrig said yesterday afternoon We are quickly depleting our storage Even under the order J Aron Co a subsidiary of Goldman Sachs has not delivered gas They represent about of our daily needs Bcfd in January Oh yeah weve been in contact with them she said Weve been in contact with the DOE too The other two suppliers who had stopped delivering gas to us last week have made gas available to us under the order They are Sempra Energy Trading and Western Gas Resources Homrig said PGE expected DOE to take legal action against those who didnt resume deliveries The order applied to gas suppliers all of which supplied gas to PGE within the last days Theres not a lot I can say said J Aron spokeswoman Kate Baum J Aron has always complied with the law and we intend to comply with this order Thats my statement I can neither confirm nor deny anything else Meanwhile other suppliers who were not among those on the DOEs list were staying as far away from California as possible All I know is were not selling in California any more A person could get fired around here for doing that said one marketer All we had in California were a few spot deals that expired at the end of December Needless to say we didnt reup them Without the DOEs order PGE would be back where it was last week with some suppliers stopping delivery others planning to stop at the end of their contract terms and most suppliers unwilling to sell additional gas to the utility PGE has said it has enough gas in storage to make up for the lost supply under such a scenario until the first week in February Homrig said PGEs storage currently is well below full or less than Bcf and depleting rapidly by about MMcfd to Bcfd PGEs Pipe Ranger web site shows the utility has been averaging about MMcfd of withdrawals over the past several days and is expecting a slight increase over the next few days CA Launches New Buying Program Supplies Remain Tight Depending on your perspective California either moved toward future solutions to its nagging energy crisis or took several steps backward yesterday with the launch of its electricity bulk buying program for longterm fixedprice supplies The auction began yesterday and will run through noon today The state is seeking sealed bids for sixmonth threeyear fiveyear and year supply agreements Whether results of the auction would be made public was still unclear yesterday but the results are expected to be given to legislators who now are debating various longterm solutions in the state senate A spokesperson in the state Assembly Speakers office said the legislature is basically standing by awaiting more price information Action on the proposed comprehensive legislation including the question of the state taking over the private utilities hydroelectric systems should come by the end of the week Merrill Lynch said yesterday it was increasingly skeptical that the securitization for hydro plan would go forward It has received muted support Merrill Lynch said and has not been drafted as a bill yet Recent revisions of the comprehensive bill show some progress on contract flexibility with the possibility that the value of the entire portfolio of energy contracts might be capped at a weighted average price of MWh which is well below the utilities retail rate caps Edison at MWh and PGE at The difference is expected to be used to pay down the utilities debt Meanwhile the electric system limped along under the specter of another Stage Three yesterday but without rolling blackouts and elsewhere indications outside the state were that some energy marketers have written off California from their prospective marketing lists Were not selling in California any more a person could get fired for doing that around here said one Texasbased gas marketer referring to the continuing credit problems of Pacific Gas and Electric Co which has been hobbled by the weight of its wholesale electricity debts on the natural gas side too In the meantime Southern California Edison Co is back in federal district court in Los Angeles where it obtained a favorable initial ruling two weeks ago This time it is asking for the court to force the California Public Utilities Commission to allow it to raise its rates to cover the wholesale cost of power Calling the action with the court a last resort Edison said it has tried to get the rate situation resolved but at every turn it has met resistance denial and fingerpointing by the CPUCs fivemember governorappointed board The CPUC on Tuesday acted to anticipate new state legislation regarding the hydroelectric systems in the state by canceling hearings it had scheduled this week and next to go exclusively to written comments for the environmental review of the ongoing case looking at PGEs hydro utility assets The current energy crisis in the state makes it prudent for the commission to shift from public hearings to written testimony the CPUC said in a prepared statement

Lorna Original Message From ENRON mailtoIMCEANOTESwebmasterceraEcom NRONcom Sent Friday January PM To Subject Western Energy Markets Stuggle Along CERA Monthly Briefing Title Western Energy Markets Stuggle Along URL eprofileuDmD Western Market Overview As the California power crisis remains unresolved and blackouts in Californ ia have gone from threat to reality the western gas and power markets grow increasingly distorted by the perceived risk of selling energy to Californi as two largest utilities Normal power plant operations and power pricing dynamics have been supplanted with federal mandates to deliver power to California and power basis differentials are being influenced by credit risk Regional hydroelectric supplies have been drawn down at abnormally rapid rates to me et current demand such that in the absence of increased precipitation through out the West suppliers will be unable to depend heavily on hydroelectric outpu t in February and later in the year Gas suppliers are growing increasingly wary about shouldering the increased risk Natural gas and power prices have declined from Decembers record levels driven in part by Januarytodate weather that has been warmer than normal Although Topock gas prices remain above the per million British thermal units MMBtu level basis differentials to the Henry Hub have declined dramatically from a premium over Henry Hub prices of per MMBtu in Decem ber to an average of per MMBtu in January Demand levels will likely hold near January levels during February as the already intense pull of gas for power generation continues Because storage levels in California remain low the California citygates will be exposed to temporary price spikes during spells of cold weather Differentials for February are expected to average to per MMBtu in the Rocky Mountains and San Juan producing bas ins during February per MMBtu at AECO and per MMBtu at Topock Power prices in January have followed both the decline in gas prices and th e shift to warmer weather However there is growing unease in the power mark ets with the dry precipitation season to date A significantly lowerthanavera ge hydroelectric season would permeate through the power markets for all of placing gasfired generation on the margin virtually the entire year CERA has incorporated a lowerthataverage view of hydroelectric generation into its gas and power analyses February onpeak power prices are expected to average per megawatthour MWh in February depending on location but tempor ary price spikes are likely as California reserves reach critically low levels and the independent system operator ISO struggles to secure enough power to k eep the lights on Offpeak power prices are also expected to remaining strong averaging per MWh in February depending on location Regional Power Market Drivers Low Precipitation Threatens Already Difficul t Disappointing levels of precipitation have raised the specter that the power markets will be plagued by a belowaverage hydroelectric year Seasonto date precipitation is currently percent of normal in the upper Columbia River Basin in British Columbia to percent of normal in the US Colum bia River Basin and percent of normal for California January hydroelectric output westwide has been higher than normal as operators have run faciliti es hard to supply energy during December and January energy shortages In comi ng months however output will be down roughly average megawatts aMW compared with the first quarter of owing in part to this early drawdo wn CERA has incorporated an outlook for hydroelectric production in that is approximately percent of CERAs estimate for an average western hydro year see Table Concerns over low precipitation levels and the high drawdown rate of Pacifi c Northwest hydroelectric facilities leave the Pacific Northwest particularly vulnerable to higher prices in February as winter weatherdriven demand spikes challenge regional supplies and California demand prevents a significant le vel of exports from California to the Pacific Northwest Even under normal hydroelectric conditions demand growth in early was expected to push the utilization rates of US Western Systems Coordinating Council WSCC gasfired generation facilities to percent well above th e percent average level of the first quarter see Table The combine d effects of the early drawdown of hydroelectric facilities a disappointing precipitation season and demand growth will push these utilization rates t o nearly percent in the first quarter This will cause markets to cl ear at or above the production cost of gasfired generation even more often tha n in Pacific Northwest Hydroelectric generators in the Pacific Northwest have drawn down the regio ns hydroelectric reservoirs to well below average historical levels Grand Coulee the largest hydroelectric facility in the West with over megawatts MW of capacity was near percent of the historical average as of early Janu ary and reflects the general condition of the major reservoirs in the region I n the event that precipitation remains low the drawdown of these facilities in early winter to meet load spikes in the Pacific Northwest and California ha s hurt the regions ability to supply power throughout and will maint ain upward pressure on power prices Aboveaverage temperatures in early January have helped to mask some of the underlying strong fundamentals in the Pacific Northwest Strong demand grow th for the first quarter near percent is expected however owing to economi c growth and a return to normal weather from last years mild winter see Table Low hydroelectric availability and persistent gas prices in the to per MMBtu range at Sumas have the potential during the remainder of the win ter to cause price spikes well above the per MWh onpeak levels so far in January although average prices should be much lower Decembers averag e of per MWh demonstrated this potential clearly see Table Along with demand growth near percent yearoveryear in February cold snaps will again bring price runups particularly in the event that persistent low precipitation in the region reduces the ability of hydroelectric operators to draw down facilities past alreadylow levels CERA expects MidColumbia prices to stay near January levels in February fo r a monthly average of per MWh on peak and per MWh off peak Continue d drops in hydroelectric reservoirs and weatherrelated events would push pri ces periodically to Decembers high levels California Although California has had a December and early January that were nearly percent warmer than usual January prices have reflected percent demand growth over owing to economic and other growth factors that have pushe d gasfired generators onto the margin more often with higher gas prices at Topock by MMBtu low hydroelectric availability westwide and the degrad ed condition of the California power market Northern California snowpacks hav e been higher than in other parts of the state but hover near percent of normal in spite of recent storms Reservoir levels for the state are betwee n and percent of average depending on location but are in the to percentofaverage range for reservoirs affecting the states largest hydroelectric facilities As Californias largest investorowned utilities IOUs continue to stru ggle to obtain gas and power supplies in the face of financial insolvency Californ ia power prices have reflected a premium associated with the higher risk of supplying the state January differentials with western prices have grown a s high as per MWh owing in part to temporary supply shortages as nuclear and other thermal plant outages at times have totaled over MW Northern Californias import constraints make it particularly susceptible to thes e temporary shortages suggesting that continued low hydroelectric supplies w ill increase the risk of repeated localized blackouts in the event of extensive future outages The agreements reached through negotiations between suppliers the IOUs an d state and federal officials in recent weeks will calm some of the price inflating uncertainty in the market but California will be the premium mar ket through the first quarter of and most of the coming year owing to persistent supply tightness For February in California CERA expects sustai ned price strength of per MWh on peak and per MWh off peak Rockies and the Southwest The Southwest and Rockies regions had warm weather in December and the firs t half of January but have not been completely insulated from the price runu ps in other parts of the West Demand growth in the region is expected to be n ear percent for the first quarter with February experiencing moderate perc ent growth suggesting that most of the price strength will be attributed to interconnections with the hydrodeprived California and Pacific Northwest markets Capacity margins in the Southwest are at their highest levels duri ng the winter andas an isolated subregionwould exceed percent at th is time Compared with California prices prices in the Southwest and Rockies region s will reflect the relatively low cost of gas supply and the prevalence of co al fired generation MW or percent of the installed base in the region CERAs outlook for onpeak average price for February is p er MWh Offpeak prices in the Rockies will drop nearly per MWh below the Southwest reflecting the ability of California markets to exert more influence on the Southwest than on the Rockies Western Gas Markets Although gas prices at Topock have come down from lofty December levels winter is far from over in the West indeed the pressure is intensifying The cre dit crisis precipitated by the power market crisis is spilling over into gas markets storage levels within California are again at critically low level s The mild weather during December and early January allowed some improvement in the positions but when PGEs suppliers began refusing to serve because of the utilitys credit problems the utility responded by drawing heavily on s torage inventories and a spell of wintry weather compounded increased demand in t he face of limited supplies As a result overall inventory levels are again falling quickly CERA estimates that inventory levels in California are approximately billion cubic feet Bcf A continued heavy draw on gas for power generation will k eep demand levels high see Table and the inability to manage demand spikes by drawing on storage inventories leaves the market exposed to price spikes Normal weather during February would probably allow prices at both Topock a nd Malin to settle back into the to premium to the Henry Hub but extreme weather could push basis differentials as high as per MMBtu In the Rockies and San Juan Basins differentials will depend critically on the weather Because supply levels and storage inventories in the Rockies are healthy the impact of swings in regional demand can cause wide swings in differentials CERA expects the swings to continue through February with differentials generally maintaining wider discounts to the Henry Hub by the end of the month As high absolute gas prices continue more and more effects of these prices will emerge CERA estimates that MMcf per day of base industrial demand in the Westparticularly in Californiahas switched off of gas Some end users have turned to diesel fuel for industrial boilers some plants have simply curtailed operations in response to the higher prices On the power side plants within California are extremely limited in their ability to burn alternative fuels because of emissions credits However plants outside of California do have some backup capability Arizona Public Servic e has purchased barrels of sulfur residual fuel oil to burn as an alternative to gas Given the intense pressure on gas oil will absorb some of growth in power loads California In November an early strong draw on storage in California raised questions about winter deliverability within the state A combination of low storage inventories high gas demand for power generation and continued high utilization rates on import pipelines into the state will keep pressure on California prices through February see Table Despite efforts by end us ers to limit gas burns in the state in the face of extremely high gas prices C ERA expects demand during January in the state is up by MMcf per day on a year overyear basis In February loads should start to decline as residential and commercial demand declines through the month However power loads will rem ain strong and actually climb from January into February as hydroelectric generation falls This demand support continued strong capacity utilization rates in import pipelines into California and critically low storage inventories will keep intense pressure on gas prices within the state through February During periods of high demand prices will likely reach back up into the to per MMBtu range Eventually as heating loads settle and storage dra ws slow toward the end of February differentials should ease back into the to per MMBtu range On balance CERA expects a Topock differential fo r February of per MMBtu see Table Pacific Northwest Three factors have combined to strengthen Malin prices over the past week and these forces should extend price strength at Malin into February First th e return of colder winter weather after moderate temperatures during late December and early January is increasing heating loads and power loads Second lowerthannormal hydroelectric generation is increasing the draw on gas fo r power generation during a season when the pull is normally low Third the California power shortage is drawing on all regional supplies and supportin g the demand for gas for power generation Pacific Northwest demand is expected to hold flat relative to January level s during February with slight increases in gas demand for power generation offsetting declines in residential and commercial demand The sustained hig h demand levelsdespite relatively healthy Northwest storage inventory lev els will keep Malin prices well above Henry Hub prices CERA expects a Malin to Henry Hub differential of per MMBtu during February A dropoff in demand of MMcf per day is expected in March as steep declines in heating loads offset continued increases in gas demand for powe r generation However prices at Malin will likely remain unusually strong th is spring Part of the shortfall in hydroelectric generation continues to be made up by draining reservoirs That early drawdown will limit the availability of hydroelectric generation through the spring and early summer months Both l ow hydroelectric generation and a challenging storage refill season in Norther n California should sustain the Malin premium to the Henry Hub even into the spring Rocky Mountains The volatility in Rocky Mountain differentials continues Differentials continue to depend primarily on local heating loads cooler weather support s loads and prices within the region but periods of warm weather drive steep declines in Rocky Mountain prices relative to prices at the Henry Hub Duri ng February demand should drop off in the region Although declines in heatin g loads in neighboring western regions will be offset by increases in gas dem and for power generation the Rockies remain primarily coal based As a result the lower expected hydroelectric output will do little to support loads within the region Increases in supplyCERA expects supply increases of MMcf pe r day during relative to will overwhelm available pipeline capacity out of the region Demand during February in the Rockies is expected to remain flat at Bcf per day however within the month demand loads will drop substantially This w ill put pressure on differentials toward the end of the month and CERA expects average basis differentials to the Henry Hub during February of per MMBtu That widening trend should continue during March with differentials to the Henry Hub eventually reaching per MMBtu this summer Southwest Prices in the San Juan Basin have been following Rocky Mountain prices up a nd down with regional demand loads That dynamic will likely continue through February CERA expects relatively flat demand during February within the Southwest As in the West as a whole a significant dropoff is expected during March as residential and commercial heating demand wanes For February continued strong demand loads within the Rockies and Southwest will support prices in the San Juan barring unusually warm weather CERA expects a differential to the Henry Hub of per MMBtu As residential and commercial loads decline sharply during late February an d March prices in the San Juan will reflect ample supply CERA expects decli nes in San Juan production during but declines will be limited by the strongest drilling activity for conventional supplies in the basin in a decade However pressure on Rocky Mountain supplies will mean increased exports fr om the north into the San Juan and those increased exports will more than off set the declines in local production Pipeline capacity constraints out of the San Juan will again mean wide San JuantoHenry Hub differentials with pressur e on prices developing during the spring and intensifying through the summer months Western Canada Increasing Supply AECO differentials to the Henry Hub have ranged between per MMBtu and over per MMBtu Given strong demand in the United States export pipelines have been running near capacity all winter Even the Bcf per day Alliance pipeline has been running full through the end of the winter continued strong US demand should keep export pipeline flows near capacity Given these flow levels CERA expects differentials to remain near the to per MMBtu level reflecting the cost of transport on TransCanada the only available export capacity out of Alberta For February CERA expects a differential between AECO and the Henry Hub of per MMBtu Storage inventories in western Canada are running below historical average levels but the refill season should be manageable inventories are nowhere near as low as US inventory levels Inventories in the West are expected to fall slightly below historical average levels by the end of withdrawal seas on and exports should decline relative to first quarter levels as injection season begins in the spring CERA expects differentials to Henry Hub prices to nar row sometime in the late spring as the focus in Alberta turns from filling US winter demand to refilling Canadian storage On the supply side production has turned the corner in western Canada and yearoveryear increases in supply of nearly MMcf per day are now evide nt After flat production levels for relative to increases for the y ear should reach MMcf per day Given strong expected demand from California and the West Coast CERA expects no declines in yearoveryear flows into the West on PGE GT NW Overall flows should reach Bcf per day for an increase of MMcf per day from levels end Follow above URL for full report Come Shoot

PGEs utility authority to amend its gas supply deals to keep supplies flowing to the state past Feb when the current federal DOE emergency order expires but it postponed action on another PGE request that Southern California Gas Co which has strongly objected be compelled to provide emergency supplies to the PGE utilitys residential and small business customers Loretta Lynch president of the California Public Utilities Commission said PGEs utility is a victim a victim of circumstances and a victim of predatory practices by natural gas suppliers now demanding payment for future supplies up front not because the utility has failed to pay its past gas bills but because the electricity crisis has sapped its creditworthiness The CPUC action allows PGEs utility to offer suppliers the option of securitization or in effect a lien in the utilitys retail customers bills which cover the full cost of the wholesale gas prices as an incentive to have the suppliers extend contracts with PGEs gas utility operations while the creditworthiness of the company itself is dubious It wont be until next week when the utility begins negotiating new contracts that it will know if the CPUC action will overcome the suppliers reluctance to extend contracts in the current situation according to PGE gas utility spokesperson Staci Homrig On the operational side PGE on Wednesday declared a lowinventory OFO because of a cold snap causing more supplies to be burned then pipeline shippers were bringing into the system The action was thought to help cause the PGE citygate price to jump from to on Wednesday As for reports of low storage Homrig said that while the utilitys supplies are very low they are adequate for the next week They are not dipping into cushion or base gas at this point Homrig said Lynch said that PGE has not defaulted on any payments but nevertheless in what she considers predatory practices the suppliers have required advance payments or payment at the time supplies are provided These gas suppliers are taking advantage of an emergency situation to extract another pound of flesh Lynch said in voting for the securitization measure Suppliers who have been paid when due are now saying regardless of existing agreements pay us today They are doing this in the coldest time of the year so the commissioners have to take these difficult steps to allow PGE amend these agreements in order to keep the gas flowing Part of the CPUCs action places a day limit on the securitization option so with the way gas contracts work in effect it only provides about another days worth of supplies said Homrig who noted that almost all of PGEs to suppliers have asked for special payment arrangements advances cashondelivery or letters of credit that the company cannot accommodate because of its cashflow crisis Out of ongoing negotiations the parties came up with the securitization proposal in the customer account receivables thus assuring them they will get paid On the gas side PGE has had sufficient revenues unlike its electric business but the suppliers have not wanted to let the utility stick to a normal payment arrangement because of the severe creditrating decline in the past weeks The CPUC met in San Francisco late Wednesday afternoon in the midst of a whirlwind day of public announcements from the governor state legislature consumer groups regulators and utilities A key piece was missing however California state legislative leaders called off a morning briefing that was to have offered the latest legislative proposals for dealing with the energy crisis Reportedly sticking points remain centered on the key questions of who pays for the solutions and how deeply the state gets into the energy business A spokesman for the assembly speakers office said he had no idea when the briefing would be rescheduled One piece of legislation that got through the state Senate SB X yesterday authorizes another million in emergency funds to purchase power It also would allow the state water resources department to be the utilities wholesale power supplier under longterm contracts at least through The measure drew a protest from CPUC Commissioner Richard Bilas who argued that the state agency be removed from that role as quickly as possible The bill which was first passed by the state Assembly was returned to assembly committees last night to iron out changes made in the senate It then would have to be ratified again by the Assembly Meanwhile consumer activists held rallies around the state protesting the state bailout of the privatesector utilities This prompted at least one of the utilities Southern California Edison to come out swinging saying that the recently released results of utility financial audits do not show any windfall profits or diversion of monies from the utilities to the parent company A letter surfaced in Washington from Gov Gray Davis to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee dated Jan and outlining measures the state is taking to increase energy supply and decrease demand sign longterm contracts and maintain the financial viability of the states public utilities The letter a catalogue of recent initiatives already reported here contained no specifics on any longterm contracts nor legislation signed that would address the immediate problem Davis outlined measures being taken to speed up siting of new power plants saying an additional MW would be online by the end of the year Responding to questions on another arena Edison Internationals senior vice president Tom Higgins said everything is on the table in the ongoing negotiations between Davis threeperson negotiating team and the two utilities including dropping the pending lawsuit in federal court in Los Angeles and crediting excess revenues from the utilities own generation against the whopping wholesale power cost undercollections The state remained under a power watch for the th day as the California independent grid operator CalISO urged conservation because reserves remain very low

The West Keeping Its Fingers Crossed CERA Alert CERA Alert Sent Wed July Title The West Keeping Its Fingers Crossed Author Zenker Moritzburke Snyder EMail Category Alert Product Line Western Energy URL cfmtrackeprofilecfmum A strong dose of summer weather in June propelled Westwide demand levels up by nearly percent over the same period in These higher demand levels provided the years first example of the power price spikes that can be produced when the Wests tight capacity intersects with normal summer load levels lowerthannormal hydroelectric levels strong gas prices and Californias immature wholesale power market structure As power markets reacted in June with unprecedented price strength throughout the region regulators and the California Independent System Operator ISO intervened to dampen markets from a maximum of per megawatthour MWh to per MWh Although some market participants have filed protests at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to raise or eliminate the caps utilities legislators and consumer advocates are moving to protect consumers or completely redesign what they perceive as a flawed market As western markets move through the critical JulyAugust peak electricity demand period market participants and regulators alike are wondering if power supplies will be sufficient and if price levels will rival those in June CERA expects that western supplies will be adequate under normal summer weather conditions barring abnormal unit and transmission line outages However normal August weather conditions will push demand levels significantly higher than in June creating an even tighter supplydemand balance straining the ability of the transmission system to supply key demand regions adequately A hot weather event could exhaust both instate and imported supplies for California The tight supply and demand situation will almost certainly prompt a strong price response similar to that in June This will fuel the unease of regulators in states that have restructured their markets and in those that are considering restructuring Even as regulators continued support of restructured power markets begins to waver a weather event that forces regional blackouts would force regulators to intervene CERAs outlook for August power markets is driven by High peak loads Under normal weather conditions Westwide August loads will be on average megawatts MW higher than last August The peak load in California is expected to push capacity margins to percent even after curtailing interruptible load Lower hydroelectric output As the West enters its peak load period hydroelectric production is expected to decline systemwide by roughly average megawatts aMW from July to August Compared with the high sustained output of last August hydroelectric output this August although roughly average on a historical basis will be roughly aMW percent lower High levels of gasfired generation Compared with August higher utilization rates along with gas prices that have climbed per million British thermal units MMBtu will increase the incremental cost of energy production by over per MWh Although CERA expects power prices in August to diverge from production costs owing to the expected supply tightness higher production costs will create a higher floor for energy prices in all periods of the day The extremely tight power supplydemand balance within the West and within California specifically has resulted in unprecedented high summer gas demand for power generation This high demand levelcombined with seasonal storage injection needs in Californiahas pushed up utilization rates on pipelines into California and pushed Topock differentials over per MMBtu to the Henry Hub Strong demand should continue through August in the West and support premium pricing at Topock The Rocky Mountains represent the opposite extreme to the high premium placed on Topock deliveries In the Rockies supply is building relative to export pipeline capacity and market access is becoming a challenge Weak seasonal demand compounds the problem the strong western demand for gas for power generation does not extend to the Rockies Generation within the region remains nearly all coalfired These regional pressures should remain a feature of western gas markets through September Moderate summer weather and reassuring injection rates nationwide during recent weeks have allowed some easing in prices at the Henry Hub However summer is not yet over and absolute storage inventories are still at critical levels Higher gas prices are likely to resurface Regional Power Market Drivers August demand under normal weather is expected to rise by an additional percent or nearly aMW over average June levels see Table Peak demand levels should exceed those in June as well with a coincident peak over the whole Western Systems Coordinating Council WSCC of MW expected under normal weather conditions in a percent increase over the weathermuted peak California alone should experience peak loads that are approximately MW higher than peak levels in June Available generation capacity in the West has been at normal levels for this time of year although coalfired plants are responding to a record production year with repeated but shortlived outages The steady decline in hydroelectric generation will remove aMW from the West resource base when compared with July levels and about aMW since June although reservoir refilling operations temporarily removed significant quantities of hydroelectric generation during portions of June Given hydro operators economic interest in maximizing onpeak production at the expense of offpeak production the loss of capacity during the onpeak period will be lower than these levels August will be a critical month for the heavily importdependent state of California While the state will be drawing approximately aMW of imports during August to meet demands during peak periods CERA expects the level of imports to exceed MW during peak demand conditions The Southwests need to supply native demand first will limit its ability to export to California and lower yearoveryear hydroelectric production in the Pacific Northwest will limit exports from that region Pacific Northwest CERA expects Pacific Northwest demand in August to climb by nearly aMW when compared with June levels The water supply for the Pacific Northwest has declined to percent of normal levels for the Lower Columbia owing to warmerthannormal weather in June In addition normal seasonal decline in runoff levels will drop about aMW from the resource base when compared with levels in June see Table Generation plant operators have responded to both growing native demand and a robust export market by running coal and gasfired generation at high levels Although less than MW of gasfired generation is currently available in the region it has been running at high utilization rates High energy demand in California for Pacific Northwest energy will keep differentials low between the regions As in June Pacific Northwest prices will respond in kind to the volatility CERA expects to occur in California in August In addition if hot weather in the Pacific Northwest pressures regional energy reserves local prices will rise to keep energy in the region potentially causing prices in the Pacific Northwest to move higher than those to the south California California is entering the peak load season with relatively little generating capacity down for maintenance Although hydroelectric output continues to decline statewide reservoir storage levels remain high at roughly percent of normal Nevertheless declining hydroelectric production is expected to remove about aMW when compared with hydroelectric production levels in June Normal summer weather will push demand in the state up by about aMW over June levels which were high see Table Californias peak load is expected to exceed MW compared with a peak load in June of approximately MW MW on the states ISO system alone according to its own estimate Assuming normal plant outage rates this demand level will necessitate the import of about MW of energy to meet the statewide peak Even after curtailing the approximately MW of interruptible load available for tight supply situations the state has a precarious percent capacity margin during the system peak An extreme hot weather event could push state loads up by an additional MW Outages are likely if additional imports are not available A capacity limit of MW will be in place during the summer for energy exports from the Pacific Northwest to Northern California The import limit from the Pacific Northwest to southern California will be MW Rockies and Southwest August demand levels in the combined RockiesSouthwest region will increase only slightly above levels in August climbing approximately aMW as loads in the regionunlike the rest of the belowaverage WSCCwere near normal last August Even so August loads will increase demand by over aMW when compared with levels in June of this year As with last year and this June supplies in the region should be sufficient to meet peak demand conditions under normal weather although growing loads in the RockiesSouthwest region have reduced its ability to supply neighboring regions with energy during peak demand conditions High loads driven by hot weather will keep the regions prices high Differentials between the region and California will be tight but California having tighter supplydemand balances will need to price at a premium to attract energy The highcapacity transmission ties between the RockiesSouthwest and the California market which is about percent the size of the RockiesSouthwest market will ensure that prices in the RockiesSouthwest stay close behind California prices whenever loads are high in California Regional Gas Market Drivers Evidence of pipeline bottlenecks has emerged across the West and supply and demand forces over the next year look likely to intensify these pressures Since the Northern Border expansion in late narrow northsouth and eastwest differentials across pricing points defined the market This summer the continuing supply growth in the Rocky Mountains has widened differentials between the Rockies and the rest of the West At Topock increasing gas demand in California and high utilization rates have resulted in high premiums Overall in North American gas markets strong storage injection rates in recent weeks have allowed some easing in pricesfrom an early July Henry Hub price of per MMBtu to under per MMBtu However despite these high injection rates the supplydemand balance and absolute level of storage inventories remain precarious Summer is not over and higher nationwide power loads in weeks to come will likely cut into storage injections and boost prices The ongoing competition between power and storage for supply should support an average Henry Hub price of per MMBtu in August Through the end of the summer differentials in the West should hold near current levels The pressure of growing Rocky Mountain supply will continue until heating loads start climbing in the fall In California high seasonal power loads should continue through August with hot weather and continued declines in hydroelectric generation Demand strength is expected to continue Across the West August demand for gas should climb from billion cubic feet Bcf per day in June to Bcf per day buoyed by an increase in gas demand for power generation see Table California High gas demand for power generation within California will continue through August CERA expects an increase from the states June demand levels of Bcf per day to Bcf per day during August The increase stems from declines in hydroelectric generation and increases in overall power loads Total demand is expected to exceed last years demand level by Bcf per day This will increase flows on pipelines into California reduce the states storage surplus and sustain high prices CERA expects pipeline utilization rates during August to average percent see Table CERA expects an August TopockHenry Hub differential of per MMBtu see Table Pacific Northwest Despite the extremely high prices at Topock and high demand in California until recently gas at Malin priced at a slight discount to Henry Hub prices After averaging per MMBtu below the Henry Hub during the third quarter last year the differential so far during the third quarter this year is per MMBtu below the Hub This week Malin is pricing at a per MMBtu premium relative to the Henry Hub The TopockMalin differential has swelled to over per MMBtu signaling intraCalifornia pipeline capacity constraints Two factors pressured Malin differentials during the early summer Pressure on Rocky Mountain and AECO differentials Prices in the two areas supplying the Pacific Northwest are under some pressure Increasing supplies in the Rockies are beginning to reach the limits of export capacity and put downward pressure on Rockies prices by limiting external market access At AECO although export capacity out of the province is available almost all of that excess capacity accesses eastern Canada on TransCanada Pipeline Pipelines into the United States are running near capacity Because of TransCanadas limited ability to discount interruptible transport the available space is more expensive and therefore the last to be filled Low early summer regional demand Gas demand in the Pacific Northwest is limited during late spring and early summer by declines in heating loads and very strong hydroelectric output Even in a normal or dry hydroelectric year seasonal runoff holds down gas demand for power generation in May and June even as gas demand for power generation begins climbing in California Increasing power loads are already evident The first factor will likely endure until heating season begins in late fall and regional demand in the Rockies and western Canada begins climbing However gas demand for power generation in the Pacific Northwest has increased already this summer and will continue to climb through the end of July and into August as hydroelectric generation wanes This added demand million cubic feet MMcf per day above June demand levelswill provide some support for Malin prices and limited support for Rockies and AECO prices MalinHenry Hub differentials are expected to average per MMBtu above the Henry Hub price during August Rocky Mountains Pressure on regional supplies within the Rockies continues as exports out of the region reach new highs Differentials to the Henry Hub have widened to over per MMBtu and although prices in the rest of the West will gain some support from high power loads regional demand in the Rockies is expected to remain near low seasonal levels through August August demand is expected to average Bcf per day in the region approximately equal to Junes Bcf per day total demand Demand begins to build during September but until the heating season begins in October Rocky Mountain prices will lag well below prices in the rest of the West CERA expects a Rocky MountainHenry Hub differential of per MMBtu during August Although some narrowing in Rocky Mountain differentials looks likely as seasonal demand increases through the fall the rapid build in supply in the region will likely keep differentials wide during CERA expects a supply build this year of nearly MMcf per day followed by a build of over MMcf per day during Currently approximately MMcf per day of excess pipeline export exists out of the region with the largest increment on Transcolorado into the San Juan Basin Next summer all capacity will likely run close to full Until export pipelines expandthe first likely expansion is Trailblazerdifferentials will remain wide For CERA expects an average annual differential below the Henry Hub of per MMBtu Southwest Differentials in the San Juan and Permian Basins have gained considerable strength relative to Henry Hub prices amid the recent hot weather in Texas Permian supplies are pricing at a slight premium to the Henry Hub price and in the San Juan Basin prices have narrowed from an early July differential of per MMBtu to a differential of less than per MMBtu CERA expects demand in the Southwest during August of Bcf per day an increase from Junes level of Bcf per day but the larger Texas market will determine the relative strength of differentials in those two basins CERA expects a San Juan differential of per MMBtu during August with a Permian Basin differential of per MMBtu Differentials between the Rocky Mountains and the San Juan Basin have widened substantially over the past two months with supply increases in the Rocky Mountains Flows on Transcolorado increased from a monthly average of under MMcf per day to over MMcf per day during June Supply in the two regions is following opposite paths Rockies supply is climbing rapidly and San Juan supply has likely peaked and should decline slowly beginning this year CERA expects a decline in supply of MMcf per day during relative to and an additional decline of MMcf per day during Because of these different outlooks wider RockiesSan Juan differentials will persist end Follow URL for PDF version of this Monthly

mailtoIMCEANOTESwebmasterceraEcom NRONcom Sent Monday February PM To Subject Californias Desperate Attempts to Avoid a Rate Increase CERA Al ert Title Californias Desperate Attempts to Avoid a Rate Increase URL eprofileuDmD Californias Desperate Attempts to Avoid a Rate Increase On February the California Assembly approved and the California governor signed a new law intended to secure power supplies for California The legislature has been meeting since early January in a special extraordi nary session to address the power market crisis in the state and the new la w represents their first significant piece of legislation The bill AB establishes a new mechanism for purchasing power for the states busines ses and consumers Whether the mechanism works will depend chiefly on whether the limited revenue source used to pay for the powercollected by the state s investorowned utilities IOUs under current retail rateswill cover wholesale power market costs incurred by the state The law reflects the obsession by California lawmakers with avoiding a rate increase rather than focusing on the underlying flaws in Californias market structure AB ushers in several important changes to the California market structure It also contains several key provisions that capture the political mood in the state Highlights of the bill include Power buying authority transferred The responsibility for purchasing pow er for the customers of Californias IOUs has been transferred to the Calif ornia Department of Water Resources CDWR The California utilities will continu e to operate and schedule their remaining generating facilities and contracts T he difference between the utilities total load and the sum of their resour ces referred to as the utilities net short amount will be supplie d by CDWR an amount of energy that varies between and megawatts MW depending on the time of year time of day and utility plant availability The utilities most recently performed this function themselves buying energy from the California Power Exchange PX However CDWR has been buying electricity o n behalf of the IOUs since midJanuary when the nearbankruptcy of Southern California Edison SCE and Pacific Gas Electric PGE threatened to disrupt supplies to their customers CDWR is a state agency that manages water reservoirs and transportation systems in the state CDWR uses an enormous amount of electricity to transport water across California and provides critical loadshedding capability to the independent system operator ISO In addition CDWRs reservoirs generate power The CDWR is thus well integr ated in the states electric grid but in the past has not executed large compli cated energy purchase arrangements to supply the customers of Californias utilities Portfolio of transactions The intent of AB is to allow CDWR to execute a portfolio of contracts to stabilize the cost of power for the utilities and their customers CDWR has until January to execute contracts CDWR will take title to power and is thereby not just acting as a clearinghouse It has issued a request for bids and seeks a variety of terms including month ly annual twoyear threeyear and longer CDWR may also enter into options Thus although CDWRs role is intended to be temporary the contracts th at it executes could extend many years Power for munis CDWR may purchase power on behalf of some California municipal utilities at the municipal utilities election New payment scheme CDWR will be entitled to a portion of existing utilit y rates to pay for the cost of purchased power interest on bonds and administrative expenses This payment stream will be equal to the differenc e between the generation component currently embedded in utility retail rates averaging about per kilowatthour kWh and the utilities costs to run their own generation plants costs of bilateral and qualifying facility contracts and the costs of ancillary services The CDWR share of retail ra tes is referred to as the California Purchase Adjustment CPA It is not clear whether the CPA will cover wholesale power market costs Current prices for multiyear power contracts may lie above the CPA In addition if investors believe that the CPA is inadequate to cover costs the entire program may b e abandoned New bonds Bonds will be issued to secure power The total amount of bond s issued may not exceed four times the CPA The state will transfer mill ion from the general fund to jumpstart the program which begins immediately This seed money and all bond proceeds must be recovered by CDWR from the Califor nia utilities customers and municipal utilities if they opt in New residential rate freeze The California Public Utilities Commission CPUC is prohibited from increasing residential customer rates until it ha s completed paying all outstanding obligations This locks in the recent percent residential rate increase indefinitely Governor Gray Davis thus ke eps his pledge not to increase rates further Retail competition To help secure a stable payment stream for the new bonds AB enables the CPUC to prohibit the utilities retail customers from choosing an alternative electricity provider until CDWRs obligations are paid Although the CPUC has yet to act on this the action would effectively halt the competitive retail markets in the state for the duration of the CDWR progra m Taxpayer protection AB directs that the new bonds clearly state neither the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the State of California is pledged to the payment of the principal of or interest on this bond Thus the bonds are secured only by the payment stream from utility rates No assets affected The CDWR is granted neither ownership nor control of utility assets Ironically the authority now granted CDWR is what California utilities had essentially requested last summer when they sought to stabilize electricity prices by executing a portfolio of transactions The utilities were never provided sufficient authority to execute term contracts In addition the utilities have more experience to perform this function than CDWR Rather than aligning retail rates with wholesale electricity prices California has sidestepped the issue by simply transferring the electricity purchasing function SCE and PGE are still left to contend with uncollected costs fro m past energy purchases although they will no longer incur costs associated with buying power in the current wholesale market while charging frozen retail rates The utility liquidity crisis has not been resolved It is not clear whether the laws prohibition on rate increases for residential customers can be achieved The law is silent on rate increases for commerci al and industrial customers providing a potential path for recovering higherthan expected costs Alternatively CDWR could conceivably find contracts of sufficient duration and low enough price that the rate pledge is met These contracts would lock in todays retail rates for a long period of time AB is just one of the steps that state officials hope will restore the po wer system in California to a more stable footing Key tasks remain Californias wholesale market structure which helped cause the supply crisis by ensuring that it was not profitable or possible to build generation in California remains unchanged The term contracts CDWR is likely to sign wi ll provide a mechanism for mainly existing generators to lay off risk but will not be sufficient to encourage the build of sufficient new facilities In addition Californias siting and permitting process remains largely unchanged The state must still address the need to expedite the development of new power plants AB does not provide for the recovery of uncollected past wholesale ener gy costs of Californias utilities The state has been negotiating a deal w ith the utilities that may involve the transfer of generation or transmission asset s to the state However the utilities have achieved recent court victories that may pave the way to a courtdirected recovery of these costs Recent audits indicate that SCE and PGE recovered their stranded costs early in wh ich should have triggered an end to their respective rate freezes A legal showdown between the utilities and the state on this issue may be inevitable end Follow above URL for full report Come Shoot the Rapids with us at CERAWeek

Economic Development Councils Worth spending some time with them Lorna Wednesday February Nevada Goes for the Gold By Dave Todd mailto Its a reverse twist on Americas economic history One might even call it a case of Eastward Ho For the first time in the nearly two centuries that California has been part of the United States entrepreneurs are talking about leaving not moving into the Golden State because of potential opportunities for doing business to the east Not much farther east only over the mountains into neighboring states but still in that direction as opposed to jurisdictions north or south of California And the biggest lights in the eyes of one particular industry are emanating from Nevada Jack Stewart president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association recently warned that massive power price increases and future rate hikes could be the genesis for industry departures from the state The impact on large industrial users he warned could provide an impetus for a statewide economic downturn in California which accounts for about of the United States GDP Californias mass exodus Since the beginning of the year Nevadas primary economic development agencies have been overwhelmed by California companies wanting to relocate some or all of their operations to the state The bad news for California is that the list includes many Silicon Valley enterprises or wannabes whose growth planning units have been gripped by uncertainty about the dependability of future electric supply delivery Somer Hollingsworth president and CEO of the Nevada Development Authority in Las Vegas said in late January he was urgently asked to meet with corporate officials of a major California company to brief them about relocating to Nevada In meeting with the company he asked Are there others like you And they said yes we can introduce you to company after company after company Overwhelmingly it is hightech California companies that are most interested in moving because of their evergrowing requirements for reliability in their electric service Beyond that We have five power companies that have already come down here and talked to uspower producers he said These companies including Calpine Corp are keen to take advantage of a variety of opportunities made easier by the fact that unlike California Nevada has no state income tax and no general corporate or business inventory tax putting it at both a geographical proximity and tax advantage to California It also puts Nevada ahead of other lowtax Western states such as Arizona Colorado and Utah RenoSilicon Valley share symbiotic relationship Hollingsworths northern counterpart at Renos publicprivate sectorbacked agency the Economic Development Association of Western Nevada EDAWN tells a similar story Chuck Alvey who heads that body says interest in his city from Silicon Valley refugees is becoming intense A mere threehours drive and minute plane ride from the San FranciscoSan Jose area Reno and Lake Tahoe already house hundreds of hightech industry executives who commute back and forth and who have up to now escaped the impact of power drains caused by their energyintensive industries Server farms banks of computers that manage Web sites and related business operations continue to grow in number A single server farm can require as much as MW of power to operate Strict new federal energy efficiency standards to curb demand by other power hogs such as residential central air conditioners and heat pumps clothes washers water heaters and commercial heating and cooling equipment wont be implemented in time to affect the current power crisis The US Department of Energy last month announced that the energy conservation measures could save consumers and businesses more than billion over the next years Though the energy saved would eliminate the need for MW of new power generation the new standards wouldnt be phased in until between and Stan Thomas director of business planning and growth strategies for Sierra Pacific Power Co Nevadas dominant energy company said his business has experienced great success at moving Silicon Valleybased firms divisions into Nevada albeit in a limited way But were seeing a lot more companies saying Wait a minute We cant operate here anymore with power being shut off and having payrolls to meet and not producing any product He added that getting a little more aggressive about enticing electricity supplyconstrained companies to relocate to Nevada is no longer likely to be seen as a cherrypicking operation at another states expense In fact Nevada froze its electric deregulation planning last year pausing to reconsider its options as a direct result of Californias policy confusion We have delayed until we have a plan together where capacity exceeds native instate demand said Thomas Sierra Pacifics power delivery capabilities are being enhanced by its plan to build a new kV line in eastern Nevada to import power from Utah In it also installed a major line into the Pacific Northwest Both developments are significant because the company has switched its strategy to become more of a power transmission distribution company than a generator Were learning our lesson here said Thomas Setting aside the issue of burgeoning energy demand requirements across the West the need to recover stranded costs associated with deregulation is a preoccupation for power plantowners in general he said As for California I think the next couple of years are going to be some tight times no doubt about it And thats why what were trying to do in Nevada is secure longterm contracts as well as shortterm contracts to protect our customers while were in the process of securing capacity to ensure

Gorillas Show Strong Volume Growth The year was a banner year for the top players in gas marketing with huge increases in gas prices enormous volatility continuing growth in sales volumes and major potential for profits Physical gas sales volumes for the top marketers in NGIs ranking grew to nearly Bcfd and profits among the larger players came in very strong with companies such as Williams reporting profit increases in their energy merchant segments However for many of the smaller players it was a tough year The big news here is probably the price pressure the marketers have had to withstand said Ben Schlesinger president of Marylandbased consulting firm Schlesinger and Associates which tracks energy marketing These people have price exposure on both sides of their business the buy side and sell side Theyve actively sought to hedge these risks but theres no question that there have been some real stresses in their businesses as a result of quadrupling gas prices in Significant shuffling has begun to take place and will continue not just among the leadership but among the whole roster of marketing companies predicted Schlesinger For the first time Im not sure all will make it because of the price volatility and the stresses that it creates on their balance sheets and their ability to meet the different needs of their customers If you are on the wrong side of a transaction these days in California you are going to suffer significantly Its not much different at the Henry Hub either he noted The harsh reality is that only the strong will survive Ronald J Barone of UBS Warburg believes the California energy crisis and fears of lack of gas supply and capacity are driving customers to the strongest marketers I think that over the long term it will be a positive for the bigger players such as Enron Customers want to go with somebody who is big has facilities somebody who is going to guarantee it somebody who can do risk management for them Enron is the pound gorilla here Enron has been the pound gorilla in gas marketing for years but there were always plenty of pound gorillas around Last year however Enron found a way to trade natural gas over the Internet and at last glance was well over pounds more than double the size of its next closest rival gorilla Duke Energy Enron sold Bcfd of gas last year compared to only Bcfd the year prior and compared to the Bcfd sold by Duke Energy which came in second place in NGIs ranking of gas marketers by physical sales volume Enron catapulted itself to the next level with the help of its handy new tool EnronOnline its webbased proprietary energy and commodity trading system that now handles about mainly natural gas transactions each day In Enron completed its first full year of deploying EnronOnline which quickly became the worlds largest webbased ecommerce site During the year Enron executed transactions online with customers totaling billion of gross value The tremendous success of EnronOnline led many observers to wonder whether market concentration was beginning to take place in the industry When you look at Enrons massive increase in wholesale transactions you have to wonder about that concentration Enrons Bcfd is pretty large when compared with the Bcfd that is actually consumed in North America But you have to factor in multiple trades one marketer trades a given molecule of gas to another marketer and so on According to Schlesinger the socalled churning factor is close to three In the past several years when weve been polling marketers we got numbers in that came to about Tcf We added up all the physical sales by all the marketing companies We did not have response in our survey some of the midsized and smaller companies didnt respond We reasonably extrapolated that about Tcf maybe even Tcf of gas was traded each year in North America Physical consumption in North America is about Tcf so divided by is about Using that calculation Enron with Bcfd of physical gas sales in ends up with a not unreasonable market share When the Federal Trade Commission looks at markets and market share it uses several tools one of which is the HerschmanHerfindahl Index a measure of market concentration Its the sum of the squares of the market share of each participant If one company owns the entire of the market thats an HHI of The Department of Justice has been using as a red flag when it considers approval of mergers and acquisitions According to Schlesinger the total gas industry has an HHI of only about way below any suggestion of market concentration Its so low that its unbelievable Its a highly competitive business Even if one competitor has of the market HHI of and the next competitor has and on down it certainly doesnt send up any red flags he said It could be that market concentration in the gas industry has risen a bit in but this information alone would not diminish the fact that the industry is one of the most competitive businesses in the United States However there may be some regional issues we have to think about he added We havent looked at that so I cant comment on whether anyone has undue market power in a particular region or state for example There is a snowball effect going on among the top marketers The leaders keep getting larger Volume growth averages at least per year or more Several factors should fuel future growth Price increases volatility and uncertainty of supplies are driving buyers to the larger marketers according to both Schlesinger and Barone Online trading has become a new springboard for additional growth by allowing greater efficiency and many more trades to take place Schlesinger said he believes electronic trading was responsible for a good part the increase in volumes Enron attributed much of its growth to the online business According to some observers online trading still has plenty of room to grow Altra Energy CEO Paul Bourke believes about of all gas trading now takes place over the Internet Bourke said Altra had natural gas trades on its system in December However Barone predicts there eventually will be a slowdown in gas marketing growth in the United States as international energy markets grab the attention of many marketers International should pick up the slack and contribute increasingly to the bottom line he said Barone also expects the current market situation and the continued interest in service supply and commodity versatility to continue driving marketing companies together I think size scope and scale are incredibly significant Only one of the top major marketers last year resulted from the combination of two separate predecessors Axia which grew out of the combination of Koch Energy and Entergy The rest of the group achieved its growth without major acquisitions or mergers Thirteen out of the top marketers showed double or tripledigit volume growth with only two companies in the minus column PGE had the largest volume deterioration of any of the large marketers with a decline in annual volumes and a decline in quarterly volumes PGE went through a significant reorganization last year The move of its National Energy Group NEG to Bethesda MD from Houston had the greatest impact on its trading activity But the company also sold its energy services business and its Texas gas transmission assets among other changes It really slowed down our trading and a large number of people stayed behind in Houston said company spokesman Patrick Hurston At the time of the move the company estimated about half or would make the move Hurston wouldnt say how many actually made the trip but the company is still actively hiring TransCanada which also underwent a massive reorganization last year was the other company in the minus column with a decline in sales volume The remainder of the group experienced large increases in volumes Enron at Duke with growth Sempra with and BP Amoco with growth

portfolio in the United States InterGen the power generation joint venture of Royal DutchShell Group and Bechtel Enterprise Holdings Inc closed a deal yesterday giving the international developer a equity interest in Houstonbased Coral Energy one of the largest natural gas and power marketers in the country Coral Energy officials had predicted in July that Shell and construction giant Bechtel would fold InterGen InterGen North America and certain assets of Coral Energy into one business see Daily GPI July Under the agreement announced yesterday InterGen will receive the majority of the natural gas pipeline storage and power generation assets of Shells Coral Energy affiliate in the United States It remains a joint venture of Shell and Bechtel The move gives Shell a ownership in InterGen with Bechtel owning the remaining InterGen had been formed as a joint venture and Bechtel made an undisclosed payment to Shell in the deal About Coral employees mostly related to the Texasbased assets in Houston will become InterGen employees under the agreement InterGen is considered a world leader in power generation development with projects around the world Carlos Riva InterGens CEO said that the transaction represents a significant boost to our plans in the United States These assets and strengthened alignment with a premier US gas and electricity trading enterprise will provide InterGen a strong platform for growth in the US market Globally the alignment is expected to help leverage Shells strengths in both fuel supply and power marketing and trading Bechtel will continue to be InterGens preferred provider for worldwide power generation engineering procurement and construction services Coral is the regions third largest natural gas marketer and the twentieth largest power marketer in the country Linda Cook Shell Gas and Powers CEO said the whole idea was to help InterGen grow in the United States and that the best way was to add Shell assets to it Success in tomorrows energy markets will be earned through globally aligned marketing trading and asset companies said Cook Thats critically true in the US and will be the case as competitive energy markets open worldwide InterGen plans to build a sizable power generation portfolio in the US working closely with Coral to pursue investment decisions that make the most commercial sense We expect this relationship to make a significant contribution to both InterGens and Corals longterm success Shell and Bechtel formed InterGen in March see Daily GPI March specifically to pursue power generation opportunities in North America The Bostonbased company was set up to develop Shell Bechtel and InterGen have among them the complete skill set for success in the new global energy market said Paul Unruh COO of Bechtel InterGen is a worldclass developer with a proven track record of successfully developing financing and operating projects around the world Shell is one of the most successful marketers and traders of energy in the US and is expanding into deregulating natural gas and power markets globally Bechtel is a global leader in the development engineering and construction of power facilities These strengths together create a large power generation platform now directly linked with global energy marketing and trading InterGens portfolio will give Coral Energy access for its trading business and Coral will participate as part of Shells global trading network with InterGen a business partner in its expanding North American asset platform As the exclusive marketer of Shells gas production Coral has a gas supply of Bcfd and a trading platform dealing in extensive volumes of energy in all key supply basins For Bechtel the agreement will help it lock in construction contracts for its combined cycle gas turbine power stations Specifically the assets to be transferred to InterGen from Coral include the following miles of major intrastate gas pipelines in Texas The pipeline facilities extend from South Texas near the Mexican border along the Texas Gulf Coast to the Louisiana boarder and north from near Houston to the East Texas producing areas The West Clear Lake Storage facility one of the largest natural gas storage reservoirs in Texas Located near the Houston Ship Channel it has a leasehold interest in the Stratton Ridge storage facility Corals interest of more than MW in four power plants one in operation and three under construction The transfer would follow equity and regulatory approvals In total Coral had miles of gas pipeline that ran along the Gulf Coast in Texas and Louisiana It also is building a mile long pipeline in northern Mexico with that countrys national oil company PEMEX Currently InterGen is either operating or building power stations with a total of MW It also has MW in advanced development Projects are being operated under construction or are in advanced development in the United Kingdom the Philippines Colombia Mexico China Egypt Brazil Australia Turkey and the United States

Category Alert Product Line North American Gas URL cfmtrackeprofilecfmum Alternative URL clientnagaltnagaltabhtml Gas prices remain within a high range with prices volatile between approximately and per million British thermal units MMBtu Prices are likely to remain within this high band through the fall until the uncertainty of early winter weather resolves itself At the lower end of this rangeand with oil prices in the upper s per barrel or higherprice support kicks in as end users begin to switch back toward gas or to reactivate industrial demand Gas prices may flirt with the lower boundary so long as the weather is not too hot across too many regions allowing storage injections to increase and providing hopes for an adequately supplied winter Abovenormal heat in only one or two regions however or even the threat of storms in the Gulf of Mexico will pull prices quickly upward As for the upper boundary although prices in specific regions such as California and the Northeast may reach above an actual storm in the Gulf or more widespread heat than has yet occurred this summer appears required to pull the Henry Hub much above Absent tropical storm activity in the Gulf of Mexico CERA expects prices to settle into the lower portion of this band during September see Table Although strong power loads and the resulting weak injection rates are likely to sustain prices through much of August the seasonal decline in generation demand into September should allow storage injections to increase by billion cubic feet Bcf per day As a result CERA expects prices to settle somewhat averaging per MMBtu at the Henry Hub during September However the larger fundamental force in the market remains unchanged supplies are adequate with any certainty only for another warm winter Any interruption in supply or abnormal demand will quickly drive prices upward next month may represent the low for the remainder of the year Gas StorageNot Yet Enough Mild weather over much of the United States during July allowed a muchneeded recovery in storage injections with the estimated injection rate increasing by nearly Bcf per day from yearearlier levels see Table This rate was enabled entirely by lower demand however and not added supply The result is that under more normal summer weather conditions during August the US storage inventory deficit is likely to remain stubbornly near Bcf Although the deficit is likely to decline on average during August it is even more likely to expand again during September especially should any storm necessitate evacuation of offshore platforms Absolute inventories and supply adequacy for this winter therefore remain a concern in the market Inventories are unlikely to reach levels adequate to prevent record lows from occurring next spring Should injections continue as expected inventories would reach approximately Bcf by October but reaching even this level still an alltime low annual maximum inventory requires some help from a lack of storm activity and a lack of heating load in October Storage inventories are not yet sufficient to relieve market pressure and are unlikely to become so by the beginning of the heating season Regional MarketsWestern Disconnects Continue Wide differentials emerged this summer in the West and look likely to persist through September In Southern California record summer demand levels have pushed pipeline flows to new highs Topock continues to be the premium pricing point in North America In the Rockies supply growth has pushed up pipeline flows out of the region Power loads should ease somewhat in Southern California and that easing will bring some decline in the Topock premium Pressure on Rocky Mountains and San Juan prices should persist until the start of the heating season in late October see Table CERAs outlook by region follows Rockies Pipeline capacity out of the Rockies is running nearly full to every export market except the San Juan Basin Emerging pipeline bottlenecks should keep differentials wide during September with an average differential of per MMBtu San Juan In the San Juan increased imports from the Rocky Mountains and high utilization rates on capacity into California are pressuring prices CERA expects differentials to average per MMBtu for the month of September San Juan differentials will narrow more substantially when Rocky Mountain pipeline bottlenecks are relieved by increases in heating demand during the fourth quarter Permian and MidContinent Strong power loads in Texas have supported Permian Basin prices during July and August Persistent power demand is expected to keep differentials around per MMBtu for September MidContinent prices should average just under Permian prices Chicago Steady storage injection loads are unlikely to support prices at Chicago in the face of declining power generation into September July premiums of to have already come down in early August and are likely to remain low at approximately for September Northeast markets Northeast price premiums have averaged from the mids to the mids depending on generation load and proximity to the New York Facilities Group major meters CERA expects little to change this relationship but as generation loads decline into September premiums could move closer to the fuel cost floor the mid to high s Canadian MarketsSupply Growth Still Disappointing Although June displayed yearoveryear growth in production in western Canada July reverted to a decline and August is running close to last years level The current expectation is for over well completions in approximately of which are expected to be gas wells Even if the trend toward shallow drilling does not change substantially the sheer number of wells is expected to produce a supply build by yearend and into For the total western Canadian supply build is expected to be flat with increasing to a positive growth of MMcf per day in Demand Slow but Exports Up TransCanada flows are down MMcf per day on average for but have been down by over MMcf per day so far in the third quarter PGE GTNW volumes were up by over MMcf per day in June and July but have dropped to yearearlier levels in August and are expected to remain close to last years levels for September Northern Border Pipeline is operating at rates similar to last years on average in but is expected to decrease about MMcf per day for the third quarter Western Canadian demand is currently up slightly driven by the warmerthannormal weather in late July and early August but should be closer to levels in September High Prices Wide Differentials The AECOHenry differential has widened quite dramatically over the past few months from the low USs of the first quarter to US in July The

Operationsmarketing related rd Legislativeregulatory related El Paso Explosion Takes MMcfd Off Market About Bcfd of flow on El Pasos South Mainline downstream of Pecos River NM Station ceased after the pipeline exploded early Saturday killing people and seriously injuring two others at a nearby campsite El Paso said Monday it was able to compensate for about half that volume through a combination of fuel switching by downstream customers maximum storage withdrawals an OFO and other customer cooperation The market reaction was rather predictable as all three California points rose by about cents to lead an overall price surge However utilities in the state did not appear to be experiencing any supply problems SoCal Gas said storage and supplies from other Southwest receipt points were adequate to avoid any problems A gas operations official for Los Angeles Dept of Water and Power also saw no reason for panic From past similar incidents on Southwest pipelines he expected that the approximately feetlong section missing from El Pasos line could be slapped back into place rather quickly El Paso itself had no estimate for when it can restore service in the impacted segment it must get approval rom the federal investigators before beginning repairs or evaluating a restart of the adjacent lines But a large aggregator and a marketer agreed with the LADWP official that it should be a quick mechanical fix once repairs begin The aggregator believed downtime could be as short as a week No customers were cut off as a result of the rupture but some were getting reduced volumes an El Paso spokeswoman said Northern Natural Gas was seeing a throughput increase of MMcfd Monday while Transwestern volumes were up MMcfd as a result of shippers diverting gas away from El Pasos South Mainline an Enron spokeswoman said A producer said she diverted as much of her companys gas as possible from El Paso to Transwestern People were reluctant to trade Permian Basin gas Monday especially at fixed prices because of doubts about how much would be able to flow several sources said Permian numbers rose a little less than cents as part of the general upturn However it was Waha prices that saw a bigger increase of nearly cents as a result Everything in El PasoPermians Keystone pool was going back into Waha said a marketer putting Waha in the mid s at a premium of more than a nickel above Henry Hub The Southern California border at an average of nearly led the rest of Mondays market by a large margin Before trading began EnronOnline was offering border swing swaps for the rest of the month at a marketer said With swing swaps priced so high it gave sellers more confidence in what prices they could command in the day market he said Either way I wouldnt want to be short right now at the border There were lots of rumors but no facts available on what caused the El Paso rupture noted one aggregator But its a good thing it didnt happen until after California had cooled off Otherwise I could easily have seen the border basis spread from San Juan Basin go as high as instead of the approximate gap of egistered Monday by Daily GPI A knowledgeable source provided his analyis of the blast The structure of the crater made the rupture look like a line integrity problem from the way it blew out The earth can harbor leaking gas for a while until eventually everything all goes up at once People nearby would not have detected anything because gas is odorless in longhaul lines the mercaptan odorant is not added until it gets to the local distribution stage Pipeline safety surveyors usually will look for dead vegetation in the vicinity to detect a leak but this was a desert area with very little vegetation It is easily possible for escaping gas to hug the ground for the approximate foot distance to the victims campsite and seek an ignition source there It is a normal tendency for gas leaking into the atmosphere to stay close to the ground and that tendency would have been amplied by the chilliness of the predawn desert The source went on to say I think there will be lot more of this ruptures in the future with many pipes becoming at least years old El Paso was unlucky in experiencing one of the early incidents he said because the situation applies to the other lines with old pipe Pipelines used to spend a lot more money on maintenance when regulation was tighter and they were still paying for depreciation he said Now theyre more purely forprofit companies after having written off their depreciation costs many times over El Paso Blast Kills Shuts Down South Mainline Federal and company investigators Monday swarmed over the scene of the devastating El Paso Natural Gas mainline explosion that erupted near daybreak Saturday engulfing a party of weekend campers along the Pecos River near Carlsbad NM and killing people Two other persons were hospitalized in critical condition Three officials from the federal Office of Pipeline Safety OPS and with the National Transportation Safety Board NTSB have been at the site of the blast since late Saturday and two more OPS officials were en route Monday New Mexico Gov Gary Johnson who flew to the area on Sunday said he wanted to know how many other potential pipeline dangers there are in the state He called for a thorough investigation About Bcfd of capacity on El Pasos southern leg initially was lost from the ruptured inch line and two looped lines nearby that were shut in after the accident El Paso was making up some of the shortfall by drawing the maximum MMcfd from its Washington Ranch Storage Field downstream of the accident Increased use of other pipelines allocations and cutbacks by customers and the fact that weather had moderated in California helped ease the supply situation Nevertheless spot prices increased by about cents for points in California while the rest of the market spurred by Hurricane Debby went up about cents There was no estimate as to when the looped lines would be back in service according to El Paso spokesperson Kim Wallace We dont intend to put anything back into service until we know for certain that the remaining pipelines are safe Wallace said She did not expect them to be back in service today and could give no time frame on when they would be returned to service It is much too premature at this point to predict when the three disabled El Paso westbound lines will return to service said Patricia Klinger a spokeswoman with the Department of Transportations Research and Special Programs Administration RSPA which oversees the OPS The one that ruptured is definitely going to be out of service for awhile and another line is badly damaged from the fire As for a third adjacent line that could potentially be reopened but we have to test the integrity of that line and have it examined by metallurgists she told Daily GPI Everyone will be working of course to try to get this line back in service But the safe operation of the pipeline is of premiere importance The three lines shared the same rightofway Were just now able to start looking at exactly what happened and how to get that one line back in service Klinger said Our metallurgist is on his way right now I know hes going to meet with the NTSB when theyre examining the foot section of pipe thats out of the ground as a result of the explosion I think the company also wants to decide what types of tests can be done on this line Its not piggable The NTSB which has set up a command center in Carlsbad NM declined to make any preliminary speculation about the cause of the explosion Its much too early for us to even think about the cause of this accident Were only dealing with the factsRight now were documenting the pipe itself and surveying the land Were going to look at the chronology of when the emergency calls came in document damage to vehicles and injuries said NTSB spokesman Keith Holloway Probably at this point were looking at nine months to a year maybe more before the results of the investigation are publicly disclosed Holloway noted The rupture occurred at am MDT in the underground line near the Pecos River crossing which is about miles south of the Carlsbad Caverns National Park in a spot popular with local campers and fishermen The blast tore a crater in the earth about feet long feet wide and feet deep According to preliminary reports the pipeline was underground at the point of rupture sending two sections of pipe each about feet long flying hundreds of feet The gas then ignited and shot flames from the broken pipe toward sleeping campers The NTSB estimated there was a gap of to feet between broken ends of the pipeline at the site The fire burned for about minutes before El Paso workers manually shut off pipeline valves Ten members of two families were burned to death in the blast The families who were related by marriage were camping on public land along the river near where the pipeline emerged from the ground to cross the Pecos in an aerial crossing alongside a bridge Six were pronounced dead at the scene and four others died at Texas hospitals Saturday night The dead included five children under the age of six including sixmonthold twins Two adults were listed in critical condition Monday at a hospital in Lubbock TX The ruptured pipeline which El Paso said was constructed in is one of four that runs along the southern branch of El Pasos pipeline system There is an adjacent inch pipeline and another inch pipeline The fourth a inch pipeline was abandoned and is not available for service Wallace said El Paso and federal officials are particularly interested in the integrity of the second inch pipeline that ran close to the broken line Wallace said that none of the companys customers had been cut off of service but they were receiving gas as reduced levels She also said that on Aug a patrol inspection either done by air or vehicle was conducted on the pipelines located near the Pecos River by El Paso officials and no problems were found El Paso conducted the last corrosion test in February and no problems were found then either Visual inspections are conducted on all of the systems pipelines once a month she said and the company follows all federal pipeline requirements for inspections Asked whether El Paso planned to change its inspection system immediately Wallace said that she did not think so but said that if the NTSB review finds something that needs to be changed the company will do whatever needs to be done immediately These situations are so rare she said We dont feel that we need to change what were doing now But if the situation warrants we certainly will make any changes necessary El Paso is working with family members to take care of their immediate needs including hotel accommodations food travel arrangements and medical treatment The company also is providing additional services as needed This is a tragic accident and our heartfelt condolences go out to the families involved said El Paso Energy President William Wise He said the company was working with the NTSB to investigate diligently all matters surrounding this accident and to establish its cause as quickly as possible The fallout of the explosion is expected to extend all across the country as federal legislators consider more stringent pipeline rules following an explosion in Bellingham WA that killed three in June Locally Carlsbad Mayor Gary Perkowski said that he wanted to find out what happened and keep it from ever happening again That reaction was echoed by the New Mexico governor I have a lot of questions said Johnson What is the reliability of these pipelines What went wrong Was it preventable Meanwhile RSPA was sifting through its history to determine whether the El Paso blast was the biggest pipeline disaster on record in terms of fatalities Timeline am Aug El Paso Natural Gas automated computer reading of the pressure in the pipeline

line using manual valves Between Jan and June of this year there have been transmission pipeline incidents according to the OPS Fourteen were caused by either external or internal corrosion were damaged by outside forces three were due to construction or material defects and were unknown There was only one fatality until June of this year on transmission pipeline incidents which was caused by an outside force Eleven people had been injured through June In August OPS sent a warning letter to El Paso citing it for a number of pipeline safety violations in Arizona The OPS did not impose a civil fine on El Paso but it advised the pipeline that should you not correct the circumstances leading to the violation we will take enforcement actions when and if the continued violation comes to our attention El Paso Blast May Cinch Tough Pipe Safety Bill The explosion on El Paso Natural Gas system which killed people over the weekend may give Congress the added boost to pass a tough pipeline safety reauthorization bill when it returns from recess in September Capitol Hill insiders said Monday This just sadly proves why Congress needs to act as soon as it returns on Sept to pass the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act before any more innocent lives are taken said a spokeswoman for Sen John McCain RAZ In June Chairman McCains Senate Commerce Committee voted out the Pipeline Safety Improvement bill that would among other things give states inspection and oversight authority over interstate pipelines require interstate pipelines to consult with states about their integrity plans create stiffer penalties for pipeline safety transgressors and offer protection to whistleblowers who report pipeline violations McCain proposed the agressive safety bill following the product pipeline explosion in Bellingham WA that killed three in June McCain has always been determined to pass this bill this year but this obviously sadly strengthens that resolve she said He will make a determined effort for this to happen but whether its brought up for a vote on the Senate floor will be up to Senate Leader Trent Lott RMS the McCain spokeswoman said I have no doubts that the Senate will push for pipeline safety when it returns said Terry Boss vice president of environment safety and operations for the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America INGAA On the House side a companion to McCains bill has been introduced as well as a number of other pipeline safety measures but most are at the subcommittee level But the issue could pick up steam in the wake of the El Paso blast We must examine why this accident occurred and ensure that it must never happen again said Rep Joe Skeen RNM Definitely its a tragic situation Boss said referring to the explosion near Carlsbad NM which reportedly left a crater about feet deep feet wide and feet long Five of the fatalities were children who were spending a weekend camping and fishing with their family along the Pecos River The political fallout from the disaster was being assessed in Washington DC yesterday Any kind of incident has political ramificationsWere just not sure how this is going to directly impact pending legislation and regulations Boss noted

on AM on PM To cc Subject Monthly Briefing A Shoulder Month Without Shoulder Prices CERA Alert CERA Alert Sent Tue August Title Monthly Briefing A Shoulder Month Without Shoulder Prices Author Zenker Snyder Moritzburke EMail Category Alert Product Line Western Energy URL cfmtrackeprofilecfmum Alternate URL clientcealtcealtabhtml As western markets continue to struggle through high August demand and prices for both power and natural gas September looms as the start of the fall shoulder season The shoulder season historically has brought the possibility of a break in weather and a demand drop in both power and gas prices from summer levels CERA expects this shoulder season to differ from years past however with power and gas markets producing strong yearoveryear prices and little relief from summer levels even with normal September weather Westwide power loads will decline but will remain similar to those in June a month with high power prices In addition compared with June levels hydroelectric capacity has dropped owing to reduced stream flows leaving more expensive gasfired generation to replace declining hydroelectric output CERA expects occasional hot weather and higher gas prices to push onpeak prices in the West to percent over September levels Continued strong use of gasfired generation in the West as well as low US storage inventories and tight supply demand balances will keep the pressure on gas prices Topock prices are expected to average per million British thermal units MMBtu in September These high September gas and power prices are driven by Declining hydroelectric output The months of September through November represent the low point for hydroelectric output in the West with rainfall historically boosting output in December Approximately average megawatts aMW will be available from hydroelectric facilities during the threemonth period This represents a net reduction in capacity of aMW when compared with the recent JuneAugust summer months and a reduction of aMW when compared with September levels Higher more variable power demand The Southwest and Southern California still experience hot weather in September and regional utilities typically consider it possible that a years peak load event will occur in September Spiking loads however can quickly retreat with a return to cooler weather Thus power loads and power prices are expected to experience a high degree of variability during September High levels of gasfired generation Load growth and a declining hydroelectric resource base will require gasfired resources to serve approximately the same level of demand as in June a month with similar average demand and monthly average onpeak power prices in the per megawatthour MWh range depending on the region This strong pull on gasfired plants will push deep into the generation resource base driving prices upward An additional billion cubic feet Bcf per day will be required for gasfired generators in the US West compared with September levels Strong North American gas prices Natural gas prices are expected to retain most of this summers peak levels as North American supplies remain tight A market anxious about winter demand and price levels will also limit a price retreat this fall As a result average September Henry Hub prices are expected to trade around per MMBtu An active storm season could keep Henry Hub prices near the mark Strong western basis differentials The strong demand for gas to serve gasfired generation and storage concurrently will maintain western basis differentials at high levels especially in the California markets CERA expects a TopocktoHenry Hub differential of per MMBtu during September Extended operational problems associated with El Pasos pipeline rupture would raise that outlook Regional Power Market Drivers Hotterthannormal August weather transmission and generator outages high natural gas prices and declining hydroelectric output all contributed to a rise in power price levels during August Southern California average power prices in August have thus far exceeded July levels by an average of per MWh during the onpeak period and by per MWh during the offpeak period MidColumbia power prices bearing the brunt of fireinduced transmission outages experienced a jump from July price levels of per MWh for the onpeak period and per MWh in the offpeak period Offpeak prices which have averaged above per MWh during the JuneAugust period are clearly defined by the production cost of gasfired resources Onpeak prices during this same period at over per MWh in all regions in all months have reflected a significant premium at times over the cost of the marginal system generator see Table A return to normal weather should drive Westwide loads down by aMW in September from August levels However load growth and a return to normal weather are expected to push loads up by aMW when compared with September levels These greater loads coupled with a reduction in hydroelectric generation of aMW from last Septembers levels will create supply tightness during September see Tables and Hydroelectric coal and nuclear generation together will be insufficient to serve Westwide demand in September even during much of the offpeak periods requiring gasfired resources to meet a significant portion of the load Gas demand for power generation is expected to average Bcf per day in September down from over Bcf per day in August but up by a dramatic Bcf per day compared with levels in September September power prices will be defined by a floor set by the incremental cost of gasfired generation approximately per MWh with prices frequently higher as demand increases As this summer has clearly demonstrated prices rise in a nonlinear fashion as supplies grow very tight Hot weatherinduced loads should provide additional examples of this relationship Cooler or hotterthannormal weather in September coupled with the inherent high variability of September loads will produce a wide range of price outcomes Under normal weather onpeak power prices are expected to fall in the per MWh range depending on location representing a percent premium to yearago September prices see Figure The latest revision of the California Independent System Operators ISOs imbalance energy market cap down to per MWh is expected to depress market prices during any weather events in September CERA expects the ISO price cap to limit prices outside of California as well Pacific Northwest Although demand levels in the Pacific Northwest are expected to retreat in September by at least aMW compared with those in the hotterthannormal month of August the loss in available capacity from hydroelectric resources will amount to aMW over the same period see Table Thus the Pacific Northwest will be in an even more limited position to export power to other regions With transmission interties operating at below rated capacity during this period power prices in the Pacific Northwest will maintain their tight relationship with those in Northern California These price levels will continue to support the operation of the regions limited quantity of gasfired generation MidColumbia onpeak price levels are expected to average per MWh in September Offpeak power price levels in the Pacific Northwest will also receive a boost from the strong markets to the south The expected September level of per MWh represents the opportunity cost of power sales in surrounding markets California The fall months initiate a seasonal shift in price differentials that separates the West into markets that lie north of transmission Path and those to the south As in years past hydrodepleted Northern California should experience demand levels that must be served by generation resources within the region Exports from the Pacific Northwest dwindle and energy from the nuclear and coalrich Southwest is constrained from entering Northern California by Path import limitations This condition which is expected to persist from September through November allows Northern California to price at a premium The expected monthly average onpeak Northern California price of per MWh incorporates this dynamic Notably the California ISO is completing a process to remap the zones in California in part to capture locational price differences more effectively Southern California like the Southwest will typically experience hot weather episodes in September During these high demand periods prices will rise to peak levels as experienced this summer In addition California as a whole should see average loads in September that are aMW higher than those of September Occasional cooler weather will sharply but temporarily reduce daily prices Southern California benefits from the abundant export capacity of the Southwest during cooler weather in that region allowing prices to fall well below those in Northern California An per MWh differential between the north and south portions of the state is expected with Southern California onpeak prices averaging per MWh Offpeak prices of and per MWh for Northern and Southern California respectively reflect the continued need for gasfired resources to support September offpeak loads Rockies and Southwest An extended period of hot weather in July and August has boosted demand in the Rockies a region with growing saturation of residential air conditioning Limited transmission capacity and a dearth of cheaper exports from surrounding regions have allowed the Rockies to price temporarily at a premium to all other regions in the West A return to normal weather in September should restore the previously tight relationship of Rockies prices to those in the North Rockies prices are expected to fall with loads with a September monthly onpeak price average of per MWh and an offpeak price average of per MWh CERA expects Southwest prices to be tightly connected to prices in Southern California on a monthly average basis The two regions generally experience the same September weather patterns and a strong MW transmission link between the two market centers allows them to balance loads with each other Strong gas prices and occasional market tightnessinduced price runups will maintain onpeak prices at the per MWh level in September Offpeak prices will like those in Southern California be buoyed by the high cost of gasfired generation A price level of per MWh is expected for offpeak prices Regional Gas Market Drivers The summer competition for gas supply between power and storage continues in North America with gas prices reflecting the intensity of that competition Even as the summer power peak subsides in September across the United States the need to continue strong storage injections and the threat of storms in the Gulf will keep prices high and volatile The storage deficit now stands at approximately Bcf and US storage inventories look likely to head into winter at historically low levels This critical storage situation will keep prices high despite overall declines in power loads in September CERA expects a Henry Hub price of per MMBtu during September In the West strong power loads and the potential for power peaks persist through September especially in California Overall total demand for gas is expected to decline across the West from Bcf per day during August to Bcf per day during September see Table This load will tend to keep intraregional differentials wide throughout the West during the month The recent price disconnects between the supplyrich Rocky Mountains and San Juan Basin and demandcharged California will persist October should bring some change in this dynamic as heating loads in the Rockies begin to increase In general winter will bring a dramatic shift in regional pricing differentials throughout the West The summer pressure on Rocky Mountain supplies caused by high utilization rates on most export pipelines will be relieved somewhat by regional heating loads Declines in flows into the San Juan Basin from the Rockies will take some downward pressure off prices in the San Juan On the other hand healthy California storage inventories should limit price premiums at Topock through the heating season The startup of the new Alliance pipeline which will draw gas to the Midwest will support prices in the Pacific Northwest and California California Topock continues to be the premium pricing point in North America although differentials between Southern California and the Henry Hub subsided somewhat from peak levels near per MMBtu before this weekends pipeline explosion Total imports into California reached record levels during July total imports of Bcf per day eclipsed the previous high by million cubic feet MMcf per day see Table Pipeline capacity into the state during the month ran at percent utilization So far in August pipeline capacity utilization is exceeding even that high rate running at percent These high rates of capacity utilization are putting pressure on gas prices in Southern California and the pressure should continue during September Total demand in California is expected to decline somewhat during September but continued strong power loads and low seasonal hydroelectric generation will provide support Total demand in the state should average Bcf per day down only slightly from Augusts total of Bcf per day Flows into the state between August and September are not likely to change significantly but price pressure should decline somewhat with demand The Topock differential to the Henry Hub should average approximately per MMBtu for September see Table Storage inventories in the West are still healthy relative to levels in the rest of the United States but the storage surplus in the region has eroded In California inventories are running lower than last year and the deficit in the state looks likely to widen during September The end of injection season storage inventories will determine the vulnerability of Topock differentials to winter price spikes Pacific Northwest Malin prices this summer have shown neither the strong premiums that Topock prices have shown nor the wide discounts that supplies in the Rocky Mountains and San Juan Basins have shown So far this month prices at Malin are averaging a per MMBtu discount to the Henry Hub Pipeline capacity into the region from the Rocky Mountains is running nearly full flows on PGT out of Alberta have averaged nearly Bcf per day this month Export capacity out of the region on PGE GT NW is running close to capacity and pipeline constraints to the south combined with strong California demand are driving the wide MalintoTopock differentials Continuing strong demand in the South will likely keep Topock prices strong and the wide northsouth differentials within the West will likely hold through September In the Pacific Northwest demand is expected to climb through September to Bcf per day from Bcf per day in August This demand level should keep Malin differentials from widening from current levels For September CERA expects Malin prices to average per MMBtu below the Henry Hub price Southwest Prices in the San Juan Basin this summer have been left behind by rising California demand Although the westward pull on supplies is strong bottlenecks between California and the San Juan have led to disconnects between San Juan prices and Topock prices Pipeline capacity utilization rates on Transwestern and the northern leg of El Paso reached percent during July with less than MMcf per day of excess pipeline capacity Increased flows from the Rockies on TransColorado and Northwest are contributing to downward pressure on San Juan Basin supply and in general the San Juan has followed Rocky Mountain prices rather than following prices at Topock or the Permian Basin Unlike in the past two summers the bottleneck has not allowed power demand on the West Coast to support San Juan prices relative to Permian prices The differential between San Juan and Permian has averaged per MMBtu so far this month and per MMBtu since June Additional imports from the Rockies into the San Juan have increased supply by MMcf per day relative to last summer but these higher flows do not fully explain the disconnect Without much change in Southwestern or Rocky Mountains local demand the San Juan should continue to price at a wide discount during September The San JuantoHenry Hub differential is expected to average per MMBtu As in the Rockies differentials should narrow substantially in October Rocky Mountains Downward pressures on Rocky Mountain prices intensified over the past month as utilization rates on pipelines out of the region continued to climb Record heat and power generation levels have done little to boost gas demand within the region generation is still largely coalbased and the demand impact on gas of the additional load is minimal CERA expects the heavy discountcurrent Rocky MountaintoHenry Hub differentials are around per MMBtuto persist through September Local area demand is not expected to change during September Substantial gain in local demand comes in October with heating loads October demand should average Bcf per day up from August and September averages of around Bcf per day Although the winter heating season will relieve pipeline pressures in the Rockies winter differentials are expected to stay in the to per MMBtu range Strong storage inventories will limit the connection with broader North American markets this summer Next summer pressures on Rockies supplies will likely intensify relative to this summer Although pipeline expansion projects have been announcedTrailblazer and Williams announced expansion plans this summerthe new capacity will not be online to relieve constraints next summer CERA expects supplies within the Rocky Mountains to increase by MMcf per day next year Western Canada After widening to over US per MMBtu the AECOHenry differential has begun to narrow somewhat maintenance that has restricted flows has largely been responsible for the jump from per MMBtu in July With current supply able to fill the contracted pipe capacity and incremental volumes having to pay full cost to flow differentials are likely to persist in the midUSs per MMBtu for September AECO is expected to be US per MMBtu C per gigajoule for September Even with the startup of the Alliance project the contract nonrenewal on TransCanada is likely to continue the twotiered pricing dynamics of contracted versus uncontracted pipeline costs This will result in differentials that will range between US and US per MMBtu throughout the winter Supply build in western Canada continues to languish behind last years levels The pace of drilling over gas wells are expected this year should provide growth in the fourth quarter and into Supply is expected to be flat with on an annual basis for this year and up at least MMcf per day in Sumas prices have been quite volatile driven by both weather in the Pacific Northwest and maintenance on the Westcoast system For September Sumas is expected to be slightly more stable and to price at a modest premium to AECO of US per MMBtu end Follow URL for PDF version of this Monthly Briefing with associated graphic and tables CERAs Autumn Roundtable event dates and

Power by Pan Canadian We will look at the Oklahoma reserves for location and strategy with our pipewith the switch in ownership they may be receptive to strategy changes Lorna PanCanadian Says Montana Power Purchase Beautiful Fit To extend what it sees as dominance in Canadas natural gas market and to boost its production by PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd yesterday agreed to purchase Montana Power Co for million The properties will extend PanCanadians existing shallow gas properties in southern Alberta into northern Montana adding MMcfd and barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids The acquisition will give PanCanadian properties in Alberta Montana Colorado Oklahoma and Wyoming along with three gas pipelines linking Alberta and Saskatchewan to Montana We have a focus on natural gas said CEO David Tuer during a conference call yesterday in Calgary This is clearly our future It is difficult to put any negative on this acquisition and its likely to stay valuable for the foreseeable future Montana Powers production is more than natural gas and associated liquids and the acquisition substantially extends PanCanadians land and infrastructure allowing it to use its technology and operating strategies in a region that extends along the AlbertaMontana border The Montana Power assets clearly fit our strengths and allow us to employ our expertise in developing long life reserves of shallow and medium depth natural gas Tuer said The potential in these assets is significant and over the next few years we will add substantially to PanCanadians daily natural gas production Tuer said that the acquisition extends the companys dominance in shallow gas and called Montana Power a beautiful fit with PanCanadians gas strategy land position and technological capability PanCanadians newest acquisition adds reserves of Bcf and MM barrels of oil and natural gas liquids on a proven and onehalf probable basis said officials Production and reserves account for million of the purchase price while the remainder is made up of million for the midstream and marketing assets million for the undeveloped land about acres and million of working capital Tuer said the company was paying centsMcfe of proven and onhalf probable reserves The price for daily flowing production based on a ration of gas to BOE is Mcfe or BOE Along with the added Alberta and Montana properties PanCanadian also picks up some land in Colorados Denver Basin which now produces about MMcfd Other land that is part of the sale is located in the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma and the Green River Basin of Wyoming Three natural gas pipelines that cross from Montana into Alberta and Saskatchewan also are included The pipelines allow direct access to the US markets for southern Alberta and Saskatchewan gas and serve more than million net acres of developed and undeveloped lands with most of it concentrated in parcels that span the CanadaMontana border Midstream assets that go to PanCanadian include a natural gas marketing company in Butte MT along with a deep cut gas processing and fractionation plant in Colorado The Fort Lupton CO plant processes more than MMcfd and barrels of natural gas liquids and condensate In all the total developed and undeveloped land is roughly million net acres or million gross acres said PanCanadian Montana Power fit us like a glove Tuer said during the conference call He said the acquisition will help PanCanadian to remain best of class for what it does It makes our sandbox that much bigger The acquisition which is expected to close around Oct will increase both PanCanadians net income and cash flow this year and in subsequent years said Tuer The added gas production will immediately increase the companys natural gas as a percentage of total production to based on a ratio of gas to BOE About of the natural gas being acquired from Montana Power now is being sold to Montana Power utilities for to MMcf until July and because its priced below the open market officials think future earnings will be good As that contract expires theres a lot of potential from the price in this transaction Tuer said And whats to become of Montana Power Earlier this year the yearold company headquartered in Butte announced it would divest itself of four of its traditional energy businesses By selling its coal production natural gas transmission and distribution independent power production and oil and gas exploration and production businesses it plans to reinvest the proceeds in Touch America a fiber optics and telecommunications business which is also a subsidiary of Montana Power The process to determine the buyer for our oil and gas business was robust and we are delighted with the result said Montana Power CEO Robert P Gannon We believe there will be a meshing of business strategies and that cultural synergys exist between the purchased companies and Pan Canadian He noted that Montana Power has had a Canadian presence for almost years PanCanadian purchased the entire oil and gas division which now employs about PanCanadian plans to maintain a regional office in Butte invest in the acquired properties and grow daily gas production There was no word on whether any jobs would be lost

BriefingThe Pressure Cooker CERA Alert CERA Alert Sent Thu June Title Monthly BriefingThe Pressure Cooker Author N American Natural Gas Team EMail Category Alert Product Line North American Gas URL cfmtrackeprofilecfmum Pressure remains extremely strong in the United States gas market as three factorsincreasing power generation demand lower storage inventories and US wellhead supply still struggling to reboundcall into question the ability to build storage to a level adequate for next winter As strong as gas market fundamentals are gas prices are being supported also by concurrent strength in oil and liquids markets making traditional alternatives to gas much more expensive than in recent years In this environment intense competition between power generation demand and storage injections will continue throughout the summerwith pressure increasing into July as temperatures riseand gas will continue to price at the high levels necessary to discourage enduse demand The per million British thermal units MMBtu increase in gas prices since the beginning of May has already driven responses among end users First gas is now pricing at a slight premium to residual fuel oil on the East Coast and gas will likely lose approximately million cubic feet MMcf per day of demand to residual fuel oil this summer relative to last summer Second several ammonia manufacturing facilities have begun to shut down Equally telling however is that heat in any one region of the countrymost recently the Westis all that is required to sustain gas prices above at the Henry Hub despite relatively moderate temperatures elsewhere and demand reductions in industrial and other power markets Underlying pressures are such that prices are likely to rise on average from current levels as higher temperatures arrive For these reasons CERA expects prices to average at the Henry Hub during July see Table and even greater volatility is possible The intense competition and need to price out enduse demand mean that the market is vulnerable to spikes above per MMBtu amid heat waves this summer Gas StorageInjections Increase but Little Relief Yet The gas market experienced a small measure of relief in early June as storage injections finally reached a pace closer to historical averages with the American Gas Association AGA reporting billion cubic feet Bcf of injections during each of the weeks ending June and However these injections did little to reduce a deficit that is now close to Bcf on a yearoveryear basis and conditions may not again be as favorable as they have been recently for injections for many weeks or even months to come As temperatures rise through the end of the month injections are likely to slow so that for June CERA expects an average injection rate of approximately Bcf per day The deficit that stood at an estimated Bcf as of the end of May see Table on an inventory level of approximately Bcf is expected to rise slightly during June to Bcf despite a healthy injection rate for the first nine days of the month With US wellhead supply still running an estimated to Bcf per day below yearearlier levels and with added imports from Canada just offsetting this decline even the moderate demand growth expected for July relative to last July will make reducing the deficit a difficult task Each month in which this Bcf deficit carries forward increases the likelihood that inventories will be at their lowest maximum ever this October Injections like those in the recent two weeks would have to continue into July for this pattern to reverse in a significant way an unlikely event that would occur only under very mild weather conditions Regional Markets With the exception of the Rocky Mountains western differentials have been supported by waves of hot weather and extremely strong gas demand for power generation within the region This strong demand is pulling supplies from the Permian and San Juan Basins to the West Coast and has pushed up capacity utilization on the Southwest pipelines into California Prices at the California border have been particularly strong averaging over a premium to the Henry Hub so far this month Continued strong western demand looks likely to support prices within the region through July as power loads remain strong and hydroelectric output declines In addition the early heat waves have begun to erode the California storage surplus although inventories in the region as a whole remain strong see Table CERAs outlook by region follows Rockies Continuing strong supply growth and low seasonal demand have pushed up exports out of the Rocky Mountains region High utilization rates on export pipelines will keep Rocky Mountain differentials wide during the rest of the summer CERA expects an average July differential to the Henry Hub of per MMBtu San Juan The pull on supplies from California has narrowed the differential between the San Juan Basin and the Henry Hub and this West Coast pull looks likely to remain strong through the summer CERA expects a differential between the San Juan Basin and the Henry Hub of per MMBtu during July Permian and MidContinent As Texas power loads increase the competition from the West Coast and Texas markets for Permian supplies should intensify Permian differentials which have been averaging around per MMBtu to the Henry Hub should narrow CERA expects a per MMBtu differential for July MidContinent supplies should price just below Permian supplies at an per MMBtu differential to the Henry Hub Chicago Chicago differentials continue to trade around per MMBtu to the Henry Hub and although hot weather and climbing demand within the region could put some upward pressure on those differentials ample seasonal pipeline capacity into the region will limit pressure CERA expects a July differential of per MMBtu Northeast New York citygate differentials have a higher floor this summer namely higher fuel costs from the Gulf Coast as a result of gas The result has been differentials above from Transco Station but closer to from the Henry Hub As power generation load reaches its peak however differentials can rise even in summer Shortlived power load peaks may lift weekly New York differentials into the s but for the month of July CERA expects the New York differential to average Canadian MarketsDemand Still Down Canadian demand continues to be down on a yearoveryear basis Volumes on TransCanada Pipeline are MMcf below levels at this time last year and Alberta demand is MMcf below both of these reductions are primarily storage related Weak storage injections driven in large part by the lack of an adequate summerwinter price spread continue to place inventories further behind levels Although inventories are still well above the fiveyear average unless injections increase it is more likely that endofseason inventories will be comparable to the fiveyear average Bcf rather than to levels Bcf Export volumes continue to be slightly higher than last year Thus far in June flows on Northern Border Pipeline are similar to while PGE GTNW is currently operating MMcf higher Demand on the West Coast is expected to continue this trend for the summer Alberta supply build for June is likely to be flat with levels An outage pattern similar to last years has emerged TCENOVA has had maintenance projects ongoing in June but the supply reduction is primarily the result of plant turnarounds Thus far in June reductions in supply because of maintenance have been as high as MMcf but should average MMcf for the month Even though June is expected to be flat yearoveryear the fact that this maintenance reduction is less than maintenance reductions implies that a return to supply growth has not yet occurred Supply is still expected to start showing growth in the second half of the year largely in the fourth quarter as a result of the increased level of drilling The annual average supply is expected to be around MMcf per day higher than in as the result of the return to growth in Alberta and modest growth in British Columbia again primarily later in the year as well as the new production from Ft Liard that is now onstream The NYMEX and Henry Hub price strength is being felt in Canada AECO is expected to average C per gigajoule GJ US per MMBtu for June with a differential in the low USs July is expected to average C per GJ US per MMBtu The HenrytoAECO differential is likely to remain relatively high until storage injections increase the demand Follow URL for PDF version of this Monthly Briefing with associated tables end

selling test gas in ramp up period Right now these first deliveries are going into the ANR system because it is the only interconnect that is ready Alliance Delayed But Deliveries Begin Ramping Up After months of speculation in the industry Alliance Pipeline confirmed yesterday full commercial service will be delayed nearly a month until Oct When construction of the system was scheduled nearly three years ago Oct was the target date for commercial service However the delay doesnt mean the market wont be getting any Canadian gas out of Alliance until the end of October The pipeline opened one of its Chicago delivery valves last Thursday and started selling MMcfd of gas into the market It intends to increase its sales each week eventually reaching its full Bcfd load prior to switching to commercial service on Oct said spokesman Jack Crawford We got Commission approval to actually sell our test gas Right now I think we are dealing with three or four different marketers Our initial deliveries right now are into the ANR system Thats because its basically the only connection that is ready but over the next few weeks we expect they will all be ready to go and we will test them all Id be surprised if it ends up being regular volume increases of MMcfd each week but thats kind of the game plan said Crawford On Oct it will be Alliance selling Bcfd of test gas and on Oct it will be shippers nominating at one end and delivering at the other The market may not see much of a difference We obviously dont want to start charging our shippers until we have the confidence that all the systems have been checked out The pipeline system is designed to deliver gas from producing regions of northeastern British Columbia and northwestern Alberta to the Chicago area where the line interconnects with the North American pipeline grid Currently more than of the total pipeline system has been installed including mainline compressor stations receipt points in British Columbia and Alberta and delivery points in Illinois Commissioning activities commenced in March including the flowing of gas into the completed sections of line to purge air from the pipe At present approximately of Alliance has been purged of air This includes all the mainline portion of the system miles from near Gordondale Alberta to the delivery section near Joliet Illinois and of mile laterals receipt portion of the system Additionally receipt point meter stations have been commissioned Final commissioning activities are also being completed at mainline compressor stations To date Bcf of gas is in the commissioned mainline and lateral portions of the system with the ultimate line pack targeted at Bcf Crawford said there were a variety of factors that contributed to the delayed startup The rain in Saskatchewan delayed us a bit back in July but we managed to catch up on the construction there in August But it then meant that some of our commissioning didnt get going until a little bit later Farther west in Alberta and BC in fact weve had a couple of rain problems In particular we have one relatively small but fairly long lateral that we havent even been able to get on the right of way yet and thats because of rain Up in BC weve been having trouble with a directional drill of a creek on one of our laterals up there he said Were likely to get approval to opencut that creek but that will take us probably the better part of a month On the downstream end we had hoped to get more of our downstream connections right now We are testing one but some of the others arent quite ready yet Were ready but they are not Then of course there is a fairly complex interaction between the pipeline and the Aux Sable liquids plant We havent had a chance to work on that yet So when you look at all of those things the question was when could we establish a date when all this stuff would be done and we would be operational We spent a fair amount of time with our shippers and they mentioned one other pipeline that was being delayed one day at a time drove them to distraction We agreed we would pick one of three dates all Mondays Oct Oct or Oct and we just had to pick one that we felt confident in Besides the timing of service there has been another important question on the minds of many market observers Will the gas Alliance ships come Oct be incremental gas or gas that would have been flowing through TransCanada I dont think its going to be purely either way said Crawford Lots of guys are targeting for Nov to bring their new gas on to start the gas year so it all depends on how much shows up Its not a big secret that weve had some wet weather and some of the drilling and completion work hasnt gotten done Thats likely to have some affect on it as well Thats a delay though How long are people going to pay for gas Boy people are going to have a lot of money for drilling and projects

Author N American Natural Gas Team EMail Category Alert Product Line North American Gas URL cfmtrackeprofilecfmuDmD Alternative URL clientnagaltnagaltabhtml As the heating season approaches a highbut justifiedlevel of anxie ty regarding winter supplies is driving the gas market As things stand the market is headed into the winter exposed to a supply shortfall late in the winter even under normal weather conditions This prospect has placed a floor on the ga s price at the price of residual fuel oil itself priced in the mid to upper s range Gas prices moving into this range would begin to attract demand back into the market diverting supplies from storage and increasing supply concerns again To the upside there is little demand response to price until industrial demand lessens or the price of distillate oil as of this writing near per million British thermal units MMBtu is breached However distillate markets themselves are extremely tight and prices for that fuel would likely follo w gas prices up Within this range prices are defined mainly by supply anxiety the markets judgment of the likelihood of a supply shortfall which would b e characterized by extreme pricing and volatility and a difficult process of supply allocation by price By now exposure to extreme price volatility this winter is certain Althou gh CERA expects storage injections to increase by approximately billion cu bic feet Bcf per day from August to September this increase would still leav e inventories at record lows for this month and next Even this increase in injections will not occur if a tropical storm forces evacuation of offshore platforms or if hot weather returns For October heating load enters the picture With US supplies running clos e to yearearlier levels and imports slightly higher demand priced out of the market will remain the key reason that storage injections increase at all from las t years low level As a result although prices may close the month of September in the upper s per MMBtu at the high end of the competitive range with resid any threat of interruption in supplies will quickly bounce prices upward during the remainder of September or in October As the heating season begins therefore CERA expects the reality of supply vulnerability for the winter to result in the first ever monthly average price of at the Henry Hub s ee Table and the first of potentially many months at or above that price Gas StorageNew Record Lows CERA estimates that storage inventories in the United States crossed into record low territory as of the end of August when inventories of Bcf fell below the previous record low of Bcf see Table More records will likely be broken in the coming months and by widening margins Injections for September are expected to average Bcf per day an increase of Bcf p er day from the August level but below last years pace of Bcf per day CERAs September estimate could be exceeded under mild weather condition s with no tropical activity hitting the Gulf of Mexico but injections would likely fall below the Bcf per day rate should storm activity force evacuation of platforms This rate would leave US inventories at Bcf at months end a record low by Bcf For October CERA expects a slight increase in the injection rate from last year Injections of Bcf per day on average this year would be enabled by dema nd priced out of the market and by a lack of unusually cool weather or tropica l storm activity October injections have varied historically from Bcf pe r day to Bcf per day Even if injections reached toward the upp er end of this range the market would remain exposed to shortfalls during the winter At the expected injection rate US inventories of Bcf at the end of October would result in an end of March inventory level of Bcf und er normal winter weather Bcf below the previous record low of Bcf Regional MarketsWaiting for Winter The pipeline explosion on El Paso during late August intensified the subregional pressures already at play in western gas markets Cuts in pipeline flows limited access into California on the only pipeline route into the state with any excess capacity The lack of supply pressured prices within the supply basins and forced strong storage withdrawals in the California market Although summer power loads in California will ease and much of the El Paso capacity has be en restored the race to improve storage positions before the onset of winter heating load will keep intense pressure on Topock prices Differentials in the rest of the West will strengthen as local heating loads begin to absorb enough supply t o ease pipeline bottlenecks see Table Differentials in the East which have traded in a narrow range this summer will likely reach slightly higher levels with the start of the heating season in October However exposure to pricing disconnects will remain low until later this year CERAs outlook by region follows Rockies Pipeline bottlenecks out of the Rocky Mountains this summer should begin to ease as heating loads climb during October CERA expects that as local demand limits pressure on pipeline capacity differentials will narrow October differentials should average per MMBtu San Juan The resumption of flows on El Pasos southern system combined with production outages has relieved some of the access constraints on San Juan supply Seasonal declines in Rockies to Southwest flows and the beginning of the heating season should narrow October differentials to per MMBtu Permian and MidContinent The continuing pull on supplies from the West will support Permian prices and the Midwestern pull on supplies will support MidContinent prices CERA expects a differential to the Henry Hub of per MMBtu for MidContinent supplies and per MMBtu for Permian supplies Chicago The delay in the inservice date for Alliance from October to October will take some gas out of the Chicago market next month This delay combined with the need to build Midwest storage inventories should sustain the recent increase in differentials from the range to above per MMBtu CERA expects October differentials at the Chicago citygate to average Northeast markets Gas prices near have increased the fuel cost of delivery from the Gulf Coast into the Northeast raising the floor level for differentials to near per MMBtu The beginning of the heating season and the lack of new capacity into the New York citygate should support differentials above the floor during October at near per MMBtu Canadian MarketsOutages Affect Supply Outages have affected supply thus far in September Both British Columbia a nd Alberta have been affected resulting in a further yearoveryear decline i n Western Canadian supply The various problems appear to be rectified but t he average supply for the month is likely to be down to million cubic feet MMcf per day from September Drilling has been adversely affected over the past several weeks by wet weather but rig utilization is beginning to climb again to previous levels More th an gas wells are expected for this year Slight Drop in Export Demand Eastern Canadian demand is still down approximately MMcf per day with

youll know The natural gas market is a real success story FERC has gotten an enormous amount of things right The market may not be unblemished but there are lots who consider the natural gas market the best market in the world offering genuine price discovery on a daily basis across dozens of products Its something everyone should be proud of Robert Levin of the New York Mercantile Exchange told a FERC conference yesterday The natural gas market has performed remarkably admirably through a range of market conditions with hundreds if not thousands of market participants using an extraordinary selection of market instruments Levin continued adding that the Commission should be supporting the growth and increased sophistication of commerce Youre at that point now Warning against socalled solutions offered by some at the daylong conference to increase liquidity or tie the natural gas market to the electric market Levin cautioned liquidity cannot be legislated Dont overreact The electric market is poorly regulated Remedies from the natural gas market should be transferred to the electric market rather than allow the gas market to be corrupted by the regulatory mistakes of the electric market Rather than worry over regulating an hourly market for natural gas change the electric market which Levin believes has developed its overemphasis on the hourly market because of the artificial tilt toward the spot market But while Levin warned against too much market meddling others among the more than representatives of the industry and its customers testifying at FERCs conference on competitive natural gas markets argued for a variety of initiatives to increase market liquidity by changing the rules for pipeline transportation Eliminating the shippermusthavetitle rule promoting expansion of the existing pipeline infrastructure especially in the Northeast doing away with straightfixvariable SFV rate design review of firmtowellhead rates in the production region and the allocation of transportation costs between the upstream and downstream were among the chief proposals proffered by mostly pipeline customers However greater gas market liquidity shouldnt be confused with increased competition in pipeline transportation municipals and producers told FERC staff during a postOrder technical conference Wednesday Were concerned the Commission may be equating market liquidity with competition in pipeline transportation The two are not the same said Arthur Corbin on behalf of the American Public Gas Association APGA which represents municipal gas distributors Even with greater and greater market liquidity monopoly power exists in the pipeline transportation segment Captive shippers will always require a regulated transportation service from any hub to their citygate he said Much the same holds true for LDCs noted Bruce Henning director of energy practices for Energy and Environmental Analysis Inc EEA who represented the American Gas Association AGA at the Commission staff conference He agreed market liquidity has improved immeasurably but he added theres not a liquid market center at every pipeline receipt or delivery point location Nor is there likely to be market centers in all of these locations in the near future Consequently Henning said FERC will need to continue to protect producers from market power that accompanies limited access to pipelines The daylong conference held yesterday in Washington DC was the first of several that FERC staff plans to hold to explore the impact of the Commissions transportation policies on the development of gas markets Christopher A Helms president and COO of Panhandle Pipeline Companies urged FERC not to enact policy changes that would place commodity market liquidity as the ultimate goal at the expense of the transportation market Helms said he advocated policies encouraging pipeline expansions and construction of optimal amounts of additional capacity to meet the needs of the market The single most important characteristic for liquidity in the natural gas commodity markets is the availability of adequate transportation capacity Charles Daverio vice president of KeySpan Corp echoed that sentiment saying FERC could increase liquidity in the New York City market and elsewhere in the Northeast by promoting construction of new pipeline capacity to ensure adequate supplies for the region yearround This would reduce energy costs and enhance reliability he noted Panhandles Helms also cautioned against policy changes that would force the development of new market centers and hubs Market centers should be allowed to develop at their own pace and at locations where the market sees fit he said EEAs Henning estimated more than liquid and transparent market centers exist today which permit industry participants to buy and sell gas daily under extremely competitive conditions He said hes confident more will be added because of the options that they provide to gas customers As another way to enhance liquidity KeySpans Daverio as well as others supported eliminating the shippermusthavetitle rule which requires the customer to retain title to the gas while its being shipped Doing away with the rule would pave the way for the development of new pipeline products and services such as operational balancing and virtual storage he told the FERC staff But Dena Wiggins an attorney with the DC law firm of Sutherland Asbill Brennan LLP which represents the Process Gas Consumers Group industrial gas customers said her group was very concerned about efforts to repeal the rule I havent heard anything yet today that satisfies the concerns that we might have She noted the Commission already has granted exceptions to the shippermusthavetitle rule in certain cases and should continue with this policy where necessary Moreover Wiggins said industrial customers were increasingly worried about the mounting market power of unregulated companies especially gas marketers At the conference she also expressed her groups dismay with the pipeline compliance filings with Order particularly on the penalty issue Rather than an improved penalty structure pipelines are proposing higher penalties Wiggins said We continue to be shocked at the absolute wholesale departures from BPs Jeff Holligan also waded into the fight against all the new services outlined by pipelines in their Order filings which he said were nothing more than penalties disguised as balancing services that customers cant refuse He urged the Commission to check with a pipelines customers noting one proposed new service is opposed by of the pipelines nonaffiliated customers Some of the proposed services Holligan said add up to nothing more than degradation of existing longterm firm service Holligan representing the largest producer in the US and Canada joined other market participants in urging adoption of standardized allocation sales standardized penalty levels and the requirement that all pipelines implement a uniform title transfer tracking process In short standardizing pipeline services certainly on an individual pipeline and also to a large extent between and across pipelines is imperative if markets are to be highly liquidIndividually negotiated services where every service is a different service or the adoption of a socalled dual track market are the antithesis of a highly liquid efficient and competitive gas market Standardization of operational terms of pipeline service is necessary to facilitate trading through ecommerce The Commission should be striving to commoditize pipeline capacity so it can be traded along with gas electronically Holligan said

would like to listen in at the Houston location Lorna Dear CERA Members and Friends Are oil companies leaving money on the table in their use of benchmark crude prices What can be done to lower the risk in these potentially harmful calculations One of Cambridge Energy Research Associates CERA core businesses has been benchmark crude oil price analysis In our new multiclient study The Hole in the Barrel CERA goes beyond our benchmark price analyses to analyze the structure of the market itself We argue the limits and real economic losses that can result from misunderstanding these prices specifically the Brent benchmark in oil company financial calculations and strategic planning the magnitude of which can be significant often amounting to dollars not cents per barrel As an introduction to this new study we would like to invite you to participate in this complementary multimedia conference call and web presentation on October With the current volatility and high levels of energy prices this conference call will bring clarity to these important and relevant issues To enroll for the call please RSVP to or and reference the Confirmation Code in order to participate in the call In this detailed study CERA looks at what people really mean when they talk about the oil price As part of the study we Analyze each of the five contracts that make up the Brent market and consider their longterm future given the steady decline of wet barrels including how other price markers might evolve Outline how oil companies have more discretion to raise revenues for a given volume of production than is generally appreciated Examine each of the three components that make up oil prices absolute price level time and grade differentials to show where revenue is being lost and what can be done to add it back again Assess the management control issues associated with any market activity and conclude that the risks of dealing are significant but not overwhelming especially in comparison to the underlying and increasing price risk that they help to manage In this evolving New World while trading may or may not be good for you not understanding the market can be fatal CONFERENCE CALL TOPICS Brent Blend as a price benchmark for a significant proportion of internationally traded crude oils The fitness for purpose of each of the five interwoven but separate

feet Tcf by the end of the month The headroom for price is much greater as distillate oil the next substitute for gas should gas prices rise is itse lf in short supply Shutdowns of industrial facilities represent an important increment of demand resistance as gas prices rise and neither switching to distillate n or shutting down production comes easily or cheaply Time is running out before the heating season begins and the market remain s justifiably on edge upward volatility remains much more likely than any significant settling in price As a result CERA expects natural gas prices to be sustained in the mids averaging at the Henry Hub during November see Table More lucka great deal morewould be required to restore a measure of calm to the gas market Gas StorageThe Final Push October storage injections have varied historically from Bcf to approximately Bcf per day in the United States and this year CERA expects them to averag e Bcf per day a moderate level for the month see Table The reporting of injections of Bcf during the week ending October precipitated a increase in futures prices but this rate is actually above average for the first full week of October With the beginning of consistent heating load late this month CERA expects a slowing of injections resulting in an endofOctober inventory of Bcfmore tha n Bcf below the previous record low for the end of October CERA expects that many storage holdershaving begun the winter with record low inventorieswill preserve inventories to the extent possible during Novemb er However normal weather this year would drive a substantial rebound in heating load from last years level and would require added storage withdrawals whic h CERA estimates will average Bcf per day this year Withdrawals at that pace or even substantially slower as occurred during and will keep inventories on a trajectory to hit record lows by the end of March Low storage inventories will remain a major source of price support requiring that demand continue to b e priced out of the gas market and keeping gas prices above those of residual fuel oil Regional MarketsWinter Rules The transition to winter pricing relationships is under way and the start of winter heating demand in the West has narrowed differentials between the supplyri ch Rocky Mountains and the Henry Hub Local demand for Rockies supply has also eased pressure on San Juan Basin prices and CERA expects differentials between both regions and the Henry Hub to continue to narrow through November In t he Northeast differentials will begin to widen with the onset of winter with the magnitude of the differentials depending on early winter weather The onset of flows on Alliance will limit increases in the Chicago differential during Novembe r see Table CERAs outlook by region follows Rockies Earlyseason cold has narrowed Rockies to Henry Hub differentials so far this month Ample supplies within the Rockies will mean volatile pricing relationships through the end of October and early November depending on heating load but in general strong regional demand will keep differentials well below the per MMBtu summer level CERA expects a per MMBtu differential to the Henry Hub during November San Juan The increase in local heating demand in the Rockies will continue to ease pressure on San Juan prices by limiting flows south out of the Rockies San Juan differentials should follow the same relationships as Rockies prices with general narrowing but continued volatility through November CERA expects an average San Juan differential of per MMBtu for November Permian and MidContinent Tight relationships between the Permian Basin and MidContinent and the Henry Hub should continue through November with some slight widening in the MidContinent basis differential expected when Alliance flows commence CERA expects differentials of per MMBtu and per MMBtu respectively Chicago The beginning of service via the Alliance Pipeline during November is the focus of most attention in the Chicago citygate market However the demand rebound that would result from normal November weather this year would offset most of the added supplies As a result Chicago differentials will average in the per MMBtu range even when Alliance flows commence although delay of the Vector Pipeline will keep much of the new gas in the Midwest CERA expects average November Chicago differentials of per MMBtu Northeast markets Normal weather would drive a substantial rebound in New York citygate prices from yearearlier levels but there is little added delivery capacity into that market CERA expects New York to price above the Henry Hub during November well above the current low o mids Canadian MarketsSupply Growth Still Uncertain The supply build is uncertain at this time because flows on Alliance are uncertain A line pack of between and Bcf has been established and modest flows of million cubic feet MMcf per day have been initiated to test and commissio n the pipeline The startup is still slated for November but the unknown quantities of gas that are flowing on a daytoday basis are making it difficult to asses s precisely the volume of supply being produced At this time it appears that October is on par with The current expectation is for over well completions in approximately of which are expected to be gas wells Even if the shallow trend does not change substantially the sheer number of wells is still expected to produce a supply build by yearend and into For the total western suppl y build is expected to be flat with to slightly negative increasing to positive growth of MMcf per day in Demand Slow but Exports Up TransCanada flows are still down averaging about MMcf per day less in October than the yearearlier levels Storage injections in the East have accelerated eastern inventories are expected to be above last years levels at the e nd of October Storage injections in the West however have dwindled revising the expect ed storage inventories to be even with the fiveyear average but below levels PGE GTNW volumes have declined in October and are expected to be slightly below levels by MMcf per day in November as well Northern Bord er Pipeline is running about MMcf per day above October but is expecte d to be slightly below levels in November Coolerthannormal weather has push ed western Canadian demand up slightly but does not offset the lower eastern Canadian demand High Prices Wide Differentials The AECOHenry differential has leveled off in the upper USs to low USs and is expected to remain

Prices CERA Alert CERA Alert Sent Fri June Title New Peaks New Prices Author Zenker Moritzburke Snyder EMail Category Alert Product Line Western Energy URL cfmtrackeprofilecfmum In the West July typically marks the start of the summer cooling season which along with waning hydroelectric energy production and the more frequent use of gasfired generators to meet demand causes steadily rising power prices CERA expects the West to be the only region in North America with a yearoveryear increase in peak electricity demand Power prices already established new record highs in June suggesting that as demand reaches its peak during the coming summer months western power markets will continue to experience increased volatility compared with last years levels The convergence of natural gas prices that are much higher than last years levels growing demand for power and reduced hydroelectric energy production when compared with levels in is pushing up western power prices Merchant and other gasfired generators will be pressed into service experiencing their strongest utilization rates since the drought year of Greater utilization of gasfired generators within the West has supported western differentials and contributed to high gas prices throughout North America Western gas prices should continue to be strong boosted by continuing increases in regional gas demand for power generation and pressure across North America to inject gas into storage in anticipation of summer power loads The main drivers of higher power and gas prices when compared with yearearlier levels will be Peak WSCC load season Summer weather will drive loads to the years coincident peak which is most likely to occur during the JulyAugust period but could arrive any time during the June through October airconditioning season CERA expects demand growth of percent in the third quarter compared with levels in which will push Western Systems Coordinating Council WSCC coincident peak demand levels to percent over levels Waning hydroelectric output Hydroelectric production is on its normal downward seasonal slide This resource decline is more visible when compared with the hydro season which was both abundant and prolonged High utilization rates for gasfired generators Growing demand for electricity coupled with a declining availability of hydroelectric energy will drive utilization rates of gasfired power plants to their highest levels since the drought year of Higher fuel prices Western gas prices have remained at per MMBtu above levels Growing yearoveryear gas demand for power generation is providing much of the price pressure in western markets These higher gas prices provide a boost to both onpeak and offpeak power prices of between and per megawatthour MWh Regional Power Market Drivers Power markets in the West are poised to break records for demand peak load and gasfired plant utilization and as a result power prices A return to normal summer weather coupled with growing demand for power will push demand for electricity up by gigawatthours GWh in the US West for the third quarter compared with levels or almost megawatts MW on average see Table This growth in the demand for electricity will also drive peak loads to new highs CERA expects the WSCC coincident peak to be exceeded by percent climbing to nearly MW As was demonstrated by the mild summer of deviations from normal weather could boost or thwart this peak demand growth figure Two key factors will significantly reduce third quarter hydroelectric production levels compared with levels First CERA expects Westwide total season hydroelectric production in of roughly percent of historical average levels substantially lower than the approximately percent of average in Second runoff was prolonged in serving to push a substantial portion of the hydroelectric production into the summer period see Figure On average CERA expects these factors will remove GWh or almost average megawatts aMW from the western resource base compared with levels Exacerbating this decline refilling of reservoirs and flow restrictions to assist fish migration will cause periodic but significant curtailments in power production at key Pacific Northwest hydroelectric facilities Natural gasfired facilities will be called upon to supply most of the expected increase in demand while also replacing hydroelectric resources as they continue to decline This will push average annual utilization rates of gasfired combined cycle steam and cogeneration plants to approximately percent in levels not experienced since the percent annual average utilization rate in a year marked by drought and warmerthannormal summer weather Utilization rates for these facilities will also surge past levels especially this summer CERA anticipates a Westwide third quarter utilization rate of percent for these facilities under normal summer weather conditions compared with percent for the same period of This level of utilization will certainly establish gasfired generation as the floor to power prices during the third quarter during not only the onpeak demand period but the offpeak as well With natural gas prices at per MMBtu higher than levels power prices are boosted by per MWh owing to fuel price increases alone With supply tightness already evident in western power markets the stage is set for increased price volatility compared with levels as episodes of hot weather require increased utilization of lessefficient generators throughout this summer Pacific Northwest The water supply forecast for the Columbia River remains near average but has dropped a couple percentage points from last month Flows are expected to remain at roughly percent of average through September on the Lower Columbia and percent of average on the Upper Columbia Conditions overall are still sufficient to be considered average This return to normal conditions in the Pacific Northwest should produce hydroelectric output nearly GWh percent lower than last year for July and GWh lower for the third quarter as a whole see Table The regions load growth coupled with lower hydro supply will continue to elevate power prices in the Pacific Northwest relative to levels Tighter supply conditions in California and the Southwest will attract energy exports from the Pacific Northwest preserving a differential between the Pacific Northwest and California of about per MWh on average Price differentials between the Pacific Northwest and California have varied dramatically recently with the north at times rising above those to the south owing to local demand and hydroelectric constraints caused by reservoir filling operations Since the end of May volatility in both markets has pushed the difference between daily onpeak prices at COB and those in California from a premium of per MWh to a discount of per MWh within a few days CERA expects that over the long run California markets will clear at a premium as the summer progresses but the differential will vary widely with episodes of Pacific Northwest power pricing at a premium to those in California California Despite belowaverage precipitation and snowpack this year California reservoir storage levels throughout the state are higher than normal ranging between and percent of average for the states primary runoff regions Under these conditions hydroelectric output should be roughly percent GWh below last years levels for the third quarter see Table With a return to normal weather conditions relative to third quarter cooling demand this summer will increase most in California where weather was nearly percent cooler than average last year Recent dayahead power prices in California have drawn attention to the West as the highestcost market if only temporarily in North America Record high temperatures and unscheduled unit outages produced new dayahead price records with power prices on June at per MWh in the dayahead onpeak market and realtime hourly prices at the market cap of per MWh Increased utilization of gasfired generation and daily gas prices of around per MMBtu burnertip in Southern California have kept daily average offpeak prices between and per MWh Notably these higher price have occurred during periods when roughly MW more coalfire generation was available in the West compared with the same period in CERA expects prices to continue to respond to the tight capacity environment this summer Rockies and Southwest During summer the RockiesSouthwest was the only region to experience aboveaverage cooling demand suggesting that normal weather should bring only moderate demand growth of less than percent see Table However growing energy demand in neighboring regions and a large transmission transfer capability will pull energy from the RockiesSouthwest region when excess capacity is available ensuring that prices in the region will remain tightly connected to price levels in other parts of the West Palo Verde prices have generally kept pace with other western markets while maintaining their characteristic premium to the California Power Exchange during spring and early summer CERA expects Southwest prices to strengthen relative to California when summer weather periodically shifts the locus of demand to the Southwest However California prices will maintain a premium on average to those in the Southwest as the effects of the states tight supply situation translates to higher prices than those in either the Southwest or Pacific Northwest Regional Gas Market Drivers Under continuing pressure to inject gas into storage in the face of declining supply and increasing gas demand for power generation gas prices at the Henry Hub are expected to average per MMBtu in July The strong demand for gas for power generation will keep differentials strong in the southern half of the West In the Rockies pipeline constraints will keep differentials wide The heightened call on gas demand for power generation driven by the declining hydroelectric generation and increasing power loads is expected to drive demand increases of Bcf per day relative to July and MMcf per day relative to June demand levels Gas demand for power generation is expected to reach a monthly average record level of Bcf per day in July see Tables and These increases will result in declines in western storage injection rates and in exports from the West Both Permian and San Juan supplies will be pulled increasingly toward the West Coast during July Low storage inventories and needed increases in injections are driving North American gas pricing The West is the one US region actually running a storage surplus but the recent heat waves and associated pull on gas supplies have eroded that surplus particularly in California see Table Given the expected increases in gas demand the western surplus should continue its decline This decline and very high demand will reinforce the volatility in differentials already evident this summer California Because of the early hot weather in the West and strong gas demand for power generation Topock prices have been extremely high and volatile So far this month Topock has averaged over per MMBtu above the Henry Hub Flows on El Paso and Transwestern into California increased by over million cubic feet MMcf per day during June relative to May averages and flows are expected to continue to climb by an additional MMcf per day during July PGT continues to run near capacity see Table At the same time the storage levels within California look likely to fall below last years levels sometime during the month This intense demand pressureCalifornia demand should increase by nearly MMcf per day in July relative to Junewill keep utilization rates on import pipelines high and sustain Topock differentials CERA expects the Topock to Henry Hub differential to average per MMBtu during July see Table This high differential will likely persist through the summer with differentials rising above per MMBtu during West Coast heat waves Southwest San Juan price differentials have been volatile narrowing during periods of very high western demand However a very high utilization rate on pipeline capacity into California has widened the TopockSan Juan differential and that wide gap is expected to persist On average San Juan differentials to the Henry Hub are expected to narrow from current levels as southwestern demand increases with western temperatures Demand in the Southwest is expected to climb from Bcf per day in June to Bcf per day in July This increased call on regional supplies and an expected strengthening in Permian prices should result in an average San Juan differential to the Henry Hub of per MMBtu In the Permian Basin prices are expected to strengthen as Texas power demand climbs Combined with the pull on supplies from the West Permian differentials should narrow from their current levels of per MMBtu to below per MMBtu Pacific Northwest Strong June hydroelectric output has limited the call on gas supplies in the Pacific Northwest so far this summer but as hydroelectric output decreases in June and July gas demand will increase dramatically CERA expects an increase of nearly MMcf per day during July relative to June levels The limited demand so far has meant differentials between Malin and the Henry Hub of as much as per MMBtu and Topock to Malin differentials of over per MMBtu The Malin to Henry Hub differential has narrowed slightly to around per MMBtu It should continue to strengthen with growth in regional demand and average per MMBtu during July Rocky Mountains Regional gas supply within the Rocky Mountains continues to increase bolstered by continuing growth in the Powder River Basin This April exports out of the Rockies reached Bcf per day a record high Although there is excess pipeline capacity out of the region into the Southwest on the Transcolorado and Northwest pipelines high utilization rates have widened Rockies differentials with the rest of the West In particular Rockies to San Juan differentials have averaged nearly per MMBtu for June after pricing close to parity earlier in the year That gap should persist through the summer as gasfired generation climbs across the rest of the West Demand is expected to average the same level in July as in June in the Rocky Mountains where coal limits gass gains in power generation CERA expects prices within the Rockies to gather some support from increasing power loads in the Pacific Northwest as well as from stronger differentials in the San Juan Basin On average Rockies differentials to the Henry Hub are expected to average per MMBtu during July In response to the increasing supplies flowing out of the Powder River Basin and the increasing pipeline capacity utilization on export pipelines Trailblazer has announced an open season for two possible options to extend and expand the mile pipeline from Wyoming into Nebraska Although timing and volumes have yet to be announced the additional capacity could prevent serious bottlenecks from developing out of the region which CERA would expect by without capacity additions end Follow URL for PDF version of this Monthly Briefing with associated graphic and tables Please note Should the above URL not work please use the following

updates Enrons Lay Urges Bold Solutions to Power Market Woes As the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission prepared to weigh in this morning with the federal governments answer to Californias bedeviled power market free market advocates issued last minute warnings against taking the price cap route espoused by the CalISO FERCs meeting is scheduled to start at AM EST Check this morning for updates In a letter fired off to FERC Chairman James J Hoecker yesterday Enron CEO Kenneth Lay urged the Commission to find a fix for the underlying structural problems in the power market rather than follow the steps of policy makers who have placed price cap band aids over hemorrhaging wounds Lay told Hoecker the power market is halfway across a busy street in its transition from monopoly to competition It cant stand where it is He said FERC has to make a choice between falling into the same trap of political expediency as Californias ISO leaving the nations electric system in the lurch from one crisis to the next or it can take a big step toward fundamental structural reform At the same time the Electric Power Supply Association EPSA called on FERC to issue an emergency cease and desist order prohibiting the CalISO from unilaterally implementing any changes to its current MWh price cap for wholesale electricity purchases In a motion filed Monday the marketer group specifically asked the Commission to bar the CalISO board of directors from putting into effect its decision to impose a fiendishly complex loaddifferentiated price cap of or less during the offpeak season effective Nov The plan was designed by the states main utility consumer group see Daily GPI Oct In addition the EPSA urged FERC to state explicitly that the CalISO does not have the authority to impose or extend price or bid caps unless expressly authorized to do so by the Commission The CalISOs current authority to set price caps expires on Nov Lay said the CalISOs complicated new formula caps prices below the cost of gasfired generation making obvious errors such as failing to take into account gas transportation costs between the Henry Hub and power plants in California in doing so the bid cap makes it more economic for generators to sell their gas supply rather than use it to make electricity in California The new formula also forces the ISO into the market to buy power on an ad hoc basis to keep the lights on when the capped market fails to attract sufficient supplies which it inevitably will do Lay said In addition the capped formula invites generators to shut in production export power out of state and deploy their turbines in other states or countries He noted that the ISOs Chairman voted against the measure while all of the states utilities voted for it presumably knowing full well that it simply will not work California is just the latest failure of partial or compromised open access said Lay Its time for the Commission to reject this approach The power industry the nations most essential industry is mired in the transition from regulated monopoly to open access and customer choice Every step forward has been compromised out of concern for alienating one vested interest or another As a result utilities are free to slow the interconnection of new generation withhold equal access to the transmission system favor their own sales over those of competitors miscalculated available transmission capacity and exercise control over supposedly independent system operators and reliability organizations Lay predicted that installing price caps for political expediency would plunge markets into greater uncertainty and discourage new supplies and conservation methods FERC has to complete the work that it started said Lay It has to ensure that all parties have equal and fair access to transmission by ending the special priority for utility uses of the system Second FERC must require transmission owners to separate operation of the monopoly transmission assets from their other businesses Third FERC must take politics out of transmission system operations by revising governance structures to ensure independence Finally FERC must end its reliance on shortsighted price caps by putting in place the necessary reforms to allow these markets to operate efficiently to encourage conservation and attract new supplies EPSA said the CalISO board acted in obvious disregard for the Commissions orderly processes It cannot be permitted to make the Commissions decisions for it or to alter so radically market rules thereby injecting more uncertainty and confusion in the market and subverting the process for fashioning fair effective and comprehensive remedies for Californias flawed electric markets the group noted The EPSA believes that any remedial actions taken by FERC with respect to the California markets will be severely compromised if the CalISO boards imposition of new prices caps is allowed to take effect

prices and alternate fuel pricing Note the price differential forecasts by basin CERA Alert Sent Wed November Title Midmonth Report Early Warning Author N American Gas Team EMail Category Alert Product Line North American Gas URL cfmtrackeprofilecfmum Alternative URL clientnagaltnagaltabhtml After a warm October the first cold weather this year has provided an early warning of what winter could bring for the gas market Cold weather across much of the great plains and a cold forecast for larger heating markets in the Midwest and Northeast have driven a surge in gas prices of more than per million British thermal units MMBtu over the past week This rebound in price highlighted the continued tightness of supply and moved the price of gas back above that of residual fuel oil assuring that dualfuel loads remain off of gas Supplies for the winter are not adequate to allow most dualfuel end users to burn gas If this cold snap extends through the remainder of November a heavy earlywinter draw on storage could set the stage for unprecedented high prices through the winter Though storage inventories have reached near the billion cubic feet Bcf level they remain at a record low heading into the heating season and even a normal winter would reduce inventories to a near record or record absolute low by spring This supply tightness places the gas price playing field in the broad territory above the resid price near in the Gulf Coast and into a range potentially testing the next difficult level of demand resistance This resistance could come from switching to distillate oil but low distillate inventories and high distillate prices mean that switching would require a gas price above per MMBtu and any move to switch to distillate would likely drive prices of both commodities higher Rather a combination of some switching to resid in industrial boilers and a shutdown of a few more pricesensitive end users may be required None of these measures comes easily or cheaply however and they can be overwhelmed by weatherdriven swings in demand As a result as cold weather settles in CERA expects heightened price volatility at levels above the price of resid and extreme sensitivity in the market to weather and weather forecasts Under normal weather conditions CERA expects Henry Hub prices to average during December see Table which by itself would represent an all time high for December But even this estimate could prove low If the current cold snap extends through early December prices could easily climb into the per MMBtu range Gas StorageThe Record Low Maximum CERA estimates that storage inventories reached a maximum of Bcf as of the end of October a record low for that month by Bcf see Table Even this level was reached only through a fortunate combination of a lack of storms in the Gulf of Mexico and consistent warmth through most of October The withdrawal season is likely to have begun this week however and in a strong way The cold weather now settling in is likely to offset warmth early this month increasing the withdrawal rate this November to Bcf per day on average well above the Bcf per day average rate of the past two years By the end of this month the US inventory deficit is likely to have widened again to Bcf CERA estimates that normal December weather would require storage withdrawals of approximately Bcf per day which is above last years rate of Bcf per day This year however this withdrawal rate would apply consistent pressure in the market through December and beyond as it would keep inventories on a path to reach Bcf by the end of March just below the alltime endofMarch low of Bcf So long as inventories remain on this path the pressure does not end even with the end of winter as a significant increase in injections next year would be required for inventories to reach even trillion cubic feet Tcf by next fall Although the supply build will begin to help by late winter it is unlikely to be of the magnitude required both to offset power generation demand growth and to allow this increase in storage injections to occurunless demand continues to be priced out of the market DemandKeeping Warm After last years warm winter CERA expects a strong rebound in heating demand and this weeks weather and forecast reinforce that expectation Weather last winter November through March was the warmest of the decade and there will be a significant rebound in heating demand in the residential and commercial sectors as weather returns toward normal this heating season Under normal weather conditions Average heating demand through the winter would be Bcf per day higher than last years Monthly average heating demand through the winter would be Bcf per day peaking at Bcf per day in January December heating demand would increase by Bcf per day relative to last December Weather percent colder than normal could further increase December demand by Bcf per day relative to normal weather likewise a percent warmerthannormal scenario could decrease demand by Bcf per day relative to normal weather Fuel Switching With natural gas markets this tight there is significant pressure for demand to be backed out of the market Residential and commercial demand is inelastic to price in the short run which leaves industrial demand and power demand as the only relief valve for the market This winter we expect all plants capable of burning residual fuel oil as an alternative to gas to do so a loss of million cubic feet MMcf per day of demand for power generation relative to last winter industrial consumers to switch the equivalent of MMcf per day off of gas gas prices to act as a ceiling for residual fuel oil prices as much as resid will act as a floor for gas For December CERA expects an overall demand increase of Bcf per day relative to last December and a Bcf per day increase in demand relative to November with increasing heating load offset somewhat by fuel switching SupplyThe Rebound The pressure from increasing demand and lower storage inventories is intense but US supply is beginning to rebound The recent steep decline in US lower capacity is expected to reverse in late given the soaring gasrelated rig count The success in reversing the decline in the Gulf of Mexico is related to the combination of the rampup of the Hickory and Tanzanite subsalt discoveries on the shelf adding to the recent startup of the Muni field these fields could add over Bcf per day later in the response of the shallow water to the strong late turnaround in drilling activity Other important capacity additions are occurring in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico with Bcf per day in and and onshore led by the Bossier sand play in Freestone County Texas the Barnett Shale play in Wise County Texas and the Powder River Basin coal seam play Further increases in drilling are likely to slow New deep land rigs are under construction and shallow rigs are being refurbished with cannibalized parts from older rigs Producers are experiencing delays in obtaining rigs as the supply of quality rigs depletes and drilling companies struggle to round out drilling crews Regional MarketsWild Winter in the West Extremely cold weather in the West has brought Rockies prices close to parity with Henry Hub prices and triggered early season spikes at Sumas in the north and Topock in the south Pipeline maintenance on El Paso is exacerbating the regional demand pressure and has contributed to Topock differentials of over per MMBtu Tight pricing relationships to the Henry Hub in the San Juan and Rocky Mountains should hold through February with significant widening in differentials as heating loads decline Winter has arrived in earnest across North America but the startup of firm transportation service on Alliance is delayed once again this time until December Nonetheless flows on the pipeline are under way CERA estimates that flows during October averaged MMcf per day During November that total should climb to MMcf per day despite the later published start date With or without Alliance flows a weatherdriven rebound in midwestern demand relative to November and December last year should keep prices in Chicago at a significant premium to Henry Hub prices In the Northeast differentials remain extremely strong and exposed to spikes throughout the winter despite greater flows into the region from Atlantic Canada this year see Table CERAs outlook by region follows Rockies Very cold weather within the region has brought Rocky Mountain prices near parity with Henry Hub prices A break in the cold or a cold snap in the East will likely widen the differentials but strong heating demand in the region will keep differentials within about per MMBtu below the Henry Hub price CERA expects a December average differential of per MMBtu however this differential is expected to show significant volatility based on regional weather A warm week in the Rockies could still push differentials toward per MMBtu San Juan San Juan prices will continue to hold close to Rockies prices through the winter with significant pipeline capacity between the two regions Heating loads in the Rockies will determine the San Juan to Henry Hub differential with extended cold weather in the Rockies pulling both prices close to the Henry Hub price CERA expects the December differential in the San Juan Basin to average per MMBtu Permian and MidContinent Unlike prices within the rest of the West differentials between the Henry Hub and the MidContinent and Permian Basins are likely to trade within a relatively narrow range during the winter as supplies from those basins are pulled either east or west depending on regional weather CERA expects a Permian to Henry Hub differential of per MMBtu and a MidContinent differential of per MMBtu for December Chicago Alliance flows into the Chicago market are now running close to MMcf per day However the onset of the heating season has offset those increased flows and pushed Chicago differentials up to near per MMBtu relative to the Henry Hub despite delays in the completion of the Vector pipeline CERA expects the strong pricing at Chicago to continue and December differentials should average per MMBtu Northeast markets Assuming normal weather we expect to see December basis for New York relative to Henry Hub at per MMBtu New England will likely see prices higher depending on the pipeline Much of this increased basis differential is caused by fuel costs For example with a percent retention rate from the Gulf Coast into New England last December would have seen retention costs of approximately at that same retention equates to Despite additional volumes of gas deliverable into the Northeast from the Atlantic Canadian fields there have been no additional regional pipeline facilities to deliver this gas to the local markets and an additional MMBtu per day of potential demand will compete for the capacity Because of this tightness should this months weather be colder than normal we could see severe spikes in basis similar to those seen in January These spikes could even exceed the highs seen in January depending on the severity of any cold snaps and the extent to which new electric loads are realized Canadian MarketsWinter Begins The colderthannormal weather has increased demand in western Canada but is only now being felt in the East Storage peaked in the West in early October at approximately Bcf below last years level and Bcf below the fiveyear average Even with modest withdrawals since that time storage inventories are still estimated to be adequate to meet winter needs Easter Canadian storage has continued to grow pushing levels to over Bcf Bcf above last year and well above the fiveyear average With the eastward movement of the colder weather withdrawals are likely to begin This higher level of eastern storage will be useful with the expected reduction of flows on TransCanada The good news resulting from the cold is a more normal freezeup which bodes well for a longer winter drilling season Gas well completions are expected to reach for and will likely be even higher next year Further Delays for Alliance The commercial inservice date for Alliance has been delayed until December the result of a combination of problems with clearing the line delays in the completion of the Aux Sable liquids extraction plant the delay of Vector and a lack of supply The pipeline has been flowing gas however with volumes building up since September It is estimated that flows for November will average MMcf per day TransCanada has taken the full brunt of the Alliance flows so far with Northern Border and PGT remaining strong December should see Alliance flows build to between and MMcf per day with modest reductions in flows on Northern Border and PGT Storage withdrawals will likely keep TransCanada reductions close to MMcf per day year overyear until Vector begins service to eastern Canada High Prices Strong Pull West The high demand in the Pacific Northwest has also provided strength for AECO The AECOHenry differential has dropped to the high s and low s as a result of this increased pull For December the differential is expected to average per MMBtu for a resulting AECO average of C per gigajoule US per MMBtu end Follow URL for PDF version of this message with

Western Market Crisis Gas Joins Power CERA Alert CERA Alert Sent Fri December Title Western Market Crisis Gas Joins Power Author CERA EMail Category Alert Product Line Western Energy North American Gas URL Western Energy Members clientcealtcealtabhtml N American Gas Memeber clientnagaltnagaltabhtml Western Markets Disconnect The western energy markets are currently in a pricing crisis Power supply shortages and threats of system blackouts have resurfaced this winter in California and spiking natural gas prices have become the latest energy headache for the West Gas prices along the Pacific corridor from Kingsgate in the North to Topock in the South have jumped to over per MMBtu during December after averaging over per MMBtu through the second half of November Extreme weather strong power demand for gas and unusually low gas storage levels have combined to intensify the demand for pipeline gas and have exposed a latent capacity bottleneck in bringing gas to this far western corridor The result is prices that dramatically disconnected from the rest of the North American gas market in a way that is more typical of Northeast markets during the winter The vulnerability to additional spikes will endure as the demand drivers combined with weakened storage inventories will maintain price pressure on western price points throughout the winter However the recent jumps in western gas market differentialsto more than a per MMBtu premium to the Henry Hubshould ease somewhat with a break in the weather Under any weather scenario spikes up into the per MMBtu range will be a feature of winter markets along the West Coast On balance we expect West Coast price differentials to average at a per MMBtu premium through winter The spring hydroelectric runoff season should offer the first opportunity for a break in differentials that could drop back to more typical levels of less than per MMBtu Over the long term increased pipeline capacity and additional gas supply are needed to break the vulnerability to future West Coast price spikes However significant new capacity additions are still to months away In the meantimeparticularly this wintersustained high and volatile price differentials and extremely high absolute prices at western points are likely to draw the increased attention of state regulators and the FERC as winter heating demand exposes residential customers to the direct cost of the crisis Building Up to the Price Spike The first signs of natural gas price spikes and disconnects emerged this summer as sharp yearoveryear increases in demand pushed pipeline utilization rates to new highs As pipeline capacity constraints into California became evident differentials in Southern California moved up to a per MMBtu premium to the Henry Hub These extremely high prices as well as low forward spreads discouraged storage injections through the summer As a result a strong storage position early in the summer deteriorated rapidly from May through July In August a lateral on El Pasos southern system exploded the accident further limited pipeline capacity into California for a twoweek period During that time the market drew heavily on storage inventories and further weakened storage positions As hydroelectric generation declined through the summer the price strength extended into Northern California Malin which had been pricing near parity with the Henry hub in the summer began trading at a per MMBtu premium to the Henry Hub in September The summer and early fall market set the stage for continued and more intense spikes this winter The following factors are now driving this market Continuing surges in gas demand Gas demand levels have remained high since early summer driven by higher overall demand for electricity and lower hydroelectric output Demand levels for the third quarter in the US West averaged billion cubic feet Bcf per day up from Bcf per day during the third quarter Persistently strong gasfired generation production through the fall months diverted gas to power production frustrating efforts to fill storage This pressure will continue The yearoveryear demand increases from the power sector will be compounded as evidenced in November by swings upward in residential and commercial heating demand of million cubic feet MMcf per day Overall CERA expects nearly Bcf per day of increased demand in the West this winter with the critical California and Pacific Northwest regions showing Bcf per day of increased demand Key power sector drivers including the strong economy colder weather and lower hydroelectric generation will continue to push gasfired generation Pipeline utilization nears capacity Strong western demand for gas has pushed utilization rates on western pipes to high levels Flows from British Columbia into the Northwest pipeline have remained at high levels since summer while flows from the Rockies on Northwest have remained at pipeline capacity Flows on PGT into Kingsgate have remained at or near capacity although approximately MMcf per day of excess capacity exists on PGT into California at Malin Likewise flows out of the Rockies on Kern River pipeline have consistently remained at capacity The only slack pipeline capacity remaining for West Coast gas markets has been on Southwest pipes During the past few months these pipelines have operated at their highest utilization rates since the addition of capacity from Canada early last decade The high utilization of western pipeline capacityreminiscent of power plant capacity constraints that helped propel power prices to all time highs in the West this summerleaves very little slack capacity to provide a relief valve for demand spikes And that is exactly what has driven prices during the past few weeks see Figure Given the level of storage inventories and expected gas demand flows on the El Paso and Transwestern pipelines will have to reach even higher flow levels from December through March than they have averaged through November Deteriorating storage position At the start of November California storage inventories held at Bcf a full Bcf below the fiveyear average inventory level The strong instate withdrawals during November weakened that position to Bcf the deficit swelled to Bcf Inventories in California have never fallen below Bcf so deliverability through the end of winter is likely less than MMcf per day Storage inventories in California are so low that utilities ability to balance withdrawals from storage with purchases from demandsensitive price points is severely limited If the cold weather blast anticipated for mid December materializes this effort at balance will be even further compromised for the remainder of winter see Figure Shortterm contracting A significant amount of western gas is purchased or indexed to the spot market A shift from term contracts for both gas and pipeline capacity to spot transactionsin many cases in response to gas and power industry deregulationhas left the West much more exposed to spot market volatility In other areas of the country utilities have significant firm pipeline capacity extending from supply regions to the citygate andor have forward purchased gas at previous and lower prices for at least some portion of their winter supplies As a result unlike in eastern markets a much larger proportion of the supply portfolio of California utilities will be exposed to the current price spikes No alternatives A lack of fuelswitching capability prevents a meaningful demand response to higher gas prices Power prices continue to move in lockstep with the increase in gas prices Not surprisingly gas prices pushed the cost of gasfired generation beyond the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions FERCs proposed price cap of per megawatthour setting the stage for a reassessment of this price limit A small and declining portion of power generators are liquid fuel capable Significantly air emissions restrictions already plaguing power markets with much higher emissions credit costs this yearwill make any further switching to liquid fuels in the crucial California market highly unlikely this winter A recent meeting of the South Coast Air Quality Management District which has jurisdiction over the Los Angeles area concluded with no relief granted to generators running short of emissions credits Market Forces Unite for Price Spikes During November The first cold weatherrelated demand spike demonstrated the combined power of these forces and the vulnerability of the western markets A cold weather system in mid November brought temperatures averaging percent colder than normalthe temperatures actually averaged percent colder than a normal January weekand provided the additional demand boost that taxed the gas delivery systems on the West Coast Capacity constraints on moving gas into California that appeared during the summer extended north into the Pacific Northwest as heating loads climbed This core demand compounded the effects of continued strong demand for gas for power generation The high power demand was the result of the intersection of the annual low point for hydroelectric generation and a series of planned and unplanned nuclear and coal power plant outages Gas demand in the US West during the last two weeks of November was boosted to approximately Bcf per day driven by heating demand increases of Bcf per day above normal levels and power plant outage related demand increases of Bcf per day These demand spikes caused buyersalready dependent on the spot marketto bid citygate prices to record high levels through the last two weeks of November and into December Since demand outstripped supply prices rose dramatically at all western price points and flows of natural gas to western markets increased over high summer levels Citygate prices surged beyond per MMBtu on daily spot markets and averaged nearly per MMBtu for December bidweek at Topock Daily spot gas prices have reflected imbalance penalty prices in many western market regions West Coast to Remain Disconnected Through the Winter Although the week of November could prove to be the peak demand week in the West this winter CERA does not expect any significant retreat in gas prices on the West Coast any time soon Storage inventories are so low that the ability to beat back demand spikes with high storage withdrawals is not an option for gas utilities Generators which already rely heavily on the spot market for supplies are faced with a bidding war for scarce supplies Colderthannormal weather would likely keep West Coast prices in the per MMBtu range More normal weather would allow a slow decline from current levels of over per MMBtu down into the per MMBtu range However the storage situation and underlying demand strength mean that any return to a lower pricing range is unlikely until early January This winter will prove a critical test for western gas markets and the end of the heating season will likely provide the first opportunity for lower price levels in the West Coast market As heating loads diminish significantly in March and storage deliverability is no longer a critical issue premiums should retreat back into the per MMBtu range As hydroelectric generation begins to increase the pressure could subside even further but storage injections during the spring shoulder season will likely limit price declines even during the spring The Unique Vulnerability of the Pacific Northwest The West Coast price pressure is not limited to California High demand in the Pacific Northwest and more indirectly in California will keep upward pressure on prices from Sumas to Stanfield Northwest pipeline capacity from the Rockies was already fully utilized at the onset of the cold weather and even so can only provide gas so far into the Pacific Northwest The combined California and Pacific Northwest demand pushed Stanfield up in spite of the limited volumes that are bidirectional there The only supply source for the load centers in southern British Columbia and even more so in northern Pacific Northwest such as Seattle are from Westcoast at Sumas The Westcoast mainline from the producing fields in Northeast British Columbia has also been operating at capacity The same bidding forces felt in California have been evident at these western Canadian price points pushing Sumas prices into the s per MMBtu These forces will persist keeping Sumas at a premium to AECO over the winterand in much closer relationship to California prices Customer Response Another Log on the Backlash Bonfire With power plants and gas utilities paying the current high spot prices consumers bills from Vancouver to San Diego will ultimately reflect these high commodity prices The gas industry has been preparing for rate shock this winter warning regulators and customers alike However the price spikes in the West and the sustained premiums in western markets move beyond alarming Capacity holders are reaping significant rewards for their investments in capacity positions resulting in a substantial transfer of wealth from consumers to capacity holders Market power and market gaming accusations that have hit the power markets will find easy application in their gas market counterpart no matter what their merits Some level of investigation into the natural gas markets during or following this challenging winter should be expected As has occurred in the power markets this will now turn attention to gas purchasing practices particularly in California The likely outcome of this process will be a shift away from the heavy reliance on spot purchases toward a more flexible portfolio approach end Follow URL for PDF version of this Alert with associated graphics Come Shoot the Rapids with us at CERAWeek Shooting the Rapids Strategies

PM on PM To cc Subject The Storm Arrives CERA Alert CERA Alert Sent Fri December Title The Storm Arrives Author N American Gas Team EMail Category Alert Product Line North American Gas URL clientnagaltnagaltabhtml Cold Weather Path Colderthannormal weather through November and forecasted cold for the first half of December throughout the Midwest and Northeast have driven gas prices well into record territory with the January Henry Hub price trading near per MMBtu and closing above on the New York Mercantile Exchange December This sixweek cold period and the quick depletion of already low storage inventories has established prices at or above CERAs cold weather path for the remainder of the winter and in all likelihood beyond If December storage withdrawals are as high as CERA now expects the gas market will remain on the cold weather path through as well even if weather returns to normal during the second half of December The enormous increase in storage injections that is likely to be required next summer would keep the pressure on gas markets throughout the year So long as weather remains cold or even normal this winter a new market dynamic is in effect in which gas prices interact more with distillate fuel oil prices rather than with those of residual fuel oil In addition gas is likely to have an increasingly direct influence on power prices in the growing number of regions in which gasfired generation is now on the margin in winter This winter the gas market is likely to rediscover for the first time in decades which end users value natural gas most highly and which ultimately do not The gas market is also rediscovering the value of firm pipeline capacity particularly into market areas Both the West Coast and the Northeast have experienced even more extreme price spikes with daily prices in both regions peaking above per MMBtu Indeed the shortage of gas in California is so acute that prices above per MMBtu have been reported If sustained these price levels will induce a political reaction that will reverberate throughout the industry Storage UpdateEven High Seems Low Panic in the market yesterday was eased somewhat as storage withdrawals for the week ending December at billion cubic feet Bcf proved to be less than expected This withdrawal was half the previous weeks rate and in CERAs view actual withdrawals for both weeks probably lie between these two readings In some cases successive weeks smooth out volatile readings in the AGA survey But even the Bcf figure though a significant retreat from the previous weeks rate is high by historical standards One would have to go back to to find a higher reading for a comparable week in the AGA survey Inventories as of the beginning of December at an estimated Bcf see Table were Bcf below the yearearlier level and this deficit is likely to increase substantially during December If weather forecasts indicating colderthannormal weather through midDecember in key heating markets hold true storage withdrawals for the month will average approximately Bcf per day This rate is an increase from CERAs normal weather estimate of Bcf per day and even this rate depends on weather returning to normal in mid December This level of withdrawals would leave only Bcf in storage on January an inventory Bcf below the yearearlier level Assuming normal weather such an inventory would place storage on track to reach a March minimum of Bcf Bcf below the record low At a US inventory level this low many storage operators would be dipping into baseload gas in order to support service even to firm gas customers Physical deliverability from storage fields will be significantly lower this year in midwinter forcing a greater reliance on pipeline gas and peaking facilities during January and February The actual reduction in field deliverability is impossible to quantify but storage inventories cannot be withdrawn at steady rates throughout the winter withdrawal rates decline with inventory as field pressure is reduced Pressure in the market will be reinforced and extended through and probably into During the past two summers high prices have been required to discourage demand and allow overall US storage injections to reach barely trillion cubic feet Tcf If normal weather holds for the remainder of this winter Tcf of injectionswhich would be nearly impossible to achievewould be required during if inventories are to recover to Tcf at peak If weather this winter is merely normal from midDecember through March going into winter next year the United States will have considerably less gas in storage Reaching even the Bcf level according to CERA estimates see Table would require an additional Bcf of injections next year and that alone would prove challenging PriceThe Cold Weather Path The weakness of storage inventories and the demand pressure in both core and power generation markets created by the cold weather have caused prices to move onto and even above CERAs cold weather path for this winter see Table Storage inventories would become perilously low if the current forecast for cold weather through midDecember proves accurate and the injections required next summer would keep pressure in the market intense For these reasons CERAs outlook for prices for January and throughout now reflects the cold weather path Prices could take an even higher path particularly if colderthannormal weather endures beyond midDecember or returns on a sustained basis in January or February Several forces that could weaken prices during will begin to enter the market during the winter but these are offset by demand volatility in the winter and the requirement to rebuild storage inventories once the winter is over Such factors include a building US supply capability growing imports softening oil prices allowing a lower floor for prices once the winter ends and potentially weakening economic growth Although the influence of these factors will increase it is unlikely to match the huge injection requirement that appears more and more certain next summer DemandThe Difficult Next Round of Switching With gas prices hitting new record highs CERA expects some additional demand to be priced out of the market Because gas has priced above residual fuel oil for most weeks since May however the easiest fuel switching in the power generation and industrial sectors has already occurred Even though gas prices are currently above the level of distillate approximately per MMBtu in New York switching from gas to distillate requires changes in longstanding consumer habit will occur only over time and is likely limited in volume Significant switching to distillate would quickly raise the price of distillate itself There are four major sources of additional demand response in industrial markets Additional switching to resid in industrial boilers The next increment of demand to come out of the market is likely to be in the industrial sector through additional fuel switching to resid and to some extent to distillate These markets will continue to show some flexibility but will not represent a large volume CERA estimates that the industrial boiler market has probably already begun to lose small amounts less than Bcf per day in switching to resid given the consistency of gas price premiums greater than per MMBtu Investment in restoring switching capability As premiums move far beyond this level industrial end users can be expected to take a closer look at reinvigorating their switching capability beyond their initial shortterm levels However such a change would require investment by industrial end users and the availability of resid in oil markets CERA estimates that with focused investment over the course of a number of months to perhaps a year switching to resid could eventually reach as high as Bcf per day There is already some movement here given the impact of high gas prices on earnings energy prices have already begun to receive management attention Switching to distillate US Department of Energy data suggest that industrial end users have a theoretical capability of switching nearly Bcf per day to distillate in the short term This switch would represent additional distillate demand of over barrels per day bd in a US market of million barrels This marginal demand would move the distillate price in tandem with gas price and any additional switching among power generators to distillate would reinforce this price correlation In addition the availability of distillate inventories on site should restrict the quick switching to short periods of time and will not offer a longterm solution to tight markets Shutting down industrial plants Also offering some flexibility is the shutdown of manufacturing plants that use gas as a feedstock The major feedstock consumers are the ammonia and methanol industries and not surprisingly given the tight margins available manufacturers of ammonia and of methanol continue to show suppressed gas demand However in the short term only a portion of ammonia production is at risk Whereas the production needs of merchant facilities along the Gulf Coast is relatively readily replaced by imports substitution becomes more difficult away from the coast because of transportation logistics and for facilities whose production is linked to valueadded fertilizer products Hence CERA still estimates that even with nonexistent margins substantial ammonia production would continue with additional losses of perhaps million cubic feet MMcf per day of potential demand in addition to the facilities that have already closed Extraordinarily high gas prices will also hasten the shuttering of North American methanol capacity putting at risk another to MMcf per day of gas demand for that sector Switching that could occur in boiler use is concentrated in the chemicals paper and refining sectors in the South and the food products sector in the Midwest Continuing feedstock losses would be concentrated in the South Central region For process users even extraordinarily high gas prices are expected to have little impact on the use of gas in the short term Energy costs are not the dominant component of production costs for these users and a physical changeover would be timeintensive and elemental in its impact on enduse product quality The NortheastCold Weather Operations Begin All of the Northeast pipelines have issued notices to customers that they either have imposed or are highly likely to need to impose transportation restrictions of various types The most common restriction is to nonprimary firm services secondary and interruptible type services which will be scheduled for the next several days on many pipelines Other pipelines have issued balancing requirements whereby receipts and deliveries must match Even hourly flow orders have also been implemented These actions are normal for winter operations when a cold period is expected Whereas the firm market for natural gas is rarely affected by these restrictions the spot market becomes much more volatile as interruptible supplies dry up The spot market primarily made up of nonfirm customers has had a dramatic reaction to the diminished availability of delivered spot gas into the market area as has been reflected by the volatility of the cash market this week The result of these restrictions of nonprimary firm services has been an expansion of basis to Henry Hub At one point gas for nextday delivery to New York traded near per MMBtu delivered although the average price was closer to These high spikes are the result of very thinly traded volumes of gas Although these restrictions will likely ease as temperatures return closer to normal CERA now expects basis into the New York citygate to average per MMBtu for December and per MMBtu for January end Follow URL for PDF version of this Alert with associated tables Come Shoot the Rapids with

to shut in operations because of high natural gas prices are nevertheless making money by selling gas futures contracts Terra Industries and Mississippi Chemical Corp became the latest companies to announce cutbacks related to current natural gas costs Iowabased Terra Industries said it had sold off a portion of its December natural gas purchases and shutdown of its Verdigis OK ammonia facility The company had previously reported that it would not operate its Bytheville AR and Beaumont TX facilities during the month of December as well In a similar maneuver Mississippi Chemical Corp a producer of nitrogen phosphorus and potassiumbased products in Mississippi Louisiana and New Mexico reported the sale of all of its natural gas futures contracts from January forward in order to take full advantage of the opportunity uncovered by soaring natural gas prices Mississippi Chemical said it expects to realize a pretax gain of million in its second fiscal quarter ending Dec from the recently sold contracts The problem lies in the fact that escalating natural gas costs are not being mimicked by chemical prices An overabundance on the market has kept chemical prices relatively low while gas prices a feedstock for some chemicals continue to climb The difference in the latest shutdowns is that the companies involved have openly announced they have sold their gas contracts off because it is more profitable than manufacturing their products said Ron Phillips of The Fertilizer Institute Duke Energys Ken Nyiri divisional director of strategic planning and research commented on Mississippi Chemicals transactions I guess they probably made about a MMBtu margin on the gas which is significantly more than they could make on the ammonia in fact they would have lost unit Their ammonia was probably costing them about ton to make with gas bought at MMBtu in November and the market today is at so basically they would break even on their ammonia production costs By selling the gas at around MMBtu they made MMBtu It was just a question of do they convert the gas to ammonia and make nothing on it or do they sell the gas and make million Michael L Bennett executive vice president of Terra said The natural gas price increase since our December requirements were purchased for Verdigris permitted us to sell a portion of those purchases and generate higher gross profits than could be realized from selling the products manufactured with the natural gas We will evaluate the economics of bringing Verdigris back to full production near the end of December when Januarys natural gas purchase commitments must be made Terra estimates the idled facilities represent and of the companys North American ammonia UAN urea and methanol manufacturing capacity respectively The production of all four chemicals are heavily dependent on natural gas Phillips said The latest data we had in October was that of the companies that we survey which is not the entire ammonia market but a good bit of it we were looking at operating rates of Currently a total of million tonsyear of ammonia production capacity is out of service out of about million tonsyear of production capacity Clearly some of these folks have been selling their gas rather than producing ammonia said Nyiri Its the prudent thing to do I think in this marketplace Buy your ammonia if you can At gas that costs you ton to make the ammonia which is more than the current market is willing to pay A spokeswoman for Mississippi Chemical said the company held on to its December gas contracts and has been operating at varied levels of capacity throughout see Daily GPI June Depending on what the gas prices are and what our product prices are around the JanuaryFebruary time frame we will make decisions then on our operations rate capacity said Melinda Hood a Mississippi Chemical spokeswoman Charles O Dunn CEO of Mississippi Chemical said We remain committed to the nitrogen business and our customers but we also have to take advantage of opportunities to optimize cash flow during these challenging times It is our belief that the current unprecedented natural gas prices are unlikely to be sustained during the intermediate term stated Dunn As a result we felt it was in the companys best interest to sell our futures positions to lock in the substantial gain afforded by the recent increase in natural gas prices Going forward we will continue to determine operating levels for our plants based on the relationship between natural gas prices nitrogen product prices and our customers requirements as we have been doing for some time International imports are also hurting US producers Currently there is a surplus of ammonia in the international market which is holding ammonia prices down US fertilizer producers cant compete with the international market Gas prices are centsMMBtu in Russia cents to MMBtu in Argentina and Venezuela and MMBtu in Trinidad The US imports million tons of ammonia each year Fertilizers represent of the demand for ammonia in the United States Terra Industries said its facilities would resume production as soon as it became economical again whether from gas prices declining or nitrogen and methanol prices rising just as long as prices reach levels allowing positive cash flows Nyiri said he believes relief is in sight He pointed out that the ammonia market has been sitting around the ton level for the last several months but believes ammonia prices will have to increase entering the next planting season Ive got my model peaking out around ton in April or May and at that time I have gas costs coming down At that point the Bcfd of demand from the fertilizer production industry should begin returning to service

PM on PM To cc Subject Power Market Caps Lower Prices at Higher Risk CERA Alert CERA Alert Sent Fri July Title Power Market Caps Lower Prices at Higher Risk Author Zenker Mortizburke EMail Category Alert Product Line Western Energy URL cfmtrackeprofilecfmum Recent events in California culminating in new market rules established for the energy and ancillary services markets indicate that legislators and regulators are dissatisfied with the performance of the markets they established The hot weather in California during June triggered high electricity demand corresponding recordbreaking power prices and rolling blackouts in the San Francisco area Although the economic impact of both the outages and the concurrent price spikes is significant a recent decision by Californias Independent System Operator ISO to intervene in the markets by lowering price caps through the summer of from to per megawatthour MWh may prove to be the most important product of the market events Ironically the proclivity to continue to change the market rules whatever the intention could create market distortions that delay the addition of new generating capacity by discouraging plant developers and driving away needed capit al This would only prolong the states supply shortage and resultant high prices Although the recordsetting weather that prompted the rolling blackouts in the San Francisco area is not likely to be repeated the West as a whole will experience higher coincident peak demand under normal weather conditions this summer CERA expects that supplies will be sufficient to meet peak demand this year but the high price levels of June will be repeated during peak demand conditions not only this summer but during the summers of and possibly The Pressure Builds The blackouts were not spawned by a statewide supply shortfall but instead by a transmission constraint that limits the ability to import sufficient quantities of power to the San Francisco area The quantity of generating capacity out of service in the West was near average levels despite a nuclear unit outage in Washington Although the blackouts were brief and wholesale power prices decreased with the temperatures the intense scrutiny over the events and resultant changes to the market rules indicate that legislators and regulators are dissatisfied with the performance of the markets they designed The markets architects assumed that competition would lower wholesale prices in the state However prices in June have been roughly eight times higher than in s prerestructured California market leading many regulators and legislators to conclude that the markets are flawed requiring additional caps and market rules Although some state officials strongly favored lo wering the price caps many within the ISOs Board of Governors strongly opposed intervening in what they consider to be normal market reactions to tight supply and demand fundamentals The current tight supply situation in California and the West as a whole is a product of recent strong economic growth throughout the region coupled with the slow process of permitting new power plants Owing to strong economic growth in California in and and percent respectively capacity margins have shrunk from percent in to percent in Demand growth throughout the West has reduced the amount of energy available for export from the Pacific Northwest and Southwest to California As a result even with optimistic levels of energy imports and the curtailment of approximately megawatts MW of interruptible load within the state California capacity margins will fall well below North American Electric Reliability Council NERC reliability criteria roughly percent this summer The West is the only region in North America that will experience a tightening of capacity margins relative to levels in under normal weather conditions CERA anticipates peak demand growth to continue to outpace new capacity additions through with slightly growing capacity margins in At these levels an unusual amount of either plant capacity or transmission line capacity out of service during peak demand conditions would require the ISO to mandate blackouts of a portion of the states load to maintain the overall stability of the grid Thus the tight capacity situation in the state will continue to pressure prices to high levels which may provoke legislators and regulators to attempt to extend the price caps or implement additional market rules Market Distorting Effects Under tremendous pressure from some legislators regulators and market participants the California ISO Board of Governors lowered the current price caps on energy from to per MWh in a special meeting conducted June Owing to the interconnectedness of western markets the decision to lower the caps and the apparent willingness of regulators to continue to change the rules governing Californias electricity markets will affect power market participants throughout the West Profitability of existing and future generators degraded High power prices and volatility levels in June although detrimental to most buyers provide strong encouragement to plant developers Limiting the level of price flyups degrades the ability of plant owners to recover capital costs plus earn a return on that capital In most periods of the year competition drives prices to levels that provide little opportunity for a return on capital Generators therefore seek to recover their investments with higher bids in Californias energy and ancillary services markets during periods of supply scarcity Existing merchant generators are at increased risk to recover the investments they made based on cash flow outlooks developed prior to the imposition of caps Supply shortfall prolonged The process of siting and permitting power plants in California is cumbersome requiring as long as five years from plant proposal to synchronization with the grid The California Energy Commission CEC the state agency charged with approving new plants has repeatedly expressed concerns about the chronic tight supply situation in the state Pricedampening market intervention indicates to plant developers that California officials may continue to reengineer the states power markets to the detriment of generator profitability and when added to the difficult permitting process potentially delaying the introduction of new capacity to meet rapidly growing state demand Prominent plant developers have recently indicated that markets outside of California may provide a more stable market and a better environment for deploying scarce resources and generating equipment such as turbines Trading positions affected Lowering price caps reduces the degree of price volatility and the level of overall average prices Market participants have executed market positions based on the outlook for prices under the previous higher price cap By lowering the price cap not only are the value of existing physical eg power plant and financial eg forward contracts positions significantly affected but market participants must also incorporate the uncertainty of possible future adjustments to the cap into their trading Circumventing market rules The variety of energy and capacity markets in California as well as the bilateral markets outside of the state provides opportunities to circumvent the intent of the new market rules further distorting the markets in the West Although lowering price caps in California will likely temporarily reduce price levels the new power plant capacity ultimately needed in the state to reduce price levels and improve reliability on a sustainable basis could be discouraged by prolonged and repeated intervention in

prices and alternate fuel pricing Note the price differential forecasts by basin CERA Alert Sent Wed November Title Midmonth Report Early Warning Author N American Gas Team EMail Category Alert Product Line North American Gas URL cfmtrackeprofilecfmum Alternative URL clientnagaltnagaltabhtml After a warm October the first cold weather this year has provided an early warning of what winter could bring for the gas market Cold weather across much of the great plains and a cold forecast for larger heating markets in the Midwest and Northeast have driven a surge in gas prices of more than per million British thermal units MMBtu over the past week This rebound in price highlighted the continued tightness of supply and moved the price of gas back above that of residual fuel oil assuring that dualfuel loads remain off of gas Supplies for the winter are not adequate to allow most dualfuel end users to burn gas If this cold snap extends through the remainder of November a heavy earlywinter draw on storage could set the stage for unprecedented high prices through the winter Though storage inventories have reached near the billion cubic feet Bcf level they remain at a record low heading into the heating season and even a normal winter would reduce inventories to a near record or record absolute low by spring This supply tightness places the gas price playing field in the broad territory above the resid price near in the Gulf Coast and into a range potentially testing the next difficult level of demand resistance This resistance could come from switching to distillate oil but low distillate inventories and high distillate prices mean that switching would require a gas price above per MMBtu and any move to switch to distillate would likely drive prices of both commodities higher Rather a combination of some switching to resid in industrial boilers and a shutdown of a few more pricesensitive end users may be required None of these measures comes easily or cheaply however and they can be overwhelmed by weatherdriven swings in demand As a result as cold weather settles in CERA expects heightened price volatility at levels above the price of resid and extreme sensitivity in the market to weather and weather forecasts Under normal weather conditions CERA expects Henry Hub prices to average during December see Table which by itself would represent an all time high for December But even this estimate could prove low If the current cold snap extends through early December prices could easily climb into the per MMBtu range Gas StorageThe Record Low Maximum CERA estimates that storage inventories reached a maximum of Bcf as of the end of October a record low for that month by Bcf see Table Even this level was reached only through a fortunate combination of a lack of storms in the Gulf of Mexico and consistent warmth through most of October The withdrawal season is likely to have begun this week however and in a strong way The cold weather now settling in is likely to offset warmth early this month increasing the withdrawal rate this November to Bcf per day on average well above the Bcf per day average rate of the past two years By the end of this month the US inventory deficit is likely to have widened again to Bcf CERA estimates that normal December weather would require storage withdrawals of approximately Bcf per day which is above last years rate of Bcf per day This year however this withdrawal rate would apply consistent pressure in the market through December and beyond as it would keep inventories on a path to reach Bcf by the end of March just below the alltime endofMarch low of Bcf So long as inventories remain on this path the pressure does not end even with the end of winter as a significant increase in injections next year would be required for inventories to reach even trillion cubic feet Tcf by next fall Although the supply build will begin to help by late winter it is unlikely to be of the magnitude required both to offset power generation demand growth and to allow this increase in storage injections to occurunless demand continues to be priced out of the market DemandKeeping Warm After last years warm winter CERA expects a strong rebound in heating demand and this weeks weather and forecast reinforce that expectation Weather last winter November through March was the warmest of the decade and there will be a significant rebound in heating demand in the residential and commercial sectors as weather returns toward normal this heating season Under normal weather conditions Average heating demand through the winter would be Bcf per day higher than last years Monthly average heating demand through the winter would be Bcf per day peaking at Bcf per day in January December heating demand would increase by Bcf per day relative to last December Weather percent colder than normal could further increase December demand by Bcf per day relative to normal weather likewise a percent warmerthannormal scenario could decrease demand by Bcf per day relative to normal weather Fuel Switching With natural gas markets this tight there is significant pressure for demand to be backed out of the market Residential and commercial demand is inelastic to price in the short run which leaves industrial demand and power demand as the only relief valve for the market This winter we expect all plants capable of burning residual fuel oil as an alternative to gas to do so a loss of million cubic feet MMcf per day of demand for power generation relative to last winter industrial consumers to switch the equivalent of MMcf per day off of gas gas prices to act as a ceiling for residual fuel oil prices as much as resid will act as a floor for gas For December CERA expects an overall demand increase of Bcf per day relative to last December and a Bcf per day increase in demand relative to November with increasing heating load offset somewhat by fuel switching SupplyThe Rebound The pressure from increasing demand and lower storage inventories is intense but US supply is beginning to rebound The recent steep decline in US lower capacity is expected to reverse in late given the soaring gasrelated rig count The success in reversing the decline in the Gulf of Mexico is related to the combination of the rampup of the Hickory and Tanzanite subsalt discoveries on the shelf adding to the recent startup of the Muni field these fields could add over Bcf per day later in the response of the shallow water to the strong late turnaround in drilling activity Other important capacity additions are occurring in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico with Bcf per day in and and onshore led by the Bossier sand play in Freestone County Texas the Barnett Shale play in Wise County Texas and the Powder River Basin coal seam play Further increases in drilling are likely to slow New deep land rigs are under construction and shallow rigs are being refurbished with cannibalized parts from older rigs Producers are experiencing delays in obtaining rigs as the supply of quality rigs depletes and drilling companies struggle to round out drilling crews Regional MarketsWild Winter in the West Extremely cold weather in the West has brought Rockies prices close to parity with Henry Hub prices and triggered early season spikes at Sumas in the north and Topock in the south Pipeline maintenance on El Paso is exacerbating the regional demand pressure and has contributed to Topock differentials of over per MMBtu Tight pricing relationships to the Henry Hub in the San Juan and Rocky Mountains should hold through February with significant widening in differentials as heating loads decline Winter has arrived in earnest across North America but the startup of firm transportation service on Alliance is delayed once again this time until December Nonetheless flows on the pipeline are under way CERA estimates that flows during October averaged MMcf per day During November that total should climb to MMcf per day despite the later published start date With or without Alliance flows a weatherdriven rebound in midwestern demand relative to November and December last year should keep prices in Chicago at a significant premium to Henry Hub prices In the Northeast differentials remain extremely strong and exposed to spikes throughout the winter despite greater flows into the region from Atlantic Canada this year see Table CERAs outlook by region follows Rockies Very cold weather within the region has brought Rocky Mountain prices near parity with Henry Hub prices A break in the cold or a cold snap in the East will likely widen the differentials but strong heating demand in the region will keep differentials within about per MMBtu below the Henry Hub price CERA expects a December average differential of per MMBtu however this differential is expected to show significant volatility based on regional weather A warm week in the Rockies could still push differentials toward per MMBtu San Juan San Juan prices will continue to hold close to Rockies prices through the winter with significant pipeline capacity between the two regions Heating loads in the Rockies will determine the San Juan to Henry Hub differential with extended cold weather in the Rockies pulling both prices close to the Henry Hub price CERA expects the December differential in the San Juan Basin to average per MMBtu Permian and MidContinent Unlike prices within the rest of the West differentials between the Henry Hub and the MidContinent and Permian Basins are likely to trade within a relatively narrow range during the winter as supplies from those basins are pulled either east or west depending on regional weather CERA expects a Permian to Henry Hub differential of per MMBtu and a MidContinent differential of per MMBtu for December Chicago Alliance flows into the Chicago market are now running close to MMcf per day However the onset of the heating season has offset those increased flows and pushed Chicago differentials up to near per MMBtu relative to the Henry Hub despite delays in the completion of the Vector pipeline CERA expects the strong pricing at Chicago to continue and December differentials should average per MMBtu Northeast markets Assuming normal weather we expect to see December basis for New York relative to Henry Hub at per MMBtu New England will likely see prices higher depending on the pipeline Much of this increased basis differential is caused by fuel costs For example with a percent retention rate from the Gulf Coast into New England last December would have seen retention costs of approximately at that same retention equates to Despite additional volumes of gas deliverable into the Northeast from the Atlantic Canadian fields there have been no additional regional pipeline facilities to deliver this gas to the local markets and an additional MMBtu per day of potential demand will compete for the capacity Because of this tightness should this months weather be colder than normal we could see severe spikes in basis similar to those seen in January These spikes could even exceed the highs seen in January depending on the severity of any cold snaps and the extent to which new electric loads are realized Canadian MarketsWinter Begins The colderthannormal weather has increased demand in western Canada but is only now being felt in the East Storage peaked in the West in early October at approximately Bcf below last years level and Bcf below the fiveyear average Even with modest withdrawals since that time storage inventories are still estimated to be adequate to meet winter needs Easter Canadian storage has continued to grow pushing levels to over Bcf Bcf above last year and well above the fiveyear average With the eastward movement of the colder weather withdrawals are likely to begin This higher level of eastern storage will be useful with the expected reduction of flows on TransCanada The good news resulting from the cold is a more normal freezeup which bodes well for a longer winter drilling season Gas well completions are expected to reach for and will likely be even higher next year Further Delays for Alliance The commercial inservice date for Alliance has been delayed until December the result of a combination of problems with clearing the line delays in the completion of the Aux Sable liquids extraction plant the delay of Vector and a lack of supply The pipeline has been flowing gas however with volumes building up since September It is estimated that flows for November will average MMcf per day TransCanada has taken the full brunt of the Alliance flows so far with Northern Border and PGT remaining strong December should see Alliance flows build to between and MMcf per day with modest reductions in flows on Northern Border and PGT Storage withdrawals will likely keep TransCanada reductions close to MMcf per day year overyear until Vector begins service to eastern Canada High Prices Strong Pull West The high demand in the Pacific Northwest has also provided strength for AECO The AECOHenry differential has dropped to the high s and low s as a result of this increased pull For December the differential is expected to average per MMBtu for a resulting AECO average of C per gigajoule US per MMBtu end Follow URL for PDF version of this message with

Alert Title Argentine Power Markets Winter Constraints Push Prices Higher in May Author Bailey EMail Category Alert Product Line Latin American Energy URL clientlaaltlaaltabhtml Summary Prices in the Argentine power market were significantly higher in May owing to the combination of continued low hydro output strong demand growth and periodic constraints on natural gas deliveries to power plants in the Buenos Aires region Spot power prices energy component only averaged per megawatthour MWh in May Although average power prices declined from last year price volatility increased with several shortduration episodes of prices over per MWh as gas unavailability in the Buenos Aires region forced several midcost units offline during peak hours In June prices are expected to continue strengthening to the per MWh range on average Beyond June price pressures are expected to remain negative as increasing hydro output new and returning lowcost thermal capacity and the end of gas constraints push average prices back toward per MWh or below by August or September CERA Alert Title US Gas Markets Reach New Heights Where Will It Stop Author N American Gas Team EMail Category Alert Product Line North American Gas URL clientnagaltnagaltabhtml Summary The US gas market enters the month of June with prices at the highest level since deregulation At the Henry Hub prices have surged to as high as per MMBtuup from less than per MMBtu during April Behind this has been a building and serious shortfall of supply the result of disappointing gas production levels and surging gas demand for power generation The gap between these two forces has been met through storage inventories with injections so far this spring running between and Bcf per day below last years rate The continued tension between these two forces will keep the pressure on prices this summer and the need to inject gas into storage will price out increments of demand CERA Alert Title Monthly BriefingThe Pressure Cooker Author N American Natural Gas Team EMail Category Alert Product Line North American Gas URL clientnagaltnagaltabhtml Summary Pressure remains extremely strong in the United States gas market as three factorsthe increasing power generation demand lower storage inventories and US wellhead supply still struggling to reboundcall into question the ability to build storage to a level adequate for next winter Prices are being supported also by concurrent strength in oil and liquids markets making traditional alternatives to gas much more expensive than in recent years In this environment intense competition between power generation demand and storage injections will continue throughout the summerwith pressure increasing into July as temperatures risewith the result that gas will continue to price at the high levels necessary to discourage enduse demand CERA expects a July average price of per MMBtu CERA Decision Brief Title Western Canada Supply Growth Getting Nowhere Faster Author Eynon Small EMail Category Decision Brief Product Line North American Gas URL clientnagdbnagdbabhtml Summary As US supply declines and demand grows current high gas prices are reinforced but western Canadian gas supply growth appears to be faltering when it is needed most Both transitory factors and enduring trends underlie the disappointing production growth results The largely weatherrelated transitory factors have had a nearterm impact on drilling and connection activity The underlying trends have been developing slowly over time More shallow gas wells have been drilled in the past three to four years and created a shift to higher average basin declines and lower average per well production rates Thus more shallow wells are needed just to replace production With a shift to more exploration and deeper drilling higher supply growth rates are possible but if that does not occur other potential supply sources may step in Significant Arctic reserves in the McKenzie Delta and the Alaskan North Slope are once again entering the spotlight Coal bed methane has become a str ong source of US supply Although now ignored in Canada it may become a future source of Canadian gas CERA Watch Title Reaching New Heights Author N American Natural Gas Team EMail Category Watch Product Line North American Gas URL clientnagwchnagwchabhtml Summary Fundamentals have taken center stage as building demand pressure accompanies US supply declines Storage inventories have been significantly reduced and the pressure for storage injections is likely to intensify as we head into the summer months Demanddriven growth continues as completions of gasfired power generation plants accelerate to a pace above megawatts per year and economic growth stimulates electricity demand The result is a higherprice playing field for natural gas with the average Henry Hub price likely to reach per MMBtu for its highest level since the development of spot markets CERA Private Report Title Closing the Utility Stock Valuation Gap Does Strategy Matter Author Parshley EMail Category Private Report Product Line North American Power URL clientnapprnapprabhtml Summary The stock market has been delivering an unsettling message to the utility industry Traditionally undervalued in the market the sector is trading at a historically wide percent discount to Standard and Poors SP The SP Utility Index over the past months gained only percent with huge gains by some energy companies offset by a percent drop in stock price for electric utilities Yet early this year the SPU outpaced all other industry groups How should constantly evolving utilities in this wideopen sector form a strategic plan to maximize shareholder value while achieving success The value of electric utility merger and acquisition deals for a record billionwas double the value But are these choices ahead of the curve And when will the market catch up Three groups of new companies with distinctive strategies may provide clues to the new strategic landscape multiservice and technology providers superregionals and global power and energy companies Three other strategic choices are considered in evaluating responses to these challenges CERA Decision Brief Title The Summer Spot Electricity Markets Outlook Divergent Trends in Price Volatility Author Makovich Sannicandro EMail Category Decision Brief Product Line North American Power URL clientnapdbnapdbabhtml Summary While several regional power markets are likely to see a repeat of price spikes this summer other markets are likely to see a reversal in price volatility as supplydemand balances improve dramatically One way to interpret forward markets is as a consensus of market expectations Therefore forward prices for onpeak wholesale power reflect the common expectation that prices will spike as high asor even higher thanin A significant disconnect exists between the forward market prices and market fundamentals for the upcoming summer in some regional markets CERA Alert Title Atlantic Basin Gasoline Markets Soar Author Meyers EMail Category Alert Product Line Refined Products URL clientrpaltrpaltabhtml Summary Spurred by supply concerns at the start of the summer driving season spot gasolinetocrude oil price differentials on both sides of the north Atlantic have soared to the highest levels seen since the Gulf War In CERAs view this

unleaded gasoline surged to per barrel measured against WTI up per barrel over the strong April value of Apparent demand for gasoline skyrocketed to million barrels per day mbd in response to the start of the summer driving season Despite increases in the reported demand for distillate and jetkerosene these markets did not experience the same monthovermonth strength in differentials dropping to and per barrel versus WTI respectively CERA Alert Title Refined Products LineEuropean Markets Author Refined Products Team EMail Category Alert Product Line Refined Products URL clientrpaltrpaltabhtml Summary As higher crude oil prices started to reduce the high product differentials to Brent and thus lower refinery margins refiners attempted to prevent this situation from worsening by reducing throughputs However very tight markets for gasoline and to a lesser extent for automotive diesel helped to limit the fall in those products values Meanwhile fuel oil discounts to crude oil widened in May driving down simplehydroskimming margins In recent weeks the combination of lower primary products inventories and reductions in operations at some refineries has helped differentials to recover This has pushed margins to above Mays averages although still below Aprils peaks CERA Alert Title Recent Actions Signal Progress Toward MTBE Elimination Author Stackpole EMail Category Alert Product Line Refined Products URL clientrpaltrpaltabhtml Summary The close scrutiny that federal reformulated gasoline RFG now faces from the media and public officials owing to Midwestern market price spikes has not stopped the inexorable political progress toward eliminating methyl tertiary butyl ether MTBE use in the US gasoline pool Additional signposts including heightened congressional debate over legislation eliminating MTBE use and state actions to ban MTBE continue to emerge that point the way toward MTBEfree gasoline in the United States CERA Alert Title Refined Products Market Update Author Refined Products Team EMail Category Alert Product Line Refined Products URL clientrpaltrpaltabhtml Summary Refined products markets continue to display marked regional differences In the Atlantic Basin low gasoline inventories in both the United States and Europe which resulted from many months of OPEC production restraint continue to dominate the market and gasoline differentials above crude are at their highest level in over ten years Although signs are emerging of a possible correction in the North American market in the coming month the gasoline season will almost certainly be the strongest experienced by Atlantic Basin refiners in many years In contrast Asia Pacific spot refining margins were weak through most of June until the recent accident at KPCs Mina alAhmadhi refinery prompted a quick strengthening in prompt Singapore margins However with ample unused refining capacity available east of Suez and the likelihood of a partial restart of the KPC refinery in July CERAs outlook is for that strength to be of short duration CERA Alert Title New Peaks New Prices Author Zenker Moritzburke Snyder EMail Category Alert Product Line Western Energy URL clientcealtcealtabhtml Summary In the West July typically marks the start of the summer cooling season and steadily rising power prices CERA expect the West to be the only region in North America with a yearoveryear increase in peak electricity demand Power prices already established new record highs in June suggesting that as demand reaches its peak in the coming months western power markets will continue to experience increased volatility compared with last years levels The convergence of higher gas prices growing power demand and reduced hydroelectric energy production compared with levels is pushing up western power prices Greater utilization of gasfired generators within the West has supported western differentials and contributed to high gas prices throughout North America Western gas prices should continue to be strong boosted by continuing increases in regional gas demand for power generation and pressure across North America to inject gas into storage in anticipation of summer power loads CERA Alert Title Oil Market Turmoil OPEC Seeks a Shortterm Fix Author World Oil Team EMail Category Alert Product Line World Oil URL clientwoaltwoaltabhtml Summary Driven by strong demandespecially in the recovering Asian economies and the United Statesoil prices both WTI and Brent have again broken the levela mark that is of particular significance in

volatile oil market is the new OPECand its successful implementation of a strategy to keep supply one half step behind demanddriving inventories down for crude with the side effect of lowering stocks for several products in markets such as the United States and Europe Three features of the current oil market are supporting prices Market supported Psychology enhanced OPEC driven CERA Alert Title OPECs Cautious New Agreement Author World Oil Team EMail Category Alert Product Line World Oil URL clientwoaltwoaltabhtml Summary OPECs agreement to raise its production quota beginning July by barrels per day to million barrels per day is consistent with its strategy of restraining supply to maintain oil inventories at relatively low levels The gain in supply is a shortterm fix meant to alleviate political pressure for increased production and to push prices below but keep them in a mid to upper s range end Follow URL for HTML Version of this message only Note Should the above URL

PM on PM To cc Subject The Storm Arrives CERA Alert CERA Alert Sent Fri December Title The Storm Arrives Author N American Gas Team EMail Category Alert Product Line North American Gas URL clientnagaltnagaltabhtml Cold Weather Path Colderthannormal weather through November and forecasted cold for the first half of December throughout the Midwest and Northeast have driven gas prices well into record territory with the January Henry Hub price trading near per MMBtu and closing above on the New York Mercantile Exchange December This sixweek cold period and the quick depletion of already low storage inventories has established prices at or above CERAs cold weather path for the remainder of the winter and in all likelihood beyond If December storage withdrawals are as high as CERA now expects the gas market will remain on the cold weather path through as well even if weather returns to normal during the second half of December The enormous increase in storage injections that is likely to be required next summer would keep the pressure on gas markets throughout the year So long as weather remains cold or even normal this winter a new market dynamic is in effect in which gas prices interact more with distillate fuel oil prices rather than with those of residual fuel oil In addition gas is likely to have an increasingly direct influence on power prices in the growing number of regions in which gasfired generation is now on the margin in winter This winter the gas market is likely to rediscover for the first time in decades which end users value natural gas most highly and which ultimately do not The gas market is also rediscovering the value of firm pipeline capacity particularly into market areas Both the West Coast and the Northeast have experienced even more extreme price spikes with daily prices in both regions peaking above per MMBtu Indeed the shortage of gas in California is so acute that prices above per MMBtu have been reported If sustained these price levels will induce a political reaction that will reverberate throughout the industry Storage UpdateEven High Seems Low Panic in the market yesterday was eased somewhat as storage withdrawals for the week ending December at billion cubic feet Bcf proved to be less than expected This withdrawal was half the previous weeks rate and in CERAs view actual withdrawals for both weeks probably lie between these two readings In some cases successive weeks smooth out volatile readings in the AGA survey But even the Bcf figure though a significant retreat from the previous weeks rate is high by historical standards One would have to go back to to find a higher reading for a comparable week in the AGA survey Inventories as of the beginning of December at an estimated Bcf see Table were Bcf below the yearearlier level and this deficit is likely to increase substantially during December If weather forecasts indicating colderthannormal weather through midDecember in key heating markets hold true storage withdrawals for the month will average approximately Bcf per day This rate is an increase from CERAs normal weather estimate of Bcf per day and even this rate depends on weather returning to normal in mid December This level of withdrawals would leave only Bcf in storage on January an inventory Bcf below the yearearlier level Assuming normal weather such an inventory would place storage on track to reach a March minimum of Bcf Bcf below the record low At a US inventory level this low many storage operators would be dipping into baseload gas in order to support service even to firm gas customers Physical deliverability from storage fields will be significantly lower this year in midwinter forcing a greater reliance on pipeline gas and peaking facilities during January and February The actual reduction in field deliverability is impossible to quantify but storage inventories cannot be withdrawn at steady rates throughout the winter withdrawal rates decline with inventory as field pressure is reduced Pressure in the market will be reinforced and extended through and probably into During the past two summers high prices have been required to discourage demand and allow overall US storage injections to reach barely trillion cubic feet Tcf If normal weather holds for the remainder of this winter Tcf of injectionswhich would be nearly impossible to achievewould be required during if inventories are to recover to Tcf at peak If weather this winter is merely normal from midDecember through March going into winter next year the United States will have considerably less gas in storage Reaching even the Bcf level according to CERA estimates see Table would require an additional Bcf of injections next year and that alone would prove challenging PriceThe Cold Weather Path The weakness of storage inventories and the demand pressure in both core and power generation markets created by the cold weather have caused prices to move onto and even above CERAs cold weather path for this winter see Table Storage inventories would become perilously low if the current forecast for cold weather through midDecember proves accurate and the injections required next summer would keep pressure in the market intense For these reasons CERAs outlook for prices for January and throughout now reflects the cold weather path Prices could take an even higher path particularly if colderthannormal weather endures beyond midDecember or returns on a sustained basis in January or February Several forces that could weaken prices during will begin to enter the market during the winter but these are offset by demand volatility in the winter and the requirement to rebuild storage inventories once the winter is over Such factors include a building US supply capability growing imports softening oil prices allowing a lower floor for prices once the winter ends and potentially weakening economic growth Although the influence of these factors will increase it is unlikely to match the huge injection requirement that appears more and more certain next summer DemandThe Difficult Next Round of Switching With gas prices hitting new record highs CERA expects some additional demand to be priced out of the market Because gas has priced above residual fuel oil for most weeks since May however the easiest fuel switching in the power generation and industrial sectors has already occurred Even though gas prices are currently above the level of distillate approximately per MMBtu in New York switching from gas to distillate requires changes in longstanding consumer habit will occur only over time and is likely limited in volume Significant switching to distillate would quickly raise the price of distillate itself There are four major sources of additional demand response in industrial markets Additional switching to resid in industrial boilers The next increment of demand to come out of the market is likely to be in the industrial sector through additional fuel switching to resid and to some extent to distillate These markets will continue to show some flexibility but will not represent a large volume CERA estimates that the industrial boiler market has probably already begun to lose small amounts less than Bcf per day in switching to resid given the consistency of gas price premiums greater than per MMBtu Investment in restoring switching capability As premiums move far beyond this level industrial end users can be expected to take a closer look at reinvigorating their switching capability beyond their initial shortterm levels However such a change would require investment by industrial end users and the availability of resid in oil markets CERA estimates that with focused investment over the course of a number of months to perhaps a year switching to resid could eventually reach as high as Bcf per day There is already some movement here given the impact of high gas prices on earnings energy prices have already begun to receive management attention Switching to distillate US Department of Energy data suggest that industrial end users have a theoretical capability of switching nearly Bcf per day to distillate in the short term This switch would represent additional distillate demand of over barrels per day bd in a US market of million barrels This marginal demand would move the distillate price in tandem with gas price and any additional switching among power generators to distillate would reinforce this price correlation In addition the availability of distillate inventories on site should restrict the quick switching to short periods of time and will not offer a longterm solution to tight markets Shutting down industrial plants Also offering some flexibility is the shutdown of manufacturing plants that use gas as a feedstock The major feedstock consumers are the ammonia and methanol industries and not surprisingly given the tight margins available manufacturers of ammonia and of methanol continue to show suppressed gas demand However in the short term only a portion of ammonia production is at risk Whereas the production needs of merchant facilities along the Gulf Coast is relatively readily replaced by imports substitution becomes more difficult away from the coast because of transportation logistics and for facilities whose production is linked to valueadded fertilizer products Hence CERA still estimates that even with nonexistent margins substantial ammonia production would continue with additional losses of perhaps million cubic feet MMcf per day of potential demand in addition to the facilities that have already closed Extraordinarily high gas prices will also hasten the shuttering of North American methanol capacity putting at risk another to MMcf per day of gas demand for that sector Switching that could occur in boiler use is concentrated in the chemicals paper and refining sectors in the South and the food products sector in the Midwest Continuing feedstock losses would be concentrated in the South Central region For process users even extraordinarily high gas prices are expected to have little impact on the use of gas in the short term Energy costs are not the dominant component of production costs for these users and a physical changeover would be timeintensive and elemental in its impact on enduse product quality The NortheastCold Weather Operations Begin All of the Northeast pipelines have issued notices to customers that they either have imposed or are highly likely to need to impose transportation restrictions of various types The most common restriction is to nonprimary firm services secondary and interruptible type services which will be scheduled for the next several days on many pipelines Other pipelines have issued balancing requirements whereby receipts and deliveries must match Even hourly flow orders have also been implemented These actions are normal for winter operations when a cold period is expected Whereas the firm market for natural gas is rarely affected by these restrictions the spot market becomes much more volatile as interruptible supplies dry up The spot market primarily made up of nonfirm customers has had a dramatic reaction to the diminished availability of delivered spot gas into the market area as has been reflected by the volatility of the cash market this week The result of these restrictions of nonprimary firm services has been an expansion of basis to Henry Hub At one point gas for nextday delivery to New York traded near per MMBtu delivered although the average price was closer to These high spikes are the result of very thinly traded volumes of gas Although these restrictions will likely ease as temperatures return closer to normal CERA now expects basis into the New York citygate to average per MMBtu for December and per MMBtu for January end Follow URL for PDF version of this Alert with associated tables Come Shoot the Rapids with

to shut in operations because of high natural gas prices are nevertheless making money by selling gas futures contracts Terra Industries and Mississippi Chemical Corp became the latest companies to announce cutbacks related to current natural gas costs Iowabased Terra Industries said it had sold off a portion of its December natural gas purchases and shutdown of its Verdigis OK ammonia facility The company had previously reported that it would not operate its Bytheville AR and Beaumont TX facilities during the month of December as well In a similar maneuver Mississippi Chemical Corp a producer of nitrogen phosphorus and potassiumbased products in Mississippi Louisiana and New Mexico reported the sale of all of its natural gas futures contracts from January forward in order to take full advantage of the opportunity uncovered by soaring natural gas prices Mississippi Chemical said it expects to realize a pretax gain of million in its second fiscal quarter ending Dec from the recently sold contracts The problem lies in the fact that escalating natural gas costs are not being mimicked by chemical prices An overabundance on the market has kept chemical prices relatively low while gas prices a feedstock for some chemicals continue to climb The difference in the latest shutdowns is that the companies involved have openly announced they have sold their gas contracts off because it is more profitable than manufacturing their products said Ron Phillips of The Fertilizer Institute Duke Energys Ken Nyiri divisional director of strategic planning and research commented on Mississippi Chemicals transactions I guess they probably made about a MMBtu margin on the gas which is significantly more than they could make on the ammonia in fact they would have lost unit Their ammonia was probably costing them about ton to make with gas bought at MMBtu in November and the market today is at so basically they would break even on their ammonia production costs By selling the gas at around MMBtu they made MMBtu It was just a question of do they convert the gas to ammonia and make nothing on it or do they sell the gas and make million Michael L Bennett executive vice president of Terra said The natural gas price increase since our December requirements were purchased for Verdigris permitted us to sell a portion of those purchases and generate higher gross profits than could be realized from selling the products manufactured with the natural gas We will evaluate the economics of bringing Verdigris back to full production near the end of December when Januarys natural gas purchase commitments must be made Terra estimates the idled facilities represent and of the companys North American ammonia UAN urea and methanol manufacturing capacity respectively The production of all four chemicals are heavily dependent on natural gas Phillips said The latest data we had in October was that of the companies that we survey which is not the entire ammonia market but a good bit of it we were looking at operating rates of Currently a total of million tonsyear of ammonia production capacity is out of service out of about million tonsyear of production capacity Clearly some of these folks have been selling their gas rather than producing ammonia said Nyiri Its the prudent thing to do I think in this marketplace Buy your ammonia if you can At gas that costs you ton to make the ammonia which is more than the current market is willing to pay A spokeswoman for Mississippi Chemical said the company held on to its December gas contracts and has been operating at varied levels of capacity throughout see Daily GPI June Depending on what the gas prices are and what our product prices are around the JanuaryFebruary time frame we will make decisions then on our operations rate capacity said Melinda Hood a Mississippi Chemical spokeswoman Charles O Dunn CEO of Mississippi Chemical said We remain committed to the nitrogen business and our customers but we also have to take advantage of opportunities to optimize cash flow during these challenging times It is our belief that the current unprecedented natural gas prices are unlikely to be sustained during the intermediate term stated Dunn As a result we felt it was in the companys best interest to sell our futures positions to lock in the substantial gain afforded by the recent increase in natural gas prices Going forward we will continue to determine operating levels for our plants based on the relationship between natural gas prices nitrogen product prices and our customers requirements as we have been doing for some time International imports are also hurting US producers Currently there is a surplus of ammonia in the international market which is holding ammonia prices down US fertilizer producers cant compete with the international market Gas prices are centsMMBtu in Russia cents to MMBtu in Argentina and Venezuela and MMBtu in Trinidad The US imports million tons of ammonia each year Fertilizers represent of the demand for ammonia in the United States Terra Industries said its facilities would resume production as soon as it became economical again whether from gas prices declining or nitrogen and methanol prices rising just as long as prices reach levels allowing positive cash flows Nyiri said he believes relief is in sight He pointed out that the ammonia market has been sitting around the ton level for the last several months but believes ammonia prices will have to increase entering the next planting season Ive got my model peaking out around ton in April or

Pressure Cooker CERA Alert CERA Alert Sent Thu June Title Monthly BriefingThe Pressure Cooker Author N American Natural Gas Team EMail Category Alert Product Line North American Gas URL cfmtrackeprofilecfmum Pressure remains extremely strong in the United States gas market as three factorsincreasing power generation demand lower storage inventories and US wellhead supply still struggling to reboundcall into question the ability to build storage to a level adequate for next winter As strong as gas market fundamentals are gas prices are being supported also by concurrent strength in oil and liquids markets making traditional alternatives to gas much more expensive than in recent years In this environment intense competition between power generation demand and storage injections will continue throughout the summerwith pressure increasing into July as temperatures riseand gas will continue to price at the high levels necessary to discourage enduse demand The per million British thermal units MMBtu increase in gas prices since the beginning of May has already driven responses among end users First gas is now pricing at a slight premium to residual fuel oil on the East Coast and gas will likely lose approximately million cubic feet MMcf per day of demand to residual fuel oil this summer relative to last summer Second several ammonia manufacturing facilities have begun to shut down Equally telling however is that heat in any one region of the countrymost recently the Westis all that is required to sustain gas prices above at the Henry Hub despite relatively moderate temperatures elsewhere and demand reductions in industrial and other power markets Underlying pressures are such that prices are likely to rise on average from current levels as higher temperatures arrive For these reasons CERA expects prices to average at the Henry Hub during July see Table and even greater volatility is possible The intense competition and need to price out enduse demand mean that the market is vulnerable to spikes above per MMBtu amid heat waves this summer Gas StorageInjections Increase but Little Relief Yet The gas market experienced a small measure of relief in early June as storage injections finally reached a pace closer to historical averages with the American Gas Association AGA reporting billion cubic feet Bcf of injections during each of the weeks ending June and However these injections did little to reduce a deficit that is now close to Bcf on a yearoveryear basis and conditions may not again be as favorable as they have been recently for injections for many weeks or even months to come As temperatures rise through the end of the month injections are likely to slow so that for June CERA expects an average injection rate of approximately Bcf per day The deficit that stood at an estimated Bcf as of the end of May see Table on an inventory level of approximately Bcf is expected to rise slightly during June to Bcf despite a healthy injection rate for the first nine days of the month With US wellhead supply still running an estimated to Bcf per day below yearearlier levels and with added imports from Canada just offsetting this decline even the moderate demand growth expected for July relative to last July will make reducing the deficit a difficult task Each month in which this Bcf deficit carries forward increases the likelihood that inventories will be at their lowest maximum ever this October Injections like those in the recent two weeks would have to continue into July for this pattern to reverse in a significant way an unlikely event that would occur only under very mild weather conditions Regional Markets With the exception of the Rocky Mountains western differentials have been supported by waves of hot weather and extremely strong gas demand for power generation within the region This strong demand is pulling supplies from the Permian and San Juan Basins to the West Coast and has pushed up capacity utilization on the Southwest pipelines into California Prices at the California border have been particularly strong averaging over a premium to the Henry Hub so far this month Continued strong western demand looks likely to support prices within the region through July as power loads remain strong and hydroelectric output declines In addition the early heat waves have begun to erode the California storage surplus although inventories in the region as a whole remain strong see Table CERAs outlook by region follows Rockies Continuing strong supply growth and low seasonal demand have pushed up exports out of the Rocky Mountains region High utilization rates on export pipelines will keep Rocky Mountain differentials wide during the rest of the summer CERA expects an average July differential to the Henry Hub of per MMBtu San Juan The pull on supplies from California has narrowed the differential between the San Juan Basin and the Henry Hub and this West Coast pull looks likely to remain strong through the summer CERA expects a differential between the San Juan Basin and the Henry Hub of per MMBtu during July Permian and MidContinent As Texas power loads increase the competition from the West Coast and Texas markets for Permian supplies should intensify Permian differentials which have been averaging around per MMBtu to the Henry Hub should narrow CERA expects a per MMBtu differential for July MidContinent supplies should price just below Permian supplies at an per MMBtu differential to the Henry Hub Chicago Chicago differentials continue to trade around per MMBtu to the Henry Hub and although hot weather and climbing demand within the region could put some upward pressure on those differentials ample seasonal pipeline capacity into the region will limit pressure CERA expects a July differential of per MMBtu Northeast New York citygate differentials have a higher floor this summer namely higher fuel costs from the Gulf Coast as a result of gas The result has been differentials above from Transco Station but closer to from the Henry Hub As power generation load reaches its peak however differentials can rise even in summer Shortlived power load peaks may lift weekly New York differentials into the s but for the month of July CERA expects the New York differential to average Canadian MarketsDemand Still Down Canadian demand continues to be down on a yearoveryear basis Volumes on TransCanada Pipeline are MMcf below levels at this time last year and Alberta demand is MMcf below both of these reductions are primarily storage related Weak storage injections driven in large part by the lack of an adequate summerwinter price spread continue to place inventories further behind levels Although inventories are still well above the fiveyear average unless injections increase it is more likely that endofseason inventories will be comparable to the fiveyear average Bcf rather than to levels Bcf Export volumes continue to be slightly higher than last year Thus far in June flows on Northern Border Pipeline are similar to while PGE GTNW is currently operating MMcf higher Demand on the West Coast is expected to continue this trend for the summer Alberta supply build for June is likely to be flat with levels An outage pattern similar to last years has emerged TCENOVA has had maintenance projects ongoing in June but the supply reduction is primarily the result of plant turnarounds Thus far in June reductions in supply because of maintenance have been as high as MMcf but should average MMcf for the month Even though June is expected to be flat yearoveryear the fact that this maintenance reduction is less than maintenance reductions implies that a return to supply growth has not yet occurred Supply is still expected to start showing growth in the second half of the year largely in the fourth quarter as a result of the increased level of drilling The annual average supply is expected to be around MMcf per day higher than in as the result of the return to growth in Alberta and modest growth in British Columbia again primarily later in the year as well as the new production from Ft Liard that is now onstream The NYMEX and Henry Hub price strength is being felt in Canada AECO is expected to average C per gigajoule GJ US per MMBtu for June with a differential in the low USs July is expected to average C per GJ US per MMBtu The HenrytoAECO differential is likely to remain relatively high until storage injections increase the demand Follow URL for PDF version of this Monthly Briefing with associated tables end

The West Keeping Its Fingers Crossed CERA Alert CERA Alert Sent Wed July Title The West Keeping Its Fingers Crossed Author Zenker Moritzburke Snyder EMail Category Alert Product Line Western Energy URL cfmtrackeprofilecfmum A strong dose of summer weather in June propelled Westwide demand levels up by nearly percent over the same period in These higher demand levels provided the years first example of the power price spikes that can be produced when the Wests tight capacity intersects with normal summer load levels lowerthannormal hydroelectric levels strong gas prices and Californias immature wholesale power market structure As power markets reacted in June with unprecedented price strength throughout the region regulators and the California Independent System Operator ISO intervened to dampen markets from a maximum of per megawatthour MWh to per MWh Although some market participants have filed protests at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to raise or eliminate the caps utilities legislators and consumer advocates are moving to protect consumers or completely redesign what they perceive as a flawed market As western markets move through the critical JulyAugust peak electricity demand period market participants and regulators alike are wondering if power supplies will be sufficient and if price levels will rival those in June CERA expects that western supplies will be adequate under normal summer weather conditions barring abnormal unit and transmission line outages However normal August weather conditions will push demand levels significantly higher than in June creating an even tighter supplydemand balance straining the ability of the transmission system to supply key demand regions adequately A hot weather event could exhaust both instate and imported supplies for California The tight supply and demand situation will almost certainly prompt a strong price response similar to that in June This will fuel the unease of regulators in states that have restructured their markets and in those that are considering restructuring Even as regulators continued support of restructured power markets begins to waver a weather event that forces regional blackouts would force regulators to intervene CERAs outlook for August power markets is driven by High peak loads Under normal weather conditions Westwide August loads will be on average megawatts MW higher than last August The peak load in California is expected to push capacity margins to percent even after curtailing interruptible load Lower hydroelectric output As the West enters its peak load period hydroelectric production is expected to decline systemwide by roughly average megawatts aMW from July to August Compared with the high sustained output of last August hydroelectric output this August although roughly average on a historical basis will be roughly aMW percent lower High levels of gasfired generation Compared with August higher utilization rates along with gas prices that have climbed per million British thermal units MMBtu will increase the incremental cost of energy production by over per MWh Although CERA expects power prices in August to diverge from production costs owing to the expected supply tightness higher production costs will create a higher floor for energy prices in all periods of the day The extremely tight power supplydemand balance within the West and within California specifically has resulted in unprecedented high summer gas demand for power generation This high demand levelcombined with seasonal storage injection needs in Californiahas pushed up utilization rates on pipelines into California and pushed Topock differentials over per MMBtu to the Henry Hub Strong demand should continue through August in the West and support premium pricing at Topock The Rocky Mountains represent the opposite extreme to the high premium placed on Topock deliveries In the Rockies supply is building relative to export pipeline capacity and market access is becoming a challenge Weak seasonal demand compounds the problem the strong western demand for gas for power generation does not extend to the Rockies Generation within the region remains nearly all coalfired These regional pressures should remain a feature of western gas markets through September Moderate summer weather and reassuring injection rates nationwide during recent weeks have allowed some easing in prices at the Henry Hub However summer is not yet over and absolute storage inventories are still at critical levels Higher gas prices are likely to resurface Regional Power Market Drivers August demand under normal weather is expected to rise by an additional percent or nearly aMW over average June levels see Table Peak demand levels should exceed those in June as well with a coincident peak over the whole Western Systems Coordinating Council WSCC of MW expected under normal weather conditions in a percent increase over the weathermuted peak California alone should experience peak loads that are approximately MW higher than peak levels in June Available generation capacity in the West has been at normal levels for this time of year although coalfired plants are responding to a record production year with repeated but shortlived outages The steady decline in hydroelectric generation will remove aMW from the West resource base when compared with July levels and about aMW since June although reservoir refilling operations temporarily removed significant quantities of hydroelectric generation during portions of June Given hydro operators economic interest in maximizing onpeak production at the expense of offpeak production the loss of capacity during the onpeak period will be lower than these levels August will be a critical month for the heavily importdependent state of California While the state will be drawing approximately aMW of imports during August to meet demands during peak periods CERA expects the level of imports to exceed MW during peak demand conditions The Southwests need to supply native demand first will limit its ability to export to California and lower yearoveryear hydroelectric production in the Pacific Northwest will limit exports from that region Pacific Northwest CERA expects Pacific Northwest demand in August to climb by nearly aMW when compared with June levels The water supply for the Pacific Northwest has declined to percent of normal levels for the Lower Columbia owing to warmerthannormal weather in June In addition normal seasonal decline in runoff levels will drop about aMW from the resource base when compared with levels in June see Table Generation plant operators have responded to both growing native demand and a robust export market by running coal and gasfired generation at high levels Although less than MW of gasfired generation is currently available in the region it has been running at high utilization rates High energy demand in California for Pacific Northwest energy will keep differentials low between the regions As in June Pacific Northwest prices will respond in kind to the volatility CERA expects to occur in California in August In addition if hot weather in the Pacific Northwest pressures regional energy reserves local prices will rise to keep energy in the region potentially causing prices in the Pacific Northwest to move higher than those to the south California California is entering the peak load season with relatively little generating capacity down for maintenance Although hydroelectric output continues to decline statewide reservoir storage levels remain high at roughly percent of normal Nevertheless declining hydroelectric production is expected to remove about aMW when compared with hydroelectric production levels in June Normal summer weather will push demand in the state up by about aMW over June levels which were high see Table Californias peak load is expected to exceed MW compared with a peak load in June of approximately MW MW on the states ISO system alone according to its own estimate Assuming normal plant outage rates this demand level will necessitate the import of about MW of energy to meet the statewide peak Even after curtailing the approximately MW of interruptible load available for tight supply situations the state has a precarious percent capacity margin during the system peak An extreme hot weather event could push state loads up by an additional MW Outages are likely if additional imports are not available A capacity limit of MW will be in place during the summer for energy exports from the Pacific Northwest to Northern California The import limit from the Pacific Northwest to southern California will be MW Rockies and Southwest August demand levels in the combined RockiesSouthwest region will increase only slightly above levels in August climbing approximately aMW as loads in the regionunlike the rest of the belowaverage WSCCwere near normal last August Even so August loads will increase demand by over aMW when compared with levels in June of this year As with last year and this June supplies in the region should be sufficient to meet peak demand conditions under normal weather although growing loads in the RockiesSouthwest region have reduced its ability to supply neighboring regions with energy during peak demand conditions High loads driven by hot weather will keep the regions prices high Differentials between the region and California will be tight but California having tighter supplydemand balances will need to price at a premium to attract energy The highcapacity transmission ties between the RockiesSouthwest and the California market which is about percent the size of the RockiesSouthwest market will ensure that prices in the RockiesSouthwest stay close behind California prices whenever loads are high in California Regional Gas Market Drivers Evidence of pipeline bottlenecks has emerged across the West and supply and demand forces over the next year look likely to intensify these pressures Since the Northern Border expansion in late narrow northsouth and eastwest differentials across pricing points defined the market This summer the continuing supply growth in the Rocky Mountains has widened differentials between the Rockies and the rest of the West At Topock increasing gas demand in California and high utilization rates have resulted in high premiums Overall in North American gas markets strong storage injection rates in recent weeks have allowed some easing in pricesfrom an early July Henry Hub price of per MMBtu to under per MMBtu However despite these high injection rates the supplydemand balance and absolute level of storage inventories remain precarious Summer is not over and higher nationwide power loads in weeks to come will likely cut into storage injections and boost prices The ongoing competition between power and storage for supply should support an average Henry Hub price of per MMBtu in August Through the end of the summer differentials in the West should hold near current levels The pressure of growing Rocky Mountain supply will continue until heating loads start climbing in the fall In California high seasonal power loads should continue through August with hot weather and continued declines in hydroelectric generation Demand strength is expected to continue Across the West August demand for gas should climb from billion cubic feet Bcf per day in June to Bcf per day buoyed by an increase in gas demand for power generation see Table California High gas demand for power generation within California will continue through August CERA expects an increase from the states June demand levels of Bcf per day to Bcf per day during August The increase stems from declines in hydroelectric generation and increases in overall power loads Total demand is expected to exceed last years demand level by Bcf per day This will increase flows on pipelines into California reduce the states storage surplus and sustain high prices CERA expects pipeline utilization rates during August to average percent see Table CERA expects an August TopockHenry Hub differential of per MMBtu see Table Pacific Northwest Despite the extremely high prices at Topock and high demand in California until recently gas at Malin priced at a slight discount to Henry Hub prices After averaging per MMBtu below the Henry Hub during the third quarter last year the differential so far during the third quarter this year is per MMBtu below the Hub This week Malin is pricing at a per MMBtu premium relative to the Henry Hub The TopockMalin differential has swelled to over per MMBtu signaling intraCalifornia pipeline capacity constraints Two factors pressured Malin differentials during the early summer Pressure on Rocky Mountain and AECO differentials Prices in the two areas supplying the Pacific Northwest are under some pressure Increasing supplies in the Rockies are beginning to reach the limits of export capacity and put downward pressure on Rockies prices by limiting external market access At AECO although export capacity out of the province is available almost all of that excess capacity accesses eastern Canada on TransCanada Pipeline Pipelines into the United States are running near capacity Because of TransCanadas limited ability to discount interruptible transport the available space is more expensive and therefore the last to be filled Low early summer regional demand Gas demand in the Pacific Northwest is limited during late spring and early summer by declines in heating loads and very strong hydroelectric output Even in a normal or dry hydroelectric year seasonal runoff holds down gas demand for power generation in May and June even as gas demand for power generation begins climbing in California Increasing power loads are already evident The first factor will likely endure until heating season begins in late fall and regional demand in the Rockies and western Canada begins climbing However gas demand for power generation in the Pacific Northwest has increased already this summer and will continue to climb through the end of July and into August as hydroelectric generation wanes This added demand million cubic feet MMcf per day above June demand levelswill provide some support for Malin prices and limited support for Rockies and AECO prices MalinHenry Hub differentials are expected to average per MMBtu above the Henry Hub price during August Rocky Mountains Pressure on regional supplies within the Rockies continues as exports out of the region reach new highs Differentials to the Henry Hub have widened to over per MMBtu and although prices in the rest of the West will gain some support from high power loads regional demand in the Rockies is expected to remain near low seasonal levels through August August demand is expected to average Bcf per day in the region approximately equal to Junes Bcf per day total demand Demand begins to build during September but until the heating season begins in October Rocky Mountain prices will lag well below prices in the rest of the West CERA expects a Rocky MountainHenry Hub differential of per MMBtu during August Although some narrowing in Rocky Mountain differentials looks likely as seasonal demand increases through the fall the rapid build in supply in the region will likely keep differentials wide during CERA expects a supply build this year of nearly MMcf per day followed by a build of over MMcf per day during Currently approximately MMcf per day of excess pipeline export exists out of the region with the largest increment on Transcolorado into the San Juan Basin Next summer all capacity will likely run close to full Until export pipelines expandthe first likely expansion is Trailblazerdifferentials will remain wide For CERA expects an average annual differential below the Henry Hub of per MMBtu Southwest Differentials in the San Juan and Permian Basins have gained considerable strength relative to Henry Hub prices amid the recent hot weather in Texas Permian supplies are pricing at a slight premium to the Henry Hub price and in the San Juan Basin prices have narrowed from an early July differential of per MMBtu to a differential of less than per MMBtu CERA expects demand in the Southwest during August of Bcf per day an increase from Junes level of Bcf per day but the larger Texas market will determine the relative strength of differentials in those two basins CERA expects a San Juan differential of per MMBtu during August with a Permian Basin differential of per MMBtu Differentials between the Rocky Mountains and the San Juan Basin have widened substantially over the past two months with supply increases in the Rocky Mountains Flows on Transcolorado increased from a monthly average of under MMcf per day to over MMcf per day during June Supply in the two regions is following opposite paths Rockies supply is climbing rapidly and San Juan supply has likely peaked and should decline slowly beginning this year CERA expects a decline in supply of MMcf per day during relative to and an additional decline of MMcf per day during Because of these different outlooks wider RockiesSan Juan differentials will persist end Follow URL for PDF version of this Monthly

Prices CERA Alert CERA Alert Sent Fri June Title New Peaks New Prices Author Zenker Moritzburke Snyder EMail Category Alert Product Line Western Energy URL cfmtrackeprofilecfmum In the West July typically marks the start of the summer cooling season which along with waning hydroelectric energy production and the more frequent use of gasfired generators to meet demand causes steadily rising power prices CERA expects the West to be the only region in North America with a yearoveryear increase in peak electricity demand Power prices already established new record highs in June suggesting that as demand reaches its peak during the coming summer months western power markets will continue to experience increased volatility compared with last years levels The convergence of natural gas prices that are much higher than last years levels growing demand for power and reduced hydroelectric energy production when compared with levels in is pushing up western power prices Merchant and other gasfired generators will be pressed into service experiencing their strongest utilization rates since the drought year of Greater utilization of gasfired generators within the West has supported western differentials and contributed to high gas prices throughout North America Western gas prices should continue to be strong boosted by continuing increases in regional gas demand for power generation and pressure across North America to inject gas into storage in anticipation of summer power loads The main drivers of higher power and gas prices when compared with yearearlier levels will be Peak WSCC load season Summer weather will drive loads to the years coincident peak which is most likely to occur during the JulyAugust period but could arrive any time during the June through October airconditioning season CERA expects demand growth of percent in the third quarter compared with levels in which will push Western Systems Coordinating Council WSCC coincident peak demand levels to percent over levels Waning hydroelectric output Hydroelectric production is on its normal downward seasonal slide This resource decline is more visible when compared with the hydro season which was both abundant and prolonged High utilization rates for gasfired generators Growing demand for electricity coupled with a declining availability of hydroelectric energy will drive utilization rates of gasfired power plants to their highest levels since the drought year of Higher fuel prices Western gas prices have remained at per MMBtu above levels Growing yearoveryear gas demand for power generation is providing much of the price pressure in western markets These higher gas prices provide a boost to both onpeak and offpeak power prices of between and per megawatthour MWh Regional Power Market Drivers Power markets in the West are poised to break records for demand peak load and gasfired plant utilization and as a result power prices A return to normal summer weather coupled with growing demand for power will push demand for electricity up by gigawatthours GWh in the US West for the third quarter compared with levels or almost megawatts MW on average see Table This growth in the demand for electricity will also drive peak loads to new highs CERA expects the WSCC coincident peak to be exceeded by percent climbing to nearly MW As was demonstrated by the mild summer of deviations from normal weather could boost or thwart this peak demand growth figure Two key factors will significantly reduce third quarter hydroelectric production levels compared with levels First CERA expects Westwide total season hydroelectric production in of roughly percent of historical average levels substantially lower than the approximately percent of average in Second runoff was prolonged in serving to push a substantial portion of the hydroelectric production into the summer period see Figure On average CERA expects these factors will remove GWh or almost average megawatts aMW from the western resource base compared with levels Exacerbating this decline refilling of reservoirs and flow restrictions to assist fish migration will cause periodic but significant curtailments in power production at key Pacific Northwest hydroelectric facilities Natural gasfired facilities will be called upon to supply most of the expected increase in demand while also replacing hydroelectric resources as they continue to decline This will push average annual utilization rates of gasfired combined cycle steam and cogeneration plants to approximately percent in levels not experienced since the percent annual average utilization rate in a year marked by drought and warmerthannormal summer weather Utilization rates for these facilities will also surge past levels especially this summer CERA anticipates a Westwide third quarter utilization rate of percent for these facilities under normal summer weather conditions compared with percent for the same period of This level of utilization will certainly establish gasfired generation as the floor to power prices during the third quarter during not only the onpeak demand period but the offpeak as well With natural gas prices at per MMBtu higher than levels power prices are boosted by per MWh owing to fuel price increases alone With supply tightness already evident in western power markets the stage is set for increased price volatility compared with levels as episodes of hot weather require increased utilization of lessefficient generators throughout this summer Pacific Northwest The water supply forecast for the Columbia River remains near average but has dropped a couple percentage points from last month Flows are expected to remain at roughly percent of average through September on the Lower Columbia and percent of average on the Upper Columbia Conditions overall are still sufficient to be considered average This return to normal conditions in the Pacific Northwest should produce hydroelectric output nearly GWh percent lower than last year for July and GWh lower for the third quarter as a whole see Table The regions load growth coupled with lower hydro supply will continue to elevate power prices in the Pacific Northwest relative to levels Tighter supply conditions in California and the Southwest will attract energy exports from the Pacific Northwest preserving a differential between the Pacific Northwest and California of about per MWh on average Price differentials between the Pacific Northwest and California have varied dramatically recently with the north at times rising above those to the south owing to local demand and hydroelectric constraints caused by reservoir filling operations Since the end of May volatility in both markets has pushed the difference between daily onpeak prices at COB and those in California from a premium of per MWh to a discount of per MWh within a few days CERA expects that over the long run California markets will clear at a premium as the summer progresses but the differential will vary widely with episodes of Pacific Northwest power pricing at a premium to those in California California Despite belowaverage precipitation and snowpack this year California reservoir storage levels throughout the state are higher than normal ranging between and percent of average for the states primary runoff regions Under these conditions hydroelectric output should be roughly percent GWh below last years levels for the third quarter see Table With a return to normal weather conditions relative to third quarter cooling demand this summer will increase most in California where weather was nearly percent cooler than average last year Recent dayahead power prices in California have drawn attention to the West as the highestcost market if only temporarily in North America Record high temperatures and unscheduled unit outages produced new dayahead price records with power prices on June at per MWh in the dayahead onpeak market and realtime hourly prices at the market cap of per MWh Increased utilization of gasfired generation and daily gas prices of around per MMBtu burnertip in Southern California have kept daily average offpeak prices between and per MWh Notably these higher price have occurred during periods when roughly MW more coalfire generation was available in the West compared with the same period in CERA expects prices to continue to respond to the tight capacity environment this summer Rockies and Southwest During summer the RockiesSouthwest was the only region to experience aboveaverage cooling demand suggesting that normal weather should bring only moderate demand growth of less than percent see Table However growing energy demand in neighboring regions and a large transmission transfer capability will pull energy from the RockiesSouthwest region when excess capacity is available ensuring that prices in the region will remain tightly connected to price levels in other parts of the West Palo Verde prices have generally kept pace with other western markets while maintaining their characteristic premium to the California Power Exchange during spring and early summer CERA expects Southwest prices to strengthen relative to California when summer weather periodically shifts the locus of demand to the Southwest However California prices will maintain a premium on average to those in the Southwest as the effects of the states tight supply situation translates to higher prices than those in either the Southwest or Pacific Northwest Regional Gas Market Drivers Under continuing pressure to inject gas into storage in the face of declining supply and increasing gas demand for power generation gas prices at the Henry Hub are expected to average per MMBtu in July The strong demand for gas for power generation will keep differentials strong in the southern half of the West In the Rockies pipeline constraints will keep differentials wide The heightened call on gas demand for power generation driven by the declining hydroelectric generation and increasing power loads is expected to drive demand increases of Bcf per day relative to July and MMcf per day relative to June demand levels Gas demand for power generation is expected to reach a monthly average record level of Bcf per day in July see Tables and These increases will result in declines in western storage injection rates and in exports from the West Both Permian and San Juan supplies will be pulled increasingly toward the West Coast during July Low storage inventories and needed increases in injections are driving North American gas pricing The West is the one US region actually running a storage surplus but the recent heat waves and associated pull on gas supplies have eroded that surplus particularly in California see Table Given the expected increases in gas demand the western surplus should continue its decline This decline and very high demand will reinforce the volatility in differentials already evident this summer California Because of the early hot weather in the West and strong gas demand for power generation Topock prices have been extremely high and volatile So far this month Topock has averaged over per MMBtu above the Henry Hub Flows on El Paso and Transwestern into California increased by over million cubic feet MMcf per day during June relative to May averages and flows are expected to continue to climb by an additional MMcf per day during July PGT continues to run near capacity see Table At the same time the storage levels within California look likely to fall below last years levels sometime during the month This intense demand pressureCalifornia demand should increase by nearly MMcf per day in July relative to Junewill keep utilization rates on import pipelines high and sustain Topock differentials CERA expects the Topock to Henry Hub differential to average per MMBtu during July see Table This high differential will likely persist through the summer with differentials rising above per MMBtu during West Coast heat waves Southwest San Juan price differentials have been volatile narrowing during periods of very high western demand However a very high utilization rate on pipeline capacity into California has widened the TopockSan Juan differential and that wide gap is expected to persist On average San Juan differentials to the Henry Hub are expected to narrow from current levels as southwestern demand increases with western temperatures Demand in the Southwest is expected to climb from Bcf per day in June to Bcf per day in July This increased call on regional supplies and an expected strengthening in Permian prices should result in an average San Juan differential to the Henry Hub of per MMBtu In the Permian Basin prices are expected to strengthen as Texas power demand climbs Combined with the pull on supplies from the West Permian differentials should narrow from their current levels of per MMBtu to below per MMBtu Pacific Northwest Strong June hydroelectric output has limited the call on gas supplies in the Pacific Northwest so far this summer but as hydroelectric output decreases in June and July gas demand will increase dramatically CERA expects an increase of nearly MMcf per day during July relative to June levels The limited demand so far has meant differentials between Malin and the Henry Hub of as much as per MMBtu and Topock to Malin differentials of over per MMBtu The Malin to Henry Hub differential has narrowed slightly to around per MMBtu It should continue to strengthen with growth in regional demand and average per MMBtu during July Rocky Mountains Regional gas supply within the Rocky Mountains continues to increase bolstered by continuing growth in the Powder River Basin This April exports out of the Rockies reached Bcf per day a record high Although there is excess pipeline capacity out of the region into the Southwest on the Transcolorado and Northwest pipelines high utilization rates have widened Rockies differentials with the rest of the West In particular Rockies to San Juan differentials have averaged nearly per MMBtu for June after pricing close to parity earlier in the year That gap should persist through the summer as gasfired generation climbs across the rest of the West Demand is expected to average the same level in July as in June in the Rocky Mountains where coal limits gass gains in power generation CERA expects prices within the Rockies to gather some support from increasing power loads in the Pacific Northwest as well as from stronger differentials in the San Juan Basin On average Rockies differentials to the Henry Hub are expected to average per MMBtu during July In response to the increasing supplies flowing out of the Powder River Basin and the increasing pipeline capacity utilization on export pipelines Trailblazer has announced an open season for two possible options to extend and expand the mile pipeline from Wyoming into Nebraska Although timing and volumes have yet to be announced the additional capacity could prevent serious bottlenecks from developing out of the region which CERA would expect by without capacity additions end Follow URL for PDF version of this Monthly Briefing with associated graphic and tables Please note Should the above URL not work please use the following

Western Market Crisis Gas Joins Power CERA Alert CERA Alert Sent Fri December Title Western Market Crisis Gas Joins Power Author CERA EMail Category Alert Product Line Western Energy North American Gas URL Western Energy Members clientcealtcealtabhtml N American Gas Memeber clientnagaltnagaltabhtml Western Markets Disconnect The western energy markets are currently in a pricing crisis Power supply shortages and threats of system blackouts have resurfaced this winter in California and spiking natural gas prices have become the latest energy headache for the West Gas prices along the Pacific corridor from Kingsgate in the North to Topock in the South have jumped to over per MMBtu during December after averaging over per MMBtu through the second half of November Extreme weather strong power demand for gas and unusually low gas storage levels have combined to intensify the demand for pipeline gas and have exposed a latent capacity bottleneck in bringing gas to this far western corridor The result is prices that dramatically disconnected from the rest of the North American gas market in a way that is more typical of Northeast markets during the winter The vulnerability to additional spikes will endure as the demand drivers combined with weakened storage inventories will maintain price pressure on western price points throughout the winter However the recent jumps in western gas market differentialsto more than a per MMBtu premium to the Henry Hubshould ease somewhat with a break in the weather Under any weather scenario spikes up into the per MMBtu range will be a feature of winter markets along the West Coast On balance we expect West Coast price differentials to average at a per MMBtu premium through winter The spring hydroelectric runoff season should offer the first opportunity for a break in differentials that could drop back to more typical levels of less than per MMBtu Over the long term increased pipeline capacity and additional gas supply are needed to break the vulnerability to future West Coast price spikes However significant new capacity additions are still to months away In the meantimeparticularly this wintersustained high and volatile price differentials and extremely high absolute prices at western points are likely to draw the increased attention of state regulators and the FERC as winter heating demand exposes residential customers to the direct cost of the crisis Building Up to the Price Spike The first signs of natural gas price spikes and disconnects emerged this summer as sharp yearoveryear increases in demand pushed pipeline utilization rates to new highs As pipeline capacity constraints into California became evident differentials in Southern California moved up to a per MMBtu premium to the Henry Hub These extremely high prices as well as low forward spreads discouraged storage injections through the summer As a result a strong storage position early in the summer deteriorated rapidly from May through July In August a lateral on El Pasos southern system exploded the accident further limited pipeline capacity into California for a twoweek period During that time the market drew heavily on storage inventories and further weakened storage positions As hydroelectric generation declined through the summer the price strength extended into Northern California Malin which had been pricing near parity with the Henry hub in the summer began trading at a per MMBtu premium to the Henry Hub in September The summer and early fall market set the stage for continued and more intense spikes this winter The following factors are now driving this market Continuing surges in gas demand Gas demand levels have remained high since early summer driven by higher overall demand for electricity and lower hydroelectric output Demand levels for the third quarter in the US West averaged billion cubic feet Bcf per day up from Bcf per day during the third quarter Persistently strong gasfired generation production through the fall months diverted gas to power production frustrating efforts to fill storage This pressure will continue The yearoveryear demand increases from the power sector will be compounded as evidenced in November by swings upward in residential and commercial heating demand of million cubic feet MMcf per day Overall CERA expects nearly Bcf per day of increased demand in the West this winter with the critical California and Pacific Northwest regions showing Bcf per day of increased demand Key power sector drivers including the strong economy colder weather and lower hydroelectric generation will continue to push gasfired generation Pipeline utilization nears capacity Strong western demand for gas has pushed utilization rates on western pipes to high levels Flows from British Columbia into the Northwest pipeline have remained at high levels since summer while flows from the Rockies on Northwest have remained at pipeline capacity Flows on PGT into Kingsgate have remained at or near capacity although approximately MMcf per day of excess capacity exists on PGT into California at Malin Likewise flows out of the Rockies on Kern River pipeline have consistently remained at capacity The only slack pipeline capacity remaining for West Coast gas markets has been on Southwest pipes During the past few months these pipelines have operated at their highest utilization rates since the addition of capacity from Canada early last decade The high utilization of western pipeline capacityreminiscent of power plant capacity constraints that helped propel power prices to all time highs in the West this summerleaves very little slack capacity to provide a relief valve for demand spikes And that is exactly what has driven prices during the past few weeks see Figure Given the level of storage inventories and expected gas demand flows on the El Paso and Transwestern pipelines will have to reach even higher flow levels from December through March than they have averaged through November Deteriorating storage position At the start of November California storage inventories held at Bcf a full Bcf below the fiveyear average inventory level The strong instate withdrawals during November weakened that position to Bcf the deficit swelled to Bcf Inventories in California have never fallen below Bcf so deliverability through the end of winter is likely less than MMcf per day Storage inventories in California are so low that utilities ability to balance withdrawals from storage with purchases from demandsensitive price points is severely limited If the cold weather blast anticipated for mid December materializes this effort at balance will be even further compromised for the remainder of winter see Figure Shortterm contracting A significant amount of western gas is purchased or indexed to the spot market A shift from term contracts for both gas and pipeline capacity to spot transactionsin many cases in response to gas and power industry deregulationhas left the West much more exposed to spot market volatility In other areas of the country utilities have significant firm pipeline capacity extending from supply regions to the citygate andor have forward purchased gas at previous and lower prices for at least some portion of their winter supplies As a result unlike in eastern markets a much larger proportion of the supply portfolio of California utilities will be exposed to the current price spikes No alternatives A lack of fuelswitching capability prevents a meaningful demand response to higher gas prices Power prices continue to move in lockstep with the increase in gas prices Not surprisingly gas prices pushed the cost of gasfired generation beyond the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions FERCs proposed price cap of per megawatthour setting the stage for a reassessment of this price limit A small and declining portion of power generators are liquid fuel capable Significantly air emissions restrictions already plaguing power markets with much higher emissions credit costs this yearwill make any further switching to liquid fuels in the crucial California market highly unlikely this winter A recent meeting of the South Coast Air Quality Management District which has jurisdiction over the Los Angeles area concluded with no relief granted to generators running short of emissions credits Market Forces Unite for Price Spikes During November The first cold weatherrelated demand spike demonstrated the combined power of these forces and the vulnerability of the western markets A cold weather system in mid November brought temperatures averaging percent colder than normalthe temperatures actually averaged percent colder than a normal January weekand provided the additional demand boost that taxed the gas delivery systems on the West Coast Capacity constraints on moving gas into California that appeared during the summer extended north into the Pacific Northwest as heating loads climbed This core demand compounded the effects of continued strong demand for gas for power generation The high power demand was the result of the intersection of the annual low point for hydroelectric generation and a series of planned and unplanned nuclear and coal power plant outages Gas demand in the US West during the last two weeks of November was boosted to approximately Bcf per day driven by heating demand increases of Bcf per day above normal levels and power plant outage related demand increases of Bcf per day These demand spikes caused buyersalready dependent on the spot marketto bid citygate prices to record high levels through the last two weeks of November and into December Since demand outstripped supply prices rose dramatically at all western price points and flows of natural gas to western markets increased over high summer levels Citygate prices surged beyond per MMBtu on daily spot markets and averaged nearly per MMBtu for December bidweek at Topock Daily spot gas prices have reflected imbalance penalty prices in many western market regions West Coast to Remain Disconnected Through the Winter Although the week of November could prove to be the peak demand week in the West this winter CERA does not expect any significant retreat in gas prices on the West Coast any time soon Storage inventories are so low that the ability to beat back demand spikes with high storage withdrawals is not an option for gas utilities Generators which already rely heavily on the spot market for supplies are faced with a bidding war for scarce supplies Colderthannormal weather would likely keep West Coast prices in the per MMBtu range More normal weather would allow a slow decline from current levels of over per MMBtu down into the per MMBtu range However the storage situation and underlying demand strength mean that any return to a lower pricing range is unlikely until early January This winter will prove a critical test for western gas markets and the end of the heating season will likely provide the first opportunity for lower price levels in the West Coast market As heating loads diminish significantly in March and storage deliverability is no longer a critical issue premiums should retreat back into the per MMBtu range As hydroelectric generation begins to increase the pressure could subside even further but storage injections during the spring shoulder season will likely limit price declines even during the spring The Unique Vulnerability of the Pacific Northwest The West Coast price pressure is not limited to California High demand in the Pacific Northwest and more indirectly in California will keep upward pressure on prices from Sumas to Stanfield Northwest pipeline capacity from the Rockies was already fully utilized at the onset of the cold weather and even so can only provide gas so far into the Pacific Northwest The combined California and Pacific Northwest demand pushed Stanfield up in spite of the limited volumes that are bidirectional there The only supply source for the load centers in southern British Columbia and even more so in northern Pacific Northwest such as Seattle are from Westcoast at Sumas The Westcoast mainline from the producing fields in Northeast British Columbia has also been operating at capacity The same bidding forces felt in California have been evident at these western Canadian price points pushing Sumas prices into the s per MMBtu These forces will persist keeping Sumas at a premium to AECO over the winterand in much closer relationship to California prices Customer Response Another Log on the Backlash Bonfire With power plants and gas utilities paying the current high spot prices consumers bills from Vancouver to San Diego will ultimately reflect these high commodity prices The gas industry has been preparing for rate shock this winter warning regulators and customers alike However the price spikes in the West and the sustained premiums in western markets move beyond alarming Capacity holders are reaping significant rewards for their investments in capacity positions resulting in a substantial transfer of wealth from consumers to capacity holders Market power and market gaming accusations that have hit the power markets will find easy application in their gas market counterpart no matter what their merits Some level of investigation into the natural gas markets during or following this challenging winter should be expected As has occurred in the power markets this will now turn attention to gas purchasing practices particularly in California The likely outcome of this process will be a shift away from the heavy reliance on spot purchases toward a more flexible portfolio approach end Follow URL for PDF version of this Alert with associated graphics Come Shoot the Rapids with us at CERAWeek Shooting the Rapids Strategies

California on the BrinkCERA Alert CERA Alert December Title California on the Brink CERA Knowledge Areas Western Energy N American Power N American Gas CALIFORNIA ON THE BRINK The California Stalemate California moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over creditworthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would avoid selling to the California market While numerous factors have contributed to the high cost of power incurred by Californias utilities the root cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation The current credit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address the situation The collective efforts of all market participants should be focused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible Western power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this summer Perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of California consumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and significant rate increases The California Public Utilities Commission denied the requests of Pacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edison to end their rate freezes forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance the costs of higher wholesale energy This has created an unsustainable accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the California market The current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the galvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to address the underlying structural problems in the industry However there is no guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective solution for customers and the industry as a whole Wholesale and retail markets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain muddled In the necessarily political process that will follow it is possible thatas has largely been the case so farthe steps taken will fail to move the California power market toward a more enduring solution and will instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws In the six months since Californias supply shortfall began plaguing Western markets regulators have done little to address the underlying problem Rather than addressing the cause of the supply shortageestablishing a market environment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and demand side responsesefforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for the crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers Indeed several actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by discouraging new power plant additions These include price caps repeated changes to market rules attempts to seize generator profits and a challenging siting and permitting process Medicine Worse than the Illness Several years of electricity demand growth and low prices in California were accompanied by very few additions to the supply base Regulators did not pay adequate attention to the looming supply shortfall The void of consensus over the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of bandaid remedies that address the symptoms but not the cause of Californias electric market woes Challenging siting and permitting Despite state action to better coordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants power plant developers still face high hurdles Local community opposition alone has struck down some key proposed facilities Price caps discourage investment State and federal proposals to cap prices limit the attractiveness of the California wholesale power market especially for developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment to more stable or more attractive markets outside the state Repeated rule changes Frequent rule changes in the ISO markets including the price caps confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new plant development Calls for refunds Despite reports by the Power Exchange the ISO and the FERC that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the California markets state officials continue to accuse power providers of gaming the market Calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits are a threat to new plant development Facility inspections Recent inspections of power plants by state officials to verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of their generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust CERAs recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the West are not guaranteed to make a profit Prospects of new plant profitability are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants decommissioning of older units demand growth and numerous other difficulttoforecast factors Californias regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers considering entering the state Despite efforts by the California ISO to stimulate new capacity additions in the state with a special limitedterm capacity payment CERA estimates that demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the West in In addition the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until at the earliest Therefore three years remain before a sufficient quantity of capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk of an outage The Road to Recovery There are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity shortfall Encourage new build Supply must be part of the answer This requires a series of steps that can help facilitate new supply build While in principal some have been taken such as new fast track approval the success of these actions can only be measured by the build itself For now there is still not enough new supply coming on until to relieve supply tightness Stabilize investment climate Utilities must have assurance that they will ultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power This provides the credit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new build Move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios One of the reasons the pressure on customers has been so intense in California has been the absence and even discouragement of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in the stateparticularly for residential and small commercial customers With the market at a peak however now is in one sense a suboptimal time to move toward term contracting Yet these contracts provide the foundation for a series of actionsincluding new supply build and demand side investments If they end up above market they will at least have achieved the desired effect of knocking down prices a fact which by itself should provide sufficient justification for recovering the cost of these commitments Encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response Although originally a feature of Californias market design most consumers are insulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates Exposing customers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a demand response Encourage market mechanisms that dampen the Boom Bust characteristic of the market Whether in the form of a capacity payment a reserve requirement or a minimum term portfolio requirement the California power market needs to move to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the market is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to elicit new investment Such a structure can help dampen but not eliminate future price volatility Avoid continuously tinkering with the market While the market does need to be restructured as described above it also needs to be stable and reliable to encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust longterm contractual market for power in California Continually tinkering with the market structuresuch as the three times the price cap has been shifted since Julyonly serves to undermine confidence in the market California needs to do its best to develop a longterm solution and then let the market run its course Allow for greater environmental flexibility The state should explore a more balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply shortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to emissions restrictions Free PURPA power plants to generate Relief should be granted to PURPA power plants that are operational but are restricted by contract from operating to generate only power end This CERA

in the United States InterGen the power generation joint venture of Royal DutchShell Group and Bechtel Enterprise Holdings Inc closed a deal yesterday giving the international developer a equity interest in Houstonbased Coral Energy one of the largest natural gas and power marketers in the country Coral Energy officials had predicted in July that Shell and construction giant Bechtel would fold InterGen InterGen North America and certain assets of Coral Energy into one business see Daily GPI July Under the agreement announced yesterday InterGen will receive the majority of the natural gas pipeline storage and power generation assets of Shells Coral Energy affiliate in the United States It remains a joint venture of Shell and Bechtel The move gives Shell a ownership in InterGen with Bechtel owning the remaining InterGen had been formed as a joint venture and Bechtel made an undisclosed payment to Shell in the deal About Coral employees mostly related to the Texasbased assets in Houston will become InterGen employees under the agreement InterGen is considered a world leader in power generation development with projects around the world Carlos Riva InterGens CEO said that the transaction represents a significant boost to our plans in the United States These assets and strengthened alignment with a premier US gas and electricity trading enterprise will provide InterGen a strong platform for growth in the US market Globally the alignment is expected to help leverage Shells strengths in both fuel supply and power marketing and trading Bechtel will continue to be InterGens preferred provider for worldwide power generation engineering procurement and construction services Coral is the regions third largest natural gas marketer and the twentieth largest power marketer in the country Linda Cook Shell Gas and Powers CEO said the whole idea was to help InterGen grow in the United States and that the best way was to add Shell assets to it Success in tomorrows energy markets will be earned through globally aligned marketing trading and asset companies said Cook Thats critically true in the US and will be the case as competitive energy markets open worldwide InterGen plans to build a sizable power generation portfolio in the US working closely with Coral to pursue investment decisions that make the most commercial sense We expect this relationship to make a significant contribution to both InterGens and Corals longterm success Shell and Bechtel formed InterGen in March see Daily GPI March specifically to pursue power generation opportunities in North America The Bostonbased company was set up to develop Shell Bechtel and InterGen have among them the complete skill set for success in the new global energy market said Paul Unruh COO of Bechtel InterGen is a worldclass developer with a proven track record of successfully developing financing and operating projects around the world Shell is one of the most successful marketers and traders of energy in the US and is expanding into deregulating natural gas and power markets globally Bechtel is a global leader in the development engineering and construction of power facilities These strengths together create a large power generation platform now directly linked with global energy marketing and trading InterGens portfolio will give Coral Energy access for its trading business and Coral will participate as part of Shells global trading network with InterGen a business partner in its expanding North American asset platform As the exclusive marketer of Shells gas production Coral has a gas supply of Bcfd and a trading platform dealing in extensive volumes of energy in all key supply basins For Bechtel the agreement will help it lock in construction contracts for its combined cycle gas turbine power stations Specifically the assets to be transferred to InterGen from Coral include the following miles of major intrastate gas pipelines in Texas The pipeline facilities extend from South Texas near the Mexican border along the Texas Gulf Coast to the Louisiana boarder and north from near Houston to the East Texas producing areas The West Clear Lake Storage facility one of the largest natural gas storage reservoirs in Texas Located near the Houston Ship Channel it has a leasehold interest in the Stratton Ridge storage facility Corals interest of more than MW in four power plants one in operation and three under construction The transfer would follow equity and regulatory approvals In total Coral had miles of gas pipeline that ran along the Gulf Coast in Texas and

California power market gone haywire and teetering on the brink of operational and financial disaster FERC Friday issued a series of remedial measures virtually stripping the CalPX and CalISO of their control of the market and calling market stakeholders together to negotiate bilateral forward contracts The Commissions main action effective with the issuance of the order after the Friday afternoon meeting removes the requirement that California utilities buy and sell exclusively through the California Power Exchange CalPX and clears the way for bilateral contracts in the forward market FERC scheduled a settlement conference for Dec in Washington of parties in the states power market to negotiate those contracts California does not have the benefit of a competitive market Chairman James Hoecker said noting he had heard the states power market called crisis by design The design was an unworkable state law the product of command and control that described in detail exactly how the market should function It wasnt competition Hoecker said Its time to get serious about saving the future of competitive marketsCompetition did not fail in principle at either the wholesale or retail level because it was never wellconceived or tried This version of competition was a disaster Commissioner William Massey defended the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions backing away from price caps Rather than cap the spot market created by the state of California the order would simply shrink its size and diminish its influence This will give back participants ability to find the right price This ability is what California has taken away from that market Massey said the action would allow bilateral transactions support forward contracts and allow the parties to manage risk He urged the California Public Utilities Commission to step up to its responsibilities in supporting the FERCdirected activities Massey said the transfer of wealth in what he described as the apocalypse in California is absolutely staggering The two largest utilities are virtually bankrupt He predicted a court acting on accepted law and precedent would eventually rule the utilities are entitled to recover the costs from customers spreading the costs out over the entire state PGE Corp officials lambasted the Commissions actions saying they left Californias electric customers exposed to price gouging and future electric supply reliability uncertainty The California wholesale market is broken And we are extremely disappointed by the insufficiency of todays FERC order PGE officials said in a statement The remedies outlined in the order do not go nearly far enough to provide a solution that ensures reliability of the states electric supply and equally importantly provides relief from future price gouging the Northern California utility company said PGE said it was particularly disappointed that FERC did not call for retroactive price refunds for California electric customers as was requested by Gov Gray Davis The utility also said it was especially troubled that FERC shortened the timeframe for the electric price cap from the end of to April leaving customers exposed during the highdemand summer season Sen Dianne Feinstein DCA said FERCs action was unacceptable Rome is burning our utilities are close to bankruptcy Californians are facing major blackouts and the Commission is fiddling Hoecker said similar competitive problems in states in the Pacific Northwest have led to pleas from governors and others for regional price caps But he pointed to the fact that FERC is severely limited in what it can do in that region For one it lacks authority over the Bonneville Power Authority and other federal operations there which make up a major portion of the market Further there is no Northwest spot market that can be capped in the way caps operate in California There also would be problems with the many purchasers who already had hedged or protected themselves in some way Hoecker strongly urged Energy Secretary Bill Richardson to convene a conference to try to identify regional problems and offered his help in this Commissioners Curt Hebert and Massey said they would issue concurring opinions Hoecker said he will submit a concurring opinion next week on items such as RTOs that are beyond the scope of the order The Commissions actions which went beyond recommendations it had made earlier see Daily GPI Nov came at an emergency meeting following a week of continuous power alerts and emergency measures to avoid rolling blackouts in the state The Commissions reforms call for No retroactive refunds for California customers Elimination of the requirement that Californias three investorowned utilities Pacific Gas and Electric San Diego Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison sell all of their power into the CalPX and buy all of their power from the CalPX This took effect Friday Return MW of generation to state regulation Termination of the CalPX wholesale rate schedule effective the close of the trading day on April Create a benchmark price for wholesale bilateral contracts to assess prices of fiveyear energy supply contracts Create penalties for underscheduling power loads A requirement that market participants schedule of their load prior to real time Violators will incur penalties for scheduling deviations exceeding the greater of MW or of their hourly load Begin market monitoring and price mitigation for the CalISO and PX spot markets FERC will hold a technical conference to develop a monitoring an mitigation program A proposed plan is to be submitted by March so that the measure can be in place by May A singlepriced auction to be used only for bids at or below MW Bids above MW will not set the market clearing price although they will be subject to FERC reporting requirements Replacing the current CalISO stakeholder governing board with a nonstakeholder board On Jan the CalISO governing board members will be required to turn over their decisionmaking power and operating control to the management of the CalISO The members will be permitted to function in an advisory capacity until the new board is selected FERC to discuss with California representatives a process for selecting new CalISO board members and Modify interconnection procedures The ISO and utilities must file generation interconnection procedures

northern Nevada industrial gas users have accused Northwest Pipeline of violating its tariff by holding them hostage to the daily mustflow operational flow orders OFOs that it has issued since early December in an effort to compensate for the sizable capacity shortfall on its system In a Section complaint filed Friday the industrial gas customers called on FERC to direct Northwest to cease and desist the alleged violation of the tariff which they claim is forcing them and other customers at the northern end of the pipeline to subsidize the gas acquisition and transportation costs of customers on the southern end of Northwests system The effect of the mustflow OFOs is to compel shippers to make up the capacity shortfall on Northwests system via displacement the industrials noted Northwests firm contractual demand is Dthd but its physical capacity is only Dthd PanAlberta Gas US Inc provides Dthd through a displacement arrangement while shippers are left to make up the remaining Dthd The industrial users contend they shouldnt be penalized for not complying with the mustflow OFOs because Northwests tariff exempts shippers that have made good faith efforts to obtain gas supply but have been unsuccessful At issue is whether the good faith efforts applies to purchasing gas at reasonable costs which is how the industrials interpret the tariff or whether it means that shippers should be required to buy gas at any price to meet a mustflow OFO The latter according to the industrial users is Northwests position The regulatory history of Northwests tariff makes clear that good faith efforts to obtain a gas supply at the Stanfield OR receipt point need not extend to purchasing gas at any price but rather must be viewed in the context of current conditions and circumstances ie available prices and supplies the industrial customers said Where a shipper can secure gas needed to meet a mustflow order only at the basin price differentials that currently prevail and assuming that the shipper can document such efforts and impacts for Northwest verification the shippers request for exemption from penalties must be granted Northwest twice has refused such a request by the industrial customers they noted In anticipation of the high gas prices this month the Nevada industrial users said they chose to switch to alternative fuels where feasible or to curtail operations rather than use their released capacity on Northwest Nevertheless the pipelines daily mustflow OFOs have forced them into the volatile daily gas market to avoid extremely high noncompliance penalties undermining their business decisions to rely on alternative fuels they told FERC RP In order to comply with Northwests orders the industrials said they must ship the gas to a point where they cannot use it and can only sell it at the Rocky Mountain basin prices which is a fraction of the price at which under current conditions they purchased it The industrial users said they have had to comply with Northwests mustflow OFOs given the hefty penalties they would face otherwise The penalties are equal to the greater of Dth or four times the highest spot rate at Sumas Stanfield Kingsgate Opal or Ignacio for the month of noncompliance Based on the spot rate at Stanfield the penalty this month was Dth If one of the Nevada industrial users Newmont Mining Corp had defied Northwests order to flow of its contract demand or Dth on any December day it would have been penalized for that one day they said If all of the Nevada industrial customers had violated the pipelines order the oneday penalty would have been The industrial shippers want FERC to go beyond interpreting the good faith efforts exemption in their favor They contend that Northwest tariff allowing mustflow OFOs as currently structured is both unreasonable and unduly discriminatory Thats because it requires one group of shippers who see no additional benefits to incur gas acquisition and transportation costs solely to subsidize service to another group of shippers they argued They believe the shippers who benefit should pay for the displacement capacity costs Currently the mustflow OFOs result in southbound flows on Northwest that create northbound capacity for the benefit of shippers with southtonorth entitlements Those same southtonorth shippers could however themselves purchase spot gas in the Canadian supply areas and ship such volumes southward on an interruptible basis on Northwest ie do what the industrial shippers and others have been directed to do They could pay the costs of the capacity that they want As an alternative Northwest could require a sharing of displacement capacity costs by all shippers using its system at a given time when capacity is short or it could invest in facilities so that it has the physical capacity to meet all of its contractual commitments the industrial users said

Northwest and California PGE Corps National Energy Group revealed plans Wednesday to begin an open season early next year kicking off a fiveyear expansion effort The first phase would add MMcfd of firm transportation capacity out of western Canada on its Gas TransmissionNorthwest GTN pipeline system The PGE GTN group expects the phase one expansion to be in service by November at the latest As we have been anticipating the western natural gas market is at a critical point in the need for additional pipeline capacity said Thomas B King president of the PGE National Energy Group PGE NEG West Region Gas supplies into the Pacific Northwest and California are very tight At the same time the market is strong and growing and the PGE Gas Transmission Northwest pipeline system has been operating at or near maximum capacity levels for the greater part of the year We believe GTN is now positioned for an aggressive expansion period that will result in additional supplies of natural gas at competitive transportation rates in this region for both directuse customers and electric generation by King noted that the phase one expansion of the GTN system was brought on primarily because of the state of disarray in the California market He cited the growing use of gas to fuel electric generating facilities as the main reason new capacity is needed King added that the GTN pipeline system is the most direct and economic link for tapping the Canadian production basins and bringing the load to California and the Pacific Northwest markets He also emphasized that the expansions would help the market prepare for new supply from Alaska We are constantly talking to our customers about what is the right time for us to expand our pipeline system said Sandra McDonough spokeswoman for PGE Corp With the power plant development both in California and in the Pacific Northwest including plants in the Northwest that are being built right next to our pipeline the time is clearly now to start expanding the system We have gotten more bids for capacity than we have been able to move recently McDonough told Daily GPI last week that the company was looking to expand its mainline in the near future see Daily GPI Dec To gauge demand PGE NEG plans to launch an open season for the MMcfd expansion of the mainline beginning on Jan Bids are due by Feb Following the open season the company will hold a capacity rationalization period which will allow existing shippers to release capacity directly to customers who have expressed an interest The mile dual pipe GTN system begins at the IdahoBritish Columbia border travels through northern Idaho southeastern Washington and central Oregon and terminates at the OregonCalifornia border where it connects with the Pacific Gas and Electric Co intrastate pipeline system Currently the GTN system is the largest US transporter of Canadian natural gas with Bcfd of capacity The expansion was deemed necessary because the average contract term on the line extends through and the pipeline has been operating at capacity or near capacity for most of The method of expansion had not been decided on yet but it is expected to include additional compression and some looping McDonough said PGE has been in contact with its upstream providers including TransCanada Pipelines Limited TCPL to ensure coordination of capacity Doug Baldwin CEO of TCPL said TransCanada will work with PGE NEG to examine and if appropriate satisfy the needs of market participants in both the western United States and Canada If response to the open season is adequate PGE NEG hopes to move along with the project immediately The November in service date includes an anticipated oneyear process to obtain a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC permit We also expect to have an incremental MMcfd of new directconnect gasfired electric generation load along the GTN system in the Pacific Northwest by mid King said We expect to follow the project immediately with additional pipeline expansions to meet the need for additional gas supplies in the Pacific Northwest on both the east and west sides of the Cascade Mountains For the next fivetoeight years PGE Corp expects to be busy with pipeline expansions and new additions The company has planned a second mainline expansion to be in service in with a new interconnect near Spokane WA which will serve the Puget SoundSeattle area The last expansion phase will be brought online sometime after With Alaskan gas fields expected to be ready for commercial service in the next five to years PGE NEG will build an expansion that will facilitate transportation of gas from Alaska and Canadas Northwest Territories to markets in the lower states Overall what we are looking at is the potential to expand the system by Bcfd over the next decade McDonough said

from the marathon governmentindustry negotiations The principals of last Tuesday nights marathon session were expected to meet by videoconference over the weekend to review solutions developed by staff working groups which met through the end of the week see Daily GPI Jan On the West Coast the week ended with emergency legislation starting its dash through the state capital and the governor holding a minute meeting with two neighboring western governors to piece together a regional strategy on joint energy conversationsupply cooperation On Friday Gov Gray Davis said if FERC fails to act he is sure Congress will take up legislation to stabilize power prices throughout the country or at least give governors the option to opt into a stabilized pricing mechanism Sen Diane Feinstein DCA announced she was working on a bill to be offered later this month which would allow the energy secretary to impose price caps Davis indicated that he and federal officials would be working over the weekend and he expects to have something to announce early next week and in the long term he expects to solve this problem in the next days and in six months hopefully this whole episode will be a distant memory Also on Friday Standard Poors assigned an investment grade triple Bplus corporate credit rating to subsidiary PGE Energy Trading Holdings and said subsidiaries Gas Transmission Northwest and PEG Generating also would maintain their investment grade rating based on each entitys own creditworthiness and economic selfsufficiency These units would be insulated from any downgrades of the parent PGE Corp or the utility subsidiary Pacific Gas Electric This action came after PGE suspended its fourth quarter dividend and announced it was cutting staff and services see Daily GPI Jan Following their meeting in Sacramento Friday Gov Davis and his counterparts in Oregon John Kitzhaber and Washington Gary Locke announced a Feb western governors meeting would be held in Portland OR to push for a western region wholesale power price cap and a regionwide push by each state to conserve energy and finally to share energy supplies on a seasonal basis As fellow Democrats Washingtons Gov Locke and Oregons Gov Kitzhaber expressed strong support for Gov Daviss efforts and pushed for solutions from FERC It is extraordinarily important that this not be a partisan struggle between West Coast Democratic governors and the inland governors who are mostly Republican said Kitzhaber noting that not all the solutions have to come from new generation Conservation can play a major role too Both visiting governors said they strongly support the state of California becoming the purchaser of longterm power and then reselling to the utilities They are banking on the fact that the states creditworthiness will gain much better prices than the cashstrapped nearbankrupt two major utilities Southern California Edison Co and Pacific Gas and Electric Co The lower house Assembly of the state legislature cranked out about a dozen proposed laws including one to completely restructure the oversight boards of the statechartered grid operator CalISO and wholesale spot power market CalPX from large stakeholder panels of to industry representatives to small units of three people each all appointed by the governor Another proposed law would prevent the states three major privatesector utilities including the two near bankruptcy to sell their remaining generation units which are comprised mostly of nuclear hydroelectric and interests in outofstate coalfired plants Gov Davis indicated he expects state lawmakers to pass the bill this Wednesday establishing threeperson boards and the members of the ISO panel will be the head of the states three principal agencies overseeing electricity the California Public Utilities Commission California Energy Commission and Electricity Oversight Board of which two of the three are headed by Davis appointees The nearrolling blackouts of Thursday caused by stormdriven wave surges that curtailed power production at coastal plants were eliminated over the weekend through stepped up conservation restoration of major units at PGEs Diablo Canyon Nuclear Generating Plant and by what the grid operator called the biggest singleday lowering of demand he has ever experienced This week CalISO expects to have to MW that were out of service last week back online further improving the chance of avoiding power emergencies Salvaging the states system last week at the critical Stage Three was Californias water resources department which operates the massive northtosouth network of aqueducts It purchased MW from out of state using the states creditworthiness to get around the CalISO financial problems As it has done on a lowerprofile basis in the past the water resources department acted as a quasistate power authority and the CalISO COO Kellan Fluckiger said that other market participants also are providing this sort of intermediary financing in light of the credit concerns surrounding the ISO and utilities The water department also contributed to the supply crunch as it does routinely by shutting down its heavy electricity consuming pumps that move massive quantities of water around the state

Emergency Supply Orders Despite recent indications that the Bush administration would take a more handsoff approach to the California crisis Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham late yesterday gave PGE and Southern California Edison another two weeks of breathing room by extending emergency orders requiring gas and power suppliers to continue supplying the cashstrapped utilities The emergency gas order now expires at am EST Feb In granting the extensions Abraham urged the state to get to work to solve its own problems He said only California can implement the policies necessary to resolve the shortterm and longterm supply challenges Our action today is designed to give the governor the California legislature and other relevant parties the time to take necessary action I strongly urge the parties to act immediately said Abraham He also said he was keenly aware that other western states have expressed concerns about their own supply situation and the impact the order is having on power prices in their areas Despite the action PGE said it still is having trouble getting gas suppliers to comply with the emergency order originally issued Jan The gas supply situation is not good utility spokeswoman Staci Homrig said yesterday afternoon We are quickly depleting our storage Even under the order J Aron Co a subsidiary of Goldman Sachs has not delivered gas They represent about of our daily needs Bcfd in January Oh yeah weve been in contact with them she said Weve been in contact with the DOE too The other two suppliers who had stopped delivering gas to us last week have made gas available to us under the order They are Sempra Energy Trading and Western Gas Resources Homrig said PGE expected DOE to take legal action against those who didnt resume deliveries The order applied to gas suppliers all of which supplied gas to PGE within the last days Theres not a lot I can say said J Aron spokeswoman Kate Baum J Aron has always complied with the law and we intend to comply with this order Thats my statement I can neither confirm nor deny anything else Meanwhile other suppliers who were not among those on the DOEs list were staying as far away from California as possible All I know is were not selling in California any more A person could get fired around here for doing that said one marketer All we had in California were a few spot deals that expired at the end of December Needless to say we didnt reup them Without the DOEs order PGE would be back where it was last week with some suppliers stopping delivery others planning to stop at the end of their contract terms and most suppliers unwilling to sell additional gas to the utility PGE has said it has enough gas in storage to make up for the lost supply under such a scenario until the first week in February Homrig said PGEs storage currently is well below full or less than Bcf and depleting rapidly by about MMcfd to Bcfd PGEs Pipe Ranger web site shows the utility has been averaging about MMcfd of withdrawals over the past several days and is expecting a slight increase over the next few days CA Launches New Buying Program Supplies Remain Tight Depending on your perspective California either moved toward future solutions to its nagging energy crisis or took several steps backward yesterday with the launch of its electricity bulk buying program for longterm fixedprice supplies The auction began yesterday and will run through noon today The state is seeking sealed bids for sixmonth threeyear fiveyear and year supply agreements Whether results of the auction would be made public was still unclear yesterday but the results are expected to be given to legislators who now are debating various longterm solutions in the state senate A spokesperson in the state Assembly Speakers office said the legislature is basically standing by awaiting more price information Action on the proposed comprehensive legislation including the question of the state taking over the private utilities hydroelectric systems should come by the end of the week Merrill Lynch said yesterday it was increasingly skeptical that the securitization for hydro plan would go forward It has received muted support Merrill Lynch said and has not been drafted as a bill yet Recent revisions of the comprehensive bill show some progress on contract flexibility with the possibility that the value of the entire portfolio of energy contracts might be capped at a weighted average price of MWh which is well below the utilities retail rate caps Edison at MWh and PGE at The difference is expected to be used to pay down the utilities debt Meanwhile the electric system limped along under the specter of another Stage Three yesterday but without rolling blackouts and elsewhere indications outside the state were that some energy marketers have written off California from their prospective marketing lists Were not selling in California any more a person could get fired for doing that around here said one Texasbased gas marketer referring to the continuing credit problems of Pacific Gas and Electric Co which has been hobbled by the weight of its wholesale electricity debts on the natural gas side too In the meantime Southern California Edison Co is back in federal district court in Los Angeles where it obtained a favorable initial ruling two weeks ago This time it is asking for the court to force the California Public Utilities Commission to allow it to raise its rates to cover the wholesale cost of power Calling the action with the court a last resort Edison said it has tried to get the rate situation resolved but at every turn it has met resistance denial and fingerpointing by the CPUCs fivemember governorappointed board The CPUC on Tuesday acted to anticipate new state legislation regarding the hydroelectric systems in the state by canceling hearings it had scheduled this week and next to go exclusively to written comments for the environmental review of the ongoing case looking at PGEs hydro utility assets The current energy crisis in the state makes it prudent for the commission to shift from public hearings to written testimony the CPUC said in a prepared statement

Lorna Original Message From ENRON mailtoIMCEANOTESwebmasterceraEcom NRONcom Sent Friday January PM To Subject Western Energy Markets Stuggle Along CERA Monthly Briefing Title Western Energy Markets Stuggle Along URL eprofileuDmD Western Market Overview As the California power crisis remains unresolved and blackouts in Californ ia have gone from threat to reality the western gas and power markets grow increasingly distorted by the perceived risk of selling energy to Californi as two largest utilities Normal power plant operations and power pricing dynamics have been supplanted with federal mandates to deliver power to California and power basis differentials are being influenced by credit risk Regional hydroelectric supplies have been drawn down at abnormally rapid rates to me et current demand such that in the absence of increased precipitation through out the West suppliers will be unable to depend heavily on hydroelectric outpu t in February and later in the year Gas suppliers are growing increasingly wary about shouldering the increased risk Natural gas and power prices have declined from Decembers record levels driven in part by Januarytodate weather that has been warmer than normal Although Topock gas prices remain above the per million British thermal units MMBtu level basis differentials to the Henry Hub have declined dramatically from a premium over Henry Hub prices of per MMBtu in Decem ber to an average of per MMBtu in January Demand levels will likely hold near January levels during February as the already intense pull of gas for power generation continues Because storage levels in California remain low the California citygates will be exposed to temporary price spikes during spells of cold weather Differentials for February are expected to average to per MMBtu in the Rocky Mountains and San Juan producing bas ins during February per MMBtu at AECO and per MMBtu at Topock Power prices in January have followed both the decline in gas prices and th e shift to warmer weather However there is growing unease in the power mark ets with the dry precipitation season to date A significantly lowerthanavera ge hydroelectric season would permeate through the power markets for all of placing gasfired generation on the margin virtually the entire year CERA has incorporated a lowerthataverage view of hydroelectric generation into its gas and power analyses February onpeak power prices are expected to average per megawatthour MWh in February depending on location but tempor ary price spikes are likely as California reserves reach critically low levels and the independent system operator ISO struggles to secure enough power to k eep the lights on Offpeak power prices are also expected to remaining strong averaging per MWh in February depending on location Regional Power Market Drivers Low Precipitation Threatens Already Difficul t Disappointing levels of precipitation have raised the specter that the power markets will be plagued by a belowaverage hydroelectric year Seasonto date precipitation is currently percent of normal in the upper Columbia River Basin in British Columbia to percent of normal in the US Colum bia River Basin and percent of normal for California January hydroelectric output westwide has been higher than normal as operators have run faciliti es hard to supply energy during December and January energy shortages In comi ng months however output will be down roughly average megawatts aMW compared with the first quarter of owing in part to this early drawdo wn CERA has incorporated an outlook for hydroelectric production in that is approximately percent of CERAs estimate for an average western hydro year see Table Concerns over low precipitation levels and the high drawdown rate of Pacifi c Northwest hydroelectric facilities leave the Pacific Northwest particularly vulnerable to higher prices in February as winter weatherdriven demand spikes challenge regional supplies and California demand prevents a significant le vel of exports from California to the Pacific Northwest Even under normal hydroelectric conditions demand growth in early was expected to push the utilization rates of US Western Systems Coordinating Council WSCC gasfired generation facilities to percent well above th e percent average level of the first quarter see Table The combine d effects of the early drawdown of hydroelectric facilities a disappointing precipitation season and demand growth will push these utilization rates t o nearly percent in the first quarter This will cause markets to cl ear at or above the production cost of gasfired generation even more often tha n in Pacific Northwest Hydroelectric generators in the Pacific Northwest have drawn down the regio ns hydroelectric reservoirs to well below average historical levels Grand Coulee the largest hydroelectric facility in the West with over megawatts MW of capacity was near percent of the historical average as of early Janu ary and reflects the general condition of the major reservoirs in the region I n the event that precipitation remains low the drawdown of these facilities in early winter to meet load spikes in the Pacific Northwest and California ha s hurt the regions ability to supply power throughout and will maint ain upward pressure on power prices Aboveaverage temperatures in early January have helped to mask some of the underlying strong fundamentals in the Pacific Northwest Strong demand grow th for the first quarter near percent is expected however owing to economi c growth and a return to normal weather from last years mild winter see Table Low hydroelectric availability and persistent gas prices in the to per MMBtu range at Sumas have the potential during the remainder of the win ter to cause price spikes well above the per MWh onpeak levels so far in January although average prices should be much lower Decembers averag e of per MWh demonstrated this potential clearly see Table Along with demand growth near percent yearoveryear in February cold snaps will again bring price runups particularly in the event that persistent low precipitation in the region reduces the ability of hydroelectric operators to draw down facilities past alreadylow levels CERA expects MidColumbia prices to stay near January levels in February fo r a monthly average of per MWh on peak and per MWh off peak Continue d drops in hydroelectric reservoirs and weatherrelated events would push pri ces periodically to Decembers high levels California Although California has had a December and early January that were nearly percent warmer than usual January prices have reflected percent demand growth over owing to economic and other growth factors that have pushe d gasfired generators onto the margin more often with higher gas prices at Topock by MMBtu low hydroelectric availability westwide and the degrad ed condition of the California power market Northern California snowpacks hav e been higher than in other parts of the state but hover near percent of normal in spite of recent storms Reservoir levels for the state are betwee n and percent of average depending on location but are in the to percentofaverage range for reservoirs affecting the states largest hydroelectric facilities As Californias largest investorowned utilities IOUs continue to stru ggle to obtain gas and power supplies in the face of financial insolvency Californ ia power prices have reflected a premium associated with the higher risk of supplying the state January differentials with western prices have grown a s high as per MWh owing in part to temporary supply shortages as nuclear and other thermal plant outages at times have totaled over MW Northern Californias import constraints make it particularly susceptible to thes e temporary shortages suggesting that continued low hydroelectric supplies w ill increase the risk of repeated localized blackouts in the event of extensive future outages The agreements reached through negotiations between suppliers the IOUs an d state and federal officials in recent weeks will calm some of the price inflating uncertainty in the market but California will be the premium mar ket through the first quarter of and most of the coming year owing to persistent supply tightness For February in California CERA expects sustai ned price strength of per MWh on peak and per MWh off peak Rockies and the Southwest The Southwest and Rockies regions had warm weather in December and the firs t half of January but have not been completely insulated from the price runu ps in other parts of the West Demand growth in the region is expected to be n ear percent for the first quarter with February experiencing moderate perc ent growth suggesting that most of the price strength will be attributed to interconnections with the hydrodeprived California and Pacific Northwest markets Capacity margins in the Southwest are at their highest levels duri ng the winter andas an isolated subregionwould exceed percent at th is time Compared with California prices prices in the Southwest and Rockies region s will reflect the relatively low cost of gas supply and the prevalence of co al fired generation MW or percent of the installed base in the region CERAs outlook for onpeak average price for February is p er MWh Offpeak prices in the Rockies will drop nearly per MWh below the Southwest reflecting the ability of California markets to exert more influence on the Southwest than on the Rockies Western Gas Markets Although gas prices at Topock have come down from lofty December levels winter is far from over in the West indeed the pressure is intensifying The cre dit crisis precipitated by the power market crisis is spilling over into gas markets storage levels within California are again at critically low level s The mild weather during December and early January allowed some improvement in the positions but when PGEs suppliers began refusing to serve because of the utilitys credit problems the utility responded by drawing heavily on s torage inventories and a spell of wintry weather compounded increased demand in t he face of limited supplies As a result overall inventory levels are again falling quickly CERA estimates that inventory levels in California are approximately billion cubic feet Bcf A continued heavy draw on gas for power generation will k eep demand levels high see Table and the inability to manage demand spikes by drawing on storage inventories leaves the market exposed to price spikes Normal weather during February would probably allow prices at both Topock a nd Malin to settle back into the to premium to the Henry Hub but extreme weather could push basis differentials as high as per MMBtu In the Rockies and San Juan Basins differentials will depend critically on the weather Because supply levels and storage inventories in the Rockies are healthy the impact of swings in regional demand can cause wide swings in differentials CERA expects the swings to continue through February with differentials generally maintaining wider discounts to the Henry Hub by the end of the month As high absolute gas prices continue more and more effects of these prices will emerge CERA estimates that MMcf per day of base industrial demand in the Westparticularly in Californiahas switched off of gas Some end users have turned to diesel fuel for industrial boilers some plants have simply curtailed operations in response to the higher prices On the power side plants within California are extremely limited in their ability to burn alternative fuels because of emissions credits However plants outside of California do have some backup capability Arizona Public Servic e has purchased barrels of sulfur residual fuel oil to burn as an alternative to gas Given the intense pressure on gas oil will absorb some of growth in power loads California In November an early strong draw on storage in California raised questions about winter deliverability within the state A combination of low storage inventories high gas demand for power generation and continued high utilization rates on import pipelines into the state will keep pressure on California prices through February see Table Despite efforts by end us ers to limit gas burns in the state in the face of extremely high gas prices C ERA expects demand during January in the state is up by MMcf per day on a year overyear basis In February loads should start to decline as residential and commercial demand declines through the month However power loads will rem ain strong and actually climb from January into February as hydroelectric generation falls This demand support continued strong capacity utilization rates in import pipelines into California and critically low storage inventories will keep intense pressure on gas prices within the state through February During periods of high demand prices will likely reach back up into the to per MMBtu range Eventually as heating loads settle and storage dra ws slow toward the end of February differentials should ease back into the to per MMBtu range On balance CERA expects a Topock differential fo r February of per MMBtu see Table Pacific Northwest Three factors have combined to strengthen Malin prices over the past week and these forces should extend price strength at Malin into February First th e return of colder winter weather after moderate temperatures during late December and early January is increasing heating loads and power loads Second lowerthannormal hydroelectric generation is increasing the draw on gas fo r power generation during a season when the pull is normally low Third the California power shortage is drawing on all regional supplies and supportin g the demand for gas for power generation Pacific Northwest demand is expected to hold flat relative to January level s during February with slight increases in gas demand for power generation offsetting declines in residential and commercial demand The sustained hig h demand levelsdespite relatively healthy Northwest storage inventory lev els will keep Malin prices well above Henry Hub prices CERA expects a Malin to Henry Hub differential of per MMBtu during February A dropoff in demand of MMcf per day is expected in March as steep declines in heating loads offset continued increases in gas demand for powe r generation However prices at Malin will likely remain unusually strong th is spring Part of the shortfall in hydroelectric generation continues to be made up by draining reservoirs That early drawdown will limit the availability of hydroelectric generation through the spring and early summer months Both l ow hydroelectric generation and a challenging storage refill season in Norther n California should sustain the Malin premium to the Henry Hub even into the spring Rocky Mountains The volatility in Rocky Mountain differentials continues Differentials continue to depend primarily on local heating loads cooler weather support s loads and prices within the region but periods of warm weather drive steep declines in Rocky Mountain prices relative to prices at the Henry Hub Duri ng February demand should drop off in the region Although declines in heatin g loads in neighboring western regions will be offset by increases in gas dem and for power generation the Rockies remain primarily coal based As a result the lower expected hydroelectric output will do little to support loads within the region Increases in supplyCERA expects supply increases of MMcf pe r day during relative to will overwhelm available pipeline capacity out of the region Demand during February in the Rockies is expected to remain flat at Bcf per day however within the month demand loads will drop substantially This w ill put pressure on differentials toward the end of the month and CERA expects average basis differentials to the Henry Hub during February of per MMBtu That widening trend should continue during March with differentials to the Henry Hub eventually reaching per MMBtu this summer Southwest Prices in the San Juan Basin have been following Rocky Mountain prices up a nd down with regional demand loads That dynamic will likely continue through February CERA expects relatively flat demand during February within the Southwest As in the West as a whole a significant dropoff is expected during March as residential and commercial heating demand wanes For February continued strong demand loads within the Rockies and Southwest will support prices in the San Juan barring unusually warm weather CERA expects a differential to the Henry Hub of per MMBtu As residential and commercial loads decline sharply during late February an d March prices in the San Juan will reflect ample supply CERA expects decli nes in San Juan production during but declines will be limited by the strongest drilling activity for conventional supplies in the basin in a decade However pressure on Rocky Mountain supplies will mean increased exports fr om the north into the San Juan and those increased exports will more than off set the declines in local production Pipeline capacity constraints out of the San Juan will again mean wide San JuantoHenry Hub differentials with pressur e on prices developing during the spring and intensifying through the summer months Western Canada Increasing Supply AECO differentials to the Henry Hub have ranged between per MMBtu and over per MMBtu Given strong demand in the United States export pipelines have been running near capacity all winter Even the Bcf per day Alliance pipeline has been running full through the end of the winter continued strong US demand should keep export pipeline flows near capacity Given these flow levels CERA expects differentials to remain near the to per MMBtu level reflecting the cost of transport on TransCanada the only available export capacity out of Alberta For February CERA expects a differential between AECO and the Henry Hub of per MMBtu Storage inventories in western Canada are running below historical average levels but the refill season should be manageable inventories are nowhere near as low as US inventory levels Inventories in the West are expected to fall slightly below historical average levels by the end of withdrawal seas on and exports should decline relative to first quarter levels as injection season begins in the spring CERA expects differentials to Henry Hub prices to nar row sometime in the late spring as the focus in Alberta turns from filling US winter demand to refilling Canadian storage On the supply side production has turned the corner in western Canada and yearoveryear increases in supply of nearly MMcf per day are now evide nt After flat production levels for relative to increases for the y ear should reach MMcf per day Given strong expected demand from California and the West Coast CERA expects no declines in yearoveryear flows into the West on PGE GT NW Overall flows should reach Bcf per day for an increase of MMcf per day from levels end Follow above URL for full report Come Shoot

PGEs utility authority to amend its gas supply deals to keep supplies flowing to the state past Feb when the current federal DOE emergency order expires but it postponed action on another PGE request that Southern California Gas Co which has strongly objected be compelled to provide emergency supplies to the PGE utilitys residential and small business customers Loretta Lynch president of the California Public Utilities Commission said PGEs utility is a victim a victim of circumstances and a victim of predatory practices by natural gas suppliers now demanding payment for future supplies up front not because the utility has failed to pay its past gas bills but because the electricity crisis has sapped its creditworthiness The CPUC action allows PGEs utility to offer suppliers the option of securitization or in effect a lien in the utilitys retail customers bills which cover the full cost of the wholesale gas prices as an incentive to have the suppliers extend contracts with PGEs gas utility operations while the creditworthiness of the company itself is dubious It wont be until next week when the utility begins negotiating new contracts that it will know if the CPUC action will overcome the suppliers reluctance to extend contracts in the current situation according to PGE gas utility spokesperson Staci Homrig On the operational side PGE on Wednesday declared a lowinventory OFO because of a cold snap causing more supplies to be burned then pipeline shippers were bringing into the system The action was thought to help cause the PGE citygate price to jump from to on Wednesday As for reports of low storage Homrig said that while the utilitys supplies are very low they are adequate for the next week They are not dipping into cushion or base gas at this point Homrig said Lynch said that PGE has not defaulted on any payments but nevertheless in what she considers predatory practices the suppliers have required advance payments or payment at the time supplies are provided These gas suppliers are taking advantage of an emergency situation to extract another pound of flesh Lynch said in voting for the securitization measure Suppliers who have been paid when due are now saying regardless of existing agreements pay us today They are doing this in the coldest time of the year so the commissioners have to take these difficult steps to allow PGE amend these agreements in order to keep the gas flowing Part of the CPUCs action places a day limit on the securitization option so with the way gas contracts work in effect it only provides about another days worth of supplies said Homrig who noted that almost all of PGEs to suppliers have asked for special payment arrangements advances cashondelivery or letters of credit that the company cannot accommodate because of its cashflow crisis Out of ongoing negotiations the parties came up with the securitization proposal in the customer account receivables thus assuring them they will get paid On the gas side PGE has had sufficient revenues unlike its electric business but the suppliers have not wanted to let the utility stick to a normal payment arrangement because of the severe creditrating decline in the past weeks The CPUC met in San Francisco late Wednesday afternoon in the midst of a whirlwind day of public announcements from the governor state legislature consumer groups regulators and utilities A key piece was missing however California state legislative leaders called off a morning briefing that was to have offered the latest legislative proposals for dealing with the energy crisis Reportedly sticking points remain centered on the key questions of who pays for the solutions and how deeply the state gets into the energy business A spokesman for the assembly speakers office said he had no idea when the briefing would be rescheduled One piece of legislation that got through the state Senate SB X yesterday authorizes another million in emergency funds to purchase power It also would allow the state water resources department to be the utilities wholesale power supplier under longterm contracts at least through The measure drew a protest from CPUC Commissioner Richard Bilas who argued that the state agency be removed from that role as quickly as possible The bill which was first passed by the state Assembly was returned to assembly committees last night to iron out changes made in the senate It then would have to be ratified again by the Assembly Meanwhile consumer activists held rallies around the state protesting the state bailout of the privatesector utilities This prompted at least one of the utilities Southern California Edison to come out swinging saying that the recently released results of utility financial audits do not show any windfall profits or diversion of monies from the utilities to the parent company A letter surfaced in Washington from Gov Gray Davis to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee dated Jan and outlining measures the state is taking to increase energy supply and decrease demand sign longterm contracts and maintain the financial viability of the states public utilities The letter a catalogue of recent initiatives already reported here contained no specifics on any longterm contracts nor legislation signed that would address the immediate problem Davis outlined measures being taken to speed up siting of new power plants saying an additional MW would be online by the end of the year Responding to questions on another arena Edison Internationals senior vice president Tom Higgins said everything is on the table in the ongoing negotiations between Davis threeperson negotiating team and the two utilities including dropping the pending lawsuit in federal court in Los Angeles and crediting excess revenues from the utilities own generation against the whopping wholesale power cost undercollections The state remained under a power watch for the th day as the California independent grid operator CalISO urged conservation because reserves remain very low

mailtoIMCEANOTESwebmasterceraEcom NRONcom Sent Monday February PM To Subject Californias Desperate Attempts to Avoid a Rate Increase CERA Al ert Title Californias Desperate Attempts to Avoid a Rate Increase URL eprofileuDmD Californias Desperate Attempts to Avoid a Rate Increase On February the California Assembly approved and the California governor signed a new law intended to secure power supplies for California The legislature has been meeting since early January in a special extraordi nary session to address the power market crisis in the state and the new la w represents their first significant piece of legislation The bill AB establishes a new mechanism for purchasing power for the states busines ses and consumers Whether the mechanism works will depend chiefly on whether the limited revenue source used to pay for the powercollected by the state s investorowned utilities IOUs under current retail rateswill cover wholesale power market costs incurred by the state The law reflects the obsession by California lawmakers with avoiding a rate increase rather than focusing on the underlying flaws in Californias market structure AB ushers in several important changes to the California market structure It also contains several key provisions that capture the political mood in the state Highlights of the bill include Power buying authority transferred The responsibility for purchasing pow er for the customers of Californias IOUs has been transferred to the Calif ornia Department of Water Resources CDWR The California utilities will continu e to operate and schedule their remaining generating facilities and contracts T he difference between the utilities total load and the sum of their resour ces referred to as the utilities net short amount will be supplie d by CDWR an amount of energy that varies between and megawatts MW depending on the time of year time of day and utility plant availability The utilities most recently performed this function themselves buying energy from the California Power Exchange PX However CDWR has been buying electricity o n behalf of the IOUs since midJanuary when the nearbankruptcy of Southern California Edison SCE and Pacific Gas Electric PGE threatened to disrupt supplies to their customers CDWR is a state agency that manages water reservoirs and transportation systems in the state CDWR uses an enormous amount of electricity to transport water across California and provides critical loadshedding capability to the independent system operator ISO In addition CDWRs reservoirs generate power The CDWR is thus well integr ated in the states electric grid but in the past has not executed large compli cated energy purchase arrangements to supply the customers of Californias utilities Portfolio of transactions The intent of AB is to allow CDWR to execute a portfolio of contracts to stabilize the cost of power for the utilities and their customers CDWR has until January to execute contracts CDWR will take title to power and is thereby not just acting as a clearinghouse It has issued a request for bids and seeks a variety of terms including month ly annual twoyear threeyear and longer CDWR may also enter into options Thus although CDWRs role is intended to be temporary the contracts th at it executes could extend many years Power for munis CDWR may purchase power on behalf of some California municipal utilities at the municipal utilities election New payment scheme CDWR will be entitled to a portion of existing utilit y rates to pay for the cost of purchased power interest on bonds and administrative expenses This payment stream will be equal to the differenc e between the generation component currently embedded in utility retail rates averaging about per kilowatthour kWh and the utilities costs to run their own generation plants costs of bilateral and qualifying facility contracts and the costs of ancillary services The CDWR share of retail ra tes is referred to as the California Purchase Adjustment CPA It is not clear whether the CPA will cover wholesale power market costs Current prices for multiyear power contracts may lie above the CPA In addition if investors believe that the CPA is inadequate to cover costs the entire program may b e abandoned New bonds Bonds will be issued to secure power The total amount of bond s issued may not exceed four times the CPA The state will transfer mill ion from the general fund to jumpstart the program which begins immediately This seed money and all bond proceeds must be recovered by CDWR from the Califor nia utilities customers and municipal utilities if they opt in New residential rate freeze The California Public Utilities Commission CPUC is prohibited from increasing residential customer rates until it ha s completed paying all outstanding obligations This locks in the recent percent residential rate increase indefinitely Governor Gray Davis thus ke eps his pledge not to increase rates further Retail competition To help secure a stable payment stream for the new bonds AB enables the CPUC to prohibit the utilities retail customers from choosing an alternative electricity provider until CDWRs obligations are paid Although the CPUC has yet to act on this the action would effectively halt the competitive retail markets in the state for the duration of the CDWR progra m Taxpayer protection AB directs that the new bonds clearly state neither the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the State of California is pledged to the payment of the principal of or interest on this bond Thus the bonds are secured only by the payment stream from utility rates No assets affected The CDWR is granted neither ownership nor control of utility assets Ironically the authority now granted CDWR is what California utilities had essentially requested last summer when they sought to stabilize electricity prices by executing a portfolio of transactions The utilities were never provided sufficient authority to execute term contracts In addition the utilities have more experience to perform this function than CDWR Rather than aligning retail rates with wholesale electricity prices California has sidestepped the issue by simply transferring the electricity purchasing function SCE and PGE are still left to contend with uncollected costs fro m past energy purchases although they will no longer incur costs associated with buying power in the current wholesale market while charging frozen retail rates The utility liquidity crisis has not been resolved It is not clear whether the laws prohibition on rate increases for residential customers can be achieved The law is silent on rate increases for commerci al and industrial customers providing a potential path for recovering higherthan expected costs Alternatively CDWR could conceivably find contracts of sufficient duration and low enough price that the rate pledge is met These contracts would lock in todays retail rates for a long period of time AB is just one of the steps that state officials hope will restore the po wer system in California to a more stable footing Key tasks remain Californias wholesale market structure which helped cause the supply crisis by ensuring that it was not profitable or possible to build generation in California remains unchanged The term contracts CDWR is likely to sign wi ll provide a mechanism for mainly existing generators to lay off risk but will not be sufficient to encourage the build of sufficient new facilities In addition Californias siting and permitting process remains largely unchanged The state must still address the need to expedite the development of new power plants AB does not provide for the recovery of uncollected past wholesale ener gy costs of Californias utilities The state has been negotiating a deal w ith the utilities that may involve the transfer of generation or transmission asset s to the state However the utilities have achieved recent court victories that may pave the way to a courtdirected recovery of these costs Recent audits indicate that SCE and PGE recovered their stranded costs early in wh ich should have triggered an end to their respective rate freezes A legal showdown between the utilities and the state on this issue may be inevitable end Follow above URL for full report Come Shoot the Rapids with us at CERAWeek

Economic Development Councils Worth spending some time with them Lorna Wednesday February Nevada Goes for the Gold By Dave Todd mailto Its a reverse twist on Americas economic history One might even call it a case of Eastward Ho For the first time in the nearly two centuries that California has been part of the United States entrepreneurs are talking about leaving not moving into the Golden State because of potential opportunities for doing business to the east Not much farther east only over the mountains into neighboring states but still in that direction as opposed to jurisdictions north or south of California And the biggest lights in the eyes of one particular industry are emanating from Nevada Jack Stewart president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association recently warned that massive power price increases and future rate hikes could be the genesis for industry departures from the state The impact on large industrial users he warned could provide an impetus for a statewide economic downturn in California which accounts for about of the United States GDP Californias mass exodus Since the beginning of the year Nevadas primary economic development agencies have been overwhelmed by California companies wanting to relocate some or all of their operations to the state The bad news for California is that the list includes many Silicon Valley enterprises or wannabes whose growth planning units have been gripped by uncertainty about the dependability of future electric supply delivery Somer Hollingsworth president and CEO of the Nevada Development Authority in Las Vegas said in late January he was urgently asked to meet with corporate officials of a major California company to brief them about relocating to Nevada In meeting with the company he asked Are there others like you And they said yes we can introduce you to company after company after company Overwhelmingly it is hightech California companies that are most interested in moving because of their evergrowing requirements for reliability in their electric service Beyond that We have five power companies that have already come down here and talked to uspower producers he said These companies including Calpine Corp are keen to take advantage of a variety of opportunities made easier by the fact that unlike California Nevada has no state income tax and no general corporate or business inventory tax putting it at both a geographical proximity and tax advantage to California It also puts Nevada ahead of other lowtax Western states such as Arizona Colorado and Utah RenoSilicon Valley share symbiotic relationship Hollingsworths northern counterpart at Renos publicprivate sectorbacked agency the Economic Development Association of Western Nevada EDAWN tells a similar story Chuck Alvey who heads that body says interest in his city from Silicon Valley refugees is becoming intense A mere threehours drive and minute plane ride from the San FranciscoSan Jose area Reno and Lake Tahoe already house hundreds of hightech industry executives who commute back and forth and who have up to now escaped the impact of power drains caused by their energyintensive industries Server farms banks of computers that manage Web sites and related business operations continue to grow in number A single server farm can require as much as MW of power to operate Strict new federal energy efficiency standards to curb demand by other power hogs such as residential central air conditioners and heat pumps clothes washers water heaters and commercial heating and cooling equipment wont be implemented in time to affect the current power crisis The US Department of Energy last month announced that the energy conservation measures could save consumers and businesses more than billion over the next years Though the energy saved would eliminate the need for MW of new power generation the new standards wouldnt be phased in until between and Stan Thomas director of business planning and growth strategies for Sierra Pacific Power Co Nevadas dominant energy company said his business has experienced great success at moving Silicon Valleybased firms divisions into Nevada albeit in a limited way But were seeing a lot more companies saying Wait a minute We cant operate here anymore with power being shut off and having payrolls to meet and not producing any product He added that getting a little more aggressive about enticing electricity supplyconstrained companies to relocate to Nevada is no longer likely to be seen as a cherrypicking operation at another states expense In fact Nevada froze its electric deregulation planning last year pausing to reconsider its options as a direct result of Californias policy confusion We have delayed until we have a plan together where capacity exceeds native instate demand said Thomas Sierra Pacifics power delivery capabilities are being enhanced by its plan to build a new kV line in eastern Nevada to import power from Utah In it also installed a major line into the Pacific Northwest Both developments are significant because the company has switched its strategy to become more of a power transmission distribution company than a generator Were learning our lesson here said Thomas Setting aside the issue of burgeoning energy demand requirements across the West the need to recover stranded costs associated with deregulation is a preoccupation for power plantowners in general he said As for California I think the next couple of years are going to be some tight times no doubt about it And thats why what were trying to do in Nevada is secure longterm contracts as well as shortterm contracts to protect our customers while were in the process of securing capacity to ensure that we have an adequate supply of electricity at reasonable rates Other areas targeting California companies Its not just Nevadas physical proximity to California that helps it attract relocating companies Its also the different opportunities offered by Nevadas two main population centers Reno and Las Vegas Both cities attract different kinds of energydependent businesses from California In this regard We are two different markets said Thomas In any case Nevada isnt the only state thats getting calls and returning interest in kind Half a continent away Tennessees state department of economic and community development recently targeted about California companies with financial enticements and advertisements that proclaim the lights are always on in the electric powerrich Tennessee Valley Authoritys service territory Elsewhere across the nation from Seattle to Manhattan there are initiatives to build or refurbish buildings to make them capable of servicing highenergy demand Internetrelated data centers Nevada however has one giant advantage aside from being closer to California Las Vegas for example has one of the most extensive readily accessible black fiber systems of any major metropolitan area in the United States But of course it would As the Nevada Development Authoritys Hollingsworth joked Most everything we have here is stateoftheart and brand new because we blow everything up every years We just implode it and build something new The most recent casualty to fall to progress was the El Rancho Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip deemed past its prime which bit the dust in October in a televised entertainment spectacle Power to the people

by Lorna BrennanETSEnron on AM on PM To cc Subject Monthly Briefing In a High Range CERA Alert CERA Alert Sent Tue August Title Monthly Briefing In a High Range Author N American Gas Team EMail Category Alert Product Line North American Gas URL cfmtrackeprofilecfmum Alternative URL clientnagaltnagaltabhtml Gas prices remain within a high range with prices volatile between approximately and per million British thermal units MMBtu Prices are likely to remain within this high band through the fall until the uncertainty of early winter weather resolves itself At the lower end of this rangeand with oil prices in the upper s per barrel or higherprice support kicks in as end users begin to switch back toward gas or to reactivate industrial demand Gas prices may flirt with the lower boundary so long as the weather is not too hot across too many regions allowing storage injections to increase and providing hopes for an adequately supplied winter Abovenormal heat in only one or two regions however or even the threat of storms in the Gulf of Mexico will pull prices quickly upward As for the upper boundary although prices in specific regions such as California and the Northeast may reach above an actual storm in the Gulf or more widespread heat than has yet occurred this summer appears required to pull the Henry Hub much above Absent tropical storm activity in the Gulf of Mexico CERA expects prices to settle into the lower portion of this band during September see Table Although strong power loads and the resulting weak injection rates are likely to sustain prices through much of August the seasonal decline in generation demand into September should allow storage injections to increase by billion cubic feet Bcf per day As a result CERA expects prices to settle somewhat averaging per MMBtu at the Henry Hub during September However the larger fundamental force in the market remains unchanged supplies are adequate with any certainty only for another warm winter Any interruption in supply or abnormal demand will quickly drive prices upward next month may represent the low for the remainder of the year Gas StorageNot Yet Enough Mild weather over much of the United States during July allowed a muchneeded recovery in storage injections with the estimated injection rate increasing by nearly Bcf per day from yearearlier levels see Table This rate was enabled entirely by lower demand however and not added supply The result is that under more normal summer weather conditions during August the US storage inventory deficit is likely to remain stubbornly near Bcf Although the deficit is likely to decline on average during August it is even more likely to expand again during September especially should any storm necessitate evacuation of offshore platforms Absolute inventories and supply adequacy for this winter therefore remain a concern in the market Inventories are unlikely to reach levels adequate to prevent record lows from occurring next spring Should injections continue as expected inventories would reach approximately Bcf by October but reaching even this level still an alltime low annual maximum inventory requires some help from a lack of storm activity and a lack of heating load in October Storage inventories are not yet sufficient to relieve market pressure and are unlikely to become so by the beginning of the heating season Regional MarketsWestern Disconnects Continue Wide differentials emerged this summer in the West and look likely to persist through September In Southern California record summer demand levels have pushed pipeline flows to new highs Topock continues to be the premium pricing point in North America In the Rockies supply growth has pushed up pipeline flows out of the region Power loads should ease somewhat in Southern California and that easing will bring some decline in the Topock premium Pressure on Rocky Mountains and San Juan prices should persist until the start of the heating season in late October see Table CERAs outlook by region follows Rockies Pipeline capacity out of the Rockies is running nearly full to every export market except the San Juan Basin Emerging pipeline bottlenecks should keep differentials wide during September with an average differential of per MMBtu San Juan In the San Juan increased imports from the Rocky Mountains and high utilization rates on capacity into California are pressuring prices CERA expects differentials to average per MMBtu for the month of September San Juan differentials will narrow more substantially when Rocky Mountain pipeline bottlenecks are relieved by increases in heating demand during the fourth quarter Permian and MidContinent Strong power loads in Texas have supported Permian Basin prices during July and August Persistent power demand is expected to keep differentials around per MMBtu for September MidContinent prices should average just under Permian prices Chicago Steady storage injection loads are unlikely to support prices at Chicago in the face of declining power generation into September July premiums of to have already come down in early August and are likely to remain low at approximately for September Northeast markets Northeast price premiums have averaged from the mids to the mids depending on generation load and proximity to the New York Facilities Group major meters CERA expects little to change this relationship but as generation loads decline into September premiums could move closer to the fuel cost floor the mid to high s Canadian MarketsSupply Growth Still Disappointing Although June displayed yearoveryear growth in production in western Canada July reverted to a decline and August is running close to last years level The current expectation is for over well completions in approximately of which are expected to be gas wells Even if the trend toward shallow drilling does not change substantially the sheer number of wells is expected to produce a supply build by yearend and into For the total western Canadian supply build is expected to be flat with increasing to a positive growth of MMcf per day in Demand Slow but Exports Up TransCanada flows are down MMcf per day on average for but have been down by over MMcf per day so far in the third quarter PGE GTNW volumes were up by over MMcf per day in June and July but have dropped to yearearlier levels in August and are expected to remain close to last years levels for September Northern Border Pipeline is operating at rates similar to last years on average in but is expected to decrease about MMcf per day for the third quarter Western Canadian demand is currently up slightly driven by the warmerthannormal weather in late July and early August but should be closer to levels in September High Prices Wide Differentials The AECOHenry differential has widened quite dramatically over the past few months from the low USs of the first quarter to US in July The differential increased to well over a dollar in the second week of August but the driver for that increase was maintenance that reduced the export capacity at Empress August and September are expected to average in the mids AECO is expected to average C per gigajoule GJ US per MMBtu for August with September softening to C per GJ US per MMBtu for a third quarter average of C per GJ US per MMBtu end

Gorillas Show Strong Volume Growth The year was a banner year for the top players in gas marketing with huge increases in gas prices enormous volatility continuing growth in sales volumes and major potential for profits Physical gas sales volumes for the top marketers in NGIs ranking grew to nearly Bcfd and profits among the larger players came in very strong with companies such as Williams reporting profit increases in their energy merchant segments However for many of the smaller players it was a tough year The big news here is probably the price pressure the marketers have had to withstand said Ben Schlesinger president of Marylandbased consulting firm Schlesinger and Associates which tracks energy marketing These people have price exposure on both sides of their business the buy side and sell side Theyve actively sought to hedge these risks but theres no question that there have been some real stresses in their businesses as a result of quadrupling gas prices in Significant shuffling has begun to take place and will continue not just among the leadership but among the whole roster of marketing companies predicted Schlesinger For the first time Im not sure all will make it because of the price volatility and the stresses that it creates on their balance sheets and their ability to meet the different needs of their customers If you are on the wrong side of a transaction these days in California you are going to suffer significantly Its not much different at the Henry Hub either he noted The harsh reality is that only the strong will survive Ronald J Barone of UBS Warburg believes the California energy crisis and fears of lack of gas supply and capacity are driving customers to the strongest marketers I think that over the long term it will be a positive for the bigger players such as Enron Customers want to go with somebody who is big has facilities somebody who is going to guarantee it somebody who can do risk management for them Enron is the pound gorilla here Enron has been the pound gorilla in gas marketing for years but there were always plenty of pound gorillas around Last year however Enron found a way to trade natural gas over the Internet and at last glance was well over pounds more than double the size of its next closest rival gorilla Duke Energy Enron sold Bcfd of gas last year compared to only Bcfd the year prior and compared to the Bcfd sold by Duke Energy which came in second place in NGIs ranking of gas marketers by physical sales volume Enron catapulted itself to the next level with the help of its handy new tool EnronOnline its webbased proprietary energy and commodity trading system that now handles about mainly natural gas transactions each day In Enron completed its first full year of deploying EnronOnline which quickly became the worlds largest webbased ecommerce site During the year Enron executed transactions online with customers totaling billion of gross value The tremendous success of EnronOnline led many observers to wonder whether market concentration was beginning to take place in the industry When you look at Enrons massive increase in wholesale transactions you have to wonder about that concentration Enrons Bcfd is pretty large when compared with the Bcfd that is actually consumed in North America But you have to factor in multiple trades one marketer trades a given molecule of gas to another marketer and so on According to Schlesinger the socalled churning factor is close to three In the past several years when weve been polling marketers we got numbers in that came to about Tcf We added up all the physical sales by all the marketing companies We did not have response in our survey some of the midsized and smaller companies didnt respond We reasonably extrapolated that about Tcf maybe even Tcf of gas was traded each year in North America Physical consumption in North America is about Tcf so divided by is about Using that calculation Enron with Bcfd of physical gas sales in ends up with a not unreasonable market share When the Federal Trade Commission looks at markets and market share it uses several tools one of which is the HerschmanHerfindahl Index a measure of market concentration Its the sum of the squares of the market share of each participant If one company owns the entire of the market thats an HHI of The Department of Justice has been using as a red flag when it considers approval of mergers and acquisitions According to Schlesinger the total gas industry has an HHI of only about way below any suggestion of market concentration Its so low that its unbelievable Its a highly competitive business Even if one competitor has of the market HHI of and the next competitor has and on down it certainly doesnt send up any red flags he said It could be that market concentration in the gas industry has risen a bit in but this information alone would not diminish the fact that the industry is one of the most competitive businesses in the United States However there may be some regional issues we have to think about he added We havent looked at that so I cant comment on whether anyone has undue market power in a particular region or state for example There is a snowball effect going on among the top marketers The leaders keep getting larger Volume growth averages at least per year or more Several factors should fuel future growth Price increases volatility and uncertainty of supplies are driving buyers to the larger marketers according to both Schlesinger and Barone Online trading has become a new springboard for additional growth by allowing greater efficiency and many more trades to take place Schlesinger said he believes electronic trading was responsible for a good part the increase in volumes Enron attributed much of its growth to the online business According to some observers online trading still has plenty of room to grow Altra Energy CEO Paul Bourke believes about of all gas trading now takes place over the Internet Bourke said Altra had natural gas trades on its system in December However Barone predicts there eventually will be a slowdown in gas marketing growth in the United States as international energy markets grab the attention of many marketers International should pick up the slack and contribute increasingly to the bottom line he said Barone also expects the current market situation and the continued interest in service supply and commodity versatility to continue driving marketing companies together I think size scope and scale are incredibly significant Only one of the top major marketers last year resulted from the combination of two separate predecessors Axia which grew out of the combination of Koch Energy and Entergy The rest of the group achieved its growth without major acquisitions or mergers Thirteen out of the top marketers showed double or tripledigit volume growth with only two companies in the minus column PGE had the largest volume deterioration of any of the large marketers with a decline in annual volumes and a decline in quarterly volumes PGE went through a significant reorganization last year The move of its National Energy Group NEG to Bethesda MD from Houston had the greatest impact on its trading activity But the company also sold its energy services business and its Texas gas transmission assets among other changes It really slowed down our trading and a large number of people stayed behind in Houston said company spokesman Patrick Hurston At the time of the move the company estimated about half or would make the move Hurston wouldnt say how many actually made the trip but the company is still actively hiring TransCanada which also underwent a massive reorganization last year was the other company in the minus column with a decline in sales volume The remainder of the group experienced large increases in volumes Enron at Duke with growth Sempra with and BP Amoco with growth

FrontierNote I have the Western Frontier certificate filing if anyone wants to see it LB Petal Expansion ANR Lateral Extension Transcos Leidy Project OKd The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC issued several important certificates Wednesday for new gas pipeline infrastructure projects including final approvals for Transcontinental Gas Pipe Lines Leidy East expansion in Pennsylvania for a new pipeline by Petal Gas Storage in Mississippi and for an ANR lateral extension to serve to MW Badger power plant in Kenosha WI The Commission also denied rehearing of its orders granting Kern River Gas Transmission certificates to expand its system by about MMcfd Transcos million Leidy East pipe expansion project would make up for the failed Phase III portion of its MarketLink expansion The Leidy East project will provide up to Dthd of transportation from Leidy PA to northeastern markets in New Jersey New York and Pennsylvania The expansion consists of six pipeline loop segments that amount to miles of inch diameter pipe and about five miles of inch diameter pipe mostly in western Pennsylvania The project also would add hp of compression in Pennsylvania and New Jersey The Commissions authorization is being granted based on our findingsthat the proposed facilities will serve the public interest by increasing the pipeline capacity reaching the northeastern United States thereby helping to meet the rapid growth in electric generation demand in that market FERC said in its draft order Since the overwhelming majority of the proposed facilities will be constructed either entirely within or immediately adjacent to existing pipeline or utility rights of way the projects environmental impact will be minimized Finally Transcos existing customers will not subsidize the project because the expansion shippers will pay an incremental rate Transco said this summer that it expects the Leidy East facilities to be in service by November The Williams subsidiary said Aquila Energy Marketing Dthd PECO Energy Co Dthd Reliant Energy Services Dthd and Williams Energy Marketing Dthd are all customers The incremental reservation rate for service on the expanded facilities is Dthmonth The certificate granted to Petal Gas Storage LLC see related story covers a new pipeline that would extend miles to a connection with Southern Natural at a compressor station near Enterprise MS The million project also includes a new horsepower compressor station The project is designed to deliver Dthd of gas to Southern Companys gasfired generation in the Southeast ANR Pipelines lateral extension will carry about MMcfd of gas to Badger Generating Cos proposed power plant in Wisconsin The project includes miles of inch diameter looping along ANRs Racine Lateral and a mile extension of the lateral to the Badger plant The project would cost million and should be in service during the summer of In the Kern River case shippers had requested rehearing of FERCs order granting Kern authorization for its Dthd Expansion Project and an additional Dthd under its revised California Action project Shippers claimed the project would allow the sale of additional delivery point rights at the Wheeler Ridge point in Southern California causing further pro rata reductions in capacity for existing shippers and diminishing their firm rights Shippers said the Commission should subordinate the delivery point rights of expansion shippers to those of existing shippers until Southern California Gas builds enough takeaway capacity at Wheeler Ridge to accommodate the additional volumes However the Commission upheld its initial conclusion that the benefits of the project outweighed any risks of degrading delivery point rights given the critical need for expansions of pipeline capacity to serve electric and natural gas infrastructure in California Gulf South Sees Strong Interest in Billion Southeast Pipe Houstonbased Gulf South Pipeline Co LP formerly Koch Gateway Pipeline on Wednesday said the open season for the companys proposed billion Gulf Pines Pipeline was extremely successful adding that response to the Bcfd line from the Southeast markets far exceeded the companys expectations The open season concluded on Sept The proposed mile inch diameter or greater natural gas pipeline which was first announced in August is expected to originate in Mobile AL and extend through the states of Georgia South Carolina and North Carolina The open season clearly confirmed that the demand exists for a competitive alternative to serve the growing power generation commercial residential and industrial markets in the southeastern United States said Gulf South President Rolf Gafvert The Gulf Pines project would interconnect with the existing Gulf South pipeline near Mobile Bay enabling customers to access not only Mobile Bay supplies but also gas supplies from Texas and Louisiana including Venice and the Henry Hub according to Gulf South a subsidiary of EntergyKoch LP The proposed pipeline also would have access to multiple thirdparty storage facilities such as Gulf Souths facility in Bistineau LA We anticipate that the projected growth of power plants will far exceed existing pipeline capacity in the southeastern region said Gulf South spokesman Marc Palazzo In addition to serving power generation the company said Gulf Pines would extend farther east into the Carolinas than any existing interstate pipeline bringing interstate pipeline service to a region that historically has not had service before Palazzo said the project would be filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission next year He added that the actual route of the proposed pipeline is still to be determined Gulf South said the anticipated inservice date is sometime in Gulf South currently owns and operates miles of pipeline with compressor stations and major pipeline interconnects extending from South Texas through the Gulf States and into the Florida market area Williams Files to Build Mile Western Frontier Pipe Williams Gas Pipeline has filed an application for a new million pipeline that would extend from the Cheyenne hub in northern Colorado to multiple pipeline interconnections in southwestern Kansas and the panhandle of Oklahoma The Western Frontier Pipeline would consist of miles of inch diameter pipe and horsepower of compression It would transport up to Dthd of gas to markets in the Midcontinent In addition to an interconnection with the Williams Central system Western Frontier proposes access to other major Midcontinent pipelines including ANR Pipeline Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Northern Natural Gas and Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America Western Frontier also would have access to the growing Oklahoma intrastate markets via the Williams Central system The pipeline is anticipated to be in service by Nov Western Frontier Pipeline is a costeffective environmentally responsible way to transport natural gas from prolific Rockies supply basins to markets in the Midcontinent said Kim Cocklin senior vice president and general manager of Williams Central and Texas Gas systems We look forward to building this pipeline to help alleviate the current shortage of interstate pipeline capacity coming out of the region which was recently cited by the US Energy Information Administration Customers interested in

Operationsmarketing related rd Legislativeregulatory related El Paso Explosion Takes MMcfd Off Market About Bcfd of flow on El Pasos South Mainline downstream of Pecos River NM Station ceased after the pipeline exploded early Saturday killing people and seriously injuring two others at a nearby campsite El Paso said Monday it was able to compensate for about half that volume through a combination of fuel switching by downstream customers maximum storage withdrawals an OFO and other customer cooperation The market reaction was rather predictable as all three California points rose by about cents to lead an overall price surge However utilities in the state did not appear to be experiencing any supply problems SoCal Gas said storage and supplies from other Southwest receipt points were adequate to avoid any problems A gas operations official for Los Angeles Dept of Water and Power also saw no reason for panic From past similar incidents on Southwest pipelines he expected that the approximately feetlong section missing from El Pasos line could be slapped back into place rather quickly El Paso itself had no estimate for when it can restore service in the impacted segment it must get approval rom the federal investigators before beginning repairs or evaluating a restart of the adjacent lines But a large aggregator and a marketer agreed with the LADWP official that it should be a quick mechanical fix once repairs begin The aggregator believed downtime could be as short as a week No customers were cut off as a result of the rupture but some were getting reduced volumes an El Paso spokeswoman said Northern Natural Gas was seeing a throughput increase of MMcfd Monday while Transwestern volumes were up MMcfd as a result of shippers diverting gas away from El Pasos South Mainline an Enron spokeswoman said A producer said she diverted as much of her companys gas as possible from El Paso to Transwestern People were reluctant to trade Permian Basin gas Monday especially at fixed prices because of doubts about how much would be able to flow several sources said Permian numbers rose a little less than cents as part of the general upturn However it was Waha prices that saw a bigger increase of nearly cents as a result Everything in El PasoPermians Keystone pool was going back into Waha said a marketer putting Waha in the mid s at a premium of more than a nickel above Henry Hub The Southern California border at an average of nearly led the rest of Mondays market by a large margin Before trading began EnronOnline was offering border swing swaps for the rest of the month at a marketer said With swing swaps priced so high it gave sellers more confidence in what prices they could command in the day market he said Either way I wouldnt want to be short right now at the border There were lots of rumors but no facts available on what caused the El Paso rupture noted one aggregator But its a good thing it didnt happen until after California had cooled off Otherwise I could easily have seen the border basis spread from San Juan Basin go as high as instead of the approximate gap of egistered Monday by Daily GPI A knowledgeable source provided his analyis of the blast The structure of the crater made the rupture look like a line integrity problem from the way it blew out The earth can harbor leaking gas for a while until eventually everything all goes up at once People nearby would not have detected anything because gas is odorless in longhaul lines the mercaptan odorant is not added until it gets to the local distribution stage Pipeline safety surveyors usually will look for dead vegetation in the vicinity to detect a leak but this was a desert area with very little vegetation It is easily possible for escaping gas to hug the ground for the approximate foot distance to the victims campsite and seek an ignition source there It is a normal tendency for gas leaking into the atmosphere to stay close to the ground and that tendency would have been amplied by the chilliness of the predawn desert The source went on to say I think there will be lot more of this ruptures in the future with many pipes becoming at least years old El Paso was unlucky in experiencing one of the early incidents he said because the situation applies to the other lines with old pipe Pipelines used to spend a lot more money on maintenance when regulation was tighter and they were still paying for depreciation he said Now theyre more purely forprofit companies after having written off their depreciation costs many times over El Paso Blast Kills Shuts Down South Mainline Federal and company investigators Monday swarmed over the scene of the devastating El Paso Natural Gas mainline explosion that erupted near daybreak Saturday engulfing a party of weekend campers along the Pecos River near Carlsbad NM and killing people Two other persons were hospitalized in critical condition Three officials from the federal Office of Pipeline Safety OPS and with the National Transportation Safety Board NTSB have been at the site of the blast since late Saturday and two more OPS officials were en route Monday New Mexico Gov Gary Johnson who flew to the area on Sunday said he wanted to know how many other potential pipeline dangers there are in the state He called for a thorough investigation About Bcfd of capacity on El Pasos southern leg initially was lost from the ruptured inch line and two looped lines nearby that were shut in after the accident El Paso was making up some of the shortfall by drawing the maximum MMcfd from its Washington Ranch Storage Field downstream of the accident Increased use of other pipelines allocations and cutbacks by customers and the fact that weather had moderated in California helped ease the supply situation Nevertheless spot prices increased by about cents for points in California while the rest of the market spurred by Hurricane Debby went up about cents There was no estimate as to when the looped lines would be back in service according to El Paso spokesperson Kim Wallace We dont intend to put anything back into service until we know for certain that the remaining pipelines are safe Wallace said She did not expect them to be back in service today and could give no time frame on when they would be returned to service It is much too premature at this point to predict when the three disabled El Paso westbound lines will return to service said Patricia Klinger a spokeswoman with the Department of Transportations Research and Special Programs Administration RSPA which oversees the OPS The one that ruptured is definitely going to be out of service for awhile and another line is badly damaged from the fire As for a third adjacent line that could potentially be reopened but we have to test the integrity of that line and have it examined by metallurgists she told Daily GPI Everyone will be working of course to try to get this line back in service But the safe operation of the pipeline is of premiere importance The three lines shared the same rightofway Were just now able to start looking at exactly what happened and how to get that one line back in service Klinger said Our metallurgist is on his way right now I know hes going to meet with the NTSB when theyre examining the foot section of pipe thats out of the ground as a result of the explosion I think the company also wants to decide what types of tests can be done on this line Its not piggable The NTSB which has set up a command center in Carlsbad NM declined to make any preliminary speculation about the cause of the explosion Its much too early for us to even think about the cause of this accident Were only dealing with the factsRight now were documenting the pipe itself and surveying the land Were going to look at the chronology of when the emergency calls came in document damage to vehicles and injuries said NTSB spokesman Keith Holloway Probably at this point were looking at nine months to a year maybe more before the results of the investigation are publicly disclosed Holloway noted The rupture occurred at am MDT in the underground line near the Pecos River crossing which is about miles south of the Carlsbad Caverns National Park in a spot popular with local campers and fishermen The blast tore a crater in the earth about feet long feet wide and feet deep According to preliminary reports the pipeline was underground at the point of rupture sending two sections of pipe each about feet long flying hundreds of feet The gas then ignited and shot flames from the broken pipe toward sleeping campers The NTSB estimated there was a gap of to feet between broken ends of the pipeline at the site The fire burned for about minutes before El Paso workers manually shut off pipeline valves Ten members of two families were burned to death in the blast The families who were related by marriage were camping on public land along the river near where the pipeline emerged from the ground to cross the Pecos in an aerial crossing alongside a bridge Six were pronounced dead at the scene and four others died at Texas hospitals Saturday night The dead included five children under the age of six including sixmonthold twins Two adults were listed in critical condition Monday at a hospital in Lubbock TX The ruptured pipeline which El Paso said was constructed in is one of four that runs along the southern branch of El Pasos pipeline system There is an adjacent inch pipeline and another inch pipeline The fourth a inch pipeline was abandoned and is not available for service Wallace said El Paso and federal officials are particularly interested in the integrity of the second inch pipeline that ran close to the broken line Wallace said that none of the companys customers had been cut off of service but they were receiving gas as reduced levels She also said that on Aug a patrol inspection either done by air or vehicle was conducted on the pipelines located near the Pecos River by El Paso officials and no problems were found El Paso conducted the last corrosion test in February and no problems were found then either Visual inspections are conducted on all of the systems pipelines once a month she said and the company follows all federal pipeline requirements for inspections Asked whether El Paso planned to change its inspection system immediately Wallace said that she did not think so but said that if the NTSB review finds something that needs to be changed the company will do whatever needs to be done immediately These situations are so rare she said We dont feel that we need to change what were doing now But if the situation warrants we certainly will make any changes necessary El Paso is working with family members to take care of their immediate needs including hotel accommodations food travel arrangements and medical treatment The company also is providing additional services as needed This is a tragic accident and our heartfelt condolences go out to the families involved said El Paso Energy President William Wise He said the company was working with the NTSB to investigate diligently all matters surrounding this accident and to establish its cause as quickly as possible The fallout of the explosion is expected to extend all across the country as federal legislators consider more stringent pipeline rules following an explosion in Bellingham WA that killed three in June Locally Carlsbad Mayor Gary Perkowski said that he wanted to find out what happened and keep it from ever happening again That reaction was echoed by the New Mexico governor I have a lot of questions said Johnson What is the reliability of these pipelines What went wrong Was it preventable Meanwhile RSPA was sifting through its history to determine whether the El Paso blast was the biggest pipeline disaster on record in terms of fatalities Timeline am Aug El Paso Natural Gas automated computer reading of the pressure in the pipeline indicates pounds per square inch Around am An El Paso Natural Gas employee bowhunting in the area sees a large fireball at the scene am El Paso Natural Gas automated computer reading of the pressure in the pipeline drops to pounds per square inch am Carlsbad Fire Department responds to the emergency am Carlsbad Fire Department arrives at the scene am El Paso Natural Gas workers shut off the gas line using manual valves Between Jan and June of this year there have been transmission pipeline incidents according to the OPS Fourteen were caused by either external or internal corrosion were damaged by outside forces three were due to construction or material defects and were unknown There was only one fatality until June of this year on transmission pipeline incidents which was caused by an outside force Eleven people had been injured through June In August OPS sent a warning letter to El Paso citing it for a number of pipeline safety violations in Arizona The OPS did not impose a civil fine on El Paso but it advised the pipeline that should you not correct the circumstances leading to the violation we will take enforcement actions when and if the continued violation comes to our attention El Paso Blast May Cinch Tough Pipe Safety Bill The explosion on El Paso Natural Gas system which killed people over the weekend may give Congress the added boost to pass a tough pipeline safety reauthorization bill when it returns from recess in September Capitol Hill insiders said Monday This just sadly proves why Congress needs to act as soon as it returns on Sept to pass the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act before any more innocent lives are taken said a spokeswoman for Sen John McCain RAZ In June Chairman McCains Senate Commerce Committee voted out the Pipeline Safety Improvement bill that would among other things give states inspection and oversight authority over interstate pipelines require interstate pipelines to consult with states about their integrity plans create stiffer penalties for pipeline safety transgressors and offer protection to whistleblowers who report pipeline violations McCain proposed the agressive safety bill following the product pipeline explosion in Bellingham WA that killed three in June McCain has always been determined to pass this bill this year but this obviously sadly strengthens that resolve she said He will make a determined effort for this to happen but whether its brought up for a vote on the Senate floor will be up to Senate Leader Trent Lott RMS the McCain spokeswoman said I have no doubts that the Senate will push for pipeline safety when it returns said Terry Boss vice president of environment safety and operations for the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America INGAA On the House side a companion to McCains bill has been introduced as well as a number of other pipeline safety measures but most are at the subcommittee level But the issue could pick up steam in the wake of the El Paso blast We must examine why this accident occurred and ensure that it must never happen again said Rep Joe Skeen RNM Definitely its a tragic situation Boss said referring to the explosion near Carlsbad NM which reportedly left a crater about feet deep feet wide and feet long Five of the fatalities were children who were spending a weekend camping and fishing with their family along the Pecos River The political fallout from the disaster was being assessed in Washington DC yesterday Any kind of incident has political ramificationsWere just not sure how this is going to directly impact pending legislation and regulations Boss noted

Over Portland Utility By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Robin Sidel Rebecca Smith and Nikhi l Deogun The Wall Street Journal B Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Enron Corp is in advanced discussions to sell its Portland General Electri c utility unit to Northwest Natural Gas Co for about billion in cash and stock in a highly leveraged transaction that would eventually give Enro n a minority stake in Northwest according to people familiar with the matt er The discussions are at a very delicate stage and some important points nee d to be finalized these people caution The current environment could also make financing such a transaction quite difficult and board approval isn t a certainty However should the two sides agree to terms a deal could b e announced in the next few days Northwest Natural is also expected to ass ume roughly billion in debt Enron and Northwest Natural declined to comment If a transaction is consu mmated it would come nearly six months after the collapse of Enrons agree ment to sell the utility to Sierra Pacific Resources That transaction fell apart in part because of the California energy crisis A purchase of Port land General would be a very big bite for Northwest Natural which has a ma rket capitalization of just million and supplies natural gas to more t han residential and business customers in Oregon and Vancouver Was h Portland General is an electric utility serving more than million cu stomers in Oregon The deal would bring together two Oregon utilities whos e executives and employees know each other well Richard G Reiten Northwe sts chairman and chief executive was president and chief operating office r of Portland General between and and also served on its board By buying a utility Northwest would hope to have more bargaining power in its gas purchases enabling it to buy more product and store it when price s are cheap A deal would be accretive to Northwests earnings people fami liar with the matter say And the financial risk for Northwest Natural is s omewhat muted because Enron is helping to facilitate and finance the transa ction by agreeing to take common stock and convertible preferred stock in N orthwest Natural in addition to cash Northwest Natural would finance the t ransaction with debt and equity offerings Shares of Northwest Natural wer e trading up at in pm composite trading on the New York St ock Exchange while Enron stock was down cents a share at For E nron a deal with Northwest Natural would be the latest twist in a fiveyea r ordeal that was supposed to help the nations biggest energy trader break into Californias deregulating electricity market But the utility busines s proved less valuable than anticipated when Enron was prevented from selli ng off utility contracts that enabled it to buy electricity cheaply And Ca lifornias market developed serious problems last year that made it a less attractive place for Enron to do business Enron which also owns a major gastransmission pipeline system has a history of buying assets and busine sses learning what it can from them and then selling off the bulk of phys ical assets so it can reinvest capital elsewhere It isnt clear where Enr on will put the capital to work that it garners from the sale Its broadban d telecommunications business is in the doldrums and it recently said it wo uld invest million in it

BrennanETSEnron on AM on PM To cc Subject Monthly Briefing A Shoulder Month Without Shoulder Prices CERA Alert CERA Alert Sent Tue August Title Monthly Briefing A Shoulder Month Without Shoulder Prices Author Zenker Snyder Moritzburke EMail Category Alert Product Line Western Energy URL cfmtrackeprofilecfmum Alternate URL clientcealtcealtabhtml As western markets continue to struggle through high August demand and prices for both power and natural gas September looms as the start of the fall shoulder season The shoulder season historically has brought the possibility of a break in weather and a demand drop in both power and gas prices from summer levels CERA expects this shoulder season to differ from years past however with power and gas markets producing strong yearoveryear prices and little relief from summer levels even with normal September weather Westwide power loads will decline but will remain similar to those in June a month with high power prices In addition compared with June levels hydroelectric capacity has dropped owing to reduced stream flows leaving more expensive gasfired generation to replace declining hydroelectric output CERA expects occasional hot weather and higher gas prices to push onpeak prices in the West to percent over September levels Continued strong use of gasfired generation in the West as well as low US storage inventories and tight supply demand balances will keep the pressure on gas prices Topock prices are expected to average per million British thermal units MMBtu in September These high September gas and power prices are driven by Declining hydroelectric output The months of September through November represent the low point for hydroelectric output in the West with rainfall historically boosting output in December Approximately average megawatts aMW will be available from hydroelectric facilities during the threemonth period This represents a net reduction in capacity of aMW when compared with the recent JuneAugust summer months and a reduction of aMW when compared with September levels Higher more variable power demand The Southwest and Southern California still experience hot weather in September and regional utilities typically consider it possible that a years peak load event will occur in September Spiking loads however can quickly retreat with a return to cooler weather Thus power loads and power prices are expected to experience a high degree of variability during September High levels of gasfired generation Load growth and a declining hydroelectric resource base will require gasfired resources to serve approximately the same level of demand as in June a month with similar average demand and monthly average onpeak power prices in the per megawatthour MWh range depending on the region This strong pull on gasfired plants will push deep into the generation resource base driving prices upward An additional billion cubic feet Bcf per day will be required for gasfired generators in the US West compared with September levels Strong North American gas prices Natural gas prices are expected to retain most of this summers peak levels as North American supplies remain tight A market anxious about winter demand and price levels will also limit a price retreat this fall As a result average September Henry Hub prices are expected to trade around per MMBtu An active storm season could keep Henry Hub prices near the mark Strong western basis differentials The strong demand for gas to serve gasfired generation and storage concurrently will maintain western basis differentials at high levels especially in the California markets CERA expects a TopocktoHenry Hub differential of per MMBtu during September Extended operational problems associated with El Pasos pipeline rupture would raise that outlook Regional Power Market Drivers Hotterthannormal August weather transmission and generator outages high natural gas prices and declining hydroelectric output all contributed to a rise in power price levels during August Southern California average power prices in August have thus far exceeded July levels by an average of per MWh during the onpeak period and by per MWh during the offpeak period MidColumbia power prices bearing the brunt of fireinduced transmission outages experienced a jump from July price levels of per MWh for the onpeak period and per MWh in the offpeak period Offpeak prices which have averaged above per MWh during the JuneAugust period are clearly defined by the production cost of gasfired resources Onpeak prices during this same period at over per MWh in all regions in all months have reflected a significant premium at times over the cost of the marginal system generator see Table A return to normal weather should drive Westwide loads down by aMW in September from August levels However load growth and a return to normal weather are expected to push loads up by aMW when compared with September levels These greater loads coupled with a reduction in hydroelectric generation of aMW from last Septembers levels will create supply tightness during September see Tables and Hydroelectric coal and nuclear generation together will be insufficient to serve Westwide demand in September even during much of the offpeak periods requiring gasfired resources to meet a significant portion of the load Gas demand for power generation is expected to average Bcf per day in September down from over Bcf per day in August but up by a dramatic Bcf per day compared with levels in September September power prices will be defined by a floor set by the incremental cost of gasfired generation approximately per MWh with prices frequently higher as demand increases As this summer has clearly demonstrated prices rise in a nonlinear fashion as supplies grow very tight Hot weatherinduced loads should provide additional examples of this relationship Cooler or hotterthannormal weather in September coupled with the inherent high variability of September loads will produce a wide range of price outcomes Under normal weather onpeak power prices are expected to fall in the per MWh range depending on location representing a percent premium to yearago September prices see Figure The latest revision of the California Independent System Operators ISOs imbalance energy market cap down to per MWh is expected to depress market prices during any weather events in September CERA expects the ISO price cap to limit prices outside of California as well Pacific Northwest Although demand levels in the Pacific Northwest are expected to retreat in September by at least aMW compared with those in the hotterthannormal month of August the loss in available capacity from hydroelectric resources will amount to aMW over the same period see Table Thus the Pacific Northwest will be in an even more limited position to export power to other regions With transmission interties operating at below rated capacity during this period power prices in the Pacific Northwest will maintain their tight relationship with those in Northern California These price levels will continue to support the operation of the regions limited quantity of gasfired generation MidColumbia onpeak price levels are expected to average per MWh in September Offpeak power price levels in the Pacific Northwest will also receive a boost from the strong markets to the south The expected September level of per MWh represents the opportunity cost of power sales in surrounding markets California The fall months initiate a seasonal shift in price differentials that separates the West into markets that lie north of transmission Path and those to the south As in years past hydrodepleted Northern California should experience demand levels that must be served by generation resources within the region Exports from the Pacific Northwest dwindle and energy from the nuclear and coalrich Southwest is constrained from entering Northern California by Path import limitations This condition which is expected to persist from September through November allows Northern California to price at a premium The expected monthly average onpeak Northern California price of per MWh incorporates this dynamic Notably the California ISO is completing a process to remap the zones in California in part to capture locational price differences more effectively Southern California like the Southwest will typically experience hot weather episodes in September During these high demand periods prices will rise to peak levels as experienced this summer In addition California as a whole should see average loads in September that are aMW higher than those of September Occasional cooler weather will sharply but temporarily reduce daily prices Southern California benefits from the abundant export capacity of the Southwest during cooler weather in that region allowing prices to fall well below those in Northern California An per MWh differential between the north and south portions of the state is expected with Southern California onpeak prices averaging per MWh Offpeak prices of and per MWh for Northern and Southern California respectively reflect the continued need for gasfired resources to support September offpeak loads Rockies and Southwest An extended period of hot weather in July and August has boosted demand in the Rockies a region with growing saturation of residential air conditioning Limited transmission capacity and a dearth of cheaper exports from surrounding regions have allowed the Rockies to price temporarily at a premium to all other regions in the West A return to normal weather in September should restore the previously tight relationship of Rockies prices to those in the North Rockies prices are expected to fall with loads with a September monthly onpeak price average of per MWh and an offpeak price average of per MWh CERA expects Southwest prices to be tightly connected to prices in Southern California on a monthly average basis The two regions generally experience the same September weather patterns and a strong MW transmission link between the two market centers allows them to balance loads with each other Strong gas prices and occasional market tightnessinduced price runups will maintain onpeak prices at the per MWh level in September Offpeak prices will like those in Southern California be buoyed by the high cost of gasfired generation A price level of per MWh is expected for offpeak prices Regional Gas Market Drivers The summer competition for gas supply between power and storage continues in North America with gas prices reflecting the intensity of that competition Even as the summer power peak subsides in September across the United States the need to continue strong storage injections and the threat of storms in the Gulf will keep prices high and volatile The storage deficit now stands at approximately Bcf and US storage inventories look likely to head into winter at historically low levels This critical storage situation will keep prices high despite overall declines in power loads in September CERA expects a Henry Hub price of per MMBtu during September In the West strong power loads and the potential for power peaks persist through September especially in California Overall total demand for gas is expected to decline across the West from Bcf per day during August to Bcf per day during September see Table This load will tend to keep intraregional differentials wide throughout the West during the month The recent price disconnects between the supplyrich Rocky Mountains and San Juan Basin and demandcharged California will persist October should bring some change in this dynamic as heating loads in the Rockies begin to increase In general winter will bring a dramatic shift in regional pricing differentials throughout the West The summer pressure on Rocky Mountain supplies caused by high utilization rates on most export pipelines will be relieved somewhat by regional heating loads Declines in flows into the San Juan Basin from the Rockies will take some downward pressure off prices in the San Juan On the other hand healthy California storage inventories should limit price premiums at Topock through the heating season The startup of the new Alliance pipeline which will draw gas to the Midwest will support prices in the Pacific Northwest and California California Topock continues to be the premium pricing point in North America although differentials between Southern California and the Henry Hub subsided somewhat from peak levels near per MMBtu before this weekends pipeline explosion Total imports into California reached record levels during July total imports of Bcf per day eclipsed the previous high by million cubic feet MMcf per day see Table Pipeline capacity into the state during the month ran at percent utilization So far in August pipeline capacity utilization is exceeding even that high rate running at percent These high rates of capacity utilization are putting pressure on gas prices in Southern California and the pressure should continue during September Total demand in California is expected to decline somewhat during September but continued strong power loads and low seasonal hydroelectric generation will provide support Total demand in the state should average Bcf per day down only slightly from Augusts total of Bcf per day Flows into the state between August and September are not likely to change significantly but price pressure should decline somewhat with demand The Topock differential to the Henry Hub should average approximately per MMBtu for September see Table Storage inventories in the West are still healthy relative to levels in the rest of the United States but the storage surplus in the region has eroded In California inventories are running lower than last year and the deficit in the state looks likely to widen during September The end of injection season storage inventories will determine the vulnerability of Topock differentials to winter price spikes Pacific Northwest Malin prices this summer have shown neither the strong premiums that Topock prices have shown nor the wide discounts that supplies in the Rocky Mountains and San Juan Basins have shown So far this month prices at Malin are averaging a per MMBtu discount to the Henry Hub Pipeline capacity into the region from the Rocky Mountains is running nearly full flows on PGT out of Alberta have averaged nearly Bcf per day this month Export capacity out of the region on PGE GT NW is running close to capacity and pipeline constraints to the south combined with strong California demand are driving the wide MalintoTopock differentials Continuing strong demand in the South will likely keep Topock prices strong and the wide northsouth differentials within the West will likely hold through September In the Pacific Northwest demand is expected to climb through September to Bcf per day from Bcf per day in August This demand level should keep Malin differentials from widening from current levels For September CERA expects Malin prices to average per MMBtu below the Henry Hub price Southwest Prices in the San Juan Basin this summer have been left behind by rising California demand Although the westward pull on supplies is strong bottlenecks between California and the San Juan have led to disconnects between San Juan prices and Topock prices Pipeline capacity utilization rates on Transwestern and the northern leg of El Paso reached percent during July with less than MMcf per day of excess pipeline capacity Increased flows from the Rockies on TransColorado and Northwest are contributing to downward pressure on San Juan Basin supply and in general the San Juan has followed Rocky Mountain prices rather than following prices at Topock or the Permian Basin Unlike in the past two summers the bottleneck has not allowed power demand on the West Coast to support San Juan prices relative to Permian prices The differential between San Juan and Permian has averaged per MMBtu so far this month and per MMBtu since June Additional imports from the Rockies into the San Juan have increased supply by MMcf per day relative to last summer but these higher flows do not fully explain the disconnect Without much change in Southwestern or Rocky Mountains local demand the San Juan should continue to price at a wide discount during September The San JuantoHenry Hub differential is expected to average per MMBtu As in the Rockies differentials should narrow substantially in October Rocky Mountains Downward pressures on Rocky Mountain prices intensified over the past month as utilization rates on pipelines out of the region continued to climb Record heat and power generation levels have done little to boost gas demand within the region generation is still largely coalbased and the demand impact on gas of the additional load is minimal CERA expects the heavy discountcurrent Rocky MountaintoHenry Hub differentials are around per MMBtuto persist through September Local area demand is not expected to change during September Substantial gain in local demand comes in October with heating loads October demand should average Bcf per day up from August and September averages of around Bcf per day Although the winter heating season will relieve pipeline pressures in the Rockies winter differentials are expected to stay in the to per MMBtu range Strong storage inventories will limit the connection with broader North American markets this summer Next summer pressures on Rockies supplies will likely intensify relative to this summer Although pipeline expansion projects have been announcedTrailblazer and Williams announced expansion plans this summerthe new capacity will not be online to relieve constraints next summer CERA expects supplies within the Rocky Mountains to increase by MMcf per day next year Western Canada After widening to over US per MMBtu the AECOHenry differential has begun to narrow somewhat maintenance that has restricted flows has largely been responsible for the jump from per MMBtu in July With current supply able to fill the contracted pipe capacity and incremental volumes having to pay full cost to flow differentials are likely to persist in the midUSs per MMBtu for September AECO is expected to be US per MMBtu C per gigajoule for September Even with the startup of the Alliance project the contract nonrenewal on TransCanada is likely to continue the twotiered pricing dynamics of contracted versus uncontracted pipeline costs This will result in differentials that will range between US and US per MMBtu throughout the winter Supply build in western Canada continues to languish behind last years levels The pace of drilling over gas wells are expected this year should provide growth in the fourth quarter and into Supply is expected to be flat with on an annual basis for this year and up at least MMcf per day in Sumas prices have been quite volatile driven by both weather in the Pacific Northwest and maintenance on the Westcoast system For September Sumas is expected to be slightly more stable and to price at a modest premium to AECO of US per MMBtu end Follow URL for PDF version of this Monthly Briefing with associated graphic and tables CERAs

Transwestern Pipeline executive yesterday dismissed allegations that the pipeline withheld firm transportation capacity bound for California from its recourserate shippers last winter in order to free up more capacity for contracts at substantially higher negotiated rates Mary Kay Miller vice president of rates and certificates acknowledged Transwestern may have had discussions and exchanged faxes prior to posting its available capacity with two shippers Sempra Energy and Richardson Products II Ltd that subsequently entered into negotiatedrate transactions But she stressed that requests for capacity by Sempra Energy and Richardson were considered moot by the pipeline until after the available operational capacity was posted Even if they would have senta fax the day before capacity became available it would have been irrelevant because there was no capacity posted at that time said Miller Capacity requests that came in prior to Jan the day that available capacity was posted for February contracts on Transwestern were null and void The only relevant ones were those that Transwestern received on or after Jan she noted Miller spent much of Wednesday on the stand being quizzed by lawyers for FERC and producers about Transwesterns methods for notifying customers about available capacity the manner in which it chooses winning bids and about its preposting contacts with Sempra Energy and Richardson It was the first day of a FERC hearing exploring charges that Transwestern exercised market power in awarding negotiatedrate contracts that led to shippers being charged as much as MMBtu last February far in excess of the pipelines maximum allowed rate of centsMMBtu for firm transportation service to the California border The Commission proceeding yesterday focused on four negotiatedrate contracts of Sempra Energy and Richardson for a total MMBtud of service on Transwestern during February and March Richardson and Sempra clearly did not have any deal entitling them to the posted capacity before it was posted Miller said in prepared rebuttal testimony The two companies had the right to the capacity only after they submitted their bids after the posting period ended after Transwestern determined that no other bids were submitted and after a contract was agreed upon between Transwestern Richardson or Sempra she noted Despite claims made by FERC energy industry analyst Barry E Sullivan to the contrary Transwestern did not withhold capacity that otherwise could have been made available under recourse rates in order to make the capacity available under substantially higher negotiated rates Miller testified Sullivan an analyst in the FERC Office of Markets Tariffs and Rates OMTR Division of Litigation contends that Transwestern threatened to withhold capacity unless shippers agreed to negotiated rates In fact he believes the preposting discussions between Transwestern and shippers were intended to raise doubts about the availability of capacity at the maximum recourse rate so that shippers might be more willing to enter into negotiatedrate contracts above the recourse rate in the hope of securing some of the capacity if and when it became available But Miller counters that Sullivan offers not support for his claim She noted that even Sempra Energy and Richardson in response to a data request by Southern California Edison support Transwesterns claims Both companies replied no when asked whether any employee of Transwestern or any Transwestern affiliate ever indicated at any time that Transwestern would not provide the capacity at the maximum tariff rate The capacity at issue was offered on Transwesterns web site at the recourse rate in the exact same manner that all other capacity is offered on Transwesterns web site at the recourse rate there was no prohibition restrictions limitation condition or suggestion that a potential shipper could not bid for the capacity at the recourse rate and any potential shipper including Richardson or Sempra could have submitted a bid for the capacity at the recourse rate Sullivan contends that Transwesterns motive for allegedly advancing negotiatedrate transactions at the expense of recourserate deals was pure profit Under questioning by Thomas J Burgess of FERCs OMTR Miller conceded that Transwestern earned million from Sempra Energys contract in March million from Richardsons March contract and a comparable amount from Richardsons February contract She noted the pipeline received a substantially higher amount as a result of Sempras February contract but she didnt provide an exact figure FERCs Sullivan estimated the pipelines profit from the Sempra February contract was more than million Sullivan said that much of the profits that wound up in Transwesterns coffers would have gone to Sempra Energy and Richardson if they have been able to acquire the capacity at recourse rates But Miller countered that the Commissions negotiatedrate policy does not require a minimum level of profit to shippers or contemplate any hindsight analysis of whether shippers could have gotten a better deal or made more profits Furthermore she said the Transwestern case shouldnt be used to consider changes to the negotiatedrate policy as Sullivan has suggested This case is the wrong forum for such an issue because modifying the negotiatedrate policy should only be done on an industrywide basis so no pipeline or group of pipeline customers is competitively disadvantaged

United announced plans to buy back the of its trading and risk management arm Aquila Inc that it sold to the public earlier this year and adopt Aquila as its corporate name The move is a strategic reversal apparently prompted by the weakening economy and industry changes Executives dodged questions as to whether the move was spurred by the financial troubles at the energy industrys largest trading house Enron Corp On this busy Wednesday UtiliCorp also released its earnings and reported that it has entered into an acquisition agreement with a FirstEnergy Corp subsidiary UtiliCorp said its board of directors voted to make an exchange offer to acquire all of the outstanding publicly held common shares of its owned Aquila Inc subsidiary due to the recent significant changes in the merchant energy sector the general economy and the impact of these changes on the capital markets The most significant influence however was the realization that greater shareholder value could be obtained by recombining the financial strength of UtiliCorp with the growth opportunities that lie ahead for Aquila said Richard C Green Jr chairman and CEO of UtiliCorp With its larger asset base earnings potential and cash flow the combined company will have more efficient access to capital to execute its ambitious plans Industrywatchers questioned whether some of the spark for the recombining of the trading operation with the hardasset backed parent could have been prompted by Enrons current debacle When asked during the conference call if the Enron situation factored in the decision to combine UtiliCorp and Aquila Robert Green said The decision evolved over the recent few weeks as we evaluated the opportunities in front of Aquila and the current conditions in the capital market We effectively came to the conclusion that if we are going to put Aquila in a position to execute on these opportunities it is essential that we recombine the businesses and the balance sheets to execute on the opportunities that we see in the marketplace that are precipitated by the decline in the capital markets and the fact that the equity markets are shutdown The merchant strategy behind Aquilas rapid growth has been a key driver behind UtiliCorps achievement of aggressive earnings targets Richard Green said We decided that UtiliCorp shareholders would be better served by embracing the Aquila energy merchant strategy as the companys core strategy rather than spinning the business off as a separate entity To symbolize that change in thinking we intend to adopt Aquila as our corporate name after our exchange offer is completed The company said in its conference call that it expects to complete the reacquisition of Aquila by early January Richard Green also said he will take on a new role effective Jan initially as chairman of UtiliCorp and later of the new company that will be formed from UtiliCorp United and Aquila Inc Robert K Green president and COO of UtiliCorp will be elevated to president and CEO of the new Aquila UtiliCorp said all public Aquila shareholders will be offered shares of UtiliCorp common stock in a taxfree exchange for each outstanding share of Aquila Class A common stock Based on yesterdays closing price of per share for Aquila Class A common stock and per share for UtiliCorp common stock the offer represents a value of per Class A share of Aquila and a premium to yesterdays closing price of those shares Aquila shareholders will have the opportunity to continue to participate in Aquilas growth through their ongoing ownership of UtiliCorp shares and to receive cash dividends as UtiliCorp shareholders Richard Green said The offer requires that at least a majority of Aquilas publicly held Class A shares are tendered After successful completion of the exchange offer UtiliCorp has committed to complete a shortform merger of Aquila with a UtiliCorp subsidiary In the merger each remaining Aquila Class A share will be converted subject to the exercise of appraisal rights into the same number of shares of UtiliCorp common stock as are paid in the exchange offer UtiliCorp plans to file its offering materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission and commence the exchange offer as soon as possible Over the past year I have devoted an increasing amount of time and energy to raising other chief executives awareness of Aquilas broad capabilities Richard Green said We have a unique position in the emerging market that is being created by the convergence of the insurance capital and energy businesses combining our expertise in risk management wholesale energy structured financing generation assets and other related activities We can help clients in countless industries in ways theyve never thought of and that opportunity is largely driving this change in executive roles The company also reported Wednesday that it expects to enter into an acquisition agreement with FirstEnergy Corp under which UtiliCorp and a financial partner will purchase FirstEnergys wholly owned Avon Energy Partners Holdings subsidiary the holding company for Midlands Electricity plc Midlands Electricity is the fourthlargest regional electricity company in the United Kingdom and serves million network customers UtiliCorp said the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of after receipt of regulatory approvals In the companys conference call Robert Green said the acquisition would likely be strongly accretive in In releasing its earnings UtiliCorp followed

Westpath Expansion plans filed at NEB TransCanada Plans Export Capacity Additions While it will take another two years for a Mackenzie Valley production and pipeline project to come together there are signs that a safety margin is developing in Canadian natural gas supplies Western Canadas established heavily exploited gas fields can still deliver production growth for years to come the National Energy Board has been told TransCanada PipeLines Ltd delivered the reassuring word in an application for a year expansion program dedicated primarily to increasing exports to California and the northwestern United States TransCanada predicted that production from the western provinces can rise by about to a sustained rate of Bcfd until at least Titled the Westpath Expansion TransCanadas proposal calls for million in new facilities to raise capacity on its British Columbia System by MMcfd or to about Bcfd The route crosses southeastern BC from the Alberta boundary to an export point on the US border where it fills PGE Gas Transmission Along with US traders and power generators customers lined up for the added service include Vancouver distributor BC Gas Utility Ltd and Powerex Corp a subsidiary of BC Hydro that procures fuel for gasfired power stations TransCanada told the NEB that it also expects to file a further expansion proposal in secondquarter for the BC System The agenda matches growth under way on PGE TransCanada acknowledges that its forecast of supplies from the western provinces is more optimistic than the current expectations of the NEB the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board and the Canadian Gas Potential Committee The pipeline company said its information goes beyond official public records to include confidential data from customers its own proprietary studies and updated information on results of last years boom in gas drilling The pipeline has told the NEB that with continued demand growth the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin should be able to support increasing levels of gas deliveries of up to Bcfd at least through this decade Production from Alberta BC and Saskatchewan averaged an estimated Bcfd in TransCanada also predicts that unconventional gas chiefly coalbed methane and possibly reserves in tight or difficult geological formations will enter production by about and eventually reach Bcfd But the pipeline projection acknowledges most tight gas is not currently considered economically available within the forecast horizon to the year and current technological assumptions At the same time TransCanada said there is also great uncertainty in predicting gas production from coal deposits because there is none yet in Canada In the absence of a performance record to guide reserves and production projections the pipeline says only that if research and development and economics lead to successful commercial operations these sources may start contributing supply this decade In a separate toll case before the NEB TransCanada predicts it will be before northern gas from either the Northwest Territories or Alaska begins to flow south An announcement Jan by the Mackenzie Delta Producers Group and the Mackenzie Valley Aboriginal Pipeline Corp suggested that TransCanadas educated guesswork is on the money After nearly two years of preliminary feasibility studies and consultations with northern communities the group Imperial Oil Conoco Canada Shell Canada and ExxonMobil Canada declared intentions to go ahead on a second planning stage Next comes the project definition phase or million in technical environmental commercial and consultation work required to make regulatory applications for field gasgathering and pipeline facilities Conoco predicted the package will be completed and placed before Canadian authorities in The group says it intends to tap Arctic discoveries called Taglu Parsons Lake and Niglintgak to send Bcfd south to northwestern Alberta The plan calls for the gas to finish its trip to markets via spare capacity on TransCanadas system TransCanada is in step with the groups expectations in suggesting it will take five years beyond to collect approvals and build the project The pipeline companys forecast suggests northern production will arrive gradually going from a starting rate at MMcfd in to MMcfd in Bcfd in Bcfd in and Bcfd by The new forecast still does not predict which northern gas will flow however As a partner in the reborn Alaskan Northwest Natural Gas Transportation Co TransCanada is teamed up with eight other companies to revive the Alaska Highway pipeline route worked out in the s for production from Prudhoe Bay In the documents before the NEB TransCanada says it recognizes various uncertainties with respect to northern gas supply regarding economics timing routing and scope Its unclear as to which pipeline will be successful in attracting northern gas

Power by Pan Canadian We will look at the Oklahoma reserves for location and strategy with our pipewith the switch in ownership they may be receptive to strategy changes Lorna PanCanadian Says Montana Power Purchase Beautiful Fit To extend what it sees as dominance in Canadas natural gas market and to boost its production by PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd yesterday agreed to purchase Montana Power Co for million The properties will extend PanCanadians existing shallow gas properties in southern Alberta into northern Montana adding MMcfd and barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids The acquisition will give PanCanadian properties in Alberta Montana Colorado Oklahoma and Wyoming along with three gas pipelines linking Alberta and Saskatchewan to Montana We have a focus on natural gas said CEO David Tuer during a conference call yesterday in Calgary This is clearly our future It is difficult to put any negative on this acquisition and its likely to stay valuable for the foreseeable future Montana Powers production is more than natural gas and associated liquids and the acquisition substantially extends PanCanadians land and infrastructure allowing it to use its technology and operating strategies in a region that extends along the AlbertaMontana border The Montana Power assets clearly fit our strengths and allow us to employ our expertise in developing long life reserves of shallow and medium depth natural gas Tuer said The potential in these assets is significant and over the next few years we will add substantially to PanCanadians daily natural gas production Tuer said that the acquisition extends the companys dominance in shallow gas and called Montana Power a beautiful fit with PanCanadians gas strategy land position and technological capability PanCanadians newest acquisition adds reserves of Bcf and MM barrels of oil and natural gas liquids on a proven and onehalf probable basis said officials Production and reserves account for million of the purchase price while the remainder is made up of million for the midstream and marketing assets million for the undeveloped land about acres and million of working capital Tuer said the company was paying centsMcfe of proven and onhalf probable reserves The price for daily flowing production based on a ration of gas to BOE is Mcfe or BOE Along with the added Alberta and Montana properties PanCanadian also picks up some land in Colorados Denver Basin which now produces about MMcfd Other land that is part of the sale is located in the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma and the Green River Basin of Wyoming Three natural gas pipelines that cross from Montana into Alberta and Saskatchewan also are included The pipelines allow direct access to the US markets for southern Alberta and Saskatchewan gas and serve more than million net acres of developed and undeveloped lands with most of it concentrated in parcels that span the CanadaMontana border Midstream assets that go to PanCanadian include a natural gas marketing company in Butte MT along with a deep cut gas processing and fractionation plant in Colorado The Fort Lupton CO plant processes more than MMcfd and barrels of natural gas liquids and condensate In all the total developed and undeveloped land is roughly million net acres or million gross acres said PanCanadian Montana Power fit us like a glove Tuer said during the conference call He said the acquisition will help PanCanadian to remain best of class for what it does It makes our sandbox that much bigger The acquisition which is expected to close around Oct will increase both PanCanadians net income and cash flow this year and in subsequent years said Tuer The added gas production will immediately increase the companys natural gas as a percentage of total production to based on a ratio of gas to BOE About of the natural gas being acquired from Montana Power now is being sold to Montana Power utilities for to MMcf until July and because its priced below the open market officials think future earnings will be good As that contract expires theres a lot of potential from the price in this transaction Tuer said And whats to become of Montana Power Earlier this year the yearold company headquartered in Butte announced it would divest itself of four of its traditional energy businesses By selling its coal production natural gas transmission and distribution independent power production and oil and gas exploration and production businesses it plans to reinvest the proceeds in Touch America a fiber optics and telecommunications business which is also a subsidiary of Montana Power The process to determine the buyer for our oil and gas business was robust and we are delighted with the result said Montana Power CEO Robert P Gannon We believe there will be a meshing of business strategies and that cultural synergys exist between the purchased companies and Pan Canadian He noted that Montana Power has had a Canadian presence for almost years PanCanadian purchased the entire oil and gas division which now employs about PanCanadian plans to maintain a regional office in Butte invest in the acquired properties and grow daily gas production

Doing the Deal Dynegy CEO Chuck Watson told the investment community Monday that he was sure that the riskreward ratio in the planned merger with Enron Corp made it clearly worth doing the deal because the issues that decimated the former market leader were with its noncore businesses Explaining that his team had adequately bracketed the downside as the deal fell together over the past few weeks Watson said he could not be positive but noted that the upside was substantial and said he had a good deal of confidencethat well be absolutely fine here Dynegy which announced a billion cash stock and debt deal with its downtown Houston rival on Friday night joined with Enron executives including Chairman Kenneth Lay on Monday to answer as many questions as they could in about minutes If all goes to plan the two companies would become Dynegy Inc by the third quarter of the clear leader in natural gas and power marketing In the second quarter Enron and Dynegy combined sold a total of Bcfd of gas which represented of the volumes sold by the top gas marketers in North America Bcfd according to a ranking by NGI Enron was the top gas marketer with Bcfd and Dynegy was No with Bcfd Statistics provided by Marylandbased Energy Performance Review EPR show that Enron and Dynegy combined sold million kWh of power in the second quarter That total represented of the power sold by the top largest power marketers million kWh according to EPR Enron was in fifth place among power marketers with million kWh sold while Dynegy was in sixth place with million kWh The blending of the two will not come without challenges but Watson stressed he expects to see more opportunities than problems The opportunity appears to have come none too soon for Enron Greg Whalley Enrons president and a future member of Dynegys executive team confirmed that without some kind of equity investment in the company the once market leader probably could not have sustained its liquidity through the rest of this year We definitely needed to raise some type of equity capital said Whalley Under normal market conditions we would have had adequate liquidity This was not normal for Enron We would not have had liquidity to the end of the year Asked about asset sales in anticipation of meeting federal requirements to merge executives acknowledged there would be some but did not elaborate Whalley said that from an Enron perspective we have not spent a lot of time with Dynegy people to agree on a plan Chuck Watson has to clear what is core to Dynegy There are several assets for consideration to sell on the list Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay who will not be part of the management team but may hold a place on the Dynegy board of directors added that Enron already has billion in sales under contract all expected to close by the end of We also have three other significant international assets under contract said Lay referring to the among other things the Dabhol power plant in India Once the merger of Dynegy with Enron is successfully completed the new Dynegy will become the primary market player in all markets but there will be a significant difference in how the company moves forward noted Dynegy CFO Rob Doty Enrons financialbacked trading strategy will merge with the strong asset base of Dynegys Dynegy has protected itself on the downside however The deal includes an out for Dynegy if Enrons legal liabilities exceed billion Asked about the possibility that some of Enrons marketing and trading team may desert the company for another company Watson stressing that teamwork will be the guiding force going forward said if I were in this industry this is the combination Id work for This is an exciting day here Its been an exciting couple of weeks creating a platform for something really special in the future Enrons Whalley said that he believes the company will keep most of its team intact Theyre accustomed to being part of a winning deal he said and going forward they will be very pleased with the additional infusion of equity and the stability in the marketplace As of Monday morning Whalley said that activity looks pretty good and said there had been a positive reception to the merger Right now people are pleased with the introduction of new liquidity and really want to go about establishing or reestablishing the energy franchise Dynegy President Steve Bergstrom agreed Most traders want to be part of a winning team This is a combination that will be a winning team We have similar issues there as well The A players will stay around to be part of the winning team Bergstrom explained that when the merger is complete the new Dynegy will become the primary player in all markets He said Dynegy has a more assetbacked strategy adding that he has said before that you can only have one market maker and Enron clearly was it By combining the two companies there will be a blend of Dynegys asset strategy with Enrons financial skill set giving the new entity more liquidity marketmaking than Dynegy itself has historically done Added Watson both companies had a successful ratio and nothing is going to change thereIm a strong believer in teams and the team concept I dont want to see individuals do well if the company doesnt do well It will be imbedded in the whole company Ben Schlesinger whose company Schlesinger Associates analyzes the energy industry said Monday that the big problem in the merger is whether these two companies are able to pull togetherto harness whats there He said the two parties are clearly leaders but theoretically they will have to streamline their operations Both books are fairly strong he said and once their efficiencies are put together the new company will offer stable returns In the very short term however Schlesinger said there will be moves to other traders Other analysts also seemed to be throwing support behind the merger UBS Warburg reiterated its strong buy rating on Dynegy noting that if successfully executed this transaction would yield the most widely recognized respected and downright credible wholesaleretail energy merchant in the world However UBS warned that Dynegy still faces a daunting task in merging the operations and employees We are not naive in underestimating the enormous challenge at hand In the nearterm Enron must remain highly liquid investment grade and its employees must remain focused on keeping its core wholesaleretail franchises up and running Merrill Lynchs Donato Eassey reiterated the buy on Dynegy and moving to no opinion on Enron He said Dynegy has all the necessary skill sets and as importantly the financial stability resources and investor confidence and experience to get the job doneEnrons unparalleled online trading business should translate to significant prospects for the new Dynegy Curt Launer an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston added that despite the size of the new company we do not expect major divestitures or closing issues because of the lack of asset concentration and the inherent competitiveness of the natural gas and power marketing business He noted too that with the combination we have modeled a merchant unit that does less business because of cross trading between them and some expectation of a loss of market share Still Launer said Dynegy would become a formidable competitor benefiting from a market share in excess of of US natural gas and power trading markets As expected with most major merger announcements Moodys Investors Service placed the ratings of Dynegy and its subsidiaries under review for possible downgrade noting that notwithstanding the franchise benefits of the proposed merger the financial and business risks associated with the transaction could negatively impact Dynegys credit fundamentals The review affects about billion of Dynegy securities including its subsidiaries Illinova Corp and Illinois Power Co In its rating review Moodys said it will assess Dynegys plans to meet the liquidity needs of the combined entity and to deal with the uncertainty surrounding Enrons offbalance sheet transactions and contingent risksand examine the ultimate structure of the transaction and its impact on Dynegys financial leverage and on managements targeted debt levels The ratings service also plans to consider the governance framework within which the combined trading activities will operate Ratings under review are Dynegys Prime rating for commercial paper Dynegy Holdings Baa senior unsecured debt rating and its Prime rating for commercial paper Illinova Corps Baa senior unsecured debt rating and Illinois Power Cos Baa senior secured and Baa senior unsecured debt ratings and its Prime rating for commercial paper Fitch revised its rating watch on Enrons outstanding securities to evolving from negative where they were placed in late October The rating watch evolving means the ratings may be raised lowered or maintained Fitch also placed a rating watch negative on Dynegy and Dynegy Holdings longterm credit ratings which also means they could be lowered or affirmed The outstanding F rated commercial paper programs for Dynegy and Dynegy Holdings were not affected

selling test gas in ramp up period Right now these first deliveries are going into the ANR system because it is the only interconnect that is ready Alliance Delayed But Deliveries Begin Ramping Up After months of speculation in the industry Alliance Pipeline confirmed yesterday full commercial service will be delayed nearly a month until Oct When construction of the system was scheduled nearly three years ago Oct was the target date for commercial service However the delay doesnt mean the market wont be getting any Canadian gas out of Alliance until the end of October The pipeline opened one of its Chicago delivery valves last Thursday and started selling MMcfd of gas into the market It intends to increase its sales each week eventually reaching its full Bcfd load prior to switching to commercial service on Oct said spokesman Jack Crawford We got Commission approval to actually sell our test gas Right now I think we are dealing with three or four different marketers Our initial deliveries right now are into the ANR system Thats because its basically the only connection that is ready but over the next few weeks we expect they will all be ready to go and we will test them all Id be surprised if it ends up being regular volume increases of MMcfd each week but thats kind of the game plan said Crawford On Oct it will be Alliance selling Bcfd of test gas and on Oct it will be shippers nominating at one end and delivering at the other The market may not see much of a difference We obviously dont want to start charging our shippers until we have the confidence that all the systems have been checked out The pipeline system is designed to deliver gas from producing regions of northeastern British Columbia and northwestern Alberta to the Chicago area where the line interconnects with the North American pipeline grid Currently more than of the total pipeline system has been installed including mainline compressor stations receipt points in British Columbia and Alberta and delivery points in Illinois Commissioning activities commenced in March including the flowing of gas into the completed sections of line to purge air from the pipe At present approximately of Alliance has been purged of air This includes all the mainline portion of the system miles from near Gordondale Alberta to the delivery section near Joliet Illinois and of mile laterals receipt portion of the system Additionally receipt point meter stations have been commissioned Final commissioning activities are also being completed at mainline compressor stations To date Bcf of gas is in the commissioned mainline and lateral portions of the system with the ultimate line pack targeted at Bcf Crawford said there were a variety of factors that contributed to the delayed startup The rain in Saskatchewan delayed us a bit back in July but we managed to catch up on the construction there in August But it then meant that some of our commissioning didnt get going until a little bit later Farther west in Alberta and BC in fact weve had a couple of rain problems In particular we have one relatively small but fairly long lateral that we havent even been able to get on the right of way yet and thats because of rain Up in BC weve been having trouble with a directional drill of a creek on one of our laterals up there he said Were likely to get approval to opencut that creek but that will take us probably the better part of a month On the downstream end we had hoped to get more of our downstream connections right now We are testing one but some of the others arent quite ready yet Were ready but they are not Then of course there is a fairly complex interaction between the pipeline and the Aux Sable liquids plant We havent had a chance to work on that yet So when you look at all of those things the question was when could we establish a date when all this stuff would be done and we would be operational We spent a fair amount of time with our shippers and they mentioned one other pipeline that was being delayed one day at a time drove them to distraction We agreed we would pick one of three dates all Mondays Oct Oct or Oct and we just had to pick one that we felt confident in Besides the timing of service there has been another important question on the minds of many market observers Will the gas Alliance ships come Oct be incremental gas or gas that would have been flowing through TransCanada I dont think its going to be purely either way said Crawford Lots of guys are targeting for Nov to bring their new gas on to start the gas year so it all depends on how much shows up Its not a big secret that weve had some wet weather and some of the drilling and completion work hasnt gotten done Thats likely to have some affect on it as well Thats a delay though How long are people going to pay for gas Boy people are going to have a lot of money for drilling and projects

Supply Anxiety Author N American Natural Gas Team EMail Category Alert Product Line North American Gas URL cfmtrackeprofilecfmuDmD Alternative URL clientnagaltnagaltabhtml As the heating season approaches a highbut justifiedlevel of anxie ty regarding winter supplies is driving the gas market As things stand the market is headed into the winter exposed to a supply shortfall late in the winter even under normal weather conditions This prospect has placed a floor on the ga s price at the price of residual fuel oil itself priced in the mid to upper s range Gas prices moving into this range would begin to attract demand back into the market diverting supplies from storage and increasing supply concerns again To the upside there is little demand response to price until industrial demand lessens or the price of distillate oil as of this writing near per million British thermal units MMBtu is breached However distillate markets themselves are extremely tight and prices for that fuel would likely follo w gas prices up Within this range prices are defined mainly by supply anxiety the markets judgment of the likelihood of a supply shortfall which would b e characterized by extreme pricing and volatility and a difficult process of supply allocation by price By now exposure to extreme price volatility this winter is certain Althou gh CERA expects storage injections to increase by approximately billion cu bic feet Bcf per day from August to September this increase would still leav e inventories at record lows for this month and next Even this increase in injections will not occur if a tropical storm forces evacuation of offshore platforms or if hot weather returns For October heating load enters the picture With US supplies running clos e to yearearlier levels and imports slightly higher demand priced out of the market will remain the key reason that storage injections increase at all from las t years low level As a result although prices may close the month of September in the upper s per MMBtu at the high end of the competitive range with resid any threat of interruption in supplies will quickly bounce prices upward during the remainder of September or in October As the heating season begins therefore CERA expects the reality of supply vulnerability for the winter to result in the first ever monthly average price of at the Henry Hub s ee Table and the first of potentially many months at or above that price Gas StorageNew Record Lows CERA estimates that storage inventories in the United States crossed into record low territory as of the end of August when inventories of Bcf fell below the previous record low of Bcf see Table More records will likely be broken in the coming months and by widening margins Injections for September are expected to average Bcf per day an increase of Bcf p er day from the August level but below last years pace of Bcf per day CERAs September estimate could be exceeded under mild weather condition s with no tropical activity hitting the Gulf of Mexico but injections would likely fall below the Bcf per day rate should storm activity force evacuation of platforms This rate would leave US inventories at Bcf at months end a record low by Bcf For October CERA expects a slight increase in the injection rate from last year Injections of Bcf per day on average this year would be enabled by dema nd priced out of the market and by a lack of unusually cool weather or tropica l storm activity October injections have varied historically from Bcf pe r day to Bcf per day Even if injections reached toward the upp er end of this range the market would remain exposed to shortfalls during the winter At the expected injection rate US inventories of Bcf at the end of October would result in an end of March inventory level of Bcf und er normal winter weather Bcf below the previous record low of Bcf Regional MarketsWaiting for Winter The pipeline explosion on El Paso during late August intensified the subregional pressures already at play in western gas markets Cuts in pipeline flows limited access into California on the only pipeline route into the state with any excess capacity The lack of supply pressured prices within the supply basins and forced strong storage withdrawals in the California market Although summer power loads in California will ease and much of the El Paso capacity has be en restored the race to improve storage positions before the onset of winter heating load will keep intense pressure on Topock prices Differentials in the rest of the West will strengthen as local heating loads begin to absorb enough supply t o ease pipeline bottlenecks see Table Differentials in the East which have traded in a narrow range this summer will likely reach slightly higher levels with the start of the heating season in October However exposure to pricing disconnects will remain low until later this year CERAs outlook by region follows Rockies Pipeline bottlenecks out of the Rocky Mountains this summer should begin to ease as heating loads climb during October CERA expects that as local demand limits pressure on pipeline capacity differentials will narrow October differentials should average per MMBtu San Juan The resumption of flows on El Pasos southern system combined with production outages has relieved some of the access constraints on San Juan supply Seasonal declines in Rockies to Southwest flows and the beginning of the heating season should narrow October differentials to per MMBtu Permian and MidContinent The continuing pull on supplies from the West will support Permian prices and the Midwestern pull on supplies will support MidContinent prices CERA expects a differential to the Henry Hub of per MMBtu for MidContinent supplies and per MMBtu for Permian supplies Chicago The delay in the inservice date for Alliance from October to October will take some gas out of the Chicago market next month This delay combined with the need to build Midwest storage inventories should sustain the recent increase in differentials from the range to above per MMBtu CERA expects October differentials at the Chicago citygate to average Northeast markets Gas prices near have increased the fuel cost of delivery from the Gulf Coast into the Northeast raising the floor level for differentials to near per MMBtu The beginning of the heating season and the lack of new capacity into the New York citygate should support differentials above the floor during October at near per MMBtu Canadian MarketsOutages Affect Supply Outages have affected supply thus far in September Both British Columbia a nd Alberta have been affected resulting in a further yearoveryear decline i n Western Canadian supply The various problems appear to be rectified but t he average supply for the month is likely to be down to million cubic feet MMcf per day from September Drilling has been adversely affected over the past several weeks by wet weather but rig utilization is beginning to climb again to previous levels More th an gas wells are expected for this year Slight Drop in Export Demand Eastern Canadian demand is still down approximately MMcf per day with coolerthannormal weather reducing the need for air conditioning In the W est however coolerthannormal weather has accounted for an increase in demand for heating

youll know The natural gas market is a real success story FERC has gotten an enormous amount of things right The market may not be unblemished but there are lots who consider the natural gas market the best market in the world offering genuine price discovery on a daily basis across dozens of products Its something everyone should be proud of Robert Levin of the New York Mercantile Exchange told a FERC conference yesterday The natural gas market has performed remarkably admirably through a range of market conditions with hundreds if not thousands of market participants using an extraordinary selection of market instruments Levin continued adding that the Commission should be supporting the growth and increased sophistication of commerce Youre at that point now Warning against socalled solutions offered by some at the daylong conference to increase liquidity or tie the natural gas market to the electric market Levin cautioned liquidity cannot be legislated Dont overreact The electric market is poorly regulated Remedies from the natural gas market should be transferred to the electric market rather than allow the gas market to be corrupted by the regulatory mistakes of the electric market Rather than worry over regulating an hourly market for natural gas change the electric market which Levin believes has developed its overemphasis on the hourly market because of the artificial tilt toward the spot market But while Levin warned against too much market meddling others among the more than representatives of the industry and its customers testifying at FERCs conference on competitive natural gas markets argued for a variety of initiatives to increase market liquidity by changing the rules for pipeline transportation Eliminating the shippermusthavetitle rule promoting expansion of the existing pipeline infrastructure especially in the Northeast doing away with straightfixvariable SFV rate design review of firmtowellhead rates in the production region and the allocation of transportation costs between the upstream and downstream were among the chief proposals proffered by mostly pipeline customers However greater gas market liquidity shouldnt be confused with increased competition in pipeline transportation municipals and producers told FERC staff during a postOrder technical conference Wednesday Were concerned the Commission may be equating market liquidity with competition in pipeline transportation The two are not the same said Arthur Corbin on behalf of the American Public Gas Association APGA which represents municipal gas distributors Even with greater and greater market liquidity monopoly power exists in the pipeline transportation segment Captive shippers will always require a regulated transportation service from any hub to their citygate he said Much the same holds true for LDCs noted Bruce Henning director of energy practices for Energy and Environmental Analysis Inc EEA who represented the American Gas Association AGA at the Commission staff conference He agreed market liquidity has improved immeasurably but he added theres not a liquid market center at every pipeline receipt or delivery point location Nor is there likely to be market centers in all of these locations in the near future Consequently Henning said FERC will need to continue to protect producers from market power that accompanies limited access to pipelines The daylong conference held yesterday in Washington DC was the first of several that FERC staff plans to hold to explore the impact of the Commissions transportation policies on the development of gas markets Christopher A Helms president and COO of Panhandle Pipeline Companies urged FERC not to enact policy changes that would place commodity market liquidity as the ultimate goal at the expense of the transportation market Helms said he advocated policies encouraging pipeline expansions and construction of optimal amounts of additional capacity to meet the needs of the market The single most important characteristic for liquidity in the natural gas commodity markets is the availability of adequate transportation capacity Charles Daverio vice president of KeySpan Corp echoed that sentiment saying FERC could increase liquidity in the New York City market and elsewhere in the Northeast by promoting construction of new pipeline capacity to ensure adequate supplies for the region yearround This would reduce energy costs and enhance reliability he noted Panhandles Helms also cautioned against policy changes that would force the development of new market centers and hubs Market centers should be allowed to develop at their own pace and at locations where the market sees fit he said EEAs Henning estimated more than liquid and transparent market centers exist today which permit industry participants to buy and sell gas daily under extremely competitive conditions He said hes confident more will be added because of the options that they provide to gas customers As another way to enhance liquidity KeySpans Daverio as well as others supported eliminating the shippermusthavetitle rule which requires the customer to retain title to the gas while its being shipped Doing away with the rule would pave the way for the development of new pipeline products and services such as operational balancing and virtual storage he told the FERC staff But Dena Wiggins an attorney with the DC law firm of Sutherland Asbill Brennan LLP which represents the Process Gas Consumers Group industrial gas customers said her group was very concerned about efforts to repeal the rule I havent heard anything yet today that satisfies the concerns that we might have She noted the Commission already has granted exceptions to the shippermusthavetitle rule in certain cases and should continue with this policy where necessary Moreover Wiggins said industrial customers were increasingly worried about the mounting market power of unregulated companies especially gas marketers At the conference she also expressed her groups dismay with the pipeline compliance filings with Order particularly on the penalty issue Rather than an improved penalty structure pipelines are proposing higher penalties Wiggins said We continue to be shocked at the absolute wholesale departures from BPs Jeff Holligan also waded into the fight against all the new services outlined by pipelines in their Order filings which he said were nothing more than penalties disguised as balancing services that customers cant refuse He urged the Commission to check with a pipelines customers noting one proposed new service is opposed by of the pipelines nonaffiliated customers Some of the proposed services Holligan said add up to nothing more than degradation of existing longterm firm service Holligan representing the largest producer in the US and Canada joined other market participants in urging adoption of standardized allocation sales standardized penalty levels and the requirement that all pipelines implement a uniform title transfer tracking process In short standardizing pipeline services certainly on an individual pipeline and also to a large extent between and across pipelines is imperative if markets are to be highly liquidIndividually negotiated services where every service is a different service or the adoption of a socalled dual track market are the antithesis of a highly liquid efficient and competitive gas market Standardization of operational terms of pipeline service is necessary to facilitate trading through ecommerce The Commission should be striving to commoditize pipeline capacity so it can be traded along with gas electronically Holligan said

would like to listen in at the Houston location Lorna Dear CERA Members and Friends Are oil companies leaving money on the table in their use of benchmark crude prices What can be done to lower the risk in these potentially harmful calculations One of Cambridge Energy Research Associates CERA core businesses has been benchmark crude oil price analysis In our new multiclient study The Hole in the Barrel CERA goes beyond our benchmark price analyses to analyze the structure of the market itself We argue the limits and real economic losses that can result from misunderstanding these prices specifically the Brent benchmark in oil company financial calculations and strategic planning the magnitude of which can be significant often amounting to dollars not cents per barrel As an introduction to this new study we would like to invite you to participate in this complementary multimedia conference call and web presentation on October With the current volatility and high levels of energy prices this conference call will bring clarity to these important and relevant issues To enroll for the call please RSVP to or and reference the Confirmation Code in order to participate in the call In this detailed study CERA looks at what people really mean when they talk about the oil price As part of the study we Analyze each of the five contracts that make up the Brent market and consider their longterm future given the steady decline of wet barrels including how other price markers might evolve Outline how oil companies have more discretion to raise revenues for a given volume of production than is generally appreciated Examine each of the three components that make up oil prices absolute price level time and grade differentials to show where revenue is being lost and what can be done to add it back again Assess the management control issues associated with any market activity and conclude that the risks of dealing are significant but not overwhelming especially in comparison to the underlying and increasing price risk that they help to manage In this evolving New World while trading may or may not be good for you not understanding the market can be fatal CONFERENCE CALL TOPICS Brent Blend as a price benchmark for a significant proportion of internationally traded crude oils The fitness for purpose of each of the five interwoven but separate contracts in the Brent market to different sectors of the oil industry The risks and rewards of dealing in the Brent market Our speakers will address this topic for minutes with accompanying graphics

early October it appeared that a lucky combinati on of mild weather storage injections above billion cubic feet Bcf per day and a lack of storms in producing areas of the Gulf of Mexico had calmed the market somewhat Henry Hub prices settled near in the cash market less than above residual fuel oil Last week however tragedy in the Middle East and a slightly lowerthanexpected storage injection report were sufficient to drive Novem ber Henry Hub prices up by more than in two days to above Mild weather may still soften prices from current levels but CERA does not expect the relative calm of late September and early October to return to the gas market Turmoil in the oil market has raised the floor for gas prices as nearly Bcf per day of potential gas demand now burning residual fuel oil would quickly return to the gas market should prices decline relative to oil Also weather must remain mil d through October or else US working storage inventories may not reach even trillion cubic feet Tcf by the end of the month The headroom for price is much greater as distillate oil the next substitute for gas should gas prices rise is itse lf in short supply Shutdowns of industrial facilities represent an important increment of demand resistance as gas prices rise and neither switching to distillate n or shutting down production comes easily or cheaply Time is running out before the heating season begins and the market remain s justifiably on edge upward volatility remains much more likely than any significant settling in price As a result CERA expects natural gas prices to be sustained in the mids averaging at the Henry Hub during November see Table More lucka great deal morewould be required to restore a measure of calm to the gas market Gas StorageThe Final Push October storage injections have varied historically from Bcf to approximately Bcf per day in the United States and this year CERA expects them to averag e Bcf per day a moderate level for the month see Table The reporting of injections of Bcf during the week ending October precipitated a increase in futures prices but this rate is actually above average for the first full week of October With the beginning of consistent heating load late this month CERA expects a slowing of injections resulting in an endofOctober inventory of Bcfmore tha n Bcf below the previous record low for the end of October CERA expects that many storage holdershaving begun the winter with record low inventorieswill preserve inventories to the extent possible during Novemb er However normal weather this year would drive a substantial rebound in heating load from last years level and would require added storage withdrawals whic h CERA estimates will average Bcf per day this year Withdrawals at that pace or even substantially slower as occurred during and will keep inventories on a trajectory to hit record lows by the end of March Low storage inventories will remain a major source of price support requiring that demand continue to b e priced out of the gas market and keeping gas prices above those of residual fuel oil Regional MarketsWinter Rules The transition to winter pricing relationships is under way and the start of winter heating demand in the West has narrowed differentials between the supplyri ch Rocky Mountains and the Henry Hub Local demand for Rockies supply has also eased pressure on San Juan Basin prices and CERA expects differentials between both regions and the Henry Hub to continue to narrow through November In t he Northeast differentials will begin to widen with the onset of winter with the magnitude of the differentials depending on early winter weather The onset of flows on Alliance will limit increases in the Chicago differential during Novembe r see Table CERAs outlook by region follows Rockies Earlyseason cold has narrowed Rockies to Henry Hub differentials so far this month Ample supplies within the Rockies will mean volatile pricing relationships through the end of October and early November depending on heating load but in general strong regional demand will keep differentials well below the per MMBtu summer level CERA expects a per MMBtu differential to the Henry Hub during November San Juan The increase in local heating demand in the Rockies will continue to ease pressure on San Juan prices by limiting flows south out of the Rockies San Juan differentials should follow the same relationships as Rockies prices with general narrowing but continued volatility through November CERA expects an average San Juan differential of per MMBtu for November Permian and MidContinent Tight relationships between the Permian Basin and MidContinent and the Henry Hub should continue through November with some slight widening in the MidContinent basis differential expected when Alliance flows commence CERA expects differentials of per MMBtu and per MMBtu respectively Chicago The beginning of service via the Alliance Pipeline during November is the focus of most attention in the Chicago citygate market However the demand rebound that would result from normal November weather this year would offset most of the added supplies As a result Chicago differentials will average in the per MMBtu range even when Alliance flows commence although delay of the Vector Pipeline will keep much of the new gas in the Midwest CERA expects average November Chicago differentials of per MMBtu Northeast markets Normal weather would drive a substantial rebound in New York citygate prices from yearearlier levels but there is little added delivery capacity into that market CERA expects New York to price above the Henry Hub during November well above the current low o mids Canadian MarketsSupply Growth Still Uncertain The supply build is uncertain at this time because flows on Alliance are uncertain A line pack of between and Bcf has been established and modest flows of million cubic feet MMcf per day have been initiated to test and commissio n the pipeline The startup is still slated for November but the unknown quantities of gas that are flowing on a daytoday basis are making it difficult to asses s precisely the volume of supply being produced At this time it appears that October is on par with The current expectation is for over well completions in approximately of which are expected to be gas wells Even if the shallow trend does not change substantially the sheer number of wells is still expected to produce a supply build by yearend and into For the total western suppl y build is expected to be flat with to slightly negative increasing to positive growth of MMcf per day in Demand Slow but Exports Up TransCanada flows are still down averaging about MMcf per day less in October than the yearearlier levels Storage injections in the East have accelerated eastern inventories are expected to be above last years levels at the e nd of October Storage injections in the West however have dwindled revising the expect ed storage inventories to be even with the fiveyear average but below levels PGE GTNW volumes have declined in October and are expected to be slightly below levels by MMcf per day in November as well Northern Bord er Pipeline is running about MMcf per day above October but is expecte d to be slightly below levels in November Coolerthannormal weather has push ed western Canadian demand up slightly but does not offset the lower eastern Canadian demand High Prices Wide Differentials The AECOHenry differential has leveled off in the upper USs to low USs and is expected to remain in that range through the balance of October For November the differential is expected to average US for a resulti ng AECO average of C per gigajoule US per MMBtu end Follow URL for PDF version of

updates Enrons Lay Urges Bold Solutions to Power Market Woes As the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission prepared to weigh in this morning with the federal governments answer to Californias bedeviled power market free market advocates issued last minute warnings against taking the price cap route espoused by the CalISO FERCs meeting is scheduled to start at AM EST Check this morning for updates In a letter fired off to FERC Chairman James J Hoecker yesterday Enron CEO Kenneth Lay urged the Commission to find a fix for the underlying structural problems in the power market rather than follow the steps of policy makers who have placed price cap band aids over hemorrhaging wounds Lay told Hoecker the power market is halfway across a busy street in its transition from monopoly to competition It cant stand where it is He said FERC has to make a choice between falling into the same trap of political expediency as Californias ISO leaving the nations electric system in the lurch from one crisis to the next or it can take a big step toward fundamental structural reform At the same time the Electric Power Supply Association EPSA called on FERC to issue an emergency cease and desist order prohibiting the CalISO from unilaterally implementing any changes to its current MWh price cap for wholesale electricity purchases In a motion filed Monday the marketer group specifically asked the Commission to bar the CalISO board of directors from putting into effect its decision to impose a fiendishly complex loaddifferentiated price cap of or less during the offpeak season effective Nov The plan was designed by the states main utility consumer group see Daily GPI Oct In addition the EPSA urged FERC to state explicitly that the CalISO does not have the authority to impose or extend price or bid caps unless expressly authorized to do so by the Commission The CalISOs current authority to set price caps expires on Nov Lay said the CalISOs complicated new formula caps prices below the cost of gasfired generation making obvious errors such as failing to take into account gas transportation costs between the Henry Hub and power plants in California in doing so the bid cap makes it more economic for generators to sell their gas supply rather than use it to make electricity in California The new formula also forces the ISO into the market to buy power on an ad hoc basis to keep the lights on when the capped market fails to attract sufficient supplies which it inevitably will do Lay said In addition the capped formula invites generators to shut in production export power out of state and deploy their turbines in other states or countries He noted that the ISOs Chairman voted against the measure while all of the states utilities voted for it presumably knowing full well that it simply will not work California is just the latest failure of partial or compromised open access said Lay Its time for the Commission to reject this approach The power industry the nations most essential industry is mired in the transition from regulated monopoly to open access and customer choice Every step forward has been compromised out of concern for alienating one vested interest or another As a result utilities are free to slow the interconnection of new generation withhold equal access to the transmission system favor their own sales over those of competitors miscalculated available transmission capacity and exercise control over supposedly independent system operators and reliability organizations Lay predicted that installing price caps for political expediency would plunge markets into greater uncertainty and discourage new supplies and conservation methods FERC has to complete the work that it started said Lay It has to ensure that all parties have equal and fair access to transmission by ending the special priority for utility uses of the system Second FERC must require transmission owners to separate operation of the monopoly transmission assets from their other businesses Third FERC must take politics out of transmission system operations by revising governance structures to ensure independence Finally FERC must end its reliance on shortsighted price caps by putting in place the necessary reforms to allow these markets to operate efficiently to encourage conservation and attract new supplies EPSA said the CalISO board acted in obvious disregard for the Commissions orderly processes It cannot be permitted to make the Commissions decisions for it or to alter so radically market rules thereby injecting more uncertainty and confusion in the market and subverting the process for fashioning fair effective and comprehensive remedies for Californias flawed electric markets the group noted The EPSA believes that any remedial actions taken by FERC with respect to the California markets will be severely compromised if the CalISO boards imposition of new prices caps is allowed to take effect

PM on PM To cc Subject Power Market Caps Lower Prices at Higher Risk CERA Alert CERA Alert Sent Fri July Title Power Market Caps Lower Prices at Higher Risk Author Zenker Mortizburke EMail Category Alert Product Line Western Energy URL cfmtrackeprofilecfmum Recent events in California culminating in new market rules established for the energy and ancillary services markets indicate that legislators and regulators are dissatisfied with the performance of the markets they established The hot weather in California during June triggered high electricity demand corresponding recordbreaking power prices and rolling blackouts in the San Francisco area Although the economic impact of both the outages and the concurrent price spikes is significant a recent decision by Californias Independent System Operator ISO to intervene in the markets by lowering price caps through the summer of from to per megawatthour MWh may prove to be the most important product of the market events Ironically the proclivity to continue to change the market rules whatever the intention could create market distortions that delay the addition of new generating capacity by discouraging plant developers and driving away needed capit al This would only prolong the states supply shortage and resultant high prices Although the recordsetting weather that prompted the rolling blackouts in the San Francisco area is not likely to be repeated the West as a whole will experience higher coincident peak demand under normal weather conditions this summer CERA expects that supplies will be sufficient to meet peak demand this year but the high price levels of June will be repeated during peak demand conditions not only this summer but during the summers of and possibly The Pressure Builds The blackouts were not spawned by a statewide supply shortfall but instead by a transmission constraint that limits the ability to import sufficient quantities of power to the San Francisco area The quantity of generating capacity out of service in the West was near average levels despite a nuclear unit outage in Washington Although the blackouts were brief and wholesale power prices decreased with the temperatures the intense scrutiny over the events and resultant changes to the market rules indicate that legislators and regulators are dissatisfied with the performance of the markets they designed The markets architects assumed that competition would lower wholesale prices in the state However prices in June have been roughly eight times higher than in s prerestructured California market leading many regulators and legislators to conclude that the markets are flawed requiring additional caps and market rules Although some state officials strongly favored lo wering the price caps many within the ISOs Board of Governors strongly opposed intervening in what they consider to be normal market reactions to tight supply and demand fundamentals The current tight supply situation in California and the West as a whole is a product of recent strong economic growth throughout the region coupled with the slow process of permitting new power plants Owing to strong economic growth in California in and and percent respectively capacity margins have shrunk from percent in to percent in Demand growth throughout the West has reduced the amount of energy available for export from the Pacific Northwest and Southwest to California As a result even with optimistic levels of energy imports and the curtailment of approximately megawatts MW of interruptible load within the state California capacity margins will fall well below North American Electric Reliability Council NERC reliability criteria roughly percent this summer The West is the only region in North America that will experience a tightening of capacity margins relative to levels in under normal weather conditions CERA anticipates peak demand growth to continue to outpace new capacity additions through with slightly growing capacity margins in At these levels an unusual amount of either plant capacity or transmission line capacity out of service during peak demand conditions would require the ISO to mandate blackouts of a portion of the states load to maintain the overall stability of the grid Thus the tight capacity situation in the state will continue to pressure prices to high levels which may provoke legislators and regulators to attempt to extend the price caps or implement additional market rules Market Distorting Effects Under tremendous pressure from some legislators regulators and market participants the California ISO Board of Governors lowered the current price caps on energy from to per MWh in a special meeting conducted June Owing to the interconnectedness of western markets the decision to lower the caps and the apparent willingness of regulators to continue to change the rules governing Californias electricity markets will affect power market participants throughout the West Profitability of existing and future generators degraded High power prices and volatility levels in June although detrimental to most buyers provide strong encouragement to plant developers Limiting the level of price flyups degrades the ability of plant owners to recover capital costs plus earn a return on that capital In most periods of the year competition drives prices to levels that provide little opportunity for a return on capital Generators therefore seek to recover their investments with higher bids in Californias energy and ancillary services markets during periods of supply scarcity Existing merchant generators are at increased risk to recover the investments they made based on cash flow outlooks developed prior to the imposition of caps Supply shortfall prolonged The process of siting and permitting power plants in California is cumbersome requiring as long as five years from plant proposal to synchronization with the grid The California Energy Commission CEC the state agency charged with approving new plants has repeatedly expressed concerns about the chronic tight supply situation in the state Pricedampening market intervention indicates to plant developers that California officials may continue to reengineer the states power markets to the detriment of generator profitability and when added to the difficult permitting process potentially delaying the introduction of new capacity to meet rapidly growing state demand Prominent plant developers have recently indicated that markets outside of California may provide a more stable market and a better environment for deploying scarce resources and generating equipment such as turbines Trading positions affected Lowering price caps reduces the degree of price volatility and the level of overall average prices Market participants have executed market positions based on the outlook for prices under the previous higher price cap By lowering the price cap not only are the value of existing physical eg power plant and financial eg forward contracts positions significantly affected but market participants must also incorporate the uncertainty of possible future adjustments to the cap into their trading Circumventing market rules The variety of energy and capacity markets in California as well as the bilateral markets outside of the state provides opportunities to circumvent the intent of the new market rules further distorting the markets in the West Although lowering price caps in California will likely temporarily reduce price levels the new power plant capacity ultimately needed in the state to reduce price levels and improve reliability on a sustainable basis could be discouraged by prolonged and repeated intervention in

Alert Title Argentine Power Markets Winter Constraints Push Prices Higher in May Author Bailey EMail Category Alert Product Line Latin American Energy URL clientlaaltlaaltabhtml Summary Prices in the Argentine power market were significantly higher in May owing to the combination of continued low hydro output strong demand growth and periodic constraints on natural gas deliveries to power plants in the Buenos Aires region Spot power prices energy component only averaged per megawatthour MWh in May Although average power prices declined from last year price volatility increased with several shortduration episodes of prices over per MWh as gas unavailability in the Buenos Aires region forced several midcost units offline during peak hours In June prices are expected to continue strengthening to the per MWh range on average Beyond June price pressures are expected to remain negative as increasing hydro output new and returning lowcost thermal capacity and the end of gas constraints push average prices back toward per MWh or below by August or September CERA Alert Title US Gas Markets Reach New Heights Where Will It Stop Author N American Gas Team EMail Category Alert Product Line North American Gas URL clientnagaltnagaltabhtml Summary The US gas market enters the month of June with prices at the highest level since deregulation At the Henry Hub prices have surged to as high as per MMBtuup from less than per MMBtu during April Behind this has been a building and serious shortfall of supply the result of disappointing gas production levels and surging gas demand for power generation The gap between these two forces has been met through storage inventories with injections so far this spring running between and Bcf per day below last years rate The continued tension between these two forces will keep the pressure on prices this summer and the need to inject gas into storage will price out increments of demand CERA Alert Title Monthly BriefingThe Pressure Cooker Author N American Natural Gas Team EMail Category Alert Product Line North American Gas URL clientnagaltnagaltabhtml Summary Pressure remains extremely strong in the United States gas market as three factorsthe increasing power generation demand lower storage inventories and US wellhead supply still struggling to reboundcall into question the ability to build storage to a level adequate for next winter Prices are being supported also by concurrent strength in oil and liquids markets making traditional alternatives to gas much more expensive than in recent years In this environment intense competition between power generation demand and storage injections will continue throughout the summerwith pressure increasing into July as temperatures risewith the result that gas will continue to price at the high levels necessary to discourage enduse demand CERA expects a July average price of per MMBtu CERA Decision Brief Title Western Canada Supply Growth Getting Nowhere Faster Author Eynon Small EMail Category Decision Brief Product Line North American Gas URL clientnagdbnagdbabhtml Summary As US supply declines and demand grows current high gas prices are reinforced but western Canadian gas supply growth appears to be faltering when it is needed most Both transitory factors and enduring trends underlie the disappointing production growth results The largely weatherrelated transitory factors have had a nearterm impact on drilling and connection activity The underlying trends have been developing slowly over time More shallow gas wells have been drilled in the past three to four years and created a shift to higher average basin declines and lower average per well production rates Thus more shallow wells are needed just to replace production With a shift to more exploration and deeper drilling higher supply growth rates are possible but if that does not occur other potential supply sources may step in Significant Arctic reserves in the McKenzie Delta and the Alaskan North Slope are once again entering the spotlight Coal bed methane has become a str ong source of US supply Although now ignored in Canada it may become a future source of Canadian gas CERA Watch Title Reaching New Heights Author N American Natural Gas Team EMail Category Watch Product Line North American Gas URL clientnagwchnagwchabhtml Summary Fundamentals have taken center stage as building demand pressure accompanies US supply declines Storage inventories have been significantly reduced and the pressure for storage injections is likely to intensify as we head into the summer months Demanddriven growth continues as completions of gasfired power generation plants accelerate to a pace above megawatts per year and economic growth stimulates electricity demand The result is a

Utility Stock Valuation Gap Does Strategy Matter Author Parshley EMail Category Private Report Product Line North American Power URL clientnapprnapprabhtml Summary The stock market has been delivering an unsettling message to the utility industry Traditionally undervalued in the market the sector is trading at a historically wide percent discount to Standard and Poors SP The SP Utility Index over the past months gained only percent with huge gains by some energy companies offset by a percent drop in stock price for electric utilities Yet early this year the SPU outpaced all other industry groups How should constantly evolving utilities in this wideopen sector form a strategic plan to maximize shareholder value while achieving success The value of electric utility merger and acquisition deals for a record billionwas double the value But are these choices ahead of the curve And when will the market catch up Three groups of new companies with distinctive strategies may provide clues to the new strategic landscape multiservice and technology providers superregionals and global power and energy companies Three other strategic choices are considered in evaluating responses to these challenges CERA Decision Brief Title The Summer Spot Electricity Markets Outlook Divergent Trends in Price Volatility Author Makovich Sannicandro EMail Category Decision Brief Product Line North American Power URL clientnapdbnapdbabhtml Summary While several regional power markets are likely to see a repeat of price spikes this summer other markets are likely to see a reversal in price volatility as supplydemand balances improve dramatically One way to interpret forward markets is as a consensus of market expectations Therefore forward prices for onpeak wholesale power reflect the common expectation that prices will spike as high asor even higher thanin A significant disconnect exists between the forward market prices and market fundamentals for the upcoming summer in some regional markets CERA Alert Title Atlantic Basin Gasoline Markets Soar Author Meyers EMail Category Alert Product Line Refined Products URL clientrpaltrpaltabhtml Summary Spurred by supply concerns at the start of the summer driving season spot gasolinetocrude oil price differentials on both sides of the north Atlantic have soared to the highest levels seen since the Gulf War In CERAs view this strength in margins is attributable to the convergence of three factors very low inventories tightening gasoline specifications and legal uncertainty CERA Alert Title Refined Products LineUS Markets Author Refined Products Team EMail Category Alert Product Line Refined Products URL clientrpaltrpaltabhtml Summary The US gasoline market exhibited exceptional strength during May US Gulf Coast unleaded gasoline surged to per barrel measured against WTI up per barrel over the strong April value of Apparent demand for gasoline skyrocketed to million barrels per day mbd in response to the start of the summer driving season Despite increases in the reported demand for distillate and jetkerosene these markets did not experience the same monthovermonth strength in differentials dropping to and per barrel versus WTI respectively CERA Alert Title Refined Products LineEuropean Markets Author Refined Products Team EMail Category Alert Product Line Refined Products URL clientrpaltrpaltabhtml Summary As higher crude oil prices started to reduce the high product differentials to Brent and thus lower refinery margins refiners attempted to prevent this situation from worsening by reducing throughputs However very tight markets for gasoline and to a lesser extent for automotive diesel helped to limit the fall in those products values Meanwhile fuel oil discounts to crude oil widened in May driving down simplehydroskimming margins In recent weeks the combination of lower primary products inventories and reductions in operations at some refineries has helped differentials to recover This has pushed margins to above Mays averages although still below Aprils peaks CERA Alert Title Recent Actions Signal Progress Toward MTBE Elimination Author Stackpole EMail Category Alert Product Line Refined Products URL clientrpaltrpaltabhtml Summary The close scrutiny that federal reformulated gasoline RFG now faces from the media and public officials owing to Midwestern market price spikes has not stopped the inexorable political progress toward eliminating methyl tertiary butyl ether MTBE use in the US gasoline pool Additional signposts including heightened congressional debate over legislation eliminating MTBE use and state actions to ban MTBE continue to emerge that point the way toward MTBEfree gasoline in the United States CERA Alert Title Refined Products Market Update Author Refined Products Team EMail Category Alert Product Line Refined Products URL clientrpaltrpaltabhtml Summary Refined products markets continue to display marked regional differences In the Atlantic Basin low gasoline inventories in both the United States and Europe which resulted from many months of OPEC production restraint continue to dominate the market and gasoline differentials above crude are at their highest level in over ten years Although signs are emerging of a possible correction in the North American market in the coming month the gasoline season will almost certainly be the strongest experienced by Atlantic Basin refiners in many years In contrast Asia Pacific spot refining margins were weak through most of June until the recent accident at KPCs Mina alAhmadhi refinery prompted a quick strengthening in prompt Singapore margins However with ample unused refining capacity available east of Suez and the likelihood of a partial restart of the KPC refinery in July CERAs outlook is for that strength to be of short duration CERA Alert Title New Peaks New Prices Author Zenker Moritzburke Snyder EMail Category Alert Product Line Western Energy URL clientcealtcealtabhtml Summary In the West July typically marks the start of the summer cooling season and steadily rising power prices CERA expect the West to be the only region in North America with a yearoveryear increase in peak electricity demand Power prices already established new record highs in June suggesting that as demand reaches its peak in the coming months western power markets will continue to experience increased volatility compared with last years levels The convergence of higher gas prices growing power demand and reduced hydroelectric energy production compared with levels is pushing up western power prices Greater utilization of gasfired generators within the West has supported western differentials and contributed to high gas prices throughout North America Western gas prices should continue to be strong boosted by continuing increases in regional gas demand for power generation and pressure across North America to inject gas into storage in anticipation of summer power loads CERA Alert Title Oil Market Turmoil OPEC Seeks a Shortterm Fix Author World Oil Team EMail Category Alert Product Line World Oil URL clientwoaltwoaltabhtml Summary Driven by strong demandespecially in the recovering Asian economies and the United Statesoil prices both WTI and Brent have again broken the levela mark that is of particular significance in

OPECs Cautious New Agreement Author World Oil Team EMail Category Alert Product Line World Oil URL clientwoaltwoaltabhtml Summary OPECs agreement to raise its production quota beginning July by barrels per day to million barrels per day is consistent with its strategy of restraining supply to maintain oil inventories at relatively low levels The gain in supply is a shortterm fix meant to alleviate political pressure for increased production and to push prices below but keep them in a mid to upper s range end Follow URL for HTML Version of this message only Note Should the above URL

The West Keeping Its Fingers Crossed CERA Alert CERA Alert Sent Wed July Title The West Keeping Its Fingers Crossed Author Zenker Moritzburke Snyder EMail Category Alert Product Line Western Energy URL cfmtrackeprofilecfmum A strong dose of summer weather in June propelled Westwide demand levels up by nearly percent over the same period in These higher demand levels provided the years first example of the power price spikes that can be produced when the Wests tight capacity intersects with normal summer load levels lowerthannormal hydroelectric levels strong gas prices and Californias immature wholesale power market structure As power markets reacted in June with unprecedented price strength throughout the region regulators and the California Independent System Operator ISO intervened to dampen markets from a maximum of per megawatthour MWh to per MWh Although some market participants have filed protests at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to raise or eliminate the caps utilities legislators and consumer advocates are moving to protect consumers or completely redesign what they perceive as a flawed market As western markets move through the critical JulyAugust peak electricity demand period market participants and regulators alike are wondering if power supplies will be sufficient and if price levels will rival those in June CERA expects that western supplies will be adequate under normal summer weather conditions barring abnormal unit and transmission line outages However normal August weather conditions will push demand levels significantly higher than in June creating an even tighter supplydemand balance straining the ability of the transmission system to supply key demand regions adequately A hot weather event could exhaust both instate and imported supplies for California The tight supply and demand situation will almost certainly prompt a strong price response similar to that in June This will fuel the unease of regulators in states that have restructured their markets and in those that are considering restructuring Even as regulators continued support of restructured power markets begins to waver a weather event that forces regional blackouts would force regulators to intervene CERAs outlook for August power markets is driven by High peak loads Under normal weather conditions Westwide August loads will be on average megawatts MW higher than last August The peak load in California is expected to push capacity margins to percent even after curtailing interruptible load Lower hydroelectric output As the West enters its peak load period hydroelectric production is expected to decline systemwide by roughly average megawatts aMW from July to August Compared with the high sustained output of last August hydroelectric output this August although roughly average on a historical basis will be roughly aMW percent lower High levels of gasfired generation Compared with August higher utilization rates along with gas prices that have climbed per million British thermal units MMBtu will increase the incremental cost of energy production by over per MWh Although CERA expects power prices in August to diverge from production costs owing to the expected supply tightness higher production costs will create a higher floor for energy prices in all periods of the day The extremely tight power supplydemand balance within the West and within California specifically has resulted in unprecedented high summer gas demand for power generation This high demand levelcombined with seasonal storage injection needs in Californiahas pushed up utilization rates on pipelines into California and pushed Topock differentials over per MMBtu to the Henry Hub Strong demand should continue through August in the West and support premium pricing at Topock The Rocky Mountains represent the opposite extreme to the high premium placed on Topock deliveries In the Rockies supply is building relative to export pipeline capacity and market access is becoming a challenge Weak seasonal demand compounds the problem the strong western demand for gas for power generation does not extend to the Rockies Generation within the region remains nearly all coalfired These regional pressures should remain a feature of western gas markets through September Moderate summer weather and reassuring injection rates nationwide during recent weeks have allowed some easing in prices at the Henry Hub However summer is not yet over and absolute storage inventories are still at critical levels Higher gas prices are likely to resurface Regional Power Market Drivers August demand under normal weather is expected to rise by an additional percent or nearly aMW over average June levels see Table Peak demand levels should exceed those in June as well with a coincident peak over the whole Western Systems Coordinating Council WSCC of MW expected under normal weather conditions in a percent increase over the weathermuted peak California alone should experience peak loads that are approximately MW higher than peak levels in June Available generation capacity in the West has been at normal levels for this time of year although coalfired plants are responding to a record production year with repeated but shortlived outages The steady decline in hydroelectric generation will remove aMW from the West resource base when compared with July levels and about aMW since June although reservoir refilling operations temporarily removed significant quantities of hydroelectric generation during portions of June Given hydro operators economic interest in maximizing onpeak production at the expense of offpeak production the loss of capacity during the onpeak period will be lower than these levels August will be a critical month for the heavily importdependent state of California While the state will be drawing approximately aMW of imports during August to meet demands during peak periods CERA expects the level of imports to exceed MW during peak demand conditions The Southwests need to supply native demand first will limit its ability to export to California and lower yearoveryear hydroelectric production in the Pacific Northwest will limit exports from that region Pacific Northwest CERA expects Pacific Northwest demand in August to climb by nearly aMW when compared with June levels The water supply for the Pacific Northwest has declined to percent of normal levels for the Lower Columbia owing to warmerthannormal weather in June In addition normal seasonal decline in runoff levels will drop about aMW from the resource base when compared with levels in June see Table Generation plant operators have responded to both growing native demand and a robust export market by running coal and gasfired generation at high levels Although less than MW of gasfired generation is currently available in the region it has been running at high utilization rates High energy demand in California for Pacific Northwest energy will keep differentials low between the regions As in June Pacific Northwest prices will respond in kind to the volatility CERA expects to occur in California in August In addition if hot weather in the Pacific Northwest pressures regional energy reserves local prices will rise to keep energy in the region potentially causing prices in the Pacific Northwest to move higher than those to the south California California is entering the peak load season with relatively little generating capacity down for maintenance Although hydroelectric output continues to decline statewide reservoir storage levels remain high at roughly percent of normal Nevertheless declining hydroelectric production is expected to remove about aMW when compared with hydroelectric production levels in June Normal summer weather will push demand in the state up by about aMW over June levels which were high see Table Californias peak load is expected to exceed MW compared with a peak load in June of approximately MW MW on the states ISO system alone according to its own estimate Assuming normal plant outage rates this demand level will necessitate the import of about MW of energy to meet the statewide peak Even after curtailing the approximately MW of interruptible load available for tight supply situations the state has a precarious percent capacity margin during the system peak An extreme hot weather event could push state loads up by an additional MW Outages are likely if additional imports are not available A capacity limit of MW will be in place during the summer for energy exports from the Pacific Northwest to Northern California The import limit from the Pacific Northwest to southern California will be MW Rockies and Southwest August demand levels in the combined RockiesSouthwest region will increase only slightly above levels in August climbing approximately aMW as loads in the regionunlike the rest of the belowaverage WSCCwere near normal last August Even so August loads will increase demand by over aMW when compared with levels in June of this year As with last year and this June supplies in the region should be sufficient to meet peak demand conditions under normal weather although growing loads in the RockiesSouthwest region have reduced its ability to supply neighboring regions with energy during peak demand conditions High loads driven by hot weather will keep the regions prices high Differentials between the region and California will be tight but California having tighter supplydemand balances will need to price at a premium to attract energy The highcapacity transmission ties between the RockiesSouthwest and the California market which is about percent the size of the RockiesSouthwest market will ensure that prices in the RockiesSouthwest stay close behind California prices whenever loads are high in California Regional Gas Market Drivers Evidence of pipeline bottlenecks has emerged across the West and supply and demand forces over the next year look likely to intensify these pressures Since the Northern Border expansion in late narrow northsouth and eastwest differentials across pricing points defined the market This summer the continuing supply growth in the Rocky Mountains has widened differentials between the Rockies and the rest of the West At Topock increasing gas demand in California and high utilization rates have resulted in high premiums Overall in North American gas markets strong storage injection rates in recent weeks have allowed some easing in pricesfrom an early July Henry Hub price of per MMBtu to under per MMBtu However despite these high injection rates the supplydemand balance and absolute level of storage inventories remain precarious Summer is not over and higher nationwide power loads in weeks to come will likely cut into storage injections and boost prices The ongoing competition between power and storage for supply should support an average Henry Hub price of per MMBtu in August Through the end of the summer differentials in the West should hold near current levels The pressure of growing Rocky Mountain supply will continue until heating loads start climbing in the fall In California high seasonal power loads should continue through August with hot weather and continued declines in hydroelectric generation Demand strength is expected to continue Across the West August demand for gas should climb from billion cubic feet Bcf per day in June to Bcf per day buoyed by an increase in gas demand for power generation see Table California High gas demand for power generation within California will continue through August CERA expects an increase from the states June demand levels of Bcf per day to Bcf per day during August The increase stems from declines in hydroelectric generation and increases in overall power loads Total demand is expected to exceed last years demand level by Bcf per day This will increase flows on pipelines into California reduce the states storage surplus and sustain high prices CERA expects pipeline utilization rates during August to average percent see Table CERA expects an August TopockHenry Hub differential of per MMBtu see Table Pacific Northwest Despite the extremely high prices at Topock and high demand in California until recently gas at Malin priced at a slight discount to Henry Hub prices After averaging per MMBtu below the Henry Hub during the third quarter last year the differential so far during the third quarter this year is per MMBtu below the Hub This week Malin is pricing at a per MMBtu premium relative to the Henry Hub The TopockMalin differential has swelled to over per MMBtu signaling intraCalifornia pipeline capacity constraints Two factors pressured Malin differentials during the early summer Pressure on Rocky Mountain and AECO differentials Prices in the two areas supplying the Pacific Northwest are under some pressure Increasing supplies in the Rockies are beginning to reach the limits of export capacity and put downward pressure on Rockies prices by limiting external market access At AECO although export capacity out of the province is available almost all of that excess capacity accesses eastern Canada on TransCanada Pipeline Pipelines into the United States are running near capacity Because of TransCanadas limited ability to discount interruptible transport the available space is more expensive and therefore the last to be filled Low early summer regional demand Gas demand in the Pacific Northwest is limited during late spring and early summer by declines in heating loads and very strong hydroelectric output Even in a normal or dry hydroelectric year seasonal runoff holds down gas demand for power generation in May and June even as gas demand for power generation begins climbing in California Increasing power loads are already evident The first factor will likely endure until heating season begins in late fall and regional demand in the Rockies and western Canada begins climbing However gas demand for power generation in the Pacific Northwest has increased already this summer and will continue to climb through the end of July and into August as hydroelectric generation wanes This added demand million cubic feet MMcf per day above June demand levelswill provide some support for Malin prices and limited support for Rockies and AECO prices MalinHenry Hub differentials are expected to average per MMBtu above the Henry Hub price during August Rocky Mountains Pressure on regional supplies within the Rockies continues as exports out of the region reach new highs Differentials to the Henry Hub have widened to over per MMBtu and although prices in the rest of the West will gain some support from high power loads regional demand in the Rockies is expected to remain near low seasonal levels through August August demand is expected to average Bcf per day in the region approximately equal to Junes Bcf per day total demand Demand begins to build during September but until the heating season begins in October Rocky Mountain prices will lag well below prices in the rest of the West CERA expects a Rocky MountainHenry Hub differential of per MMBtu during August Although some narrowing in Rocky Mountain differentials looks likely as seasonal demand increases through the fall the rapid build in supply in the region will likely keep differentials wide during CERA expects a supply build this year of nearly MMcf per day followed by a build of over MMcf per day during Currently approximately MMcf per day of excess pipeline export exists out of the region with the largest increment on Transcolorado into the San Juan Basin Next summer all capacity will likely run close to full Until export pipelines expandthe first likely expansion is Trailblazerdifferentials will remain wide For CERA expects an average annual differential below the Henry Hub of per MMBtu Southwest Differentials in the San Juan and Permian Basins have gained considerable strength relative to Henry Hub prices amid the recent hot weather in Texas Permian supplies are pricing at a slight premium to the Henry Hub price and in the San Juan Basin prices have narrowed from an early July differential of per MMBtu to a differential of less than per MMBtu CERA expects demand in the Southwest during August of Bcf per day an increase from Junes level of Bcf per day but the larger Texas market will determine the relative strength of differentials in those two basins CERA expects a San Juan differential of per MMBtu during August with a Permian Basin differential of per MMBtu Differentials between the Rocky Mountains and the San Juan Basin have widened substantially over the past two months with supply increases in the Rocky Mountains Flows on Transcolorado increased from a monthly average of under MMcf per day to over MMcf per day during June Supply in the two regions is following opposite paths Rockies supply is climbing rapidly and San Juan supply has likely peaked and should decline slowly beginning this year CERA expects a decline in supply of MMcf per day during relative to and an additional decline of MMcf per day during Because of these different outlooks wider RockiesSan Juan differentials will persist end Follow URL for PDF version of this Monthly

portfolio in the United States InterGen the power generation joint venture of Royal DutchShell Group and Bechtel Enterprise Holdings Inc closed a deal yesterday giving the international developer a equity interest in Houstonbased Coral Energy one of the largest natural gas and power marketers in the country Coral Energy officials had predicted in July that Shell and construction giant Bechtel would fold InterGen InterGen North America and certain assets of Coral Energy into one business see Daily GPI July Under the agreement announced yesterday InterGen will receive the majority of the natural gas pipeline storage and power generation assets of Shells Coral Energy affiliate in the United States It remains a joint venture of Shell and Bechtel The move gives Shell a ownership in InterGen with Bechtel owning the remaining InterGen had been formed as a joint venture and Bechtel made an undisclosed payment to Shell in the deal About Coral employees mostly related to the Texasbased assets in Houston will become InterGen employees under the agreement InterGen is considered a world leader in power generation development with projects around the world Carlos Riva InterGens CEO said that the transaction represents a significant boost to our plans in the United States These assets and strengthened alignment with a premier US gas and electricity trading enterprise will provide InterGen a strong platform for growth in the US market Globally the alignment is expected to help leverage Shells strengths in both fuel supply and power marketing and trading Bechtel will continue to be InterGens preferred provider for worldwide power generation engineering procurement and construction services Coral is the regions third largest natural gas marketer and the twentieth largest power marketer in the country Linda Cook Shell Gas and Powers CEO said the whole idea was to help InterGen grow in the United States and that the best way was to add Shell assets to it Success in tomorrows energy markets will be earned through globally aligned marketing trading and asset companies said Cook Thats critically true in the US and will be the case as competitive energy markets open worldwide InterGen plans to build a sizable power generation portfolio in the US working closely with Coral to pursue investment decisions that make the most commercial sense We expect this relationship to make a significant contribution to both InterGens and Corals longterm success Shell and Bechtel formed InterGen in March see Daily GPI March specifically to pursue power generation opportunities in North America The Bostonbased company was set up to develop Shell Bechtel and InterGen have among them the complete skill set for success in the new global energy market said Paul Unruh COO of Bechtel InterGen is a worldclass developer with a proven track record of successfully developing financing and operating projects around the world Shell is one of the most successful marketers and traders of energy in the US and is expanding into deregulating natural gas and power markets globally Bechtel is a global leader in the development engineering and construction of power facilities These strengths together create a large power generation platform now directly linked with global energy marketing and trading InterGens portfolio will give Coral Energy access for its trading business and Coral will participate as part of Shells global trading network with InterGen a business partner in its expanding North American asset platform As the exclusive marketer of Shells gas production Coral has a gas supply of Bcfd and a trading platform dealing in extensive volumes of energy in all key supply basins For Bechtel the agreement will help it lock in construction contracts for its combined cycle gas turbine power stations Specifically the assets to be transferred to InterGen from Coral include the following miles of major intrastate gas pipelines in Texas The pipeline facilities extend from South Texas near the Mexican border along the Texas Gulf Coast to the Louisiana boarder and north from near Houston to the East Texas producing areas The West Clear Lake Storage facility one of the largest natural gas storage reservoirs in Texas Located near the Houston Ship Channel it has a leasehold interest in the Stratton Ridge storage facility Corals interest of more than MW in four power plants one in operation and three under construction The transfer would follow equity and regulatory approvals In total Coral had miles of gas pipeline that ran along the Gulf Coast in Texas and Louisiana It also is building a mile long pipeline in northern Mexico with that countrys national oil company PEMEX Currently InterGen is either operating or building power stations with a total of MW It also has MW in advanced development Projects are being operated under construction or are in advanced development in the United Kingdom the Philippines Colombia Mexico China Egypt Brazil Australia Turkey and the United States

Category Alert Product Line North American Gas URL cfmtrackeprofilecfmum Alternative URL clientnagaltnagaltabhtml Gas prices remain within a high range with prices volatile between approximately and per million British thermal units MMBtu Prices are likely to remain within this high band through the fall until the uncertainty of early winter weather resolves itself At the lower end of this rangeand with oil prices in the upper s per barrel or higherprice support kicks in as end users begin to switch back toward gas or to reactivate industrial demand Gas prices may flirt with the lower boundary so long as the weather is not too hot across too many regions allowing storage injections to increase and providing hopes for an adequately supplied winter Abovenormal heat in only one or two regions however or even the threat of storms in the Gulf of Mexico will pull prices quickly upward As for the upper boundary although prices in specific regions such as California and the Northeast may reach above an actual storm in the Gulf or more widespread heat than has yet occurred this summer appears required to pull the Henry Hub much above Absent tropical storm activity in the Gulf of Mexico CERA expects prices to settle into the lower portion of this band during September see Table Although strong power loads and the resulting weak injection rates are likely to sustain prices through much of August the seasonal decline in generation demand into September should allow storage injections to increase by billion cubic feet Bcf per day As a result CERA expects prices to settle somewhat averaging per MMBtu at the Henry Hub during September However the larger fundamental force in the market remains unchanged supplies are adequate with any certainty only for another warm winter Any interruption in supply or abnormal demand will quickly drive prices upward next month may represent the low for the remainder of the year Gas StorageNot Yet Enough Mild weather over much of the United States during July allowed a muchneeded recovery in storage injections with the estimated injection rate increasing by nearly Bcf per day from yearearlier levels see Table This rate was enabled entirely by lower demand however and not added supply The result is that under more normal summer weather conditions during August the US storage inventory deficit is likely to remain stubbornly near Bcf Although the deficit is likely to decline on average during August it is even more likely to expand again during September especially should any storm necessitate evacuation of offshore platforms Absolute inventories and supply adequacy for this winter therefore remain a concern in the market Inventories are unlikely to reach levels adequate to prevent record lows from occurring next spring Should injections continue as expected inventories would reach approximately Bcf by October but reaching even this level still an alltime low annual maximum inventory requires some help from a lack of storm activity and a lack of heating load in October Storage inventories are not yet sufficient to relieve market pressure and are unlikely to become so by the beginning of the heating season Regional MarketsWestern Disconnects Continue Wide differentials emerged this summer in the West and look likely to persist through September In Southern California record summer demand levels have pushed pipeline flows to new highs Topock continues to be the premium pricing point in North America In the Rockies supply growth has pushed up pipeline flows out of the region Power loads should ease somewhat in Southern California and that easing will bring some decline in the Topock premium Pressure on Rocky Mountains and San Juan prices should persist until the start of the heating season in late October see Table CERAs outlook by region follows Rockies Pipeline capacity out of the Rockies is running nearly full to every export market except the San Juan Basin Emerging pipeline bottlenecks should keep differentials wide during September with an average differential of per MMBtu San Juan In the San Juan increased imports from the Rocky Mountains and high utilization rates on capacity into California are pressuring prices CERA expects differentials to average per MMBtu for the month of September San Juan differentials will narrow more substantially when Rocky Mountain pipeline bottlenecks are relieved by increases in heating demand during the fourth quarter Permian and MidContinent Strong power loads in Texas have supported Permian Basin prices during July and August Persistent power demand is expected to keep differentials around per MMBtu for September MidContinent prices should average just under Permian prices Chicago Steady storage injection loads are unlikely to support prices at Chicago in the face of declining power generation into September July premiums of to have already come down in early August and are likely to remain low at approximately for September Northeast markets Northeast price premiums have averaged from the mids to the mids depending on generation load and proximity to the New York Facilities Group major meters CERA expects little to change this relationship but as generation loads decline into September premiums could move closer to the fuel cost floor the mid to high s Canadian MarketsSupply Growth Still Disappointing Although June displayed yearoveryear growth in production in western Canada July reverted to a decline and August is running close to last years level The current expectation is for over well completions in approximately of which are expected to be gas wells Even if the trend toward shallow drilling does not change substantially the sheer number of wells is expected to produce a supply build by yearend and into For the total western Canadian supply build is expected to be flat with increasing to a positive growth of MMcf per day in Demand Slow but Exports Up TransCanada flows are down MMcf per day on average for but have been down by over MMcf per day so far in the third quarter PGE GTNW volumes were up by over MMcf per day in June and July but have dropped to yearearlier levels in August and are expected to remain close to last years levels for September Northern Border Pipeline is operating at rates similar to last years on average in but is expected to decrease about MMcf per day for the third quarter Western Canadian demand is currently up slightly driven by the warmerthannormal weather in late July and early August but should be closer to levels in September High Prices Wide Differentials The AECOHenry differential has widened quite dramatically over the past few months from the low USs of the first quarter to US in July The differential increased to well over a dollar in the second week of August but the driver for that increase was maintenance that reduced the export capacity at Empress August and September are expected

Operationsmarketing related rd Legislativeregulatory related El Paso Explosion Takes MMcfd Off Market About Bcfd of flow on El Pasos South Mainline downstream of Pecos River NM Station ceased after the pipeline exploded early Saturday killing people and seriously injuring two others at a nearby campsite El Paso said Monday it was able to compensate for about half that volume through a combination of fuel switching by downstream customers maximum storage withdrawals an OFO and other customer cooperation The market reaction was rather predictable as all three California points rose by about cents to lead an overall price surge However utilities in the state did not appear to be experiencing any supply problems SoCal Gas said storage and supplies from other Southwest receipt points were adequate to avoid any problems A gas operations official for Los Angeles Dept of Water and Power also saw no reason for panic From past similar incidents on Southwest pipelines he expected that the approximately feetlong section missing from El Pasos line could be slapped back into place rather quickly El Paso itself had no estimate for when it can restore service in the impacted segment it must get approval rom the federal investigators before beginning repairs or evaluating a restart of the adjacent lines But a large aggregator and a marketer agreed with the LADWP official that it should be a quick mechanical fix once repairs begin The aggregator believed downtime could be as short as a week No customers were cut off as a result of the rupture but some were getting reduced volumes an El Paso spokeswoman said Northern Natural Gas was seeing a throughput increase of MMcfd Monday while Transwestern volumes were up MMcfd as a result of shippers diverting gas away from El Pasos South Mainline an Enron spokeswoman said A producer said she diverted as much of her companys gas as possible from El Paso to Transwestern People were reluctant to trade Permian Basin gas Monday especially at fixed prices because of doubts about how much would be able to flow several sources said Permian numbers rose a little less than cents as part of the general upturn However it was Waha prices that saw a bigger increase of nearly cents as a result Everything in El PasoPermians Keystone pool was going back into Waha said a marketer putting Waha in the mid s at a premium of more than a nickel above Henry Hub The Southern California border at an average of nearly led the rest of Mondays market by a large margin Before trading began EnronOnline was offering border swing swaps for the rest of the month at a marketer said With swing swaps priced so high it gave sellers more confidence in what prices they could command in the day market he said Either way I wouldnt want to be short right now at the border There were lots of rumors but no facts available on what caused the El Paso rupture noted one aggregator But its a good thing it didnt happen until after California had cooled off Otherwise I could easily have seen the border basis spread from San Juan Basin go as high as instead of the approximate gap of egistered Monday by Daily GPI A knowledgeable source provided his analyis of the blast The structure of the crater made the rupture look like a line integrity problem from the way it blew out The earth can harbor leaking gas for a while until eventually everything all goes up at once People nearby would not have detected anything because gas is odorless in longhaul lines the mercaptan odorant is not added until it gets to the local distribution stage Pipeline safety surveyors usually will look for dead vegetation in the vicinity to detect a leak but this was a desert area with very little vegetation It is easily possible for escaping gas to hug the ground for the approximate foot distance to the victims campsite and seek an ignition source there It is a normal tendency for gas leaking into the atmosphere to stay close to the ground and that tendency would have been amplied by the chilliness of the predawn desert The source went on to say I think there will be lot more of this ruptures in the future with many pipes becoming at least years old El Paso was unlucky in experiencing one of the early incidents he said because the situation applies to the other lines with old pipe Pipelines used to spend a lot more money on maintenance when regulation was tighter and they were still paying for depreciation he said Now theyre more purely forprofit companies after having written off their depreciation costs many times over El Paso Blast Kills Shuts Down South Mainline Federal and company investigators Monday swarmed over the scene of the devastating El Paso Natural Gas mainline explosion that erupted near daybreak Saturday engulfing a party of weekend campers along the Pecos River near Carlsbad NM and killing people Two other persons were hospitalized in critical condition Three officials from the federal Office of Pipeline Safety OPS and with the National Transportation Safety Board NTSB have been at the site of the blast since late Saturday and two more OPS officials were en route Monday New Mexico Gov Gary Johnson who flew to the area on Sunday said he wanted to know how many other potential pipeline dangers there are in the state He called for a thorough investigation About Bcfd of capacity on El Pasos southern leg initially was lost from the ruptured inch line and two looped lines nearby that were shut in after the accident El Paso was making up some of the shortfall by drawing the maximum MMcfd from its Washington Ranch Storage Field downstream of the accident Increased use of other pipelines allocations and cutbacks by customers and the fact that weather had moderated in California helped ease the supply situation Nevertheless spot prices increased by about cents for points in California while the rest of the market spurred by Hurricane Debby went up about cents There was no estimate as to when the looped lines would be back in service according to El Paso spokesperson Kim Wallace We dont intend to put anything back into service until we know for certain that the remaining pipelines are safe Wallace said She did not expect them to be back in service today and could give no time frame on when they would be returned to service It is much too premature at this point to predict when the three disabled El Paso westbound lines will return to service said Patricia Klinger a spokeswoman with the Department of Transportations Research and Special Programs Administration RSPA which oversees the OPS The one that ruptured is definitely going to be out of service for awhile and another line is badly damaged from the fire As for a third adjacent line that could potentially be reopened but we have to test the integrity of that line and have it examined by metallurgists she told Daily GPI Everyone will be working of course to try to get this line back in service But the safe operation of the pipeline is of premiere importance The three lines shared the same rightofway Were just now able to start looking at exactly what happened and how to get that one line back in service Klinger said Our metallurgist is on his way right now I know hes going to meet with the NTSB when theyre examining the foot section of pipe thats out of the ground as a result of the explosion I think the company also wants to decide what types of tests can be done on this line Its not piggable The NTSB which has set up a command center in Carlsbad NM declined to make any preliminary speculation about the cause of the explosion Its much too early for us to even think about the cause of this accident Were only dealing with the factsRight now were documenting the pipe itself and surveying the land Were going to look at the chronology of when the emergency calls came in document damage to vehicles and injuries said NTSB spokesman Keith Holloway Probably at this point were looking at nine months to a year maybe more before the results of the investigation are publicly disclosed Holloway noted The rupture occurred at am MDT in the underground line near the Pecos River crossing which is about miles south of the Carlsbad Caverns National Park in a spot popular with local campers and fishermen The blast tore a crater in the earth about feet long feet wide and feet deep According to preliminary reports the pipeline was underground at the point of rupture sending two sections of pipe each about feet long flying hundreds of feet The gas then ignited and shot flames from the broken pipe toward sleeping campers The NTSB estimated there was a gap of to feet between broken ends of the pipeline at the site The fire burned for about minutes before El Paso workers manually shut off pipeline valves Ten members of two families were burned to death in the blast The families who were related by marriage were camping on public land along the river near where the pipeline emerged from the ground to cross the Pecos in an aerial crossing alongside a bridge Six were pronounced dead at the scene and four others died at Texas hospitals Saturday night The dead included five children under the age of six including sixmonthold twins Two adults were listed in critical condition Monday at a hospital in Lubbock TX The ruptured pipeline which El Paso said was constructed in is one of four that runs along the southern branch of El Pasos pipeline system There is an adjacent inch pipeline and another inch pipeline The fourth a inch pipeline was abandoned and is not available for service Wallace said El Paso and federal officials are particularly interested in the integrity of the second inch pipeline that ran close to the broken line Wallace said that none of the companys customers had been cut off of service but they were receiving gas as reduced levels She also said that on Aug a patrol inspection either done by air or vehicle was conducted on the pipelines located near the Pecos River by El Paso officials and no problems were found El Paso conducted the last corrosion test in February and no problems were found then either Visual inspections are conducted on all of the systems pipelines once a month she said and the company follows all federal pipeline requirements for inspections Asked whether El Paso planned to change its inspection system immediately Wallace said that she did not think so but said that if the NTSB review finds something that needs to be changed the company will do whatever needs to be done immediately These situations are so rare she said We dont feel that we need to change what were doing now But if the situation warrants we certainly will make any changes necessary El Paso is working with family members to take care of their immediate needs including hotel accommodations food travel arrangements and medical treatment The company also is providing additional services as needed This is a tragic accident and our heartfelt condolences go out to the families involved said El Paso Energy President William Wise He said the company was working with the NTSB to investigate diligently all matters surrounding this accident and to establish its cause as quickly as possible The fallout of the explosion is expected to extend all across the country as federal legislators consider more stringent pipeline rules following an explosion in Bellingham WA that killed three in June Locally Carlsbad Mayor Gary Perkowski said that he wanted to find out what happened and keep it from ever happening again That reaction was echoed by the New Mexico governor I have a lot of questions said Johnson What is the reliability of these pipelines What went wrong Was it preventable Meanwhile RSPA was sifting through its history to determine whether the El Paso blast was the biggest pipeline disaster on record in terms of fatalities Timeline am Aug El Paso Natural Gas automated computer reading of the pressure in the pipeline indicates pounds per square inch Around am An El Paso Natural Gas employee bowhunting in the area sees a large fireball at the scene am El Paso Natural Gas automated computer reading of the pressure in the pipeline drops to pounds per square inch am Carlsbad Fire Department responds to the emergency am Carlsbad Fire Department arrives at the scene am El Paso Natural Gas workers shut off the gas line using manual valves Between Jan and June of this year there have been transmission pipeline incidents according to the OPS Fourteen were caused by either external or internal corrosion were damaged by outside forces three were due to construction or material defects and were unknown There was only one fatality until June of this year on transmission pipeline incidents which was caused by an outside force Eleven people had been injured through June In August OPS sent a warning letter to El Paso citing it for a number of pipeline safety violations in Arizona The OPS did not impose a civil fine on El Paso but it advised the pipeline that should you not correct the circumstances leading to the violation we will take enforcement actions when and if the continued violation comes to our attention El Paso Blast May Cinch Tough Pipe Safety Bill The explosion on El Paso Natural Gas system which killed people over the weekend may give Congress the added boost to pass a tough pipeline safety reauthorization bill when it returns from recess in September Capitol Hill insiders said Monday This just sadly proves why Congress needs to act as soon as it returns on Sept to pass the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act before any more innocent lives are taken said a spokeswoman for Sen John McCain RAZ In June Chairman McCains Senate Commerce Committee voted out the Pipeline Safety Improvement bill that would among other things give states inspection and oversight authority over interstate pipelines require interstate pipelines to consult with states about their integrity plans create stiffer penalties for pipeline safety transgressors and offer protection to whistleblowers who report pipeline violations McCain proposed the agressive safety bill following the product pipeline explosion in Bellingham WA that killed three in June McCain has always been determined to pass this bill this year but this obviously sadly strengthens that resolve she said He will make a determined effort for this to happen but whether its brought up for a vote on the Senate floor will be up to Senate Leader Trent Lott RMS the McCain spokeswoman said I have no doubts that the Senate will push for pipeline safety when it returns said Terry Boss vice president of environment safety and operations for the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America INGAA On the House side a companion to McCains bill has been introduced as well as a number of other pipeline safety measures but most are at the subcommittee level But the issue could pick up steam in the wake of the El Paso blast We must examine why this accident occurred and ensure that it must never happen again said Rep Joe Skeen RNM Definitely its a tragic situation Boss said referring to the explosion near Carlsbad NM which reportedly left a crater about feet deep feet wide and feet long Five of the fatalities were children who were spending a weekend camping and fishing with their family along the Pecos River The political fallout from the disaster was being assessed in Washington DC yesterday Any kind of incident has political ramificationsWere just not sure how this is going to directly impact pending legislation and regulations Boss noted

on AM on PM To cc Subject Monthly Briefing A Shoulder Month Without Shoulder Prices CERA Alert CERA Alert Sent Tue August Title Monthly Briefing A Shoulder Month Without Shoulder Prices Author Zenker Snyder Moritzburke EMail Category Alert Product Line Western Energy URL cfmtrackeprofilecfmum Alternate URL clientcealtcealtabhtml As western markets continue to struggle through high August demand and prices for both power and natural gas September looms as the start of the fall shoulder season The shoulder season historically has brought the possibility of a break in weather and a demand drop in both power and gas prices from summer levels CERA expects this shoulder season to differ from years past however with power and gas markets producing strong yearoveryear prices and little relief from summer levels even with normal September weather Westwide power loads will decline but will remain similar to those in June a month with high power prices In addition compared with June levels hydroelectric capacity has dropped owing to reduced stream flows leaving more expensive gasfired generation to replace declining hydroelectric output CERA expects occasional hot weather and higher gas prices to push onpeak prices in the West to percent over September levels Continued strong use of gasfired generation in the West as well as low US storage inventories and tight supply demand balances will keep the pressure on gas prices Topock prices are expected to average per million British thermal units MMBtu in September These high September gas and power prices are driven by Declining hydroelectric output The months of September through November represent the low point for hydroelectric output in the West with rainfall historically boosting output in December Approximately average megawatts aMW will be available from hydroelectric facilities during the threemonth period This represents a net reduction in capacity of aMW when compared with the recent JuneAugust summer months and a reduction of aMW when compared with September levels Higher more variable power demand The Southwest and Southern California still experience hot weather in September and regional utilities typically consider it possible that a years peak load event will occur in September Spiking loads however can quickly retreat with a return to cooler weather Thus power loads and power prices are expected to experience a high degree of variability during September High levels of gasfired generation Load growth and a declining hydroelectric resource base will require gasfired resources to serve approximately the same level of demand as in June a month with similar average demand and monthly average onpeak power prices in the per megawatthour MWh range depending on the region This strong pull on gasfired plants will push deep into the generation resource base driving prices upward An additional billion cubic feet Bcf per day will be required for gasfired generators in the US West compared with September levels Strong North American gas prices Natural gas prices are expected to retain most of this summers peak levels as North American supplies remain tight A market anxious about winter demand and price levels will also limit a price retreat this fall As a result average September Henry Hub prices are expected to trade around per MMBtu An active storm season could keep Henry Hub prices near the mark Strong western basis differentials The strong demand for gas to serve gasfired generation and storage concurrently will maintain western basis differentials at high levels especially in the California markets CERA expects a TopocktoHenry Hub differential of per MMBtu during September Extended operational problems associated with El Pasos pipeline rupture would raise that outlook Regional Power Market Drivers Hotterthannormal August weather transmission and generator outages high natural gas prices and declining hydroelectric output all contributed to a rise in power price levels during August Southern California average power prices in August have thus far exceeded July levels by an average of per MWh during the onpeak period and by per MWh during the offpeak period MidColumbia power prices bearing the brunt of fireinduced transmission outages experienced a jump from July price levels of per MWh for the onpeak period and per MWh in the offpeak period Offpeak prices which have averaged above per MWh during the JuneAugust period are clearly defined by the production cost of gasfired resources Onpeak prices during this same period at over per MWh in all regions in all months have reflected a significant premium at times over the cost of the marginal system generator see Table A return to normal weather should drive Westwide loads down by aMW in September from August levels However load growth and a return to normal weather are expected to push loads up by aMW when compared with September levels These greater loads coupled with a reduction in hydroelectric generation of aMW from last Septembers levels will create supply tightness during September see Tables and Hydroelectric coal and nuclear generation together will be insufficient to serve Westwide demand in September even during much of the offpeak periods requiring gasfired resources to meet a significant portion of the load Gas demand for power generation is expected to average Bcf per day in September down from over Bcf per day in August but up by a dramatic Bcf per day compared with levels in September September power prices will be defined by a floor set by the incremental cost of gasfired generation approximately per MWh with prices frequently higher as demand increases As this summer has clearly demonstrated prices rise in a nonlinear fashion as supplies grow very tight Hot weatherinduced loads should provide additional examples of this relationship Cooler or hotterthannormal weather in September coupled with the inherent high variability of September loads will produce a wide range of price outcomes Under normal weather onpeak power prices are expected to fall in the per MWh range depending on location representing a percent premium to yearago September prices see Figure The latest revision of the California Independent System Operators ISOs imbalance energy market cap down to per MWh is expected to depress market prices during any weather events in September CERA expects the ISO price cap to limit prices outside of California as well Pacific Northwest Although demand levels in the Pacific Northwest are expected to retreat in September by at least aMW compared with those in the hotterthannormal month of August the loss in available capacity from hydroelectric resources will amount to aMW over the same period see Table Thus the Pacific Northwest will be in an even more limited position to export power to other regions With transmission interties operating at below rated capacity during this period power prices in the Pacific Northwest will maintain their tight relationship with those in Northern California These price levels will continue to support the operation of the regions limited quantity of gasfired generation MidColumbia onpeak price levels are expected to average per MWh in September Offpeak power price levels in the Pacific Northwest will also receive a boost from the strong markets to the south The expected September level of per MWh represents the opportunity cost of power sales in surrounding markets California The fall months initiate a seasonal shift in price differentials that separates the West into markets that lie north of transmission Path and those to the south As in years past hydrodepleted Northern California should experience demand levels that must be served by generation resources within the region Exports from the Pacific Northwest dwindle and energy from the nuclear and coalrich Southwest is constrained from entering Northern California by Path import limitations This condition which is expected to persist from September through November allows Northern California to price at a premium The expected monthly average onpeak Northern California price of per MWh incorporates this dynamic Notably the California ISO is completing a process to remap the zones in California in part to capture locational price differences more effectively Southern California like the Southwest will typically experience hot weather episodes in September During these high demand periods prices will rise to peak levels as experienced this summer In addition California as a whole should see average loads in September that are aMW higher than those of September Occasional cooler weather will sharply but temporarily reduce daily prices Southern California benefits from the abundant export capacity of the Southwest during cooler weather in that region allowing prices to fall well below those in Northern California An per MWh differential between the north and south portions of the state is expected with Southern California onpeak prices averaging per MWh Offpeak prices of and per MWh for Northern and Southern California respectively reflect the continued need for gasfired resources to support September offpeak loads Rockies and Southwest An extended period of hot weather in July and August has boosted demand in the Rockies a region with growing saturation of residential air conditioning Limited transmission capacity and a dearth of cheaper exports from surrounding regions have allowed the Rockies to price temporarily at a premium to all other regions in the West A return to normal weather in September should restore the previously tight relationship of Rockies prices to those in the North Rockies prices are expected to fall with loads with a September monthly onpeak price average of per MWh and an offpeak price average of per MWh CERA expects Southwest prices to be tightly connected to prices in Southern California on a monthly average basis The two regions generally experience the same September weather patterns and a strong MW transmission link between the two market centers allows them to balance loads with each other Strong gas prices and occasional market tightnessinduced price runups will maintain onpeak prices at the per MWh level in September Offpeak prices will like those in Southern California be buoyed by the high cost of gasfired generation A price level of per MWh is expected for offpeak prices Regional Gas Market Drivers The summer competition for gas supply between power and storage continues in North America with gas prices reflecting the intensity of that competition Even as the summer power peak subsides in September across the United States the need to continue strong storage injections and the threat of storms in the Gulf will keep prices high and volatile The storage deficit now stands at approximately Bcf and US storage inventories look likely to head into winter at historically low levels This critical storage situation will keep prices high despite overall declines in power loads in September CERA expects a Henry Hub price of per MMBtu during September In the West strong power loads and the potential for power peaks persist through September especially in California Overall total demand for gas is expected to decline across the West from Bcf per day during August to Bcf per day during September see Table This load will tend to keep intraregional differentials wide throughout the West during the month The recent price disconnects between the supplyrich Rocky Mountains and San Juan Basin and demandcharged California will persist October should bring some change in this dynamic as heating loads in the Rockies begin to increase In general winter will bring a dramatic shift in regional pricing differentials throughout the West The summer pressure on Rocky Mountain supplies caused by high utilization rates on most export pipelines will be relieved somewhat by regional heating loads Declines in flows into the San Juan Basin from the Rockies will take some downward pressure off prices in the San Juan On the other hand healthy California storage inventories should limit price premiums at Topock through the heating season The startup of the new Alliance pipeline which will draw gas to the Midwest will support prices in the Pacific Northwest and California California Topock continues to be the premium pricing point in North America although differentials between Southern California and the Henry Hub subsided somewhat from peak levels near per MMBtu before this weekends pipeline explosion Total imports into California reached record levels during July total imports of Bcf per day eclipsed the previous high by million cubic feet MMcf per day see Table Pipeline capacity into the state during the month ran at percent utilization So far in August pipeline capacity utilization is exceeding even that high rate running at percent These high rates of capacity utilization are putting pressure on gas prices in Southern California and the pressure should continue during September Total demand in California is expected to decline somewhat during September but continued strong power loads and low seasonal hydroelectric generation will provide support Total demand in the state should average Bcf per day down only slightly from Augusts total of Bcf per day Flows into the state between August and September are not likely to change significantly but price pressure should decline somewhat with demand The Topock differential to the Henry Hub should average approximately per MMBtu for September see Table Storage inventories in the West are still healthy relative to levels in the rest of the United States but the storage surplus in the region has eroded In California inventories are running lower than last year and the deficit in the state looks likely to widen during September The end of injection season storage inventories will determine the vulnerability of Topock differentials to winter price spikes Pacific Northwest Malin prices this summer have shown neither the strong premiums that Topock prices have shown nor the wide discounts that supplies in the Rocky Mountains and San Juan Basins have shown So far this month prices at Malin are averaging a per MMBtu discount to the Henry Hub Pipeline capacity into the region from the Rocky Mountains is running nearly full flows on PGT out of Alberta have averaged nearly Bcf per day this month Export capacity out of the region on PGE GT NW is running close to capacity and pipeline constraints to the south combined with strong California demand are driving the wide MalintoTopock differentials Continuing strong demand in the South will likely keep Topock prices strong and the wide northsouth differentials within the West will likely hold through September In the Pacific Northwest demand is expected to climb through September to Bcf per day from Bcf per day in August This demand level should keep Malin differentials from widening from current levels For September CERA expects Malin prices to average per MMBtu below the Henry Hub price Southwest Prices in the San Juan Basin this summer have been left behind by rising California demand Although the westward pull on supplies is strong bottlenecks between California and the San Juan have led to disconnects between San Juan prices and Topock prices Pipeline capacity utilization rates on Transwestern and the northern leg of El Paso reached percent during July with less than MMcf per day of excess pipeline capacity Increased flows from the Rockies on TransColorado and Northwest are contributing to downward pressure on San Juan Basin supply and in general the San Juan has followed Rocky Mountain prices rather than following prices at Topock or the Permian Basin Unlike in the past two summers the bottleneck has not allowed power demand on the West Coast to support San Juan prices relative to Permian prices The differential between San Juan and Permian has averaged per MMBtu so far this month and per MMBtu since June Additional imports from the Rockies into the San Juan have increased supply by MMcf per day relative to last summer but these higher flows do not fully explain the disconnect Without much change in Southwestern or Rocky Mountains local demand the San Juan should continue to price at a wide discount during September The San JuantoHenry Hub differential is expected to average per MMBtu As in the Rockies differentials should narrow substantially in October Rocky Mountains Downward pressures on Rocky Mountain prices intensified over the past month as utilization rates on pipelines out of the region continued to climb Record heat and power generation levels have done little to boost gas demand within the region generation is still largely coalbased and the demand impact on gas of the additional load is minimal CERA expects the heavy discountcurrent Rocky MountaintoHenry Hub differentials are around per MMBtuto persist through September Local area demand is not expected to change during September Substantial gain in local demand comes in October with heating loads October demand should average Bcf per day up from August and September averages of around Bcf per day Although the winter heating season will relieve pipeline pressures in the Rockies winter differentials are expected to stay in the to per MMBtu range Strong storage inventories will limit the connection with broader North American markets this summer Next summer pressures on Rockies supplies will likely intensify relative to this summer Although pipeline expansion projects have been announcedTrailblazer and Williams announced expansion plans this summerthe new capacity will not be online to relieve constraints next summer CERA expects supplies within the Rocky Mountains to increase by MMcf per day next year Western Canada After widening to over US per MMBtu the AECOHenry differential has begun to narrow somewhat maintenance that has restricted flows has largely been responsible for the jump from per MMBtu in July With current supply able to fill the contracted pipe capacity and incremental volumes having to pay full cost to flow differentials are likely to persist in the midUSs per MMBtu for September AECO is expected to be US per MMBtu C per gigajoule for September Even with the startup of the Alliance project the contract nonrenewal on TransCanada is likely to continue the twotiered pricing dynamics of contracted versus uncontracted pipeline costs This will result in differentials that will range between US and US per MMBtu throughout the winter Supply build in western Canada continues to languish behind last years levels The pace of drilling over gas wells are expected this year should provide growth in the fourth quarter and into Supply is expected to be flat with on an annual basis for this year and up at least MMcf per day in Sumas prices have been quite volatile driven by both weather in the Pacific Northwest and maintenance on the Westcoast system For September Sumas is expected to be slightly more stable and to price at a modest premium to AECO of US per MMBtu end Follow URL for PDF version of this Monthly Briefing with associated graphic and tables CERAs Autumn Roundtable event dates and

Power by Pan Canadian We will look at the Oklahoma reserves for location and strategy with our pipewith the switch in ownership they may be receptive to strategy changes Lorna PanCanadian Says Montana Power Purchase Beautiful Fit To extend what it sees as dominance in Canadas natural gas market and to boost its production by PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd yesterday agreed to purchase Montana Power Co for million The properties will extend PanCanadians existing shallow gas properties in southern Alberta into northern Montana adding MMcfd and barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids The acquisition will give PanCanadian properties in Alberta Montana Colorado Oklahoma and Wyoming along with three gas pipelines linking Alberta and Saskatchewan to Montana We have a focus on natural gas said CEO David Tuer during a conference call yesterday in Calgary This is clearly our future It is difficult to put any negative on this acquisition and its likely to stay valuable for the foreseeable future Montana Powers production is more than natural gas and associated liquids and the acquisition substantially extends PanCanadians land and infrastructure allowing it to use its technology and operating strategies in a region that extends along the AlbertaMontana border The Montana Power assets clearly fit our strengths and allow us to employ our expertise in developing long life reserves of shallow and medium depth natural gas Tuer said The potential in these assets is significant and over the next few years we will add substantially to PanCanadians daily natural gas production Tuer said that the acquisition extends the companys dominance in shallow gas and called Montana Power a beautiful fit with PanCanadians gas strategy land position and technological capability PanCanadians newest acquisition adds reserves of Bcf and MM barrels of oil and natural gas liquids on a proven and onehalf probable basis said officials Production and reserves account for million of the purchase price while the remainder is made up of million for the midstream and marketing assets million for the undeveloped land about acres and million of working capital Tuer said the company was paying centsMcfe of proven and onhalf probable reserves The price for daily flowing production based on a ration of gas to BOE is Mcfe or BOE Along with the added Alberta and Montana properties PanCanadian also picks up some land in Colorados Denver Basin which now produces about MMcfd Other land that is part of the sale is located in the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma and the Green River Basin of Wyoming Three natural gas pipelines that cross from Montana into Alberta and Saskatchewan also are included The pipelines allow direct access to the US markets for southern Alberta and Saskatchewan gas and serve more than million net acres of developed and undeveloped lands with most of it concentrated in parcels that span the CanadaMontana border Midstream assets that go to PanCanadian include a natural gas marketing company in Butte MT along with a deep cut gas processing and fractionation plant in Colorado The Fort Lupton CO plant processes more than MMcfd and barrels of natural gas liquids and condensate In all the total developed and undeveloped land is roughly million net acres or million gross acres said PanCanadian Montana Power fit us like a glove Tuer said during the conference call He said the acquisition will help PanCanadian to remain best of class for what it does It makes our sandbox that much bigger The acquisition which is expected to close around Oct will increase both PanCanadians net income and cash flow this year and in subsequent years said Tuer The added gas production will immediately increase the companys natural gas as a percentage of total production to based on a ratio of gas to BOE About of the natural gas being acquired from Montana Power now is being sold to Montana Power utilities for to MMcf until July and because its priced below the open market officials think future earnings will be good As that contract expires theres a lot of potential from the price in this transaction Tuer said And whats to become of Montana Power Earlier this year the yearold company headquartered in Butte announced it would divest itself of four of its traditional energy businesses By selling its coal production natural gas transmission and distribution independent power production and oil and gas exploration and production businesses it plans to reinvest the proceeds in Touch America a fiber optics and telecommunications business which is also a subsidiary of Montana Power The process to determine the buyer for our oil and gas business was robust and we are delighted with the result said Montana Power CEO Robert P Gannon We believe there will be a meshing of business strategies and that cultural synergys exist between the purchased companies and Pan Canadian He noted that Montana Power has had a Canadian presence for almost years PanCanadian purchased the entire oil and gas division which now employs about PanCanadian plans to maintain a regional office in Butte invest in the acquired properties and grow daily gas production There was no word on whether any jobs would be lost

BriefingThe Pressure Cooker CERA Alert CERA Alert Sent Thu June Title Monthly BriefingThe Pressure Cooker Author N American Natural Gas Team EMail Category Alert Product Line North American Gas URL cfmtrackeprofilecfmum Pressure remains extremely strong in the United States gas market as three factorsincreasing power generation demand lower storage inventories and US wellhead supply still struggling to reboundcall into question the ability to build storage to a level adequate for next winter As strong as gas market fundamentals are gas prices are being supported also by concurrent strength in oil and liquids markets making traditional alternatives to gas much more expensive than in recent years In this environment intense competition between power generation demand and storage injections will continue throughout the summerwith pressure increasing into July as temperatures riseand gas will continue to price at the high levels necessary to discourage enduse demand The per million British thermal units MMBtu increase in gas prices since the beginning of May has already driven responses among end users First gas is now pricing at a slight premium to residual fuel oil on the East Coast and gas will likely lose approximately million cubic feet MMcf per day of demand to residual fuel oil this summer relative to last summer Second several ammonia manufacturing facilities have begun to shut down Equally telling however is that heat in any one region of the countrymost recently the Westis all that is required to sustain gas prices above at the Henry Hub despite relatively moderate temperatures elsewhere and demand reductions in industrial and other power markets Underlying pressures are such that prices are likely to rise on average from current levels as higher temperatures arrive For these reasons CERA expects prices to average at the Henry Hub during July see Table and even greater volatility is possible The intense competition and need to price out enduse demand mean that the market is vulnerable to spikes above per MMBtu amid heat waves this summer Gas StorageInjections Increase but Little Relief Yet The gas market experienced a small measure of relief in early June as storage injections finally reached a pace closer to historical averages with the American Gas Association AGA reporting billion cubic feet Bcf of injections during each of the weeks ending June and However these injections did little to reduce a deficit that is now close to Bcf on a yearoveryear basis and conditions may not again be as favorable as they have been recently for injections for many weeks or even months to come As temperatures rise through the end of the month injections are likely to slow so that for June CERA expects an average injection rate of approximately Bcf per day The deficit that stood at an estimated Bcf as of the end of May see Table on an inventory level of approximately Bcf is expected to rise slightly during June to Bcf despite a healthy injection rate for the first nine days of the month With US wellhead supply still running an estimated to Bcf per day below yearearlier levels and with added imports from Canada just offsetting this decline even the moderate demand growth expected for July relative to last July will make reducing the deficit a difficult task Each month in which this Bcf deficit carries forward increases the likelihood that inventories will be at their lowest maximum ever this October Injections like those in the recent two weeks would have to continue into July for this pattern to reverse in a significant way an unlikely event that would occur only under very mild weather conditions Regional Markets With the exception of the Rocky Mountains western differentials have been supported by waves of hot weather and extremely strong gas demand for power generation within the region This strong demand is pulling supplies from the Permian and San Juan Basins to the West Coast and has pushed up capacity utilization on the Southwest pipelines into California Prices at the California border have been particularly strong averaging over a premium to the Henry Hub so far this month Continued strong western demand looks likely to support prices within the region through July as power loads remain strong and hydroelectric output declines In addition the early heat waves have begun to erode the California storage surplus although inventories in the region as a whole remain strong see Table CERAs outlook by region follows Rockies Continuing strong supply growth and low seasonal demand have pushed up exports out of the Rocky Mountains region High utilization rates on export pipelines will keep Rocky Mountain differentials wide during the rest of the summer CERA expects an average July differential to the Henry Hub of per MMBtu San Juan The pull on supplies from California has narrowed the differential between the San Juan Basin and the Henry Hub and this West Coast pull looks likely to remain strong through the summer CERA expects a differential between the San Juan Basin and the Henry Hub of per MMBtu during July Permian and MidContinent As Texas power loads increase the competition from the West Coast and Texas markets for Permian supplies should intensify Permian differentials which have been averaging around per MMBtu to the Henry Hub should narrow CERA expects a per MMBtu differential for July MidContinent supplies should price just below Permian supplies at an per MMBtu differential to the Henry Hub Chicago Chicago differentials continue to trade around per MMBtu to the Henry Hub and although hot weather and climbing demand within the region could put some upward pressure on those differentials ample seasonal pipeline capacity into the region will limit pressure CERA expects a July differential of per MMBtu Northeast New York citygate differentials have a higher floor this summer namely higher fuel costs from the Gulf Coast as a result of gas The result has been differentials above from Transco Station but closer to from the Henry Hub As power generation load reaches its peak however differentials can rise even in summer Shortlived power load peaks may lift weekly New York differentials into the s but for the month of July CERA expects the New York differential to average Canadian MarketsDemand Still Down Canadian demand continues to be down on a yearoveryear basis Volumes on TransCanada Pipeline are MMcf below levels at this time last year and Alberta demand is MMcf below both of these reductions are primarily storage related Weak storage injections driven in large part by the lack of an adequate summerwinter price spread continue to place inventories further behind levels Although inventories are still well above the fiveyear average unless injections increase it is more likely that endofseason inventories will be comparable to the fiveyear average Bcf rather than to levels Bcf Export volumes continue to be slightly higher than last year Thus far in June flows on Northern Border Pipeline are similar to while PGE GTNW is currently operating MMcf higher Demand on the West Coast is expected to continue this trend for the summer Alberta supply build for June is likely to be flat with levels An outage pattern similar to last years has emerged TCENOVA has had maintenance projects ongoing in June but the supply reduction is primarily the result of plant turnarounds Thus far in June reductions in supply because of maintenance have been as high as MMcf but should average MMcf for the month Even though June is expected to be flat yearoveryear the fact that this maintenance reduction is less than maintenance reductions implies that a return to supply growth has not yet occurred Supply is still expected to start showing growth in the second half of the year largely in the fourth quarter as a result of the increased level of drilling The annual average supply is expected to be around MMcf per day higher than in as the result of the return to growth in Alberta and modest growth in British Columbia again primarily later in the year as well as the new production from Ft Liard that is now onstream The NYMEX and Henry Hub price strength is being felt in Canada AECO is expected to average C per gigajoule GJ US per MMBtu for June with a differential in the low USs July is expected to average C per GJ US per MMBtu The HenrytoAECO differential is likely to remain relatively high until storage injections increase the demand Follow URL for PDF version of this Monthly Briefing with associated tables end

selling test gas in ramp up period Right now these first deliveries are going into the ANR system because it is the only interconnect that is ready Alliance Delayed But Deliveries Begin Ramping Up After months of speculation in the industry Alliance Pipeline confirmed yesterday full commercial service will be delayed nearly a month until Oct When construction of the system was scheduled nearly three years ago Oct was the target date for commercial service However the delay doesnt mean the market wont be getting any Canadian gas out of Alliance until the end of October The pipeline opened one of its Chicago delivery valves last Thursday and started selling MMcfd of gas into the market It intends to increase its sales each week eventually reaching its full Bcfd load prior to switching to commercial service on Oct said spokesman Jack Crawford We got Commission approval to actually sell our test gas Right now I think we are dealing with three or four different marketers Our initial deliveries right now are into the ANR system Thats because its basically the only connection that is ready but over the next few weeks we expect they will all be ready to go and we will test them all Id be surprised if it ends up being regular volume increases of MMcfd each week but thats kind of the game plan said Crawford On Oct it will be Alliance selling Bcfd of test gas and on Oct it will be shippers nominating at one end and delivering at the other The market may not see much of a difference We obviously dont want to start charging our shippers until we have the confidence that all the systems have been checked out The pipeline system is designed to deliver gas from producing regions of northeastern British Columbia and northwestern Alberta to the Chicago area where the line interconnects with the North American pipeline grid Currently more than of the total pipeline system has been installed including mainline compressor stations receipt points in British Columbia and Alberta and delivery points in Illinois Commissioning activities commenced in March including the flowing of gas into the completed sections of line to purge air from the pipe At present approximately of Alliance has been purged of air This includes all the mainline portion of the system miles from near Gordondale Alberta to the delivery section near Joliet Illinois and of mile laterals receipt portion of the system Additionally receipt point meter stations have been commissioned Final commissioning activities are also being completed at mainline compressor stations To date Bcf of gas is in the commissioned mainline and lateral portions of the system with the ultimate line pack targeted at Bcf Crawford said there were a variety of factors that contributed to the delayed startup The rain in Saskatchewan delayed us a bit back in July but we managed to catch up on the construction there in August But it then meant that some of our commissioning didnt get going until a little bit later Farther west in Alberta and BC in fact weve had a couple of rain problems In particular we have one relatively small but fairly long lateral that we havent even been able to get on the right of way yet and thats because of rain Up in BC weve been having trouble with a directional drill of a creek on one of our laterals up there he said Were likely to get approval to opencut that creek but that will take us probably the better part of a month On the downstream end we had hoped to get more of our downstream connections right now We are testing one but some of the others arent quite ready yet Were ready but they are not Then of course there is a fairly complex interaction between the pipeline and the Aux Sable liquids plant We havent had a chance to work on that yet So when you look at all of those things the question was when could we establish a date when all this stuff would be done and we would be operational We spent a fair amount of time with our shippers and they mentioned one other pipeline that was being delayed one day at a time drove them to distraction We agreed we would pick one of three dates all Mondays Oct Oct or Oct and we just had to pick one that we felt confident in Besides the timing of service there has been another important question on the minds of many market observers Will the gas Alliance ships come Oct be incremental gas or gas that would have been flowing through TransCanada I dont think its going to be purely either way said Crawford Lots of guys are targeting for Nov to bring their new gas on to start the gas year so it all depends on how much shows up Its not a big secret that weve had some wet weather and some of the drilling and completion work hasnt gotten done Thats likely to have some affect on it as well Thats a delay though How long are people going to pay for gas Boy people are going to have a lot of money for drilling and projects

Author N American Natural Gas Team EMail Category Alert Product Line North American Gas URL cfmtrackeprofilecfmuDmD Alternative URL clientnagaltnagaltabhtml As the heating season approaches a highbut justifiedlevel of anxie ty regarding winter supplies is driving the gas market As things stand the market is headed into the winter exposed to a supply shortfall late in the winter even under normal weather conditions This prospect has placed a floor on the ga s price at the price of residual fuel oil itself priced in the mid to upper s range Gas prices moving into this range would begin to attract demand back into the market diverting supplies from storage and increasing supply concerns again To the upside there is little demand response to price until industrial demand lessens or the price of distillate oil as of this writing near per million British thermal units MMBtu is breached However distillate markets themselves are extremely tight and prices for that fuel would likely follo w gas prices up Within this range prices are defined mainly by supply anxiety the markets judgment of the likelihood of a supply shortfall which would b e characterized by extreme pricing and volatility and a difficult process of supply allocation by price By now exposure to extreme price volatility this winter is certain Althou gh CERA expects storage injections to increase by approximately billion cu bic feet Bcf per day from August to September this increase would still leav e inventories at record lows for this month and next Even this increase in injections will not occur if a tropical storm forces evacuation of offshore platforms or if hot weather returns For October heating load enters the picture With US supplies running clos e to yearearlier levels and imports slightly higher demand priced out of the market will remain the key reason that storage injections increase at all from las t years low level As a result although prices may close the month of September in the upper s per MMBtu at the high end of the competitive range with resid any threat of interruption in supplies will quickly bounce prices upward during the remainder of September or in October As the heating season begins therefore CERA expects the reality of supply vulnerability for the winter to result in the first ever monthly average price of at the Henry Hub s ee Table and the first of potentially many months at or above that price Gas StorageNew Record Lows CERA estimates that storage inventories in the United States crossed into record low territory as of the end of August when inventories of Bcf fell below the previous record low of Bcf see Table More records will likely be broken in the coming months and by widening margins Injections for September are expected to average Bcf per day an increase of Bcf p er day from the August level but below last years pace of Bcf per day CERAs September estimate could be exceeded under mild weather condition s with no tropical activity hitting the Gulf of Mexico but injections would likely fall below the Bcf per day rate should storm activity force evacuation of platforms This rate would leave US inventories at Bcf at months end a record low by Bcf For October CERA expects a slight increase in the injection rate from last year Injections of Bcf per day on average this year would be enabled by dema nd priced out of the market and by a lack of unusually cool weather or tropica l storm activity October injections have varied historically from Bcf pe r day to Bcf per day Even if injections reached toward the upp er end of this range the market would remain exposed to shortfalls during the winter At the expected injection rate US inventories of Bcf at the end of October would result in an end of March inventory level of Bcf und er normal winter weather Bcf below the previous record low of Bcf Regional MarketsWaiting for Winter The pipeline explosion on El Paso during late August intensified the subregional pressures already at play in western gas markets Cuts in pipeline flows limited access into California on the only pipeline route into the state with any excess capacity The lack of supply pressured prices within the supply basins and forced strong storage withdrawals in the California market Although summer power loads in California will ease and much of the El Paso capacity has be en restored the race to improve storage positions before the onset of winter heating load will keep intense pressure on Topock prices Differentials in the rest of the West will strengthen as local heating loads begin to absorb enough supply t o ease pipeline bottlenecks see Table Differentials in the East which have traded in a narrow range this summer will likely reach slightly higher levels with the start of the heating season in October However exposure to pricing disconnects will remain low until later this year CERAs outlook by region follows Rockies Pipeline bottlenecks out of the Rocky Mountains this summer should begin to ease as heating loads climb during October CERA expects that as local demand limits pressure on pipeline capacity differentials will narrow October differentials should average per MMBtu San Juan The resumption of flows on El Pasos southern system combined with production outages has relieved some of the access constraints on San Juan supply Seasonal declines in Rockies to Southwest flows and the beginning of the heating season should narrow October differentials to per MMBtu Permian and MidContinent The continuing pull on supplies from the West will support Permian prices and the Midwestern pull on supplies will support MidContinent prices CERA expects a differential to the Henry Hub of per MMBtu for MidContinent supplies and per MMBtu for Permian supplies Chicago The delay in the inservice date for Alliance from October to October will take some gas out of the Chicago market next month This delay combined with the need to build Midwest storage inventories should sustain the recent increase in differentials from the range to above per MMBtu CERA expects October differentials at the Chicago citygate to average Northeast markets Gas prices near have increased the fuel cost of delivery from the Gulf Coast into the Northeast raising the floor level for differentials to near per MMBtu The beginning of the heating season and the lack of new capacity into the New York citygate should support differentials above the floor during October at near per MMBtu Canadian MarketsOutages Affect Supply Outages have affected supply thus far in September Both British Columbia a nd Alberta have been affected resulting in a further yearoveryear decline i n Western Canadian supply The various problems appear to be rectified but t he

is beginning to climb again to previous levels More th an gas wells are expected for this year Slight Drop in Export Demand Eastern Canadian demand is still down approximately MMcf per day with

youll know The natural gas market is a real success story FERC has gotten an enormous amount of things right The market may not be unblemished but there are lots who consider the natural gas market the best market in the world offering genuine price discovery on a daily basis across dozens of products Its something everyone should be proud of Robert Levin of the New York Mercantile Exchange told a FERC conference yesterday The natural gas market has performed remarkably admirably through a range of market conditions with hundreds if not thousands of market participants using an extraordinary selection of market instruments Levin continued adding that the Commission should be supporting the growth and increased sophistication of commerce Youre at that point now Warning against socalled solutions offered by some at the daylong conference to increase liquidity or tie the natural gas market to the electric market Levin cautioned liquidity cannot be legislated Dont overreact The electric market is poorly regulated Remedies from the natural gas market should be transferred to the electric market rather than allow the gas market to be corrupted by the regulatory mistakes of the electric market Rather than worry over regulating an hourly market for natural gas change the electric market which Levin believes has developed its overemphasis on the hourly market because of the artificial tilt toward the spot market But while Levin warned against too much market meddling others among the more than representatives of the industry and its customers testifying at FERCs conference on competitive natural gas markets argued for a variety of initiatives to increase market liquidity by changing the rules for pipeline transportation Eliminating the shippermusthavetitle rule promoting expansion of the existing pipeline infrastructure especially in the Northeast doing away with straightfixvariable SFV rate design review of firmtowellhead rates in the production region and the allocation of transportation costs between the upstream and downstream were among the chief proposals proffered by mostly pipeline customers However greater gas market liquidity shouldnt be confused with increased competition in pipeline transportation municipals and producers told FERC staff during a postOrder technical conference Wednesday Were concerned the Commission may be equating market liquidity with competition in pipeline transportation The two are not the same said Arthur Corbin on behalf of the American Public Gas Association APGA which represents municipal gas distributors Even with greater and greater market liquidity monopoly power exists in the pipeline transportation segment Captive shippers will always require a regulated transportation service from any hub to their citygate he said Much the same holds true for LDCs noted Bruce Henning director of energy practices for Energy and Environmental Analysis Inc EEA who represented the American Gas Association AGA at the Commission staff conference He agreed market liquidity has improved immeasurably but he added theres not a liquid market center at every pipeline receipt or delivery point location Nor is there likely to be market centers in all of these locations in the near future Consequently Henning said FERC will need to continue to protect producers from market power that accompanies limited access to pipelines The daylong conference held yesterday in Washington DC was the first of several that FERC staff plans to hold to explore the impact of the Commissions transportation policies on the development of gas markets Christopher A Helms president and COO of Panhandle Pipeline Companies urged FERC not to enact policy changes that would place commodity market liquidity as the ultimate goal at the expense of the transportation market Helms said he advocated policies encouraging pipeline expansions and construction of optimal amounts of additional capacity to meet the needs of the market The single most important characteristic for liquidity in the natural gas commodity markets is the availability of adequate transportation capacity Charles Daverio vice president of KeySpan Corp echoed that sentiment saying FERC could increase liquidity in the New York City market and elsewhere in the Northeast by promoting construction of new pipeline capacity to ensure adequate supplies for the region yearround This would reduce energy costs and enhance reliability he noted Panhandles Helms also cautioned against policy changes that would force the development of new market centers and hubs Market centers should be allowed to develop at their own pace and at locations where the market sees fit he said EEAs Henning estimated more than liquid and transparent market centers exist today which permit industry participants to buy and sell gas daily under extremely competitive conditions He said hes confident more will be added because of the options that they provide to gas customers As another way to enhance liquidity KeySpans Daverio as well as others supported eliminating the shippermusthavetitle rule which requires the customer to retain title to the gas while its being shipped Doing away with the rule would pave the way for the development of new pipeline products and services such as operational balancing and virtual storage he told the FERC staff But Dena Wiggins an attorney with the DC law firm of Sutherland Asbill Brennan LLP which represents the Process Gas Consumers Group industrial gas customers said her group was very concerned about efforts to repeal the rule I havent heard anything yet today that satisfies the concerns that we might have She noted the Commission already has granted exceptions to the shippermusthavetitle rule in certain cases and should continue with this policy where necessary Moreover Wiggins said industrial customers were increasingly worried about the mounting market power of unregulated companies especially gas marketers At the conference she also expressed her groups dismay with the pipeline compliance filings with Order particularly on the penalty issue Rather than an improved penalty structure pipelines are proposing higher penalties Wiggins said We continue to be shocked at the absolute wholesale departures from BPs Jeff Holligan also waded into the fight against all the new services outlined by pipelines in their Order filings which he said were nothing more than penalties disguised as balancing services that customers cant refuse He urged the Commission to check with a pipelines customers noting one proposed new service is opposed by of the pipelines nonaffiliated customers Some of the proposed services Holligan said add up to nothing more than degradation of existing longterm firm service Holligan representing the largest producer in the US and Canada joined other market participants in urging adoption of standardized allocation sales standardized penalty levels and the requirement that all pipelines implement a uniform title transfer tracking process In short standardizing pipeline services certainly on an individual pipeline and also to a large extent between and across pipelines is imperative if markets are to be highly liquidIndividually negotiated services where every service is a different service or the adoption of a socalled dual track market are the antithesis of a highly liquid efficient and competitive gas market Standardization of operational terms of pipeline service is necessary to facilitate trading through ecommerce The Commission should be striving to commoditize pipeline capacity so it can be traded along with gas electronically Holligan said

would like to listen in at the Houston location Lorna Dear CERA Members and Friends Are oil companies leaving money on the table in their use of benchmark crude prices What can be done to lower the risk in these potentially harmful calculations One of Cambridge Energy Research Associates CERA core businesses has been benchmark crude oil price analysis In our new multiclient study The Hole in the Barrel CERA goes beyond our benchmark price analyses to analyze the structure of the market itself We argue the limits and real economic losses that can result from misunderstanding these prices specifically the Brent benchmark in oil company financial calculations and strategic planning the magnitude of which can be significant often amounting to dollars not cents per barrel As an introduction to this new study we would like to invite you to participate in this complementary multimedia conference call and web presentation on October With the current volatility and high levels of energy prices this conference call will bring clarity to these important and relevant issues To enroll for the call please RSVP to or and reference the Confirmation Code in order to participate in the call In this detailed study CERA looks at what people really mean when they talk about the oil price As part of the study we Analyze each of the five contracts that make up the Brent market and consider their longterm future given the steady decline of wet barrels including how other price markers might evolve Outline how oil companies have more discretion to raise revenues for a given volume of production than is generally appreciated Examine each of the three components that make up oil prices absolute price level time and grade differentials to show where revenue is being lost and what can be done to add it back again Assess the management control issues associated with any market activity and conclude that the risks of dealing are significant but not overwhelming especially in comparison to the underlying and increasing price risk that they help to manage In this evolving New World while trading may or may not be good for you not understanding the market can be fatal CONFERENCE CALL TOPICS Brent Blend as a price benchmark for a significant proportion of internationally traded crude oils The fitness for purpose of each of the five interwoven but separate

October Title Monthly Briefing Turning on the Heat Author N American Gas Team EMail Category Alert Product Line North American Gas URL cfmtrackeprofilecfmuDmD Alternative URL clientnagaltnagaltabhtml The nervousness driving the gas market that had settled just below the surface during the relative calm of late September and early October reemerged in force la st week From midSeptember through early October it appeared that a lucky combinati on of mild weather storage injections above billion cubic feet Bcf per day and a lack of storms in producing areas of the Gulf of Mexico had calmed the market somewhat Henry Hub prices settled near in the cash market less than above residual fuel oil Last week however tragedy in the Middle East and a slightly lowerthanexpected storage injection report were sufficient to drive Novem ber Henry Hub prices up by more than in two days to above Mild weather may still soften prices from current levels but CERA does not expect the relative calm of late September and early October to return to the gas market Turmoil in the oil market has raised the floor for gas prices as nearly Bcf per day of potential gas demand now burning residual fuel oil would quickly return to the gas market should prices decline relative to oil Also weather must remain mil d through October or else US working storage inventories may not reach even trillion cubic feet Tcf by the end of the month The headroom for price is much greater as distillate oil the next substitute for gas should gas prices rise is itse lf in short supply Shutdowns of industrial facilities represent an important increment of demand resistance as gas prices rise and neither switching to distillate n or shutting down production comes easily or cheaply Time is running out before the heating season begins and the market remain s justifiably on edge upward volatility remains much more likely than any significant settling in price As a result CERA expects natural gas prices to be sustained in the mids averaging at the Henry Hub during November see Table More lucka great deal morewould be required to restore a measure of calm to the gas market Gas StorageThe Final Push October storage injections have varied historically from Bcf to approximately Bcf per day in the United States and this year CERA expects them to averag e Bcf per day a moderate level for the month see Table The reporting of injections of Bcf during the week ending October precipitated a increase in futures prices but this rate is actually above average for the first full week of October With the beginning of consistent heating load late this month CERA expects a slowing of injections resulting in an endofOctober inventory of Bcfmore tha n Bcf below the previous record low for the end of October CERA expects that many storage holdershaving begun the winter with record low inventorieswill preserve inventories to the extent possible during Novemb er However normal weather this year would drive a substantial rebound in heating load from last years level and would require added storage withdrawals whic h CERA estimates will average Bcf per day this year Withdrawals at that pace or even substantially slower as occurred during and will keep inventories on a trajectory to hit record lows by the end of March Low storage inventories will remain a major source of price support requiring that demand continue to b e priced out of the gas market and keeping gas prices above those of residual fuel oil Regional MarketsWinter Rules The transition to winter pricing relationships is under way and the start of winter heating demand in the West has narrowed differentials between the supplyri ch Rocky Mountains and the Henry Hub Local demand for Rockies supply has also eased pressure on San Juan Basin prices and CERA expects differentials between both regions and the Henry Hub to continue to narrow through November In t he Northeast differentials will begin to widen with the onset of winter with the magnitude of the differentials depending on early winter weather The onset of flows on Alliance will limit increases in the Chicago differential during Novembe r see Table CERAs outlook by region follows Rockies Earlyseason cold has narrowed Rockies to Henry Hub differentials so far this month Ample supplies within the Rockies will mean volatile pricing relationships through the end of October and early November depending on heating load but in general strong regional demand will keep differentials well below the per MMBtu summer level CERA expects a per MMBtu differential to the Henry Hub during November San Juan The increase in local heating demand in the Rockies will continue to ease pressure on San Juan prices by limiting flows south out of the Rockies San Juan differentials should follow the same relationships as Rockies prices with general narrowing but continued volatility through November CERA expects an average San Juan differential of per MMBtu for November Permian and MidContinent Tight relationships between the Permian Basin and MidContinent and the Henry Hub should continue through November with some slight widening in the MidContinent basis differential expected when Alliance flows commence CERA expects differentials of per MMBtu and per MMBtu respectively Chicago The beginning of service via the Alliance Pipeline during November is the focus of most attention in the Chicago citygate market However the demand rebound that would result from normal November weather this year would offset most of the added supplies As a result Chicago differentials will average in the per MMBtu range even when Alliance flows commence although delay of the Vector Pipeline will keep much of the new gas in the Midwest CERA expects average November Chicago differentials of per MMBtu Northeast markets Normal weather would drive a substantial rebound in New York citygate prices from yearearlier levels but there is little added delivery capacity into that market CERA expects New York to price above the Henry Hub during November well above the current low o mids Canadian MarketsSupply Growth Still Uncertain The supply build is uncertain at this time because flows on Alliance are uncertain A line pack of between and Bcf has been established and modest flows of million cubic feet MMcf per day have been initiated to test and commissio n the pipeline The startup is still slated for November but the unknown quantities of gas that are flowing on a daytoday basis are making it difficult to asses s precisely the volume of supply being produced At this time it appears that October is on par with The current expectation is for over well completions in approximately of which are expected to be gas wells Even if the shallow trend does not change substantially the sheer number of wells is still expected to produce a supply build by yearend and into For the total western suppl y build is expected to be flat

Prices CERA Alert CERA Alert Sent Fri June Title New Peaks New Prices Author Zenker Moritzburke Snyder EMail Category Alert Product Line Western Energy URL cfmtrackeprofilecfmum In the West July typically marks the start of the summer cooling season which along with waning hydroelectric energy production and the more frequent use of gasfired generators to meet demand causes steadily rising power prices CERA expects the West to be the only region in North America with a yearoveryear increase in peak electricity demand Power prices already established new record highs in June suggesting that as demand reaches its peak during the coming summer months western power markets will continue to experience increased volatility compared with last years levels The convergence of natural gas prices that are much higher than last years levels growing demand for power and reduced hydroelectric energy production when compared with levels in is pushing up western power prices Merchant and other gasfired generators will be pressed into service experiencing their strongest utilization rates since the drought year of Greater utilization of gasfired generators within the West has supported western differentials and contributed to high gas prices throughout North America Western gas prices should continue to be strong boosted by continuing increases in regional gas demand for power generation and pressure across North America to inject gas into storage in anticipation of summer power loads The main drivers of higher power and gas prices when compared with yearearlier levels will be Peak WSCC load season Summer weather will drive loads to the years coincident peak which is most likely to occur during the JulyAugust period but could arrive any time during the June through October airconditioning season CERA expects demand growth of percent in the third quarter compared with levels in which will push Western Systems Coordinating Council WSCC coincident peak demand levels to percent over levels Waning hydroelectric output Hydroelectric production is on its normal downward seasonal slide This resource decline is more visible when compared with the hydro season which was both abundant and prolonged High utilization rates for gasfired generators Growing demand for electricity coupled with a declining availability of hydroelectric energy will drive utilization rates of gasfired power plants to their highest levels since the drought year of Higher fuel prices Western gas prices have remained at per MMBtu above levels Growing yearoveryear gas demand for power generation is providing much of the price pressure in western markets These higher gas prices provide a boost to both onpeak and offpeak power prices of between and per megawatthour MWh Regional Power Market Drivers Power markets in the West are poised to break records for demand peak load and gasfired plant utilization and as a result power prices A return to normal summer weather coupled with growing demand for power will push demand for electricity up by gigawatthours GWh in the US West for the third quarter compared with levels or almost megawatts MW on average see Table This growth in the demand for electricity will also drive peak loads to new highs CERA expects the WSCC coincident peak to be exceeded by percent climbing to nearly MW As was demonstrated by the mild summer of deviations from normal weather could boost or thwart this peak demand growth figure Two key factors will significantly reduce third quarter hydroelectric production levels compared with levels First CERA expects Westwide total season hydroelectric production in of roughly percent of historical average levels substantially lower than the approximately percent of average in Second runoff was prolonged in serving to push a substantial portion of the hydroelectric production into the summer period see Figure On average CERA expects these factors will remove GWh or almost average megawatts aMW from the western resource base compared with levels Exacerbating this decline refilling of reservoirs and flow restrictions to assist fish migration will cause periodic but significant curtailments in power production at key Pacific Northwest hydroelectric facilities Natural gasfired facilities will be called upon to supply most of the expected increase in demand while also replacing hydroelectric resources as they continue to decline This will push average annual utilization rates of gasfired combined cycle steam and cogeneration plants to approximately percent in levels not experienced since the percent annual average utilization rate in a year marked by drought and warmerthannormal summer weather Utilization rates for these facilities will also surge past levels especially this summer CERA anticipates a Westwide third quarter utilization rate of percent for these facilities under normal summer weather conditions compared with percent for the same period of This level of utilization will certainly establish gasfired generation as the floor to power prices during the third quarter during not only the onpeak demand period but the offpeak as well With natural gas prices at per MMBtu higher than levels power prices are boosted by per MWh owing to fuel price increases alone With supply tightness already evident in western power markets the stage is set for increased price volatility compared with levels as episodes of hot weather require increased utilization of lessefficient generators throughout this summer Pacific Northwest The water supply forecast for the Columbia River remains near average but has dropped a couple percentage points from last month Flows are expected to remain at roughly percent of average through September on the Lower Columbia and percent of average on the Upper Columbia Conditions overall are still sufficient to be considered average This return to normal conditions in the Pacific Northwest should produce hydroelectric output nearly GWh percent lower than last year for July and GWh lower for the third quarter as a whole see Table The regions load growth coupled with lower hydro supply will continue to elevate power prices in the Pacific Northwest relative to levels Tighter supply conditions in California and the Southwest will attract energy exports from the Pacific Northwest preserving a differential between the Pacific Northwest and California of about per MWh on average Price differentials between the Pacific Northwest and California have varied dramatically recently with the north at times rising above those to the south owing to local demand and hydroelectric constraints caused by reservoir filling operations Since the end of May volatility in both markets has pushed the difference between daily onpeak prices at COB and those in California from a premium of per MWh to a discount of per MWh within a few days CERA expects that over the long run California markets will clear at a premium as the summer progresses but the differential will vary widely with episodes of Pacific Northwest power pricing at a premium to those in California California Despite belowaverage precipitation and snowpack this year California reservoir storage levels throughout the state are higher than normal ranging between and percent of average for the states primary runoff regions Under these conditions hydroelectric output should be roughly percent GWh below last years levels for the third quarter see Table With a return to normal weather conditions relative to third quarter cooling demand this summer will increase most in California where weather was nearly percent cooler than average last year Recent dayahead power prices in California have drawn attention to the West as the highestcost market if only temporarily in North America Record high temperatures and unscheduled unit outages produced new dayahead price records with power prices on June at per MWh in the dayahead onpeak market and realtime hourly prices at the market cap of per MWh Increased utilization of gasfired generation and daily gas prices of around per MMBtu burnertip in Southern California have kept daily average offpeak prices between and per MWh Notably these higher price have occurred during periods when roughly MW more coalfire generation was available in the West compared with the same period in CERA expects prices to continue to respond to the tight capacity environment this summer Rockies and Southwest During summer the RockiesSouthwest was the only region to experience aboveaverage cooling demand suggesting that normal weather should bring only moderate demand growth of less than percent see Table However growing energy demand in neighboring regions and a large transmission transfer capability will pull energy from the RockiesSouthwest region when excess capacity is available ensuring that prices in the region will remain tightly connected to price levels in other parts of the West Palo Verde prices have generally kept pace with other western markets while maintaining their characteristic premium to the California Power Exchange during spring and early summer CERA expects Southwest prices to strengthen relative to California when summer weather periodically shifts the locus of demand to the Southwest However California prices will maintain a premium on average to those in the Southwest as the effects of the states tight supply situation translates to higher prices than those in either the Southwest or Pacific Northwest Regional Gas Market Drivers Under continuing pressure to inject gas into storage in the face of declining supply and increasing gas demand for power generation gas prices at the Henry Hub are expected to average per MMBtu in July The strong demand for gas for power generation will keep differentials strong in the southern half of the West In the Rockies pipeline constraints will keep differentials wide The heightened call on gas demand for power generation driven by the declining hydroelectric generation and increasing power loads is expected to drive demand increases of Bcf per day relative to July and MMcf per day relative to June demand levels Gas demand for power generation is expected to reach a monthly average record level of Bcf per day in July see Tables and These increases will result in declines in western storage injection rates and in exports from the West Both Permian and San Juan supplies will be pulled increasingly toward the West Coast during July Low storage inventories and needed increases in injections are driving North American gas pricing The West is the one US region actually running a storage surplus but the recent heat waves and associated pull on gas supplies have eroded that surplus particularly in California see Table Given the expected increases in gas demand the western surplus should continue its decline This decline and very high demand will reinforce the volatility in differentials already evident this summer California Because of the early hot weather in the West and strong gas demand for power generation Topock prices have been extremely high and volatile So far this month Topock has averaged over per MMBtu above the Henry Hub Flows on El Paso and Transwestern into California increased by over million cubic feet MMcf per day during June relative to May averages and flows are expected to continue to climb by an additional MMcf per day during July PGT continues to run near capacity see Table At the same time the storage levels within California look likely to fall below last years levels sometime during the month This intense demand pressureCalifornia demand should increase by nearly MMcf per day in July relative to Junewill keep utilization rates on import pipelines high and sustain Topock differentials CERA expects the Topock to Henry Hub differential to average per MMBtu during July see Table This high differential will likely persist through the summer with differentials rising above per MMBtu during West Coast heat waves Southwest San Juan price differentials have been volatile narrowing during periods of very high western demand However a very high utilization rate on pipeline capacity into California has widened the TopockSan Juan differential and that wide gap is expected to persist On average San Juan differentials to the Henry Hub are expected to narrow from current levels as southwestern demand increases with western temperatures Demand in the Southwest is expected to climb from Bcf per day in June to Bcf per day in July This increased call on regional supplies and an expected strengthening in Permian prices should result in an average San Juan differential to the Henry Hub of per MMBtu In the Permian Basin prices are expected to strengthen as Texas power demand climbs Combined with the pull on supplies from the West Permian differentials should narrow from their current levels of per MMBtu to below per MMBtu Pacific Northwest Strong June hydroelectric output has limited the call on gas supplies in the Pacific Northwest so far this summer but as hydroelectric output decreases in June and July gas demand will increase dramatically CERA expects an increase of nearly MMcf per day during July relative to June levels The limited demand so far has meant differentials between Malin and the Henry Hub of as much as per MMBtu and Topock to Malin differentials of over per MMBtu The Malin to Henry Hub differential has narrowed slightly to around per MMBtu It should continue to strengthen with growth in regional demand and average per MMBtu during July Rocky Mountains Regional gas supply within the Rocky Mountains continues to increase bolstered by continuing growth in the Powder River Basin This April exports out of the Rockies reached Bcf per day a record high Although there is excess pipeline capacity out of the region into the Southwest on the Transcolorado and Northwest pipelines high utilization rates have widened Rockies differentials with the rest of the West In particular Rockies to San Juan differentials have averaged nearly per MMBtu for June after pricing close to parity earlier in the year That gap should persist through the summer as gasfired generation climbs across the rest of the West Demand is expected to average the same level in July as in June in the Rocky Mountains where coal limits gass gains in power generation CERA expects prices within the Rockies to gather some support from increasing power loads in the Pacific Northwest as well as from stronger differentials in the San Juan Basin On average Rockies differentials to the Henry Hub are expected to average per MMBtu during July In response to the increasing supplies flowing out of the Powder River Basin and the increasing pipeline capacity utilization on export pipelines Trailblazer has announced an open season for two possible options to extend and expand the mile pipeline from Wyoming into Nebraska Although timing and volumes have yet to be announced the additional capacity could prevent serious bottlenecks from developing out of the region which CERA would expect by without capacity additions end Follow URL for PDF version of this Monthly Briefing with associated graphic and tables Please note Should the above URL not work please use the following

updates Enrons Lay Urges Bold Solutions to Power Market Woes As the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission prepared to weigh in this morning with the federal governments answer to Californias bedeviled power market free market advocates issued last minute warnings against taking the price cap route espoused by the CalISO FERCs meeting is scheduled to start at AM EST Check this morning for updates In a letter fired off to FERC Chairman James J Hoecker yesterday Enron CEO Kenneth Lay urged the Commission to find a fix for the underlying structural problems in the power market rather than follow the steps of policy makers who have placed price cap band aids over hemorrhaging wounds Lay told Hoecker the power market is halfway across a busy street in its transition from monopoly to competition It cant stand where it is He said FERC has to make a choice between falling into the same trap of political expediency as Californias ISO leaving the nations electric system in the lurch from one crisis to the next or it can take a big step toward fundamental structural reform At the same time the Electric Power Supply Association EPSA called on FERC to issue an emergency cease and desist order prohibiting the CalISO from unilaterally implementing any changes to its current MWh price cap for wholesale electricity purchases In a motion filed Monday the marketer group specifically asked the Commission to bar the CalISO board of directors from putting into effect its decision to impose a fiendishly complex loaddifferentiated price cap of or less during the offpeak season effective Nov The plan was designed by the states main utility consumer group see Daily GPI Oct In addition the EPSA urged FERC to state explicitly that the CalISO does not have the authority to impose or extend price or bid caps unless expressly authorized to do so by the Commission The CalISOs current authority to set price caps expires on Nov Lay said the CalISOs complicated new formula caps prices below the cost of gasfired generation making obvious errors such as failing to take into account gas transportation costs between the Henry Hub and power plants in California in doing so the bid cap makes it more economic for generators to sell their gas supply rather than use it to make electricity in California The new formula also forces the ISO into the market to buy power on an ad hoc basis to keep the lights on when the capped market fails to attract sufficient supplies which it inevitably will do Lay said In addition the capped formula invites generators to shut in production export power out of state and deploy their turbines in other states or countries He noted that the ISOs Chairman voted against the measure while all of the states utilities voted for it presumably knowing full well that it simply will not work California is just the latest failure of partial or compromised open access said Lay Its time for the Commission to reject this approach The power industry the nations most essential industry is mired in the transition from regulated monopoly to open access and customer choice Every step forward has been compromised out of concern for alienating one vested interest or another As a result utilities are free to slow the interconnection of new generation withhold equal access to the transmission system favor their own sales over those of competitors miscalculated available transmission capacity and exercise control over supposedly independent system operators and reliability organizations Lay predicted that installing price caps for political expediency would plunge markets into greater uncertainty and discourage new supplies and conservation methods FERC has to complete the work that it started said Lay It has to ensure that all parties have equal and fair access to transmission by ending the special priority for utility uses of the system Second FERC must require transmission owners to separate operation of the monopoly transmission assets from their other businesses Third FERC must take politics out of transmission system operations by revising governance structures to ensure independence Finally FERC must end its reliance on shortsighted price caps by putting in place the necessary reforms to allow these markets to operate efficiently to encourage conservation and attract new supplies EPSA said the CalISO board acted in obvious disregard for the Commissions orderly processes It cannot be permitted to make the Commissions decisions for it or to alter so radically market rules thereby injecting more uncertainty and confusion in the market and subverting the process for fashioning fair effective and comprehensive remedies for Californias flawed electric markets the group noted The EPSA believes that any remedial actions taken by FERC with respect to the California markets will be severely compromised if the CalISO boards imposition of new prices caps is allowed to take effect

Product Line North American Gas URL cfmtrackeprofilecfmum Alternative URL clientnagaltnagaltabhtml After a warm October the first cold weather this year has provided an early warning of what winter could bring for the gas market Cold weather across much of the great plains and a cold forecast for larger heating markets in the Midwest and Northeast have driven a surge in gas prices of more than per million British thermal units MMBtu over the past week This rebound in price highlighted the continued tightness of supply and moved the price of gas back above that of residual fuel oil assuring that dualfuel loads remain off of gas Supplies for the winter are not adequate to allow most dualfuel end users to burn gas If this cold snap extends through the remainder of November a heavy earlywinter draw on storage could set the stage for unprecedented high prices through the winter Though storage inventories have reached near the billion cubic feet Bcf level they remain at a record low heading into the heating season and even a normal winter would reduce inventories to a near record or record absolute low by spring This supply tightness places the gas price playing field in the broad territory above the resid price near in the Gulf Coast and into a range potentially testing the next difficult level of demand resistance This resistance could come from switching to distillate oil but low distillate inventories and high distillate prices mean that switching would require a gas price above per MMBtu and any move to switch to distillate would likely drive prices of both commodities higher Rather a combination of some switching to resid in industrial boilers and a shutdown of a few more pricesensitive end users may be required None of these measures comes easily or cheaply however and they can be overwhelmed by weatherdriven swings in demand As a result as cold weather settles in CERA expects heightened price volatility at levels above the price of resid and extreme sensitivity in the market to weather and weather forecasts Under normal weather conditions CERA expects Henry Hub prices to average during December see Table which by itself would represent an all time high for December But even this estimate could prove low If the current cold snap extends through early December prices could easily climb into the per MMBtu range Gas StorageThe Record Low Maximum CERA estimates that storage inventories reached a maximum of Bcf as of the end of October a record low for that month by Bcf see Table Even this level was reached only through a fortunate combination of a lack of storms in the Gulf of Mexico and consistent warmth through most of October The withdrawal season is likely to have begun this week however and in a strong way The cold weather now settling in is likely to offset warmth early this month increasing the withdrawal rate this November to Bcf per day on average well above the Bcf per day average rate of the past two years By the end of this month the US inventory deficit is likely to have widened again to Bcf CERA estimates that normal December weather would require storage withdrawals of approximately Bcf per day which is above last years rate of Bcf per day This year however this withdrawal rate would apply consistent pressure in the market through December and beyond as it would keep inventories on a path to reach Bcf by the end of March just below the alltime endofMarch low of Bcf So long as inventories remain on this path the pressure does not end even with the end of winter as a significant increase in injections next year would be required for inventories to reach even trillion cubic feet Tcf by next fall Although the supply build will begin to help by late winter it is unlikely to be of the magnitude required both to offset power generation demand growth and to allow this increase in storage injections to occurunless demand continues to be priced out of the market DemandKeeping Warm After last years warm winter CERA expects a strong rebound in heating demand and this weeks weather and forecast reinforce that expectation Weather last winter November through March was the warmest of the decade and there will be a significant rebound in heating demand in the residential and commercial sectors as weather returns toward normal this heating season Under normal weather conditions Average heating demand through the winter would be Bcf per day higher than last years Monthly average heating demand through the winter would be Bcf per day peaking at Bcf per day in January December heating demand would increase by Bcf per day relative to last December Weather percent colder than normal could further increase December demand by Bcf per day relative to normal weather likewise a percent warmerthannormal scenario could decrease demand by Bcf per day relative to normal weather Fuel Switching With natural gas markets this tight there is significant pressure for demand to be backed out of the market Residential and commercial demand is inelastic to price in the short run which leaves industrial demand and power demand as the only relief valve for the market This winter we expect all plants capable of burning residual fuel oil as an alternative to gas to do so a loss of million cubic feet MMcf per day of demand for power generation relative to last winter industrial consumers to switch the equivalent of MMcf per day off of gas gas prices to act as a ceiling for residual fuel oil prices as much as resid will act as a floor for gas For December CERA expects an overall demand increase of Bcf per day relative to last December and a Bcf per day increase in demand relative to November with increasing heating load offset somewhat by fuel switching SupplyThe Rebound The pressure from increasing demand and lower storage inventories is intense but US supply is beginning to rebound The recent steep decline in US lower capacity is expected to reverse in late given the soaring gasrelated rig count The success in reversing the decline in the Gulf of Mexico is related to the combination of the rampup of the Hickory and Tanzanite subsalt discoveries on the shelf adding to the recent startup of the Muni field these fields could add over Bcf per day later in the response of the shallow water to the strong late turnaround in drilling activity Other important capacity additions are occurring in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico with Bcf per day in and and onshore led by the Bossier sand play in Freestone County Texas the Barnett Shale play in Wise County Texas and the Powder River Basin coal seam play Further increases in drilling are likely to slow New deep land rigs are under construction and shallow rigs are being refurbished with cannibalized parts from older rigs Producers are experiencing delays in obtaining rigs as the supply of quality rigs depletes and drilling companies struggle to round out drilling crews Regional MarketsWild Winter in the West Extremely cold weather in the West has brought Rockies prices close to parity with Henry Hub prices and triggered early season spikes at Sumas in the north and Topock in the south Pipeline maintenance on El Paso is exacerbating the regional demand pressure and has contributed to Topock differentials of over per MMBtu Tight pricing relationships to the Henry Hub in the San Juan and Rocky Mountains should hold through February with significant widening in differentials as heating loads decline Winter has arrived in earnest across North America but the startup of firm transportation service on Alliance is delayed once again this time until December Nonetheless flows on the pipeline are under way CERA estimates that flows during October averaged MMcf per day During November that total should climb to MMcf per day despite the later published start date With or without Alliance flows a weatherdriven rebound in midwestern demand relative to November and December last year should keep prices in Chicago at a significant premium to Henry Hub prices In the Northeast differentials remain extremely strong and exposed to spikes throughout the winter despite greater flows into the region from Atlantic Canada this year see Table CERAs outlook by region follows Rockies Very cold weather within the region has brought Rocky Mountain prices near parity with Henry Hub prices A break in the cold or a cold snap in the East will likely widen the differentials but strong heating demand in the region will keep differentials within about per MMBtu below the Henry Hub price CERA expects a December average differential of per MMBtu however this differential is expected to show significant volatility based on regional weather A warm week in the Rockies could still push differentials toward per MMBtu San Juan San Juan prices will continue to hold close to Rockies prices through the winter with significant pipeline capacity between the two regions Heating loads in the Rockies will determine the San Juan to Henry Hub differential with extended cold weather in the Rockies pulling both prices close to the Henry Hub price CERA expects the December differential in the San Juan Basin to average per MMBtu Permian and MidContinent Unlike prices within the rest of the West differentials between the Henry Hub and the MidContinent and Permian Basins are likely to trade within a relatively narrow range during the winter as supplies from those basins are pulled either east or west depending on regional weather CERA expects a Permian to Henry Hub differential of per MMBtu and a MidContinent differential of per MMBtu for December Chicago Alliance flows into the Chicago market are now running close to MMcf per day However the onset of the heating season has offset those increased flows and pushed Chicago differentials up to near per MMBtu relative to the Henry Hub despite delays in the completion of the Vector pipeline CERA expects the strong pricing at Chicago to continue and December differentials should average per MMBtu Northeast markets Assuming normal weather we expect to see December basis for New York relative to Henry Hub at per MMBtu New England will likely see prices higher depending on the pipeline Much of this increased basis differential is caused by fuel costs For example with a percent retention rate from the Gulf Coast into New England last December would have seen retention costs of approximately at that same retention equates to Despite additional volumes of gas deliverable into the Northeast from the Atlantic Canadian fields there have been no additional regional pipeline facilities to deliver this gas to the local markets and an additional MMBtu per day of potential demand will compete for the capacity Because of this tightness should this months weather be colder than normal we could see severe spikes in basis similar to those seen in January These spikes could even exceed the highs seen in January depending on the severity of any cold snaps and the extent to which new electric loads are realized Canadian MarketsWinter Begins The colderthannormal weather has increased demand in western Canada but is only now being felt in the East Storage peaked in the West in early October at approximately Bcf below last years level and Bcf below the fiveyear average Even with modest withdrawals since that time storage inventories are still estimated to be adequate to meet winter needs Easter Canadian storage has continued to grow pushing levels to over Bcf Bcf above last year and well above the fiveyear average With the eastward movement of the colder weather withdrawals are likely to begin This higher level of eastern storage will be useful with the expected reduction of flows on TransCanada The good news resulting from the cold is a more normal freezeup which bodes well for a longer winter drilling season Gas well completions are expected to reach for and will likely be even higher next year Further Delays for Alliance The commercial inservice date for Alliance has been delayed until December the result of a combination of problems with clearing the line delays in the completion of the Aux Sable liquids extraction plant the delay of Vector and a lack of supply The pipeline has been flowing gas however with volumes building up since September It is estimated that flows for November will average MMcf per day TransCanada has taken the full brunt of the Alliance flows so far with Northern Border and PGT remaining strong December should see Alliance flows build to between and MMcf per day with modest reductions in flows on Northern Border and PGT Storage withdrawals will likely keep TransCanada reductions close to MMcf per day year overyear until Vector begins service to eastern Canada High Prices Strong Pull West The high demand in the Pacific Northwest has also provided strength for AECO The AECOHenry differential has dropped to the high s and low s as a result of this increased pull For December the differential is expected to average per MMBtu for a resulting AECO average of C per gigajoule US per MMBtu end Follow URL for PDF version of this message with

Western Market Crisis Gas Joins Power CERA Alert CERA Alert Sent Fri December Title Western Market Crisis Gas Joins Power Author CERA EMail Category Alert Product Line Western Energy North American Gas URL Western Energy Members clientcealtcealtabhtml N American Gas Memeber clientnagaltnagaltabhtml Western Markets Disconnect The western energy markets are currently in a pricing crisis Power supply shortages and threats of system blackouts have resurfaced this winter in California and spiking natural gas prices have become the latest energy headache for the West Gas prices along the Pacific corridor from Kingsgate in the North to Topock in the South have jumped to over per MMBtu during December after averaging over per MMBtu through the second half of November Extreme weather strong power demand for gas and unusually low gas storage levels have combined to intensify the demand for pipeline gas and have exposed a latent capacity bottleneck in bringing gas to this far western corridor The result is prices that dramatically disconnected from the rest of the North American gas market in a way that is more typical of Northeast markets during the winter The vulnerability to additional spikes will endure as the demand drivers combined with weakened storage inventories will maintain price pressure on western price points throughout the winter However the recent jumps in western gas market differentialsto more than a per MMBtu premium to the Henry Hubshould ease somewhat with a break in the weather Under any weather scenario spikes up into the per MMBtu range will be a feature of winter markets along the West Coast On balance we expect West Coast price differentials to average at a per MMBtu premium through winter The spring hydroelectric runoff season should offer the first opportunity for a break in differentials that could drop back to more typical levels of less than per MMBtu Over the long term increased pipeline capacity and additional gas supply are needed to break the vulnerability to future West Coast price spikes However significant new capacity additions are still to months away In the meantimeparticularly this wintersustained high and volatile price differentials and extremely high absolute prices at western points are likely to draw the increased attention of state regulators and the FERC as winter heating demand exposes residential customers to the direct cost of the crisis Building Up to the Price Spike The first signs of natural gas price spikes and disconnects emerged this summer as sharp yearoveryear increases in demand pushed pipeline utilization rates to new highs As pipeline capacity constraints into California became evident differentials in Southern California moved up to a per MMBtu premium to the Henry Hub These extremely high prices as well as low forward spreads discouraged storage injections through the summer As a result a strong storage position early in the summer deteriorated rapidly from May through July In August a lateral on El Pasos southern system exploded the accident further limited pipeline capacity into California for a twoweek period During that time the market drew heavily on storage inventories and further weakened storage positions As hydroelectric generation declined through the summer the price strength extended into Northern California Malin which had been pricing near parity with the Henry hub in the summer began trading at a per MMBtu premium to the Henry Hub in September The summer and early fall market set the stage for continued and more intense spikes this winter The following factors are now driving this market Continuing surges in gas demand Gas demand levels have remained high since early summer driven by higher overall demand for electricity and lower hydroelectric output Demand levels for the third quarter in the US West averaged billion cubic feet Bcf per day up from Bcf per day during the third quarter Persistently strong gasfired generation production through the fall months diverted gas to power production frustrating efforts to fill storage This pressure will continue The yearoveryear demand increases from the power sector will be compounded as evidenced in November by swings upward in residential and commercial heating demand of million cubic feet MMcf per day Overall CERA expects nearly Bcf per day of increased demand in the West this winter with the critical California and Pacific Northwest regions showing Bcf per day of increased demand Key power sector drivers including the strong economy colder weather and lower hydroelectric generation will continue to push gasfired generation Pipeline utilization nears capacity Strong western demand for gas has pushed utilization rates on western pipes to high levels Flows from British Columbia into the Northwest pipeline have remained at high levels since summer while flows from the Rockies on Northwest have remained at pipeline capacity Flows on PGT into Kingsgate have remained at or near capacity although approximately MMcf per day of excess capacity exists on PGT into California at Malin Likewise flows out of the Rockies on Kern River pipeline have consistently remained at capacity The only slack pipeline capacity remaining for West Coast gas markets has been on Southwest pipes During the past few months these pipelines have operated at their highest utilization rates since the addition of capacity from Canada early last decade The high utilization of western pipeline capacityreminiscent of power plant capacity constraints that helped propel power prices to all time highs in the West this summerleaves very little slack capacity to provide a relief valve for demand spikes And that is exactly what has driven prices during the past few weeks see Figure Given the level of storage inventories and expected gas demand flows on the El Paso and Transwestern pipelines will have to reach even higher flow levels from December through March than they have averaged through November Deteriorating storage position At the start of November California storage inventories held at Bcf a full Bcf below the fiveyear average inventory level The strong instate withdrawals during November weakened that position to Bcf the deficit swelled to Bcf Inventories in California have never fallen below Bcf so deliverability through the end of winter is likely less than MMcf per day Storage inventories in California are so low that utilities ability to balance withdrawals from storage with purchases from demandsensitive price points is severely limited If the cold weather blast anticipated for mid December materializes this effort at balance will be even further compromised for the remainder of winter see Figure Shortterm contracting A significant amount of western gas is purchased or indexed to the spot market A shift from term contracts for both gas and pipeline capacity to spot transactionsin many cases in response to gas and power industry deregulationhas left the West much more exposed to spot market volatility In other areas of the country utilities have significant firm pipeline capacity extending from supply regions to the citygate andor have forward purchased gas at previous and lower prices for at least some portion of their winter supplies As a result unlike in eastern markets a much larger proportion of the supply portfolio of California utilities will be exposed to the current price spikes No alternatives A lack of fuelswitching capability prevents a meaningful demand response to higher gas prices Power prices continue to move in lockstep with the increase in gas prices Not surprisingly gas prices pushed the cost of gasfired generation beyond the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions FERCs proposed price cap of per megawatthour setting the stage for a reassessment of this price limit A small and declining portion of power generators are liquid fuel capable Significantly air emissions restrictions already plaguing power markets with much higher emissions credit costs this yearwill make any further switching to liquid fuels in the crucial California market highly unlikely this winter A recent meeting of the South Coast Air Quality Management District which has jurisdiction over the Los Angeles area concluded with no relief granted to generators running short of emissions credits Market Forces Unite for Price Spikes During November The first cold weatherrelated demand spike demonstrated the combined power of these forces and the vulnerability of the western markets A cold weather system in mid November brought temperatures averaging percent colder than normalthe temperatures actually averaged percent colder than a normal January weekand provided the additional demand boost that taxed the gas delivery systems on the West Coast Capacity constraints on moving gas into California that appeared during the summer extended north into the Pacific Northwest as heating loads climbed This core demand compounded the effects of continued strong demand for gas for power generation The high power demand was the result of the intersection of the annual low point for hydroelectric generation and a series of planned and unplanned nuclear and coal power plant outages Gas demand in the US West during the last two weeks of November was boosted to approximately Bcf per day driven by heating demand increases of Bcf per day above normal levels and power plant outage related demand increases of Bcf per day These demand spikes caused buyersalready dependent on the spot marketto bid citygate prices to record high levels through the last two weeks of November and into December Since demand outstripped supply prices rose dramatically at all western price points and flows of natural gas to western markets increased over high summer levels Citygate prices surged beyond per MMBtu on daily spot markets and averaged nearly per MMBtu for December bidweek at Topock Daily spot gas prices have reflected imbalance penalty prices in many western market regions West Coast to Remain Disconnected Through the Winter Although the week of November could prove to be the peak demand week in the West this winter CERA does not expect any significant retreat in gas prices on the West Coast any time soon Storage inventories are so low that the ability to beat back demand spikes with high storage withdrawals is not an option for gas utilities Generators which already rely heavily on the spot market for supplies are faced with a bidding war for scarce supplies Colderthannormal weather would likely keep West Coast prices in the per MMBtu range More normal weather would allow a slow decline from current levels of over per MMBtu down into the per MMBtu range However the storage situation and underlying demand strength mean that any return to a lower pricing range is unlikely until early January This winter will prove a critical test for western gas markets and the end of the heating season will likely provide the first opportunity for lower price levels in the West Coast market As heating loads diminish significantly in March and storage deliverability is no longer a critical issue premiums should retreat back into the per MMBtu range As hydroelectric generation begins to increase the pressure could subside even further but storage injections during the spring shoulder season will likely limit price declines even during the spring The Unique Vulnerability of the Pacific Northwest The West Coast price pressure is not limited to California High demand in the Pacific Northwest and more indirectly in California will keep upward pressure on prices from Sumas to Stanfield Northwest pipeline capacity from the Rockies was already fully utilized at the onset of the cold weather and even so can only provide gas so far into the Pacific Northwest The combined California and Pacific Northwest demand pushed Stanfield up in spite of the limited volumes that are bidirectional there The only supply source for the load centers in southern British Columbia and even more so in northern Pacific Northwest such as Seattle are from Westcoast at Sumas The Westcoast mainline from the producing fields in Northeast British Columbia has also been operating at capacity The same bidding forces felt in California have been evident at these western Canadian price points pushing Sumas prices into the s per MMBtu These forces will persist keeping Sumas at a premium to AECO over the winterand in much closer relationship to California prices Customer Response Another Log on the Backlash Bonfire With power plants and gas utilities paying the current high spot prices consumers bills from Vancouver to San Diego will ultimately reflect these high commodity prices The gas industry has been preparing for rate shock this winter warning regulators and customers alike However the price spikes in the West and the sustained premiums in western markets move beyond alarming Capacity holders are reaping significant rewards for their investments in capacity positions resulting in a substantial transfer of wealth from consumers to capacity holders Market power and market gaming accusations that have hit the power markets will find easy application in their gas market counterpart no matter what their merits Some level of investigation into the natural gas markets during or following this challenging winter should be expected As has occurred in the power markets this will now turn attention to gas purchasing practices particularly in California The likely outcome of this process will be a shift away from the heavy reliance on spot purchases toward a more flexible portfolio approach end Follow URL for PDF version of this Alert with associated graphics Come Shoot the Rapids with us at CERAWeek Shooting the Rapids Strategies

PM on PM To cc Subject The Storm Arrives CERA Alert CERA Alert Sent Fri December Title The Storm Arrives Author N American Gas Team EMail Category Alert Product Line North American Gas URL clientnagaltnagaltabhtml Cold Weather Path Colderthannormal weather through November and forecasted cold for the first half of December throughout the Midwest and Northeast have driven gas prices well into record territory with the January Henry Hub price trading near per MMBtu and closing above on the New York Mercantile Exchange December This sixweek cold period and the quick depletion of already low storage inventories has established prices at or above CERAs cold weather path for the remainder of the winter and in all likelihood beyond If December storage withdrawals are as high as CERA now expects the gas market will remain on the cold weather path through as well even if weather returns to normal during the second half of December The enormous increase in storage injections that is likely to be required next summer would keep the pressure on gas markets throughout the year So long as weather remains cold or even normal this winter a new market dynamic is in effect in which gas prices interact more with distillate fuel oil prices rather than with those of residual fuel oil In addition gas is likely to have an increasingly direct influence on power prices in the growing number of regions in which gasfired generation is now on the margin in winter This winter the gas market is likely to rediscover for the first time in decades which end users value natural gas most highly and which ultimately do not The gas market is also rediscovering the value of firm pipeline capacity particularly into market areas Both the West Coast and the Northeast have experienced even more extreme price spikes with daily prices in both regions peaking above per MMBtu Indeed the shortage of gas in California is so acute that prices above per MMBtu have been reported If sustained these price levels will induce a political reaction that will reverberate throughout the industry Storage UpdateEven High Seems Low Panic in the market yesterday was eased somewhat as storage withdrawals for the week ending December at billion cubic feet Bcf proved to be less than expected This withdrawal was half the previous weeks rate and in CERAs view actual withdrawals for both weeks probably lie between these two readings In some cases successive weeks smooth out volatile readings in the AGA survey But even the Bcf figure though a significant retreat from the previous weeks rate is high by historical standards One would have to go back to to find a higher reading for a comparable week in the AGA survey Inventories as of the beginning of December at an estimated Bcf see Table were Bcf below the yearearlier level and this deficit is likely to increase substantially during December If weather forecasts indicating colderthannormal weather through midDecember in key heating markets hold true storage withdrawals for the month will average approximately Bcf per day This rate is an increase from CERAs normal weather estimate of Bcf per day and even this rate depends on weather returning to normal in mid December This level of withdrawals would leave only Bcf in storage on January an inventory Bcf below the yearearlier level Assuming normal weather such an inventory would place storage on track to reach a March minimum of Bcf Bcf below the record low At a US inventory level this low many storage operators would be dipping into baseload gas in order to support service even to firm gas customers Physical deliverability from storage fields will be significantly lower this year in midwinter forcing a greater reliance on pipeline gas and peaking facilities during January and February The actual reduction in field deliverability is impossible to quantify but storage inventories cannot be withdrawn at steady rates throughout the winter withdrawal rates decline with inventory as field pressure is reduced Pressure in the market will be reinforced and extended through and probably into During the past two summers high prices have been required to discourage demand and allow overall US storage injections to reach barely trillion cubic feet Tcf If normal weather holds for the remainder of this winter Tcf of injectionswhich would be nearly impossible to achievewould be required during if inventories are to recover to Tcf at peak If weather this winter is merely normal from midDecember through March going into winter next year the United States will have considerably less gas in storage Reaching even the Bcf level according to CERA estimates see Table would require an additional Bcf of injections next year and that alone would prove challenging PriceThe Cold Weather Path The weakness of storage inventories and the demand pressure in both core and power generation markets created by the cold weather have caused prices to move onto and even above CERAs cold weather path for this winter see Table Storage inventories would become perilously low if the current forecast for cold weather through midDecember proves accurate and the injections required next summer would keep pressure in the market intense For these reasons CERAs outlook for prices for January and throughout now reflects the cold weather path Prices could take an even higher path particularly if colderthannormal weather endures beyond midDecember or returns on a sustained basis in January or February Several forces that could weaken prices during will begin to enter the market during the winter but these are offset by demand volatility in the winter and the requirement to rebuild storage inventories once the winter is over Such factors include a building US supply capability growing imports softening oil prices allowing a lower floor for prices once the winter ends and potentially weakening economic growth Although the influence of these factors will increase it is unlikely to match the huge injection requirement that appears more and more certain next summer DemandThe Difficult Next Round of Switching With gas prices hitting new record highs CERA expects some additional demand to be priced out of the market Because gas has priced above residual fuel oil for most weeks since May however the easiest fuel switching in the power generation and industrial sectors has already occurred Even though gas prices are currently above the level of distillate approximately per MMBtu in New York switching from gas to distillate requires changes in longstanding consumer habit will occur only over time and is likely limited in volume Significant switching to distillate would quickly raise the price of distillate itself There are four major sources of additional demand response in industrial markets Additional switching to resid in industrial boilers The next increment of demand to come out of the market is likely to be in the industrial sector through additional fuel switching to resid and to some extent to distillate These markets will continue to show some flexibility but will not represent a large volume CERA estimates that the industrial boiler market has probably already begun to lose small amounts less than Bcf per day in switching to resid given the consistency of gas price premiums greater than per MMBtu Investment in restoring switching capability As premiums move far beyond this level industrial end users can be expected to take a closer look at reinvigorating their switching capability beyond their initial shortterm levels However such a change would require investment by industrial end users and the availability of resid in oil markets CERA estimates that with focused investment over the course of a number of months to perhaps a year switching to resid could eventually reach as high as Bcf per day There is already some movement here given the impact of high gas prices on earnings energy prices have already begun to receive management attention Switching to distillate US Department of Energy data suggest that industrial end users have a theoretical capability of switching nearly Bcf per day to distillate in the short term This switch would represent additional distillate demand of over barrels per day bd in a US market of million barrels This marginal demand would move the distillate price in tandem with gas price and any additional switching among power generators to distillate would reinforce this price correlation In addition the availability of distillate inventories on site should restrict the quick switching to short periods of time and will not offer a longterm solution to tight markets Shutting down industrial plants Also offering some flexibility is the shutdown of manufacturing plants that use gas as a feedstock The major feedstock consumers are the ammonia and methanol industries and not surprisingly given the tight margins available manufacturers of ammonia and of methanol continue to show suppressed gas demand However in the short term only a portion of ammonia production is at risk Whereas the production needs of merchant facilities along the Gulf Coast is relatively readily replaced by imports substitution becomes more difficult away from the coast because of transportation logistics and for facilities whose production is linked to valueadded fertilizer products Hence CERA still estimates that even with nonexistent margins substantial ammonia production would continue with additional losses of perhaps million cubic feet MMcf per day of potential demand in addition to the facilities that have already closed Extraordinarily high gas prices will also hasten the shuttering of North American methanol capacity putting at risk another to MMcf per day of gas demand for that sector Switching that could occur in boiler use is concentrated in the chemicals paper and refining sectors in the South and the food products sector in the Midwest Continuing feedstock losses would be concentrated in the South Central region For process users even extraordinarily high gas prices are expected to have little impact on the use of gas in the short term Energy costs are not the dominant component of production costs for these users and a physical changeover would be timeintensive and elemental in its impact on enduse product quality The NortheastCold Weather Operations Begin All of the Northeast pipelines have issued notices to customers that they either have imposed or are highly likely to need to impose transportation restrictions of various types The most common restriction is to nonprimary firm services secondary and interruptible type services which will be scheduled for the next several days on many pipelines Other pipelines have issued balancing requirements whereby receipts and deliveries must match Even hourly flow orders have also been implemented These actions are normal for winter operations when a cold period is expected Whereas the firm market for natural gas is rarely affected by these restrictions the spot market becomes much more volatile as interruptible supplies dry up The spot market primarily made up of nonfirm customers has had a dramatic reaction to the diminished availability of delivered spot gas into the market area as has been reflected by the volatility of the cash market this week The result of these restrictions of nonprimary firm services has been an expansion of basis to Henry Hub At one point gas for nextday delivery to New York traded near per MMBtu delivered although the average price was closer to These high spikes are the result of very thinly traded volumes of gas Although these restrictions will likely ease as temperatures return closer to normal CERA now expects basis into the New York citygate to average per MMBtu for December and per MMBtu for January end Follow URL for PDF version of this Alert with associated tables Come Shoot the Rapids with

to shut in operations because of high natural gas prices are nevertheless making money by selling gas futures contracts Terra Industries and Mississippi Chemical Corp became the latest companies to announce cutbacks related to current natural gas costs Iowabased Terra Industries said it had sold off a portion of its December natural gas purchases and shutdown of its Verdigis OK ammonia facility The company had previously reported that it would not operate its Bytheville AR and Beaumont TX facilities during the month of December as well In a similar maneuver Mississippi Chemical Corp a producer of nitrogen phosphorus and potassiumbased products in Mississippi Louisiana and New Mexico reported the sale of all of its natural gas futures contracts from January forward in order to take full advantage of the opportunity uncovered by soaring natural gas prices Mississippi Chemical said it expects to realize a pretax gain of million in its second fiscal quarter ending Dec from the recently sold contracts The problem lies in the fact that escalating natural gas costs are not being mimicked by chemical prices An overabundance on the market has kept chemical prices relatively low while gas prices a feedstock for some chemicals continue to climb The difference in the latest shutdowns is that the companies involved have openly announced they have sold their gas contracts off because it is more profitable than manufacturing their products said Ron Phillips of The Fertilizer Institute Duke Energys Ken Nyiri divisional director of strategic planning and research commented on Mississippi Chemicals transactions I guess they probably made about a MMBtu margin on the gas which is significantly more than they could make on the ammonia in fact they would have lost unit Their ammonia was probably costing them about ton to make with gas bought at MMBtu in November and the market today is at so basically they would break even on their ammonia production costs By selling the gas at around MMBtu they made MMBtu It was just a question of do they convert the gas to ammonia and make nothing on it or do they sell the gas and make million Michael L Bennett executive vice president of Terra said The natural gas price increase since our December requirements were purchased for Verdigris permitted us to sell a portion of those purchases and generate higher gross profits than could be realized from selling the products manufactured with the natural gas We will evaluate the economics of bringing Verdigris back to full production near the end of December when Januarys natural gas purchase commitments must be made Terra estimates the idled facilities represent and of the companys North American ammonia UAN urea and methanol manufacturing capacity respectively The production of all four chemicals are heavily dependent on natural gas Phillips said The latest data we had in October was that of the companies that we survey which is not the entire ammonia market but a good bit of it we were looking at operating rates of Currently a total of million tonsyear of ammonia production capacity is out of service out of about million tonsyear of production capacity Clearly some of these folks have been selling their gas rather than producing ammonia said Nyiri Its the prudent thing to do I think in this marketplace Buy your ammonia if you can At gas that costs you ton to make the ammonia which is more than the current market is willing to pay A spokeswoman for Mississippi Chemical said the company held on to its December gas contracts and has been operating at varied levels of capacity throughout see Daily GPI June Depending on what the gas prices are and what our product prices are around the JanuaryFebruary time frame we will make decisions then on our operations rate capacity said Melinda Hood a Mississippi Chemical spokeswoman Charles O Dunn CEO of Mississippi Chemical said We remain committed to the nitrogen business and our customers but we also have to take advantage of opportunities to optimize cash flow during these challenging times It is our belief that the current unprecedented natural gas prices are unlikely to be sustained during the intermediate term stated Dunn As a result we felt it was in the companys best interest to sell our futures positions to lock in the substantial gain afforded by the recent increase in natural gas prices Going forward we will continue to determine operating levels for our plants based on the relationship between natural gas prices nitrogen product prices and our customers requirements as we have been doing for some time International imports are also hurting US producers Currently there is a surplus of ammonia in the international market which is holding ammonia prices down US fertilizer producers cant compete with the international market Gas prices are centsMMBtu in Russia cents to MMBtu in Argentina and Venezuela and MMBtu in Trinidad The US imports million tons of ammonia each year Fertilizers represent of the demand for ammonia in the United States Terra Industries said its facilities would resume production as soon as it became economical again whether from gas prices declining or nitrogen and methanol prices rising just as long as prices reach levels allowing positive cash flows Nyiri said he believes relief is in sight He pointed out that the ammonia market has been sitting around the ton level for the last several months but believes ammonia prices will have to increase entering the next planting season Ive got my model peaking out around ton in April or May and at that time I have gas costs coming down At that point the Bcfd of demand from the fertilizer production industry should begin returning to service

Western Market Crisis Gas Joins Power CERA Alert CERA Alert Sent Fri December Title Western Market Crisis Gas Joins Power Author CERA EMail Category Alert Product Line Western Energy North American Gas URL Western Energy Members clientcealtcealtabhtml N American Gas Memeber clientnagaltnagaltabhtml Western Markets Disconnect The western energy markets are currently in a pricing crisis Power supply shortages and threats of system blackouts have resurfaced this winter in California and spiking natural gas prices have become the latest energy headache for the West Gas prices along the Pacific corridor from Kingsgate in the North to Topock in the South have jumped to over per MMBtu during December after averaging over per MMBtu through the second half of November Extreme weather strong power demand for gas and unusually low gas storage levels have combined to intensify the demand for pipeline gas and have exposed a latent capacity bottleneck in bringing gas to this far western corridor The result is prices that dramatically disconnected from the rest of the North American gas market in a way that is more typical of Northeast markets during the winter The vulnerability to additional spikes will endure as the demand drivers combined with weakened storage inventories will maintain price pressure on western price points throughout the winter However the recent jumps in western gas market differentialsto more than a per MMBtu premium to the Henry Hubshould ease somewhat with a break in the weather Under any weather scenario spikes up into the per MMBtu range will be a feature of winter markets along the West Coast On balance we expect West Coast price differentials to average at a per MMBtu premium through winter The spring hydroelectric runoff season should offer the first opportunity for a break in differentials that could drop back to more typical levels of less than per MMBtu Over the long term increased pipeline capacity and additional gas supply are needed to break the vulnerability to future West Coast price spikes However significant new capacity additions are still to months away In the meantimeparticularly this wintersustained high and volatile price differentials and extremely high absolute prices at western points are likely to draw the increased attention of state regulators and the FERC as winter heating demand exposes residential customers to the direct cost of the crisis Building Up to the Price Spike The first signs of natural gas price spikes and disconnects emerged this summer as sharp yearoveryear increases in demand pushed pipeline utilization rates to new highs As pipeline capacity constraints into California became evident differentials in Southern California moved up to a per MMBtu premium to the Henry Hub These extremely high prices as well as low forward spreads discouraged storage injections through the summer As a result a strong storage position early in the summer deteriorated rapidly from May through July In August a lateral on El Pasos southern system exploded the accident further limited pipeline capacity into California for a twoweek period During that time the market drew heavily on storage inventories and further weakened storage positions As hydroelectric generation declined through the summer the price strength extended into Northern California Malin which had been pricing near parity with the Henry hub in the summer began trading at a per MMBtu premium to the Henry Hub in September The summer and early fall market set the stage for continued and more intense spikes this winter The following factors are now driving this market Continuing surges in gas demand Gas demand levels have remained high since early summer driven by higher overall demand for electricity and lower hydroelectric output Demand levels for the third quarter in the US West averaged billion cubic feet Bcf per day up from Bcf per day during the third quarter Persistently strong gasfired generation production through the fall months diverted gas to power production frustrating efforts to fill storage This pressure will continue The yearoveryear demand increases from the power sector will be compounded as evidenced in November by swings upward in residential and commercial heating demand of million cubic feet MMcf per day Overall CERA expects nearly Bcf per day of increased demand in the West this winter with the critical California and Pacific Northwest regions showing Bcf per day of increased demand Key power sector drivers including the strong economy colder weather and lower hydroelectric generation will continue to push gasfired generation Pipeline utilization nears capacity Strong western demand for gas has pushed utilization rates on western pipes to high levels Flows from British Columbia into the Northwest pipeline have remained at high levels since summer while flows from the Rockies on Northwest have remained at pipeline capacity Flows on PGT into Kingsgate have remained at or near capacity although approximately MMcf per day of excess capacity exists on PGT into California at Malin Likewise flows out of the Rockies on Kern River pipeline have consistently remained at capacity The only slack pipeline capacity remaining for West Coast gas markets has been on Southwest pipes During the past few months these pipelines have operated at their highest utilization rates since the addition of capacity from Canada early last decade The high utilization of western pipeline capacityreminiscent of power plant capacity constraints that helped propel power prices to all time highs in the West this summerleaves very little slack capacity to provide a relief valve for demand spikes And that is exactly what has driven prices during the past few weeks see Figure Given the level of storage inventories and expected gas demand flows on the El Paso and Transwestern pipelines will have to reach even higher flow levels from December through March than they have averaged through November Deteriorating storage position At the start of November California storage inventories held at Bcf a full Bcf below the fiveyear average inventory level The strong instate withdrawals during November weakened that position to Bcf the deficit swelled to Bcf Inventories in California have never fallen below Bcf so deliverability through the end of winter is likely less than MMcf per day Storage inventories in California are so low that utilities ability to balance withdrawals from storage with purchases from demandsensitive price points is severely limited If the cold weather blast anticipated for mid December materializes this effort at balance will be even further compromised for the remainder of winter see Figure Shortterm contracting A significant amount of western gas is purchased or indexed to the spot market A shift from term contracts for both gas and pipeline capacity to spot transactionsin many cases in response to gas and power industry deregulationhas left the West much more exposed to spot market volatility In other areas of the country utilities have significant firm pipeline capacity extending from supply regions to the citygate andor have forward purchased gas at previous and lower prices for at least some portion of their winter supplies As a result unlike in eastern markets a much larger proportion of the supply portfolio of California utilities will be exposed to the current price spikes No alternatives A lack of fuelswitching capability prevents a meaningful demand response to higher gas prices Power prices continue to move in lockstep with the increase in gas prices Not surprisingly gas prices pushed the cost of gasfired generation beyond the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions FERCs proposed price cap of per megawatthour setting the stage for a reassessment of this price limit A small and declining portion of power generators are liquid fuel capable Significantly air emissions restrictions already plaguing power markets with much higher emissions credit costs this yearwill make any further switching to liquid fuels in the crucial California market highly unlikely this winter A recent meeting of the South Coast Air Quality Management District which has jurisdiction over the Los Angeles area concluded with no relief granted to generators running short of emissions credits Market Forces Unite for Price Spikes During November The first cold weatherrelated demand spike demonstrated the combined power of these forces and the vulnerability of the western markets A cold weather system in mid November brought temperatures averaging percent colder than normalthe temperatures actually averaged percent colder than a normal January weekand provided the additional demand boost that taxed the gas delivery systems on the West Coast Capacity constraints on moving gas into California that appeared during the summer extended north into the Pacific Northwest as heating loads climbed This core demand compounded the effects of continued strong demand for gas for power generation The high power demand was the result of the intersection of the annual low point for hydroelectric generation and a series of planned and unplanned nuclear and coal power plant outages Gas demand in the US West during the last two weeks of November was boosted to approximately Bcf per day driven by heating demand increases of Bcf per day above normal levels and power plant outage related demand increases of Bcf per day These demand spikes caused buyersalready dependent on the spot marketto bid citygate prices to record high levels through the last two weeks of November and into December Since demand outstripped supply prices rose dramatically at all western price points and flows of natural gas to western markets increased over high summer levels Citygate prices surged beyond per MMBtu on daily spot markets and averaged nearly per MMBtu for December bidweek at Topock Daily spot gas prices have reflected imbalance penalty prices in many western market regions West Coast to Remain Disconnected Through the Winter Although the week of November could prove to be the peak demand week in the West this winter CERA does not expect any significant retreat in gas prices on the West Coast any time soon Storage inventories are so low that the ability to beat back demand spikes with high storage withdrawals is not an option for gas utilities Generators which already rely heavily on the spot market for supplies are faced with a bidding war for scarce supplies Colderthannormal weather would likely keep West Coast prices in the per MMBtu range More normal weather would allow a slow decline from current levels of over per MMBtu down into the per MMBtu range However the storage situation and underlying demand strength mean that any return to a lower pricing range is unlikely until early January This winter will prove a critical test for western gas markets and the end of the heating season will likely provide the first opportunity for lower price levels in the West Coast market As heating loads diminish significantly in March and storage deliverability is no longer a critical issue premiums should retreat back into the per MMBtu range As hydroelectric generation begins to increase the pressure could subside even further but storage injections during the spring shoulder season will likely limit price declines even during the spring The Unique Vulnerability of the Pacific Northwest The West Coast price pressure is not limited to California High demand in the Pacific Northwest and more indirectly in California will keep upward pressure on prices from Sumas to Stanfield Northwest pipeline capacity from the Rockies was already fully utilized at the onset of the cold weather and even so can only provide gas so far into the Pacific Northwest The combined California and Pacific Northwest demand pushed Stanfield up in spite of the limited volumes that are bidirectional there The only supply source for the load centers in southern British Columbia and even more so in northern Pacific Northwest such as Seattle are from Westcoast at Sumas The Westcoast mainline from the producing fields in Northeast British Columbia has also been operating at capacity The same bidding forces felt in California have been evident at these western Canadian price points pushing Sumas prices into the s per MMBtu These forces will persist keeping Sumas at a premium to AECO over the winterand in much closer relationship to California prices Customer Response Another Log on the Backlash Bonfire With power plants and gas utilities paying the current high spot prices consumers bills from Vancouver to San Diego will ultimately reflect these high commodity prices The gas industry has been preparing for rate shock this winter warning regulators and customers alike However the price spikes in the West and the sustained premiums in western markets move beyond alarming Capacity holders are reaping significant rewards for their investments in capacity positions resulting in a substantial transfer of wealth from consumers to capacity holders Market power and market gaming accusations that have hit the power markets will find easy application in their gas market counterpart no matter what their merits Some level of investigation into the natural gas markets during or following this challenging winter should be expected As has occurred in the power markets this will now turn attention to gas purchasing practices particularly in California The likely outcome of this process will be a shift away from the heavy reliance on spot purchases toward a more flexible portfolio approach end Follow URL for PDF version of this Alert with associated graphics Come Shoot the Rapids with us at CERAWeek Shooting the Rapids Strategies

BriefingThe Pressure Cooker CERA Alert CERA Alert Sent Thu June Title Monthly BriefingThe Pressure Cooker Author N American Natural Gas Team EMail Category Alert Product Line North American Gas URL cfmtrackeprofilecfmum Pressure remains extremely strong in the United States gas market as three factorsincreasing power generation demand lower storage inventories and US wellhead supply still struggling to reboundcall into question the ability to build storage to a level adequate for next winter As strong as gas market fundamentals are gas prices are being supported also by concurrent strength in oil and liquids markets making traditional alternatives to gas much more expensive than in recent years In this environment intense competition between power generation demand and storage injections will continue throughout the summerwith pressure increasing into July as temperatures riseand gas will continue to price at the high levels necessary to discourage enduse demand The per million British thermal units MMBtu increase in gas prices since the beginning of May has already driven responses among end users First gas is now pricing at a slight premium to residual fuel oil on the East Coast and gas will likely lose approximately million cubic feet MMcf per day of demand to residual fuel oil this summer relative to last summer Second several ammonia manufacturing facilities have begun to shut down Equally telling however is that heat in any one region of the countrymost recently the Westis all that is required to sustain gas prices above at the Henry Hub despite relatively moderate temperatures elsewhere and demand reductions in industrial and other power markets Underlying pressures are such that prices are likely to rise on average from current levels as higher temperatures arrive For these reasons CERA expects prices to average at the Henry Hub during July see Table and even greater volatility is possible The intense competition and need to price out enduse demand mean that the market is vulnerable to spikes above per MMBtu amid heat waves this summer Gas StorageInjections Increase but Little Relief Yet The gas market experienced a small measure of relief in early June as storage injections finally reached a pace closer to historical averages with the American Gas Association AGA reporting billion cubic feet Bcf of injections during each of the weeks ending June and However these injections did little to reduce a deficit that is now close to Bcf on a yearoveryear basis and conditions may not again be as favorable as they have been recently for injections for many weeks or even months to come As temperatures rise through the end of the month injections are likely to slow so that for June CERA expects an average injection rate of approximately Bcf per day The deficit that stood at an estimated Bcf as of the end of May see Table on an inventory level of approximately Bcf is expected to rise slightly during June to Bcf despite a healthy injection rate for the first nine days of the month With US wellhead supply still running an estimated to Bcf per day below yearearlier levels and with added imports from Canada just offsetting this decline even the moderate demand growth expected for July relative to last July will make reducing the deficit a difficult task Each month in which this Bcf deficit carries forward increases the likelihood that inventories will be at their lowest maximum ever this October Injections like those in the recent two weeks would have to continue into July for this pattern to reverse in a significant way an unlikely event that would occur only under very mild weather conditions Regional Markets With the exception of the Rocky Mountains western differentials have been supported by waves of hot weather and extremely strong gas demand for power generation within the region This strong demand is pulling supplies from the Permian and San Juan Basins to the West Coast and has pushed up capacity utilization on the Southwest pipelines into California Prices at the California border have been particularly strong averaging over a premium to the Henry Hub so far this month Continued strong western demand looks likely to support prices within the region through July as power loads remain strong and hydroelectric output declines In addition the early heat waves have begun to erode the California storage surplus although inventories in the region as a whole remain strong see Table CERAs outlook by region follows Rockies Continuing strong supply growth and low seasonal demand have pushed up exports out of the Rocky Mountains region High utilization rates on export pipelines will keep Rocky Mountain differentials wide during the rest of the summer CERA expects an average July differential to the Henry Hub of per MMBtu San Juan The pull on supplies from California has narrowed the differential between the San Juan Basin and the Henry Hub and this West Coast pull looks likely to remain strong through the summer CERA expects a differential between the San Juan Basin and the Henry Hub of per MMBtu during July Permian and MidContinent As Texas power loads increase the competition from the West Coast and Texas markets for Permian supplies should intensify Permian differentials which have been averaging around per MMBtu to the Henry Hub should narrow CERA expects a per MMBtu differential for July MidContinent supplies should price just below Permian supplies at an per MMBtu differential to the Henry Hub Chicago Chicago differentials continue to trade around per MMBtu to the Henry Hub and although hot weather and climbing demand within the region could put some upward pressure on those differentials ample seasonal pipeline capacity into the region will limit pressure CERA expects a July differential of per MMBtu Northeast New York citygate differentials have a higher floor this summer namely higher fuel costs from the Gulf Coast as a result of gas The result has been differentials above from Transco Station but closer to from the Henry Hub As power generation load reaches its peak however differentials can rise even in summer Shortlived power load peaks may lift weekly New York differentials into the s but for the month of July CERA expects the New York differential to average Canadian MarketsDemand Still Down Canadian demand continues to be down on a yearoveryear basis Volumes on TransCanada Pipeline are MMcf below levels at this time last year and Alberta demand is MMcf below both of these reductions are primarily storage related Weak storage injections driven in large part by the lack of an adequate summerwinter price spread continue to place inventories further behind levels Although inventories are still well above the fiveyear average unless injections increase it is more likely that endofseason inventories will be comparable to the fiveyear average Bcf rather than to levels Bcf Export volumes continue to be slightly higher than last year Thus far in June flows on Northern Border Pipeline are similar to while PGE GTNW is currently operating MMcf higher Demand on the West Coast is expected to continue this trend for the summer Alberta supply build for June is likely to be flat with levels An outage pattern similar to last years has emerged TCENOVA has had maintenance projects ongoing in June but the supply reduction is primarily the result of plant turnarounds Thus far in June reductions in supply because of maintenance have been as high as MMcf but should average MMcf for the month Even though June is expected to be flat yearoveryear the fact that this maintenance reduction is less than maintenance reductions implies that a return to supply growth has not yet occurred Supply is still expected to start showing growth in the second half of the year largely in the fourth quarter as a result of the increased level of drilling The annual average supply is expected to be around MMcf per day higher than in as the result of the return to growth in Alberta and modest growth in British Columbia again primarily later in the year as well as the new production from Ft Liard that is now onstream The NYMEX and Henry Hub price strength is being felt in Canada AECO is expected to average C per gigajoule GJ US per MMBtu for June with a differential in the low USs July is expected to average C per GJ US per MMBtu The HenrytoAECO differential is likely to remain relatively high until storage injections increase the demand Follow URL for PDF version of this Monthly Briefing with associated tables end

FrontierNote I have the Western Frontier certificate filing if anyone wants to see it LB Petal Expansion ANR Lateral Extension Transcos Leidy Project OKd The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC issued several important certificates Wednesday for new gas pipeline infrastructure projects including final approvals for Transcontinental Gas Pipe Lines Leidy East expansion in Pennsylvania for a new pipeline by Petal Gas Storage in Mississippi and for an ANR lateral extension to serve to MW Badger power plant in Kenosha WI The Commission also denied rehearing of its orders granting Kern River Gas Transmission certificates to expand its system by about MMcfd Transcos million Leidy East pipe expansion project would make up for the failed Phase III portion of its MarketLink expansion The Leidy East project will provide up to Dthd of transportation from Leidy PA to northeastern markets in New Jersey New York and Pennsylvania The expansion consists of six pipeline loop segments that amount to miles of inch diameter pipe and about five miles of inch diameter pipe mostly in western Pennsylvania The project also would add hp of compression in Pennsylvania and New Jersey The Commissions authorization is being granted based on our findingsthat the proposed facilities will serve the public interest by increasing the pipeline capacity reaching the northeastern United States thereby helping to meet the rapid growth in electric generation demand in that market FERC said in its draft order Since the overwhelming majority of the proposed facilities will be constructed either entirely within or immediately adjacent to existing pipeline or utility rights of way the projects environmental impact will be minimized Finally Transcos existing customers will not subsidize the project because the expansion shippers will pay an incremental rate Transco said this summer that it expects the Leidy East facilities to be in service by November The Williams subsidiary said Aquila Energy Marketing Dthd PECO Energy Co Dthd Reliant Energy Services Dthd and Williams Energy Marketing Dthd are all customers The incremental reservation rate for service on the expanded facilities is Dthmonth The certificate granted to Petal Gas Storage LLC see related story covers a new pipeline that would extend miles to a connection with Southern Natural at a compressor station near Enterprise MS The million project also includes a new horsepower compressor station The project is designed to deliver Dthd of gas to Southern Companys gasfired generation in the Southeast ANR Pipelines lateral extension will carry about MMcfd of gas to Badger Generating Cos proposed power plant in Wisconsin The project includes miles of inch diameter looping along ANRs Racine Lateral and a mile extension of the lateral to the Badger plant The project would cost million and should be in service during the summer of In the Kern River case shippers had requested rehearing of FERCs order granting Kern authorization for its Dthd Expansion Project and an additional Dthd under its revised California Action project Shippers claimed the project would allow the sale of additional delivery point rights at the Wheeler Ridge point in Southern California causing further pro rata reductions in capacity for existing shippers and diminishing their firm rights Shippers said the Commission should subordinate the delivery point rights of expansion shippers to those of existing shippers until Southern California Gas builds enough takeaway capacity at Wheeler Ridge to accommodate the additional volumes However the Commission upheld its initial conclusion that the benefits of the project outweighed any risks of degrading delivery point rights given the critical need for expansions of pipeline capacity to serve electric and natural gas infrastructure in California Gulf South Sees Strong Interest in Billion Southeast Pipe Houstonbased Gulf South Pipeline Co LP formerly Koch Gateway Pipeline on Wednesday said the open season for the companys proposed billion Gulf Pines Pipeline was extremely successful adding that response to the Bcfd line from the Southeast markets far exceeded the companys expectations The open season concluded on Sept The proposed mile inch diameter or greater natural gas pipeline which was first announced in August is expected to originate in Mobile AL and extend through the states of Georgia South Carolina and North Carolina The open season clearly confirmed that the demand exists for a competitive alternative to serve the growing power generation commercial residential and industrial markets in the southeastern United States said Gulf South President Rolf Gafvert The Gulf Pines project would interconnect with the existing Gulf South pipeline near Mobile Bay enabling customers to access not only Mobile Bay supplies but also gas supplies from Texas and Louisiana including Venice and the Henry Hub according to Gulf South a subsidiary of EntergyKoch LP The proposed pipeline also would have access to multiple thirdparty storage facilities such as Gulf Souths facility in Bistineau LA We anticipate that the projected growth of power plants will far exceed existing pipeline capacity in the southeastern region said Gulf South spokesman Marc Palazzo In addition to serving power generation the company said Gulf Pines would extend farther east into the Carolinas than any existing interstate pipeline bringing interstate pipeline service to a region that historically has not had service before Palazzo said the project would be filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission next year He added that the actual route of the proposed pipeline is still to be determined Gulf South said the anticipated inservice date is sometime in Gulf South currently owns and operates miles of pipeline with compressor stations and major pipeline interconnects extending from South Texas through the Gulf States and into the Florida market area Williams Files to Build Mile Western Frontier Pipe Williams Gas Pipeline has filed an application for a new million pipeline that would extend from the Cheyenne hub in northern Colorado to multiple pipeline interconnections in southwestern Kansas and the panhandle of Oklahoma The Western Frontier Pipeline would consist of miles of inch diameter pipe and horsepower of compression It would transport up to Dthd of gas to markets in the Midcontinent In addition to an interconnection with the Williams Central system Western Frontier proposes access to other major Midcontinent pipelines including ANR Pipeline Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Northern Natural Gas and Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America Western Frontier also would have access to the growing Oklahoma intrastate markets via the Williams Central system The pipeline is anticipated to be in service by Nov Western Frontier Pipeline is a costeffective environmentally responsible way to transport natural gas from prolific Rockies supply basins to markets in the Midcontinent said Kim Cocklin senior vice president and general manager of Williams Central and Texas Gas systems We look forward to building this pipeline to help alleviate the current shortage of interstate pipeline capacity coming out of the region which was recently cited by the US Energy Information Administration Customers interested in Western Frontier should contact Donny King at Mark Elliott at or Dale Sanders at More information on Western Frontier is also available on the Internet at

United announced plans to buy back the of its trading and risk management arm Aquila Inc that it sold to the public earlier this year and adopt Aquila as its corporate name The move is a strategic reversal apparently prompted by the weakening economy and industry changes Executives dodged questions as to whether the move was spurred by the financial troubles at the energy industrys largest trading house Enron Corp On this busy Wednesday UtiliCorp also released its earnings and reported that it has entered into an acquisition agreement with a FirstEnergy Corp subsidiary UtiliCorp said its board of directors voted to make an exchange offer to acquire all of the outstanding publicly held common shares of its owned Aquila Inc subsidiary due to the recent significant changes in the merchant energy sector the general economy and the impact of these changes on the capital markets The most significant influence however was the realization that greater shareholder value could be obtained by recombining the financial strength of UtiliCorp with the growth opportunities that lie ahead for Aquila said Richard C Green Jr chairman and CEO of UtiliCorp With its larger asset base earnings potential and cash flow the combined company will have more efficient access to capital to execute its ambitious plans Industrywatchers questioned whether some of the spark for the recombining of the trading operation with the hardasset backed parent could have been prompted by Enrons current debacle When asked during the conference call if the Enron situation factored in the decision to combine UtiliCorp and Aquila Robert Green said The decision evolved over the recent few weeks as we evaluated the opportunities in front of Aquila and the current conditions in the capital market We effectively came to the conclusion that if we are going to put Aquila in a position to execute on these opportunities it is essential that we recombine the businesses and the balance sheets to execute on the opportunities that we see in the marketplace that are precipitated by the decline in the capital markets and the fact that the equity markets are shutdown The merchant strategy behind Aquilas rapid growth has been a key driver behind UtiliCorps achievement of aggressive earnings targets Richard Green said We decided that UtiliCorp shareholders would be better served by embracing the Aquila energy merchant strategy as the companys core strategy rather than spinning the business off as a separate entity To symbolize that change in thinking we intend to adopt Aquila as our corporate name after our exchange offer is completed The company said in its conference call that it expects to complete the reacquisition of Aquila by early January Richard Green also said he will take on a new role effective Jan initially as chairman of UtiliCorp and later of the new company that will be formed from UtiliCorp United and Aquila Inc Robert K Green president and COO of UtiliCorp will be elevated to president and CEO of the new Aquila UtiliCorp said all public Aquila shareholders will be offered shares of UtiliCorp common stock in a taxfree exchange for each outstanding share of Aquila Class A common stock Based on yesterdays closing price of per share for Aquila Class A common stock and per share for UtiliCorp common stock the offer represents a value of per Class A share of Aquila and a premium to yesterdays closing price of those shares Aquila shareholders will have the opportunity to continue to participate in Aquilas growth through their ongoing ownership of UtiliCorp shares and to receive cash dividends as UtiliCorp shareholders Richard Green said The offer requires that at least a majority of Aquilas publicly held Class A shares are tendered After successful completion of the exchange offer UtiliCorp has committed to complete a shortform merger of Aquila with a UtiliCorp subsidiary In the merger each remaining Aquila Class A share will be converted subject to the exercise of appraisal rights into the same number of shares of UtiliCorp common stock as are paid in the exchange offer UtiliCorp plans to file its offering materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission and commence the exchange offer as soon as possible Over the past year I have devoted an increasing amount of time and energy to raising other chief executives awareness of Aquilas broad capabilities Richard Green said We have a unique position in the emerging market that is being created by the convergence of the insurance capital and energy businesses combining our expertise in risk management wholesale energy structured financing generation assets and other related activities We can help clients in countless industries in ways theyve never thought of and that opportunity is largely driving this change in executive roles The company also reported Wednesday that it expects to enter into an acquisition agreement with FirstEnergy Corp under which UtiliCorp and a financial partner will purchase FirstEnergys wholly owned Avon Energy Partners Holdings subsidiary the holding company for Midlands Electricity plc Midlands Electricity is the fourthlargest regional electricity company in the United Kingdom and serves million network customers UtiliCorp said the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of after receipt of regulatory approvals In the companys conference call Robert Green said the acquisition would likely be strongly accretive in In releasing its earnings UtiliCorp followed the strong third quarter results from its Aquila subsidiary and reported earnings per share for the third quarter were up from last years third quarter after adjusting for the gain from the initial public offering of Uecomm Ltd in Australia The company posted earnings for the quarter of million a decrease from the million mark for the same quarter of UtiliCorp said energy sales for the quarter were billion up from billion during the third quarter of At Aquila we continue to see increasing client demand for our risk management solutions said Robert Green In addition our recent capacity acquisitions are performing beyond our expectations Our network businesses continue to help fuel our core growth in earnings before interest and taxes EBIT Combining that with the solid results from Aquila UtiliCorp continues to be on track to deliver at least earnings growth this year UtiliCorp CFO Dan Streek said during the conference call that the company expects EPS to be in the area of The CFO added that this far exceeds the companys growth target For guidance Streek said the combined EPS for UtiliCorp and Aquila would be around Earnings before income taxes EBIT for the quarter UtiliCorp were led by strong contributions from Aquila as well as the international business segment Aquilas operations increased from million to million net of minority interests of million in the third quarter marking a increase UtiliCorp attributed some of Aquilas growth to the fact that gas and power commodity markets are slowing down forcing Aquilas clients to focus more on risk and how they can minimize exposure As a result Aquila has seen an increase in its clientfocused businesses Additionally Aquilas December acquisition of interests in six power plants through its purchase of GPU International have provided strongerthanexpected operating results The company reported that gas trading volumes in the third quarter increased from Bcfd during the third quarter to Bcfd Power volumes increased from million MWh to million MWh EBIT from international networks increased to million from million in the third quarter excluding last years gain of million or per share from the initial public offering of Uecomm Ltd The company said EBIT from Canada and Australia increased primarily due to the full quarter contribution of electric properties in Alberta purchased on Aug and strong performance in Australia related to continued strength in the United Energy business and the addition of AlintaGas which was purchased in October In the United States UtiliCorps networks had EBIT of million in the third quarter of compared to million in the period The company said the contribution from the St Joseph Light Power division acquired at the end of was partially offset by higher operating costs

FrontierNote I have the Western Frontier certificate filing if anyone wants to see it LB Petal Expansion ANR Lateral Extension Transcos Leidy Project OKd The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC issued several important certificates Wednesday for new gas pipeline infrastructure projects including final approvals for Transcontinental Gas Pipe Lines Leidy East expansion in Pennsylvania for a new pipeline by Petal Gas Storage in Mississippi and for an ANR lateral extension to serve to MW Badger power plant in Kenosha WI The Commission also denied rehearing of its orders granting Kern River Gas Transmission certificates to expand its system by about MMcfd Transcos million Leidy East pipe expansion project would make up for the failed Phase III portion of its MarketLink expansion The Leidy East project will provide up to Dthd of transportation from Leidy PA to northeastern markets in New Jersey New York and Pennsylvania The expansion consists of six pipeline loop segments that amount to miles of inch diameter pipe and about five miles of inch diameter pipe mostly in western Pennsylvania The project also would add hp of compression in Pennsylvania and New Jersey The Commissions authorization is being granted based on our findingsthat the proposed facilities will serve the public interest by increasing the pipeline capacity reaching the northeastern United States thereby helping to meet the rapid growth in electric generation demand in that market FERC said in its draft order Since the overwhelming majority of the proposed facilities will be constructed either entirely within or immediately adjacent to existing pipeline or utility rights of way the projects environmental impact will be minimized Finally Transcos existing customers will not subsidize the project because the expansion shippers will pay an incremental rate Transco said this summer that it expects the Leidy East facilities to be in service by November The Williams subsidiary said Aquila Energy Marketing Dthd PECO Energy Co Dthd Reliant Energy Services Dthd and Williams Energy Marketing Dthd are all customers The incremental reservation rate for service on the expanded facilities is Dthmonth The certificate granted to Petal Gas Storage LLC see related story covers a new pipeline that would extend miles to a connection with Southern Natural at a compressor station near Enterprise MS The million project also includes a new horsepower compressor station The project is designed to deliver Dthd of gas to Southern Companys gasfired generation in the Southeast ANR Pipelines lateral extension will carry about MMcfd of gas to Badger Generating Cos proposed power plant in Wisconsin The project includes miles of inch diameter looping along ANRs Racine Lateral and a mile extension of the lateral to the Badger plant The project would cost million and should be in service during the summer of In the Kern River case shippers had requested rehearing of FERCs order granting Kern authorization for its Dthd Expansion Project and an additional Dthd under its revised California Action project Shippers claimed the project would allow the sale of additional delivery point rights at the Wheeler Ridge point in Southern California causing further pro rata reductions in capacity for existing shippers and diminishing their firm rights Shippers said the Commission should subordinate the delivery point rights of expansion shippers to those of existing shippers until Southern California Gas builds enough takeaway capacity at Wheeler Ridge to accommodate the additional volumes However the Commission upheld its initial conclusion that the benefits of the project outweighed any risks of degrading delivery point rights given the critical need for expansions of pipeline capacity to serve electric and natural gas infrastructure in California Gulf South Sees Strong Interest in Billion Southeast Pipe Houstonbased Gulf South Pipeline Co LP formerly Koch Gateway Pipeline on Wednesday said the open season for the companys proposed billion Gulf Pines Pipeline was extremely successful adding that response to the Bcfd line from the Southeast markets far exceeded the companys expectations The open season concluded on Sept The proposed mile inch diameter or greater natural gas pipeline which was first announced in August is expected to originate in Mobile AL and extend through the states of Georgia South Carolina and North Carolina The open season clearly confirmed that the demand exists for a competitive alternative to serve the growing power generation commercial residential and industrial markets in the southeastern United States said Gulf South President Rolf Gafvert The Gulf Pines project would interconnect with the existing Gulf South pipeline near Mobile Bay enabling customers to access not only Mobile Bay supplies but also gas supplies from Texas and Louisiana including Venice and the Henry Hub according to Gulf South a subsidiary of EntergyKoch LP The proposed pipeline also would have access to multiple thirdparty storage facilities such as Gulf Souths facility in Bistineau LA We anticipate that the projected growth of power plants will far exceed existing pipeline capacity in the southeastern region said Gulf South spokesman Marc Palazzo In addition to serving power generation the company said Gulf Pines would extend farther east into the Carolinas than any existing interstate pipeline bringing interstate pipeline service to a region that historically has not had service before Palazzo said the project would be filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission next year He added that the actual route of the proposed pipeline is still to be determined Gulf South said the anticipated inservice date is sometime in Gulf South currently owns and operates miles of pipeline with compressor stations and major pipeline interconnects extending from South Texas through the Gulf States and into the Florida market area Williams Files to Build Mile Western Frontier Pipe Williams Gas Pipeline has filed an application for a new million pipeline that would extend from the Cheyenne hub in northern Colorado to multiple pipeline interconnections in southwestern Kansas and the panhandle of Oklahoma The Western Frontier Pipeline would consist of miles of inch diameter pipe and horsepower of compression It would transport up to Dthd of gas to markets in the Midcontinent In addition to an interconnection with the Williams Central system Western Frontier proposes access to other major Midcontinent pipelines including ANR Pipeline Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Northern Natural Gas and Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America Western Frontier also would have access to the growing Oklahoma intrastate markets via the Williams Central system The pipeline is anticipated to be in service by Nov Western Frontier Pipeline is a costeffective environmentally responsible way to transport natural gas from prolific Rockies supply basins to markets in the Midcontinent said Kim Cocklin senior vice president and general manager of Williams Central and Texas Gas systems We look forward to building this pipeline to help alleviate the current shortage of interstate pipeline capacity coming out of the region which was recently cited by the US Energy Information Administration Customers interested in Western Frontier should contact Donny King at Mark Elliott at or Dale Sanders at More information on Western Frontier is also available on the Internet at

initiatives I would be happy to research further Lorna CA Gets nd Merchant Storage Project rd on the Way Setting aside vociferous local opposition from nearby property owners and a proposed denial from one of its administrative law judges ALJ the California Public Utilities Commission Thursday gave the goahead to a proposed million underground natural gas storage field near Lodi in Northern California Texasbased Western Hub Properties million Lodi storage project is designed to have Bcf of working capacity with MMcfd injection and MMcfd withdrawal capacity It includes a mile transmission pipeline that connects with Pacific Gas and Electric Cos backbone pipeline It will be the states second nonutility storage project following Wild Goose storage which went into service last year Approval of the Lodi project is effective in midJune While CPUC Commissioner Richard Bilas said he supports letting the market decide whether a project should be built and encourages competition in gas storage he cannot support allowing competitors to use regulatory loopholes to take advantage of private property owners In my view this case comes precariously close to allowing that to happen Although the Lodi project won environmental approval from an ALJ the judge recommended the project not be built because it didnt meet localneed criteria After postponing a decision on the proposed denial of the project the CPUC president and one of the other five commissioners developed an alternative that gives conditional certification to the project so it can proceed with development and construction To do so Western Hub will have to comply with all the designated environmental mitigation measures obtain adequate insurance and gain other state permits including the State Lands Commission Western Hub officials have maintained that Lodis unique geographical location with proximity to key electric generating plants will be the states only underground storage project offering fast deliverability to meet the needs of an increasingly competitive generation market In sympathizing with the local concerns regarding this project Commissioner Bilas said the opposition efforts of Lodi residents have not been wasted They highlight the need for the CPUC to continually review how its policies mesh with changing market conditions and how these interactions affect people This will continue to be a delicate balancing act The CPUC unanimous decision Bilas said attempts to make that balance Five local property owners one immediately adjacent to the proposed project traveled to San Francisco to urge the regulators to reject Western Hubs applications They called the company very arrogant in the way it treated local landowners and argued that the project would significantly adversely affect the quality of life in their community Meanwhile Western Hub is eyeing a second potential storage site near Wheeler Ridge southwest of Bakersfield It is hoping to help develop an important regional energy hub in the southern end of Californias central valley The project would be similar in size to Lodi A merchant storage field in the Wheeler Ridge area would be in close proximity to each of the four major gas pipelines in the state and to the sites for several proposed gasfired merchant power plants one of them PGE Corps La Paloma plant which began construction May will be the states largest merchant plant MW Western Hub anticipates moving through the state approval processes quicker and having the project operational in the next two to three years according to its Californiabased officials This is a storage project that is very similar to the Lodi Project said Jim Fossum Western Hub California project manager The concept of a project in the vicinity of Wheeler Ridge is being used in Westerns ongoing marketing efforts to line up customers and equity financial support but there are no specific engineering plans or draft regulatory filings in place Fossum said Western Hub owns some rights to depleted oilgas properties in the area which has a long history of fossil fuel exploration and development covering much of the th Century Were working on the engineering of it he said adding that he is not free to pinpoint precisely where the proposed site is located We have already told people that we intend to be interconnected with PGE Southern California Gas Co Kern River and Mojave pipelines he said We intend to not only provide service to the power plants in the area but to the Las Vegas area and to the power plants in Arizona Fossum said the expectation is that large customers in Nevada and Arizona could store gas in California for the peakload times when they need extra supplies take more than their normal loads off the Kern River or Mojave interstate pipeline and pay for the extra supplies out storage that would go to uses in California On a hot summer day a customer in Las Vegas may need more gas but there is no capacity available because everyone else wants it too Fossum said So the Nevada customer arranges to take extras from Shell or Chevron or one of the Californiabased customers and supply that gas back to them at Wheeler Ridge

Western Market Crisis Gas Joins Power CERA Alert CERA Alert Sent Fri December Title Western Market Crisis Gas Joins Power Author CERA EMail Category Alert Product Line Western Energy North American Gas URL Western Energy Members clientcealtcealtabhtml N American Gas Memeber clientnagaltnagaltabhtml Western Markets Disconnect The western energy markets are currently in a pricing crisis Power supply shortages and threats of system blackouts have resurfaced this winter in California and spiking natural gas prices have become the latest energy headache for the West Gas prices along the Pacific corridor from Kingsgate in the North to Topock in the South have jumped to over per MMBtu during December after averaging over per MMBtu through the second half of November Extreme weather strong power demand for gas and unusually low gas storage levels have combined to intensify the demand for pipeline gas and have exposed a latent capacity bottleneck in bringing gas to this far western corridor The result is prices that dramatically disconnected from the rest of the North American gas market in a way that is more typical of Northeast markets during the winter The vulnerability to additional spikes will endure as the demand drivers combined with weakened storage inventories will maintain price pressure on western price points throughout the winter However the recent jumps in western gas market differentialsto more than a per MMBtu premium to the Henry Hubshould ease somewhat with a break in the weather Under any weather scenario spikes up into the per MMBtu range will be a feature of winter markets along the West Coast On balance we expect West Coast price differentials to average at a per MMBtu premium through winter The spring hydroelectric runoff season should offer the first opportunity for a break in differentials that could drop back to more typical levels of less than per MMBtu Over the long term increased pipeline capacity and additional gas supply are needed to break the vulnerability to future West Coast price spikes However significant new capacity additions are still to months away In the meantimeparticularly this wintersustained high and volatile price differentials and extremely high absolute prices at western points are likely to draw the increased attention of state regulators and the FERC as winter heating demand exposes residential customers to the direct cost of the crisis Building Up to the Price Spike The first signs of natural gas price spikes and disconnects emerged this summer as sharp yearoveryear increases in demand pushed pipeline utilization rates to new highs As pipeline capacity constraints into California became evident differentials in Southern California moved up to a per MMBtu premium to the Henry Hub These extremely high prices as well as low forward spreads discouraged storage injections through the summer As a result a strong storage position early in the summer deteriorated rapidly from May through July In August a lateral on El Pasos southern system exploded the accident further limited pipeline capacity into California for a twoweek period During that time the market drew heavily on storage inventories and further weakened storage positions As hydroelectric generation declined through the summer the price strength extended into Northern California Malin which had been pricing near parity with the Henry hub in the summer began trading at a per MMBtu premium to the Henry Hub in September The summer and early fall market set the stage for continued and more intense spikes this winter The following factors are now driving this market Continuing surges in gas demand Gas demand levels have remained high since early summer driven by higher overall demand for electricity and lower hydroelectric output Demand levels for the third quarter in the US West averaged billion cubic feet Bcf per day up from Bcf per day during the third quarter Persistently strong gasfired generation production through the fall months diverted gas to power production frustrating efforts to fill storage This pressure will continue The yearoveryear demand increases from the power sector will be compounded as evidenced in November by swings upward in residential and commercial heating demand of million cubic feet MMcf per day Overall CERA expects nearly Bcf per day of increased demand in the West this winter with the critical California and Pacific Northwest regions showing Bcf per day of increased demand Key power sector drivers including the strong economy colder weather and lower hydroelectric generation will continue to push gasfired generation Pipeline utilization nears capacity Strong western demand for gas has pushed utilization rates on western pipes to high levels Flows from British Columbia into the Northwest pipeline have remained at high levels since summer while flows from the Rockies on Northwest have remained at pipeline capacity Flows on PGT into Kingsgate have remained at or near capacity although approximately MMcf per day of excess capacity exists on PGT into California at Malin Likewise flows out of the Rockies on Kern River pipeline have consistently remained at capacity The only slack pipeline capacity remaining for West Coast gas markets has been on Southwest pipes During the past few months these pipelines have operated at their highest utilization rates since the addition of capacity from Canada early last decade The high utilization of western pipeline capacityreminiscent of power plant capacity constraints that helped propel power prices to all time highs in the West this summerleaves very little slack capacity to provide a relief valve for demand spikes And that is exactly what has driven prices during the past few weeks see Figure Given the level of storage inventories and expected gas demand flows on the El Paso and Transwestern pipelines will have to reach even higher flow levels from December through March than they have averaged through November Deteriorating storage position At the start of November California storage inventories held at Bcf a full Bcf below the fiveyear average inventory level The strong instate withdrawals during November weakened that position to Bcf the deficit swelled to Bcf Inventories in California have never fallen below Bcf so deliverability through the end of winter is likely less than MMcf per day Storage inventories in California are so low that utilities ability to balance withdrawals from storage with purchases from demandsensitive price points is severely limited If the cold weather blast anticipated for mid December materializes this effort at balance will be even further compromised for the remainder of winter see Figure Shortterm contracting A significant amount of western gas is purchased or indexed to the spot market A shift from term contracts for both gas and pipeline capacity to spot transactionsin many cases in response to gas and power industry deregulationhas left the West much more exposed to spot market volatility In other areas of the country utilities have significant firm pipeline capacity extending from supply regions to the citygate andor have forward purchased gas at previous and lower prices for at least some portion of their winter supplies As a result unlike in eastern markets a much larger proportion of the supply portfolio of California utilities will be exposed to the current price spikes No alternatives A lack of fuelswitching capability prevents a meaningful demand response to higher gas prices Power prices continue to move in lockstep with the increase in gas prices Not surprisingly gas prices pushed the cost of gasfired generation beyond the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions FERCs proposed price cap of per megawatthour setting the stage for a reassessment of this price limit A small and declining portion of power generators are liquid fuel capable Significantly air emissions restrictions already plaguing power markets with much higher emissions credit costs this yearwill make any further switching to liquid fuels in the crucial California market highly unlikely this winter A recent meeting of the South Coast Air Quality Management District which has jurisdiction over the Los Angeles area concluded with no relief granted to generators running short of emissions credits Market Forces Unite for Price Spikes During November The first cold weatherrelated demand spike demonstrated the combined power of these forces and the vulnerability of the western markets A cold weather system in mid November brought temperatures averaging percent colder than normalthe temperatures actually averaged percent colder than a normal January weekand provided the additional demand boost that taxed the gas delivery systems on the West Coast Capacity constraints on moving gas into California that appeared during the summer extended north into the Pacific Northwest as heating loads climbed This core demand compounded the effects of continued strong demand for gas for power generation The high power demand was the result of the intersection of the annual low point for hydroelectric generation and a series of planned and unplanned nuclear and coal power plant outages Gas demand in the US West during the last two weeks of November was boosted to approximately Bcf per day driven by heating demand increases of Bcf per day above normal levels and power plant outage related demand increases of Bcf per day These demand spikes caused buyersalready dependent on the spot marketto bid citygate prices to record high levels through the last two weeks of November and into December Since demand outstripped supply prices rose dramatically at all western price points and flows of natural gas to western markets increased over high summer levels Citygate prices surged beyond per MMBtu on daily spot markets and averaged nearly per MMBtu for December bidweek at Topock Daily spot gas prices have reflected imbalance penalty prices in many western market regions West Coast to Remain Disconnected Through the Winter Although the week of November could prove to be the peak demand week in the West this winter CERA does not expect any significant retreat in gas prices on the West Coast any time soon Storage inventories are so low that the ability to beat back demand spikes with high storage withdrawals is not an option for gas utilities Generators which already rely heavily on the spot market for supplies are faced with a bidding war for scarce supplies Colderthannormal weather would likely keep West Coast prices in the per MMBtu range More normal weather would allow a slow decline from current levels of over per MMBtu down into the per MMBtu range However the storage situation and underlying demand strength mean that any return to a lower pricing range is unlikely until early January This winter will prove a critical test for western gas markets and the end of the heating season will likely provide the first opportunity for lower price levels in the West Coast market As heating loads diminish significantly in March and storage deliverability is no longer a critical issue premiums should retreat back into the per MMBtu range As hydroelectric generation begins to increase the pressure could subside even further but storage injections during the spring shoulder season will likely limit price declines even during the spring The Unique Vulnerability of the Pacific Northwest The West Coast price pressure is not limited to California High demand in the Pacific Northwest and more indirectly in California will keep upward pressure on prices from Sumas to Stanfield Northwest pipeline capacity from the Rockies was already fully utilized at the onset of the cold weather and even so can only provide gas so far into the Pacific Northwest The combined California and Pacific Northwest demand pushed Stanfield up in spite of the limited volumes that are bidirectional there The only supply source for the load centers in southern British Columbia and even more so in northern Pacific Northwest such as Seattle are from Westcoast at Sumas The Westcoast mainline from the producing fields in Northeast British Columbia has also been operating at capacity The same bidding forces felt in California have been evident at these western Canadian price points pushing Sumas prices into the s per MMBtu These forces will persist keeping Sumas at a premium to AECO over the winterand in much closer relationship to California prices Customer Response Another Log on the Backlash Bonfire With power plants and gas utilities paying the current high spot prices consumers bills from Vancouver to San Diego will ultimately reflect these high commodity prices The gas industry has been preparing for rate shock this winter warning regulators and customers alike However the price spikes in the West and the sustained premiums in western markets move beyond alarming Capacity holders are reaping significant rewards for their investments in capacity positions resulting in a substantial transfer of wealth from consumers to capacity holders Market power and market gaming accusations that have hit the power markets will find easy application in their gas market counterpart no matter what their merits Some level of investigation into the natural gas markets during or following this challenging winter should be expected As has occurred in the power markets this will now turn attention to gas purchasing practices particularly in California The likely outcome of this process will be a shift away from the heavy reliance on

initiatives I would be happy to research further Lorna CA Gets nd Merchant Storage Project rd on the Way Setting aside vociferous local opposition from nearby property owners and a proposed denial from one of its administrative law judges ALJ the California Public Utilities Commission Thursday gave the goahead to a proposed million underground natural gas storage field near Lodi in Northern California Texasbased Western Hub Properties million Lodi storage project is designed to have Bcf of working capacity with MMcfd injection and MMcfd withdrawal capacity It includes a mile transmission pipeline that connects with Pacific Gas and Electric Cos backbone pipeline It will be the states second nonutility storage project following Wild Goose storage which went into service last year Approval of the Lodi project is effective in midJune While CPUC Commissioner Richard Bilas said he supports letting the market decide whether a project should be built and encourages competition in gas storage he cannot support allowing competitors to use regulatory loopholes to take advantage of private property owners In my view this case comes precariously close to allowing that to happen Although the Lodi project won environmental approval from an ALJ the judge recommended the project not be built because it didnt meet localneed criteria After postponing a decision on the proposed denial of the project the CPUC president and one of the other five commissioners developed an alternative that gives conditional certification to the project so it can proceed with development and construction To do so Western Hub will have to comply with all the designated environmental mitigation measures obtain adequate insurance and gain other state permits including the State Lands Commission Western Hub officials have maintained that Lodis unique geographical location with proximity to key electric generating plants will be the states only underground storage project offering fast deliverability to meet the needs of an increasingly competitive generation market In sympathizing with the local concerns regarding this project Commissioner Bilas said the opposition efforts of Lodi residents have not been wasted They highlight the need for the CPUC to continually review how its policies mesh with changing market conditions and how these interactions affect people This will continue to be a delicate balancing act The CPUC unanimous decision Bilas said attempts to make that balance Five local property owners one immediately adjacent to the proposed project traveled to San Francisco to urge the regulators to reject Western Hubs applications They called the company very arrogant in the way it treated local landowners and argued that the project would significantly adversely affect the quality of life in their community Meanwhile Western Hub is eyeing a second potential storage site near Wheeler Ridge southwest of Bakersfield It is hoping to help develop an important regional energy hub in the southern end of Californias central valley The project would be similar in size to Lodi A merchant storage field in the Wheeler Ridge area would be in close proximity to each of the four major gas pipelines in the state and to the sites for several proposed gasfired merchant power plants one of them PGE Corps La Paloma plant which began construction May will be the states largest merchant plant MW Western Hub anticipates moving through the state approval processes quicker and having the project operational in the next two to three years according to its Californiabased officials This is a storage project that is very similar to the Lodi Project said Jim Fossum Western Hub California project manager The concept of a project in the vicinity of Wheeler Ridge is being used in Westerns ongoing marketing efforts to line up customers and equity financial support but there are no specific engineering plans or draft regulatory filings in place Fossum said Western Hub owns some rights to depleted oilgas properties in the area which has a long history of fossil fuel exploration and development covering much of the th Century Were working on the engineering of it he said adding that he is not free to pinpoint precisely where the proposed site is located We have already told people that we intend to be interconnected with PGE Southern California Gas Co Kern River and Mojave pipelines he said We intend to not only provide service to the power plants in the area but to the Las Vegas area and to the power plants in Arizona Fossum said the expectation is that large customers in Nevada and Arizona could store gas in California for the peakload times when they need extra supplies take more than their normal loads off the Kern River or Mojave interstate pipeline and pay for the extra supplies out storage that would go to uses in California On a hot summer day a customer in Las Vegas may need more gas but there is no capacity available because everyone else wants it too Fossum said So the Nevada customer arranges to take extras from Shell or Chevron or one of the Californiabased customers and supply that gas back to them at Wheeler Ridge

Gas URL Western Energy Members clientcealtcealtabhtml N American Gas Memeber clientnagaltnagaltabhtml Western Markets Disconnect The western energy markets are currently in a pricing crisis Power supply shortages and threats of system blackouts have resurfaced this winter in California and spiking natural gas prices have become the latest energy headache for the West Gas prices along the Pacific corridor from Kingsgate in the North to Topock in the South have jumped to over per MMBtu during December after averaging over per MMBtu through the second half of November Extreme weather strong power demand for gas and unusually low gas storage levels have combined to intensify the demand for pipeline gas and have exposed a latent capacity bottleneck in bringing gas to this far

wintersustained high and volatile price differentials and extremely high absolute prices at western points are likely to draw the increased attention of state regulators and the FERC as winter heating demand exposes residential customers to the direct cost of the crisis Building Up to the Price Spike The first signs of natural gas price spikes and disconnects emerged this summer as sharp yearoveryear increases in demand pushed pipeline utilization rates to new highs As pipeline capacity constraints into California became evident differentials in Southern California moved up to a per MMBtu premium to the Henry Hub These extremely high prices as well as low forward spreads discouraged storage injections through the summer As a result a strong storage position early in the summer deteriorated rapidly from May through July In August a lateral on El Pasos southern system exploded the accident further limited pipeline capacity into California for a twoweek period During that time the market drew heavily on storage inventories and further weakened storage positions As hydroelectric generation declined through the summer the price strength extended into Northern California Malin which had been pricing near parity with the Henry hub in the summer began trading at a per MMBtu premium to the Henry Hub in September The summer and early fall market set the stage for continued and more intense spikes this winter The following factors are now driving this market Continuing surges in gas demand Gas demand levels have remained high since early summer driven by higher overall demand for electricity and lower hydroelectric output Demand levels for the third quarter in the US West averaged billion cubic feet Bcf per day up from Bcf per day during the third quarter Persistently strong gasfired generation production through the fall months diverted gas to power production frustrating efforts to fill storage This pressure will continue The yearoveryear demand increases from the power sector will be compounded as evidenced in November by swings upward in residential and commercial heating demand of million cubic feet MMcf per day Overall CERA expects nearly Bcf per day of increased demand in the West this winter with the critical California and Pacific Northwest regions showing Bcf per day of increased demand Key power sector drivers including the strong economy colder weather and lower hydroelectric generation will continue to push gasfired generation Pipeline utilization nears capacity Strong western demand for gas has pushed utilization rates on western pipes to high levels Flows from British Columbia into the Northwest pipeline have remained at high levels since summer while flows from the Rockies on Northwest have remained at pipeline capacity Flows on PGT into Kingsgate have remained at or near capacity although approximately MMcf per day of excess capacity exists on PGT into California at Malin Likewise flows out of the Rockies on Kern River pipeline have consistently remained at capacity The only slack pipeline capacity remaining for West Coast gas markets has been on Southwest pipes During the past few months these pipelines have operated at their highest utilization rates since the addition of capacity from Canada early last decade The high utilization of western pipeline capacityreminiscent of power plant capacity constraints that helped propel power prices to all time highs in the West this summerleaves very little slack capacity to provide a relief valve for demand spikes And that is exactly what has driven prices during the past few weeks see Figure Given the level of storage inventories and expected gas demand flows on the El Paso and Transwestern pipelines will have to reach even higher flow levels from December through March than they have averaged through November Deteriorating storage position At the start of November California storage inventories held at Bcf a full Bcf below the fiveyear average inventory level The strong instate withdrawals during November weakened that position to Bcf the deficit swelled to Bcf Inventories in California have never fallen below Bcf so deliverability through the end of winter is likely less than MMcf per day Storage inventories in California are so low that utilities ability to balance withdrawals from storage with purchases from

see Figure Shortterm contracting A significant amount of western gas is purchased or indexed to the spot market A shift from term contracts for both gas and pipeline capacity to spot transactionsin many cases in response to gas and power industry deregulationhas left the West much more exposed to spot market volatility In other areas of the country utilities have significant firm pipeline capacity extending from supply regions to the citygate andor have forward purchased gas at previous and lower prices for at least some portion of their winter supplies As a result unlike in eastern markets a much larger proportion of the supply portfolio of California utilities will be exposed to the current price spikes No alternatives A lack of fuelswitching capability prevents a meaningful demand response to higher gas prices Power prices continue to move in lockstep with the increase in gas prices Not surprisingly gas prices pushed the cost of gasfired generation beyond the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions FERCs proposed price cap of per megawatthour setting the stage for a reassessment of this price limit A small and declining portion of power generators are liquid fuel capable Significantly air emissions restrictions already plaguing power markets with much higher emissions credit costs this yearwill make any further switching to liquid fuels in the crucial California market highly unlikely this winter A recent meeting of the South Coast Air Quality Management District which has jurisdiction over the Los Angeles area concluded with no relief granted to generators running short of emissions credits Market Forces Unite for Price Spikes During November The first cold weatherrelated demand spike demonstrated the combined power of these forces and the vulnerability of the western markets A cold weather system in mid November brought temperatures averaging percent colder than normalthe temperatures actually averaged percent colder than a normal January weekand provided the additional demand boost that taxed the gas delivery systems on the West Coast Capacity constraints on moving gas into California that appeared during the summer extended north into the Pacific Northwest as heating loads climbed This core demand compounded the effects of continued strong demand for gas for power generation The high power demand was the result of the intersection of the annual low point for hydroelectric generation and a series of planned and unplanned nuclear and coal power plant outages Gas demand in the US West during the last two weeks of November was boosted to approximately Bcf per day driven by heating demand increases of Bcf per day above normal levels and power plant outage related demand increases of Bcf per day These demand spikes caused buyersalready dependent on the spot marketto bid citygate prices to record high levels through the last two weeks of November and into December Since demand outstripped supply prices rose dramatically at all western price points and flows of natural gas to western markets increased over high summer levels Citygate prices surged beyond per MMBtu on daily spot markets and averaged

demand response to higher gas prices Power prices continue to move in lockstep with the increase in gas prices Not surprisingly gas prices pushed the cost of gasfired generation beyond the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions FERCs proposed price cap of per megawatthour setting the stage for a reassessment of this price limit A small and declining portion of power generators are liquid fuel capable Significantly air emissions restrictions already plaguing power markets with much higher emissions credit costs this yearwill make any further switching to liquid fuels in the crucial California market highly unlikely this winter A recent meeting of the South Coast Air Quality Management District which has jurisdiction over the Los Angeles area concluded with no relief granted to generators running short of emissions credits Market Forces Unite for Price Spikes During November The first cold weatherrelated demand spike demonstrated the combined power of these forces and the vulnerability of the western markets A cold weather system in mid November brought temperatures averaging percent colder than normalthe temperatures actually averaged percent colder than a normal January weekand provided the additional demand boost that taxed the gas delivery systems on the West Coast Capacity constraints on moving gas into California that appeared during the summer extended north into the Pacific Northwest as heating loads climbed This core demand compounded the effects of continued strong demand for gas for power generation The high power demand was the result of the intersection of the annual low point for hydroelectric generation and a series of planned and unplanned nuclear and coal power plant outages Gas demand in the US West during the last two weeks of November was boosted to approximately Bcf per day driven by heating demand increases of Bcf per day above normal levels and power plant outage related demand increases of Bcf per day These demand spikes caused buyersalready dependent on the spot marketto bid citygate prices to record high levels through the last two weeks of November and into December Since demand outstripped supply prices rose dramatically at all western price points and flows of natural gas to western markets increased over high summer levels Citygate prices surged beyond per MMBtu on daily spot markets and averaged nearly per MMBtu for December bidweek at Topock Daily spot gas prices have reflected imbalance penalty prices in many western market regions West Coast to Remain Disconnected Through the Winter Although the week of November could prove to be the peak demand week in the West this winter CERA does not expect any significant retreat in gas prices on the West Coast any time soon Storage inventories are so low that the ability to beat back demand spikes with high storage withdrawals is not an option for gas utilities Generators which already rely heavily on the spot market for supplies are faced with a bidding war for scarce supplies Colderthannormal weather would likely keep West Coast prices in the per MMBtu range More normal weather would allow a slow decline from current levels of over per MMBtu down into the per MMBtu range However the storage situation and underlying demand strength mean that any return to a lower pricing range is unlikely until early January This winter will prove a critical test for western gas markets and the end of the heating season will likely provide the first opportunity for lower price levels in the West Coast market As heating loads diminish significantly in March and storage deliverability is no longer a critical issue premiums should retreat back into the per MMBtu range As hydroelectric generation begins to increase the pressure could subside even further but storage injections during the spring shoulder season will likely limit price declines even during the spring The Unique Vulnerability of the Pacific Northwest The West Coast price pressure is not limited to California High demand in the Pacific Northwest and more indirectly in California will keep upward pressure on prices from Sumas to Stanfield Northwest pipeline capacity from the Rockies was already fully utilized at the onset of the cold weather and even so can only provide gas so far into the Pacific Northwest The combined California and Pacific Northwest demand pushed Stanfield up in spite of the limited volumes that are bidirectional there The only supply source for the load centers in southern British Columbia and even more so in northern Pacific Northwest such as Seattle are from Westcoast at Sumas The Westcoast mainline from the producing fields in Northeast British Columbia has also been operating at capacity The same bidding forces felt in California have been evident at these western Canadian price points pushing Sumas prices into the s per MMBtu These forces will persist keeping Sumas at a premium to AECO over the winterand in much closer relationship to California prices Customer Response Another Log on the Backlash Bonfire With power plants and gas utilities paying the current high spot prices consumers bills from Vancouver to San Diego will ultimately reflect these high commodity prices The gas industry has been preparing for rate shock this winter warning regulators and customers alike However the price spikes in the West and the sustained premiums in western markets move beyond alarming Capacity holders are reaping significant rewards for their investments in capacity positions resulting in a substantial transfer of wealth from consumers to capacity holders Market power and market gaming accusations that have hit the power markets will find easy application in their gas market counterpart no matter what their merits Some level of investigation into the natural gas markets during or following this challenging winter should be expected As has occurred in the power markets this will now turn attention to gas purchasing practices particularly in California The likely outcome of this process will be a shift away from the heavy reliance on spot purchases toward a more flexible portfolio approach end Follow URL for PDF version of this Alert with associated graphics Come Shoot the Rapids with us at CERAWeek Shooting the Rapids Strategies

FrontierNote I have the Western Frontier certificate filing if anyone wants to see it LB Petal Expansion ANR Lateral Extension Transcos Leidy Project OKd The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC issued several important certificates Wednesday for new gas pipeline infrastructure projects including final approvals for Transcontinental Gas Pipe Lines Leidy East expansion in Pennsylvania for a new pipeline by Petal Gas Storage in Mississippi and for an ANR lateral extension to serve to MW Badger power plant in Kenosha WI The Commission also denied rehearing of its orders granting Kern River Gas Transmission certificates to expand its system by about MMcfd Transcos million Leidy East pipe expansion project would make up for the failed Phase III portion of its MarketLink expansion The Leidy East project will provide up to Dthd of transportation from Leidy PA to northeastern markets in New Jersey New York and Pennsylvania The expansion consists of six pipeline loop segments that amount to miles of inch diameter pipe and about five miles of inch diameter pipe mostly in western Pennsylvania The project also would add hp of compression in Pennsylvania and New Jersey The Commissions authorization is being granted based on our findingsthat the proposed facilities will serve the public interest by increasing the pipeline capacity reaching the northeastern United States thereby helping to meet the rapid growth in electric generation demand in that market FERC said in its draft order Since the overwhelming majority of the proposed facilities will be constructed either entirely within or immediately adjacent to existing pipeline or utility rights of way the projects environmental impact will be minimized Finally Transcos existing customers will not subsidize the project because the expansion shippers will pay an incremental rate Transco said this summer that it expects the Leidy East facilities to be in service by November The Williams subsidiary said Aquila Energy Marketing Dthd PECO Energy Co Dthd Reliant Energy Services Dthd and Williams Energy Marketing Dthd are all customers The incremental reservation rate for service on the expanded facilities is Dthmonth The certificate granted to Petal Gas Storage LLC see related story covers a new pipeline that would extend miles to a connection with Southern Natural at a compressor station near Enterprise MS The million project also includes a new horsepower compressor station The project is designed to deliver Dthd of gas to Southern Companys gasfired generation in the Southeast ANR Pipelines lateral extension will carry about MMcfd of gas to Badger Generating Cos proposed power plant in Wisconsin The project includes miles of inch diameter looping along ANRs Racine Lateral and a mile extension of the lateral to the Badger plant The project would cost million and should be in service during the summer of In the Kern River case shippers had requested rehearing of FERCs order granting Kern authorization for its Dthd Expansion Project and an additional Dthd under its revised California Action project Shippers claimed the project would allow the sale of additional delivery point rights at the Wheeler Ridge point in Southern California causing further pro rata reductions in capacity for existing shippers and diminishing their firm rights Shippers said the Commission should subordinate the delivery point rights of expansion shippers to those of existing shippers until Southern California Gas builds enough takeaway capacity at Wheeler Ridge to accommodate the additional volumes However the Commission upheld its initial conclusion that the benefits of the project outweighed any risks of degrading delivery point rights given the critical need for expansions of pipeline capacity to serve electric and natural gas infrastructure in California Gulf South Sees Strong Interest in Billion Southeast Pipe Houstonbased Gulf South Pipeline Co LP formerly Koch Gateway Pipeline on Wednesday said the open season for the companys proposed billion Gulf Pines Pipeline was extremely successful adding that response to the Bcfd line from the Southeast markets far exceeded the companys expectations The open season concluded on Sept The proposed mile inch diameter or greater natural gas pipeline which was first announced in August is expected to originate in Mobile AL and extend through the states of Georgia South Carolina and North Carolina The open season clearly confirmed that the demand exists for a competitive alternative to serve the growing power generation commercial residential and industrial markets in the southeastern United States said Gulf South President Rolf Gafvert The Gulf Pines project would interconnect with the existing Gulf South pipeline near Mobile Bay enabling customers to access not only Mobile Bay supplies but also gas supplies from Texas and Louisiana including Venice and the Henry Hub according to Gulf South a subsidiary of EntergyKoch LP The proposed pipeline also would have access to multiple thirdparty storage facilities such as Gulf Souths facility in Bistineau LA We anticipate that the projected growth of power plants will far exceed existing pipeline capacity in the southeastern region said Gulf South spokesman Marc Palazzo In addition to serving power generation the company said Gulf Pines would extend farther east into the Carolinas than any existing interstate pipeline bringing interstate pipeline service to a region that historically has not had service before Palazzo said the project would be filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission next year He added that the actual route of the proposed pipeline is still to be determined Gulf South said the anticipated inservice date is sometime in Gulf South currently owns and operates miles of pipeline with compressor stations and major pipeline interconnects extending from South Texas through the Gulf States and into the Florida market area Williams Files to Build Mile Western Frontier Pipe Williams Gas Pipeline has filed an application for a new million pipeline that would extend from the Cheyenne hub in northern Colorado to multiple pipeline interconnections in southwestern Kansas and the panhandle of Oklahoma The Western Frontier Pipeline would consist of miles of inch diameter pipe and horsepower of compression It would transport up to Dthd of gas to markets in the Midcontinent In addition to an interconnection with the Williams Central system Western Frontier proposes access to other major Midcontinent pipelines including ANR Pipeline Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Northern Natural Gas and Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America Western Frontier also would have access to the growing Oklahoma intrastate markets via the Williams Central system The pipeline is anticipated to be in service by Nov Western Frontier Pipeline is a costeffective environmentally responsible way to transport natural gas from prolific Rockies supply basins to markets in the Midcontinent said Kim Cocklin senior vice president and general manager of Williams Central and Texas Gas systems We look forward to building this pipeline to help alleviate the current shortage of interstate pipeline capacity coming out of the region which was recently cited by the US Energy Information Administration Customers interested in Western Frontier should contact Donny King at Mark Elliott at or Dale Sanders at More information on Western Frontier is also available on the Internet at

Westpath Expansion plans filed at NEB TransCanada Plans Export Capacity Additions While it will take another two years for a Mackenzie Valley production and pipeline project to come together there are signs that a safety margin is developing in Canadian natural gas supplies Western Canadas established heavily exploited gas fields can still deliver production growth for years to come the National Energy Board has been told TransCanada PipeLines Ltd delivered the reassuring word in an application for a year expansion program dedicated primarily to increasing exports to California and the northwestern United States TransCanada predicted that production from the western provinces can rise by about to a sustained rate of Bcfd until at least Titled the Westpath Expansion TransCanadas proposal calls for million in new facilities to raise capacity on its British Columbia System by MMcfd or to about Bcfd The route crosses southeastern BC from the Alberta boundary to an export point on the US border where it fills PGE Gas Transmission Along with US traders and power generators customers lined up for the added service include Vancouver distributor BC Gas Utility Ltd and Powerex Corp a subsidiary of BC Hydro that procures fuel for gasfired power stations TransCanada told the NEB that it also expects to file a further expansion proposal in secondquarter for the BC System The agenda matches growth under way on PGE TransCanada acknowledges that its forecast of supplies from the western provinces is more optimistic than the current expectations of the NEB the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board and the Canadian Gas Potential Committee The pipeline company said its information goes beyond official public records to include confidential data from customers its own proprietary studies and updated information on results of last years boom in gas drilling The pipeline has told the NEB that with continued demand growth the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin should be able to support increasing levels of gas deliveries of up to Bcfd at least through this decade Production from Alberta BC and Saskatchewan averaged an estimated Bcfd in TransCanada also predicts that unconventional gas chiefly coalbed methane and possibly reserves in tight or difficult geological formations will enter production by about and eventually reach Bcfd But the pipeline projection acknowledges most tight gas is not currently considered economically available within the forecast horizon to the year and current technological assumptions At the same time TransCanada said there is also great uncertainty in predicting gas production from coal deposits because there is none yet in Canada In the absence of a performance record to guide reserves and production projections the pipeline says only that if research and development and economics lead to successful commercial operations these sources may start contributing supply this decade In a separate toll case before the NEB TransCanada predicts it will be before northern gas from either the Northwest Territories or Alaska begins to flow south An announcement Jan by the Mackenzie Delta Producers Group and the Mackenzie Valley Aboriginal Pipeline Corp suggested that TransCanadas educated guesswork is on the money After nearly two years of preliminary feasibility studies and consultations with northern communities the group Imperial Oil Conoco Canada Shell Canada and ExxonMobil Canada declared intentions to go ahead on a second planning stage Next comes the project definition phase or million in technical environmental commercial and consultation work required to make regulatory applications for field gasgathering and pipeline facilities Conoco predicted the package will be completed and placed before Canadian authorities in The group says it intends to tap Arctic discoveries called Taglu Parsons Lake and Niglintgak to send Bcfd south to northwestern Alberta The plan calls for the gas to finish its trip to markets via spare capacity on TransCanadas system TransCanada is in step with the groups expectations in suggesting it will take five years beyond to collect approvals and build the project The pipeline companys forecast suggests northern production will arrive gradually going from a starting rate at MMcfd in to MMcfd in Bcfd in Bcfd in and Bcfd by The new forecast still does not predict which northern gas will flow however As a partner in the reborn Alaskan Northwest Natural Gas Transportation Co TransCanada is teamed up with eight other companies to revive the Alaska Highway pipeline route worked out in the s for production from Prudhoe Bay In the documents before the NEB TransCanada says it recognizes various uncertainties with respect to northern gas supply regarding economics timing routing and scope Its unclear as to which pipeline will be successful in attracting northern gas

Transwestern Pipeline executive yesterday dismissed allegations that the pipeline withheld firm transportation capacity bound for California from its recourserate shippers last winter in order to free up more capacity for contracts at substantially higher negotiated rates Mary Kay Miller vice president of rates and certificates acknowledged Transwestern may have had discussions and exchanged faxes prior to posting its available capacity with two shippers Sempra Energy and Richardson Products II Ltd that subsequently entered into negotiatedrate transactions But she stressed that requests for capacity by Sempra Energy and Richardson were considered moot by the pipeline until after the available operational capacity was posted Even if they would have senta fax the day before capacity became available it would have been irrelevant because there was no capacity posted at that time said Miller Capacity requests that came in prior to Jan the day that available capacity was posted for February contracts on Transwestern were null and void The only relevant ones were those that Transwestern received on or after Jan she noted Miller spent much of Wednesday on the stand being quizzed by lawyers for FERC and producers about Transwesterns methods for notifying customers about available capacity the manner in which it chooses winning bids and about its preposting contacts with Sempra Energy and Richardson It was the first day of a FERC hearing exploring charges that Transwestern exercised market power in awarding negotiatedrate contracts that led to shippers being charged as much as MMBtu last February far in excess of the pipelines maximum allowed rate of centsMMBtu for firm transportation service to the California border The Commission proceeding yesterday focused on four negotiatedrate contracts of Sempra Energy and Richardson for a total MMBtud of service on Transwestern during February and March Richardson and Sempra clearly did not have any deal entitling them to the posted capacity before it was posted Miller said in prepared rebuttal testimony The two companies had the right to the capacity only after they submitted their bids after the posting period ended after Transwestern determined that no other bids were submitted and after a contract was agreed upon between Transwestern Richardson or Sempra she noted Despite claims made by FERC energy industry analyst Barry E Sullivan to the contrary Transwestern did not withhold capacity that otherwise could have been made available under recourse rates in order to make the capacity available under substantially higher negotiated rates Miller testified Sullivan an analyst in the FERC Office of Markets Tariffs and Rates OMTR Division of Litigation contends that Transwestern threatened to withhold capacity unless shippers agreed to negotiated rates In fact he believes the preposting discussions between Transwestern and shippers were intended to raise doubts about the availability of capacity at the maximum recourse rate so that shippers might be more willing to enter into negotiatedrate contracts above the recourse rate in the hope of securing some of the capacity if and when it became available But Miller counters that Sullivan offers not support for his claim She noted that even Sempra Energy and Richardson in response to a data request by Southern California Edison support Transwesterns claims Both companies replied no when asked whether any employee of Transwestern or any Transwestern affiliate ever indicated at any time that Transwestern would not provide the capacity at the maximum tariff rate The capacity at issue was offered on Transwesterns web site at the recourse rate in the exact same manner that all other capacity is offered on Transwesterns web site at the recourse rate there was no prohibition restrictions limitation condition or suggestion that a potential shipper could not bid for the capacity at the recourse rate and any potential shipper including Richardson or Sempra could have submitted a bid for the capacity at the recourse rate Sullivan contends that Transwesterns motive for allegedly advancing negotiatedrate transactions at the expense of recourserate deals was pure profit Under questioning by Thomas J Burgess of FERCs OMTR Miller conceded that Transwestern earned million from Sempra Energys contract in March million from Richardsons March contract and a comparable amount from Richardsons February contract She noted the pipeline received a substantially higher amount as a result of Sempras February contract but she didnt provide an exact figure FERCs Sullivan estimated the pipelines profit from the Sempra February contract was more than million Sullivan said that much of the profits that wound up in Transwesterns coffers would have gone to Sempra Energy and Richardson if they have been able to acquire the capacity at recourse rates But Miller countered that the Commissions negotiatedrate policy does not require a minimum level of profit to shippers or contemplate any hindsight analysis of whether shippers could have gotten a better deal or made more profits Furthermore she said the Transwestern case shouldnt be used to consider changes to the negotiatedrate policy as Sullivan has suggested This case is the wrong forum for such an issue because modifying the negotiatedrate policy should only be done on an industrywide basis so no pipeline or group of pipeline customers is competitively disadvantaged

Doing the Deal Dynegy CEO Chuck Watson told the investment community Monday that he was sure that the riskreward ratio in the planned merger with Enron Corp made it clearly worth doing the deal because the issues that decimated the former market leader were with its noncore businesses Explaining that his team had adequately bracketed the downside as the deal fell together over the past few weeks Watson said he could not be positive but noted that the upside was substantial and said he had a good deal of confidencethat well be absolutely fine here Dynegy which announced a billion cash stock and debt deal with its downtown Houston rival on Friday night joined with Enron executives including Chairman Kenneth Lay on Monday to answer as many questions as they could in about minutes If all goes to plan the two companies would become Dynegy Inc by the third quarter of the clear leader in natural gas and power marketing In the second quarter Enron and Dynegy combined sold a total of Bcfd of gas which represented of the volumes sold by the top gas marketers in North America Bcfd according to a ranking by NGI Enron was the top gas marketer with Bcfd and Dynegy was No with Bcfd Statistics provided by Marylandbased Energy Performance Review EPR show that Enron and Dynegy combined sold million kWh of power in the second quarter That total represented of the power sold by the top largest power marketers million kWh according to EPR Enron was in fifth place among power marketers with million kWh sold while Dynegy was in sixth place with million kWh The blending of the two will not come without challenges but Watson stressed he expects to see more opportunities than problems The opportunity appears to have come none too soon for Enron Greg Whalley Enrons president and a future member of Dynegys executive team confirmed that without some kind of equity investment in the company the once market leader probably could not have sustained its liquidity through the rest of this year We definitely needed to raise some type of equity capital said Whalley Under normal market conditions we would have had adequate liquidity This was not normal for Enron We would not have had liquidity to the end of the year Asked about asset sales in anticipation of meeting federal requirements to merge executives acknowledged there would be some but did not elaborate Whalley said that from an Enron perspective we have not spent a lot of time with Dynegy people to agree on a plan Chuck Watson has to clear what is core to Dynegy There are several assets for consideration to sell on the list Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay who will not be part of the management team but may hold a place on the Dynegy board of directors added that Enron already has billion in sales under contract all expected to close by the end of We also have three other significant international assets under contract said Lay referring to the among other things the Dabhol power plant in India Once the merger of Dynegy with Enron is successfully completed the new Dynegy will become the primary market player in all markets but there will be a significant difference in how the company moves forward noted Dynegy CFO Rob Doty Enrons financialbacked trading strategy will merge with the strong asset base of Dynegys Dynegy has protected itself on the downside however The deal includes an out for Dynegy if Enrons legal liabilities exceed billion Asked about the possibility that some of Enrons marketing and trading team may desert the company for another company Watson stressing that teamwork will be the guiding force going forward said if I were in this industry this is the combination Id work for This is an exciting day here Its been an exciting couple of weeks creating a platform for something really special in the future Enrons Whalley said that he believes the company will keep most of its team intact Theyre accustomed to being part of a winning deal he said and going forward they will be very pleased with the additional infusion of equity and the stability in the marketplace As of Monday morning Whalley said that activity looks pretty good and said there had been a positive reception to the merger Right now people are pleased with the introduction of new liquidity and really want to go about establishing or reestablishing the energy franchise Dynegy President Steve Bergstrom agreed Most traders want to be part of a winning team This is a combination that will be a winning team We have similar issues there as well The A players will stay around to be part of the winning team Bergstrom explained that when the merger is complete the new Dynegy will become the primary player in all markets He said Dynegy has a more assetbacked strategy adding that he has said before that you can only have one market maker and Enron clearly was it By combining the two companies there will be a blend of Dynegys asset strategy with Enrons financial skill set giving the new entity more liquidity marketmaking than Dynegy itself has historically done Added Watson both companies had a successful ratio and nothing is going to change thereIm a strong believer in teams and the team concept I dont want to see individuals do well if the company doesnt do well It will be imbedded in the whole company Ben Schlesinger whose company Schlesinger Associates analyzes the energy industry said Monday that the big problem in the merger is whether these two companies are able to pull togetherto harness whats there He said the two parties are clearly leaders but theoretically they will have to streamline their operations Both books are fairly strong he said and once their efficiencies are put together the new company will offer stable returns In the very short term however Schlesinger said there will be moves to other traders Other analysts also seemed to be throwing support behind the merger UBS Warburg reiterated its strong buy rating on Dynegy noting that if successfully executed this transaction would yield the most widely recognized respected and downright credible wholesaleretail energy merchant in the world However UBS warned that Dynegy still faces a daunting task in merging the operations and employees We are not naive in underestimating the enormous challenge at hand In the nearterm Enron must remain highly liquid investment grade and its employees must remain focused on keeping its core wholesaleretail franchises up and running Merrill Lynchs Donato Eassey reiterated the buy on Dynegy and moving to no opinion on Enron He said Dynegy has all the necessary skill sets and as importantly the financial stability resources and investor confidence and experience to get the job doneEnrons unparalleled online trading business should translate to significant prospects for the new Dynegy Curt Launer an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston added that despite the size of the new company we do not expect major divestitures or closing issues because of the lack of asset concentration and the inherent competitiveness of the natural gas and power marketing business He noted too that with the combination we have modeled a merchant unit that does less business because of cross trading between them and some expectation of a loss of market share Still Launer said Dynegy would become a formidable competitor benefiting from a market share in excess of of US natural gas and power trading markets As expected with most major merger announcements Moodys Investors Service placed the ratings of Dynegy and its subsidiaries under review for possible downgrade noting that notwithstanding the franchise benefits of the proposed merger the financial and business risks associated with the transaction could negatively impact Dynegys credit fundamentals The review affects about billion of Dynegy securities including its subsidiaries Illinova Corp and Illinois Power Co In its rating review Moodys said it will assess Dynegys plans to meet the liquidity needs of the combined entity and to deal with the uncertainty surrounding Enrons offbalance sheet transactions and contingent risksand examine the ultimate structure of the transaction and its impact on Dynegys financial leverage and on managements targeted debt levels The ratings service also plans to consider the governance framework within which the combined trading activities will operate Ratings under review are Dynegys Prime rating for commercial paper Dynegy Holdings Baa senior unsecured debt rating and its Prime rating for commercial paper Illinova Corps Baa senior unsecured debt rating and Illinois Power Cos Baa senior secured and Baa senior unsecured debt ratings and its Prime rating for commercial paper Fitch revised its rating watch on Enrons outstanding securities to evolving from negative where they were placed in late October The rating watch evolving means the ratings may be raised lowered or maintained Fitch also placed a rating watch negative on Dynegy and Dynegy Holdings longterm credit ratings which also means they could be lowered or affirmed The outstanding F rated commercial paper programs for Dynegy and Dynegy Holdings were not affected
