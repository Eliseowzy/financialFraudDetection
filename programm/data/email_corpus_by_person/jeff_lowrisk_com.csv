markets as of I will cover our models performance below but first I want to cover the current market In Walker MarketEdge issue that we published in early January I mentioned the recent trading range that the market has been in The top of that range was around on the SP and on the Nasdaq Those areas were important resistance levels for the market especially on the SP After that issue the market made another run up to those levelsand it was turned away once again as the SP made it up to on January th Since then the SP has dropped about and the Nasdaq composite had pulled back approximately On

site wmesecurehtm Sidebar So where does the market go from here Well lets step back for a moment On the bigger picture there are two underlying factors The first is that we are coming off a major bear market and in the case of the Nasdaq a truly historic bear market that bottomed in late September Second we have had a very powerful bounce since that September low In the last three and a half months the SP has rallied more than from low to high and the Nasdaq has rallied more than Given those two factors we have a couple of scenarios here actually there are all kinds of scenarios but most of them are derivatives of the two I will present here The first scenario is that after a huge rally this trading range for the last month is a case of the market digesting those gains In this scenario the market has entered a new bull market and this trading range is a case of the market taking a breather before moving higher Right now it seems like almost everyone favors this scenario thinking that we are in a new bull market In fact the sentiment right now is pretty amazing For example the Investors Intelligence sentiment numbers released last week showed there were fewer bearish advisors than at any time in the last three years And remember that three years includes the historic bull market of and early Pretty amazing considering that we are less than four months removed from panic lows The second scenario and the one we currently favor is that the market will have some type of a retest of the September lows That retest might take the form of a pullback that erases anywhere from to of the gains since those lows or it might take the form of a full retest that heads all the way back down towards the lows The highs in early December and early January were at significant resistance levels that have now turned the market back twice At those highs we had significant bearish divergences on our internal indicators And last but not least the turn down came when we had overwhelmingly bullish sentiment When everyone is bullish who is left to buy With all that said the next few days look like very important ones for the market On the short term the market has become extremely oversoldand it is due a nice two or three day bounce If we do get a rally it will give us a good clue as to just how much gas is left in the bulls tank On the other hand if the market doesnt put together a good bounce in the face of these oversold conditions then watch for the bears to really take controla market that cant rally when it is deeply oversold is not a healthy market OK here are the performance numbers for our various strategies for last year SP return maximum drawdown Timing return maximum drawdown Year by year results timingyearlyhtm Graduated return maximum drawdown Year by year results graduatedyearlyhtm SuperBear return maximum drawdown Year by year results superbearyearlyhtm Disaster Avoidance return maximum drawdown Year by year results disasteryearlyhtm The above returns are based on the SP and would be extremely close to what you could have expected if you used an SP index fund for your portfolio Just in case you are not familiar with the term maximum drawdown that is the greatest percentage that an account would lose from its peak For example consider a scenario where your account started with then increased in value to and then dropped to In this case the maximum drawdown would be because it fell from to or Of our four market timing strategies the Timing Strategy is by far our most popular Since we started publishing this strategy real time in it has beaten the SP in three out of four years and had a cumulative return of In that time the SP has had a cumulative return of Just as importantly the Timing Strategy has greatly reduced risk as the maximum drawdown in that period was compared to for the SP Probably the best performing strategy from a risk to reward standpoint was our SuperBear strategy This strategy is designed to stay out of the market in all but the most favorable times It has been out of the market for more than three years The worst drawdown since we went real time in has been while it has a cumulative return of in that time versus for the SP This is a very conservative strategy and over time it would be very unlikely for it to beat the return of the SP However it is extremely likely that the SuperBear strategy will have much lower drawdowns than the SP The one strategy that has generated the most confusion and questions from our readers is the Disaster Avoidance strategy This strategy is pretty much the opposite of the SuperBear strategyit is designed to stay in the stock market in all but the most dire of times This strategy remained in the stock market for all of so its results mirrored the SP Perhaps I made a mistake when I named this strategy as it seems that many people assume that it is a strategy that is going to be out of the market nearly all the time our models have been

<16856143.1075840973744.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,jeff@lowrisk.com,2002-01-31 15:13:43,Walker Market Letter PST W a l k e r M a r k e t L e t t e r January st There are no changes in the position of any of our models or positions We are still primarily out of the stock market My good friend Don Cassidy has just published a new stock market book called Trading On Volume It is an excellent book that covers using volume analysis which I think is an under explored area of trading and investing The book has been named Investment Book of the Year by Stocktraders Almanac And almost as importantlyDon lists me in the credits I just love seeing my name in print In any case this book is well worth checking outyou can get it at Amazoncom Or better yet you can get an autographed copy directly from Don at a special discounted price You can get the details by sending him an email at MODEL UPDATE Lowrisk Market Allocation Model signal strength on a scale of with being the most bullish Disaster Avoidance Strategy stocks as of Graduated Strategy stocks money markets as of Timing Strategy money markets as of SuperBear Strategy money markets as of I have a friend who recently subscribed to my newsletter He was teasing me the other day saying that I always think that the market is going to go down That isnt the case as my long time readers know But the fact is that in the last two years I have been bearishbecause the market has primarily gone down Of course in those two years the market hasnt gone straight down It has had some very powerful rallies including the explosive rally since the September st low The Nasdaq led the charge in that rally by gaining an incredible by early January And that wasnt the first strong rally since the bear market started back in Lets take a look at the previous rallies in this bear market From May to July the Nasdaq rallied And in January the Nasdaq jumped Then in April and May of many investors thought the bear market was over when the Nasdaq rallied On each of those three occasions the rally failed and the market dropped down through the previous lows These bear market rallies that we have seen since the market top back in MarchApril have pretty much followed the course of bear market rallies throughout history For a little perspective I went back and looked at the Crash and the bear market that followed That bear market didnt find a bottom until three years later in In that time there were six separate bear market rallies The gains in those rallies were and Once again take a look at rallies we have seen since the top in early and Pretty much the same ball park dont you think Sidebar Just about a year ago I put together a study comparing the current Nasdaq bear market to the Crash Back then a lot of people scoffed at the comparison but the last months have proven the comparison valid I just updated all of the chartsthey are pretty amazing Make sure you check them out at nasdaqhtm Sidebar So what is all this leading up to A few conclusionsfirst it is always good to be aware of prior market history It can really give you a perspective on current conditions Market history doesnt repeat but it often rhymes Second just because we have had a dramatic rally since September doesnt mean the bear market is over You wouldnt believe it from watching the financial stations but there actually IS a possibility that the market will go back to the September lows I think the market is currently in a retest phase of those September lows However that doesnt necessarily mean that we are in for a trip all the way back down to those lows In our January th issue of the Walker MarketEdge I said I expected a pullback of at least to of the gains from the September st lows to the DecemberJanuary highs Well so far the various indexes have pulled back between and The most surprising thing so far in this pullback is how quickly the sentiment turns bullish every time the market rallies You can see this anecdotally on the financial TV shows where every rally is seized as proof of a market bottom or a new bull market And you can also see it in the technical indicators such as VIX and the PutCall ratio where every bounce generates more bullish complacency It is almost as if the bear market in and never happened Investors and traders just dont seem to have any fear of rushing in to catch a bottom This is not the type of investor sentiment that market bottoms are made of And from looking back at market history you and I know that we shouldnt be so quick to think this bear market is over Which leads to my current two word opinion Be careful I mentioned the Walker MarketEdge up abovethat is the upgraded version of this newsletter With it you get an immediate FLASH UPDATE whenever there are any changes in our
