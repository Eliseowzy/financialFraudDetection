ownership through a number of Enron entities Through further research we found a few more that dont totally fit that mold Elektro Electricidad e Servicos SA in Brazil of this company if publicly held with the remainder held by Enron entities EPE Empresa Productora de Energia Ltda in Brazil has outside owners including Shell and LJM Brazilco and Interjuris SC Ltda aka Shell Cuiaba Holdings owns two shares and has a direct ownership interest and one Board vote Energia Ltd another Brazil operation is owned by ENBRAS which in turn in owned by Enron Corp Shares of the company are pledged to Westdeusche Landesbank Gironzentrale as of Feb Again this may be more information than you ever wanted or needed but thought you might like to know Original Message From Davis Hardie Sent Wednesday December AM To Kean Steven J Subject RE Non US Locations Steve As stated earlier many of the company names on the list that was provided either do not exactly match what we have in corporate records or there is such a long list with very similar names that we have just made assumptions in most cases regarding ownership We can assure you that for the most part you have placed the companies in the correct business bucket ie Corp ENA EES etc There are a few however that may be incorrectly categorized as follows EA ECT Non US Payroll Company there is no such entity but I would assume these folks are paid by ENA Enron Capital Trade Resources in London UK may actually be Enron Europe company called Enron Capital Trade Resources Limited EBS Broadband Solutions Pvt Ltd actually comes up to Corp through a long complicated chain of companies associated with Atlantic Commercial Finance EEOS Enron Engineering Construction and the former NEPCO are both organized under EESO whose ownership remains Enron Corp The NEPCO in the UK could actually be NEPCO Europe Ltd whose ownership is tied to Enron Europe EES Enron Direct LTD Partnership is actually an Enron North America entity The others are either EES or bundled under EES even though they are thought of as Enron Facilities ServicesLimbach companies EGA Heres where the going gets tough because the vast majority of these Enron Global Assets entities have very complicated organization structures with complicated multilayers structures that eventually lead back to Enron Corp ownership As you know all of the old subsets ie APACHI CALME etc have gone away and everything international is now EGA To the best of our knowledge all of these entities and their employees are Enron managed Following are the exceptions andor unusual organizational structure that should be noted Electricidad Enron de Guatemala SA actually reports up through ENA San Juan Gas Company Inc in Puerto Rico is a direct sub of Enron Corp owned Enron American del Sur SA is an Enron CorpEnron Transportation Services entity No entity called Enron Singapore more than likely Enron Capital Trade Resources International Singapore which is Enron North America company EIM No Stadacona Paper Company but it is probably Compagnie Papier Stadaconda which is owned in a complicated structure through a Netherlands EIM Holdings Company and then through Sundance Industrial Partners including Enron Industrial Markets GP Corp as the general partner and a list of Limited Partners including ENA Enron Corp and a nonEnron entity Salomon Brothers Holding Company Inc ENW Enron Net Works LLC is a wholly owned Enron Corp company EWC The Enron Wind Group is all part of Enron Renewable Energy Corp which is owned by Smith Street Land Co an Enron Corp company but many of the names listed here do not correspond to any official names on our list For instance there is no Enron Wind Greece but it may be Enron Wind Hellas SA no Enron Wind UK no Enron Wind India but regardless they are all part of the EWCEREC family GLOBAL These entities all are a part of Enron Global Exploration Production Inc which is owned by Enron Corp but one has indirect outside ownership EP Enron Oil Gas India Ltd for instance is owned by Enron Asst Holdings which is owned by Enron Finance Partners which is part of a complex ownership structure that includes one nonEnron entity Zephyrus Investments LLC with a small interest Again I hope this information is helpful For the most part the list appears to be in order except for the ones mentioned and for the fact that so many of the names are incomplete and hard to definitively track Let my group know if we can be of additional assistance Hardie Angus H Davis Vice President Corporate Secretary Department Enron

RelationsLay Foundation has additi onal questions regarding Community Partners request described below for immediate StabilizationTransition Funding of this year and a long term commitment of over several years I would be glad to visit w ith either of you regarding Community Partners and its future Thanks for your consideration Hardie Original Message From Davis Hardie SentFriday September AM ToMilligan Jennifer Siegel Misha CcOlson Cindy Lay Kenneth SubjectCommunity Partners StabilizationTransition Campaign Misha and Jennifer Thanks for visiting with me this week regarding Commun ity Partners and our ongoing campaign Give me a call so I can schedule a tour for you two Cindy I regret that you were unable to join us but I did want to include you in this followup email requested by Misha and Jennifer and to invite you to a tour of our clinic Background As you know Enron the old HNG was a founding member of Com munity Partners once known as Urban Affairs Corp and has been an ongoin g contributor to the nonprofit for all of its year history Begun as an effort by the business community in Houston to increase the number of fe male minorities in the workforce by providing lowcost daycare to children of innercity mothers Community Partners has grown into a million annu al budget organization whose emphasis now is schoolbased health clinics These clinics including a mobile clinic operated in cooperation with Episc opal Health Charities and Christ Cathedraldowntown are utilized by the UT Health Sciences and UT Nursing Schools as teaching facilities for their st udents interns and residents and as a result we are able to offer a ful lyear of unlimited health care at a cost of approximately per individ ual served a significant savings when compared to costs associated with government programs at charity hospitals Our associated childcare facilit y housed in an HISD school adjacent to our main clinic allows young school age mothers to remain in school by providing care for infants and preschoo lers while the students attend classes Prior Giving History For the first years of its existence Enron hi storically made an annual contribution to the nonprofit and in the last years has annually purchased a table at the Fathers of the Year Luncheon which has become a one of Houstons most recognized luncheo n fundraisers Ken Lay has been honored and has served in numerous years as Honorary Chairman of the event and he and his foundation normally buys a table When EOG was an Enron subsidiary Forrest Hoglund chair ed the event one year and the Hoglund Foundation has been a regular contrib utor Enrons AdoptaChild Holiday Program actually got its start in ass ociation with Community Partners when Enron employees would adopt and buy g ifts for children in our childcare centers Over the last several years E nrons contribution has been reduced to a annual table purchase ass ociated with the Fathers of the Year Luncheon Update on Community Partners After serving on the Board for years tw o years as Chairman the one thing I have learned about a nonprofit like Community Partners is that there is never much surplus cash especially at yearend and we are always waiting for that next contribution Every year we have been able to squeeze by but this year because of a number of cir cumstances Community Partners is in a severe battle for survival Because of personal health problems experienced by Executive Director Donna Bryant her husband Don and son Jason the Board earlier this year decided to acquire the services of a fundraising consulting group headed by Harriet L attimer and Tom Herren to help us through this crisis and to make recommend ations The Board overwhelmingly endorsed their recommendations which incl uded the following Promoting Donna Bryant to a Chairman Emeritus position with continued salar y over the next three years Donna would have no daytoday duties which will allow her to take care of her own health needs and to transition to re tirement She would be called on only as needed on a consulting basis Seeking in immediate transitionstabilization support from certain foundations who have voiced interest in providing that support to keep thi s important program going Grant requests of each have been subm itted to the Meadows Foundations and the Cullen Foundation Beginning an immediate search for an Executive Director with the enthusias tic assistance of Jackie Martin and her United Way staff and to consider t he hiring of a Development Director to focus on fundraising FYI I talk ed with Roy Hughes and have forwarded his resume to the Board search commit tee Refocusing of the Houston Endowment annual grant to the clinics an d requesting immediate payment Accomplished Strengthening of the Board of Directors I have agreed to chair the Nomin ating Committee so any ideas you can contribute would be appreciated Reapplying for United Way membership We once were a UW agency but Donna did not like the limitations to fundraising under the current circumst ances the Board now thinks otherwise Beginning an immediate personal Board contribution campaign and to seek sta bilization funding this year from the Houston community both from corporat ions and individuals Already underway Consider a major endowment campaign next year to provide emergency cash flo w in times when we are waiting for the foundation checks to come in Enrons Role In addition to an immediate stabilization gift of to to help us through the remainder of the year we would appreciat e the consideration of a major gift in the range over a year period for the Endowment Campaign We would also like a top Enron executi ve Ken Lay would be nice but it could be a nice intro to the Community fo r Mark Frevert or Greg Whalley to consider chairing the Endowment Campaign once it gets organized next year I would also consider stepping down fro m the Board to allow a more highlevel executive to represent us on the Boa rd I apologize for the longwinded nature of this message but I wanted to mak e sure that everyone knew all the facts Thanks for your consideration Angus H Davis Vice President Corporate Secretary
