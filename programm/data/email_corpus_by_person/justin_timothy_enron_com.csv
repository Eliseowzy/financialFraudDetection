Justin Have spoken with Dave Minns just now and I think he is going to spk with you I dont think I have been clear enough and I am sorry We here at Enron Japan have no particular desire or resources at the moment to send out EOL related correspondence from here If however EOL decides it is better for EOL related correspondence with Japanese counterparties to go from Enron Japan Corp as the legal entity responsible for the content of a letter rather than any other Enron entity then we will have to review and sign the correspondence since it will create legal obligations for us or have someone else sign pursuant to a limited power of attorney If you want the letters to go from Enron Japan Corp and for the EOL logo to be on the paper then we would also need to consider whether we EJ needed to register the logo as a business trade name here I am not sure whether this has been done Also note that at the moment although the Japanese version of the letterhead refers to Enron Japan Corp the English translation says EnronOnLine In any case these should be consistent I would think On the other hand if the correspondence can go from EOL LLC or another Enron legal entity then we do not need to be involved and I think this would be our preference I know that the Enron Metals people here are trying to convert their customers over to EOL The EJ traders are also trying to sell EOL in the market The time therefore may come when we prefer to personalize our EOL dealings by having them sent from EJ or Enron Metals out of Tokyo but I dont think that time has quite come yet As a separate issue if EOL wants to use the Enron Japan address in Tokyo on its letters to Japanese counterparties it may have to register a branch and this may have unexpected tax implications for EOL LLC This

to what extent the product descriptions differ from the existing swaps being traded by ENA The only difference will be the currency nothing else Regards Justin Original Message From Musch Susan Sent Wednesday November PM To Niesler Stefan Cc McBride Jane Sayre Frank Taylor Mark E Legal Minns David Aronowitz Alan Timothy Justin Subject RE EOL New Product JPY denominated WTI Swap Stefan Sorry I didnt respond sooner its been really hectic around here The GTC looks fine its the standard GTC for ENA financial products The product descriptions generally look fine as well One question I have however is to what extent the attached product descriptions differ apart from being denominated in USD rather JPY from the WTI swaps currently being traded by ENA Also the memo that Joe sent to Jeff states that the products are part of Enron Japans overall effort to extend Enrons crude and products business to Japan It will be marketed to customers as one potential means to meet their risk management requirements Pursuant to our previous discussions and emails I understand that Enron Japan will not be involved with these products If this is not the case we need to discuss what the facts are specifically going to be so as to avoid any tax issues for ENA or Enron Japan arising from any of their activities relating to this product eg such as marketing Please confirm what the facts are going to be as they currently stand Best regards Susan Original Message From Niesler Stefan Sent Tuesday November PM To Musch Susan Cc McBride Jane Subject FW EOL New Product JPY denominated WTI Swap Importance High Susan Below are the documents Jane sent to Legal HOU for approval As you see we intent to be live by Thursday We hope to have the documents in the system later today Wed your time Could you take a look at the documents and let Janeme know if you see any issues in signing off on the product We might want to ask you for signoff by tomorrow Thanks StN Original Message From McBride Jane Sent Tuesday November PM To Sayre Frank Cc Taylor Mark E Legal Aronowitz Alan Minns David Timothy Justin Niesler Stefan Subject RE EOL New Product JPY denominated WTI Swap Importance High Dear Frank Many thanks for helping out on this Should be pretty straight forward I think because it is not a new product so much as a slightly revised version of an existing product US WTI There has also been a development which makes it even simpler At first the product was going to be WTI which is usually in USD and barrels in JPY and kiloliters but apparently EOL have said kiloliters wont actually work so the only twist is that this product will be in yen and not USD I have therefore amended the documents I sent yesterday so I hope you havent looked at them yet to take the barrel KL conversion language out and to remove the glitch from the Business Day definition in the GTCs Accordingly this email is exhaustive and you can ignore the one I sent yesterday which was at the bottom of Alans email to me I am attaching a number of documents i The first is an internal memo re two new products Enron Japan wants to put on EOL The Enron CP will be ENA which is why I need your help before going to Mark The memo describes the product generally and how it will work and sets out the background as to why EJ is pushing this initiative This is FYI only ii iii These are the ii draft product descriptions and iii GTCs and we need ENA legal sign off re same If you are happy with these then I will pass to Mark Taylor for final approval assuming I still need his approval if you have approved can you confirm this I wonder If you have any questions please let me know Both documents have been prepared based on the product descriptions and the GTCs currently used for the USD WTI product Re the Product Descriptions in addition to those changes to the US WTI product description which were needed to reflect the fact that these products are in yen and not in USD we have used upper case for Business Days because it is defined in the GTCs and the definition is important because it will not refer to Japanese holidays and I have incorporated a new definition the relevant Scheduled Trading Date so that in accordance with what I understand to be standard EOL procedure the top half of the product description can be the same for both products despite the fact that the currency exchange will be done days after a different date in the case of the two definitions and only the bottom half will need to change I know this is not a great way to include definitions in an agreement but I am just trying to keep my changes consistent with the current WTI Product Description methodology I have made no changes to the current WTI GTCs I have assumed that when NY law applies to foreign products we dont usually amend the arbitration clause despite the fact that the products are likely to be purchased by nonUS counter parties I am less sure however about the events of default clause The language seems pretty short and generic so I suspect that we probably dont put CP jurisdiction specific events in but please confirm I understand you are all under pressure there so wonder when you expect you would be able to revert so that I can let the business people here know Apparently GTCs can only be loaded once a week at Wed noon HOU time so unless you can see your way through to doing this during your Tuesday ie today your time provided I hear from you by Tuesday next week this would be fine Re Exchange Rate Sara Shackleton suggested recently that a central bank rate would be better then a Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi rate but the BTM exchange rates are market standard here so we would prefer to use these This may be because BTM is listed on the NYSE and so is seen as international File JPY WTI Swap LDdoc File JPY WTI Fin Swap GTCdoc File Product Memo doc Thanks Frank Jane McBride Original Message From Aronowitz Alan Sent November To Sayre Frank Cc McBride Jane Taylor Mark E Legal Viverito John Robison Michael A Subject FW EOL new Product JPY KL WTI Swap Jane As just spoke with Frank and he will help you on this But I do want to warn you that everyone here including Frank is engaged in a number of high priority projects related to among other things entering into master netting agreements and the like to manage the credit issues affecting the Company Accordingly the timetable for a reply may not be in line with your expectations Jane I noted that the draft of the GTCs had a glitch in the Business Day definition You should resend to Frank Regards

would be really grateful if you could pass this email to the right EGM lawyer ASAP with a copy to me so I know with whom to follow up I am attaching a number of documents i The first is an internal

would be grateful if you could do this today your time RE product Descriptions in addition to those changes which were needed to reflect the fact that the products are in yen and KL and not in USD and Barrels we have used upper case for Business Days because it is defined in the GTCs and the definition is important because it will not refer to Japanese holidays and I have incorporated a new definition the relevant Scheduled Trading Date so that in accordance with what I understand to be standard EOL procedure the top half of the product description can be the same for both products despite the fact that the currency exchange will be done days after a different date in the case of the two definitions and only the bottom half will need to change I have actually only made one small change to the GTCs to provide for kiloliters in the rounding off clause I assume that given that NY law will apply that we dont usually amend the arbitration clause in the case of products likely to be purchased by nonUS counter parties I am less sure about the events of default clause The language seems pretty short and generic so I suspect that we probably dont put CP jurisdiction specific
