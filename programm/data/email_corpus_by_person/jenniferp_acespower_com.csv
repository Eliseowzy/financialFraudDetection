the best game played but we beat them How is the new building Glad to hear the rumors have stopped That can be so stressful Hope all is well with you I work nights this week imagine that Coming back after two weeks off is always so HARD Jen Original Message From mailto Sent Wednesday November AM To Jennifer Perrenot Subject RE Whats up with your schedule You always seem to be working nights Things around here have been better We arent very happy with what has happened to this co over the past couple of months At least the rumors have stopped and now we know what will become of Enron Im just not sure how everyone will handle the change to Dynegy or even if the merger will get completed Its not supposed to close until around Sept So there is plenty of time for things to change even more around here As far as my job at least I work in the power side We keep hearing that they bought us for our power and gas trading so that makes me feel a little better Im also glad that it is a Houston co that bought us We are supposed to be moving into our new building this weekend so that will be interesting Have fun over Thanksgiving Original Message From Jennifer Perrenot ENRON Sent Monday November PM To Dean Clint Subject RE Hey there How are things down in Houston I cant imagine the rumors that are going on there We were so busy here last week I am ready for my two weeks off I

Dallas and Ill chat with ya when I get back Jen Original Message From Sent Tue PM To Jennifer Perrenot Cc Subject RE I definitely dressed up for the party I looked good I was a sheriff If you cant

costumes Dexter Freebish thats it Ill have to look for it up here We went to the APB party but left early to get some food Things calmed down that last night compared to Tuesday Ill be back on days at the end of next week and then Ill have two weeks off I cannot wait What are your plans for Thanksgiving Im flying to San Antonio to visit my dad for a few days I cant decide whether to stop over in Houston or just wait until Christmas I feel so lucky that the shift Im on has the holidays off I apologize for taking so long to respond to your message I lost my voice earlier this week which kind of makes it hard to trade Needless to say they sent me home to get better I secretly think everyone was happy not to hear me talk o It was so strange because other than the loss of my voice I felt fine Who knows Have a great week Hopefully we can talk when I get in the office on Thursday Jen Original Message From Sent Fri AM To Jennifer Perrenot Cc Subject RE I promised I looked for you that night Did you go to the APB party at Grasshopper Last of four nights huh I remember those days about years ago So that probably means you have a three day weekend and are back on for days Monday Thats just my guess As for the band I was playing I really dont remember which CD I had in there but it was probably Dexter Freebish or Vallejo They are both from Austin You need to call me when you get back on days Im going to a Halloween party this weekend at my managers house It should be fun Are you planning any more trips back to Houston Clint Original Message From Jennifer Perrenot ENRON Sent Friday October AM To Dean Clint Subject RE Hey there Nice to hear from you Yeah we went out the second night but it was a little slower thank goodness I think a lot of people had early flights out the next morning This is my last of four nights and I am ready for a break Or at least some sleep What was the name of that band you were playing in your car I doubt I can find it up here but its worth a try
