<29557556.1075853700976.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,colleen.sullivan@enron.com,2000-03-30 04:23:00,Re storage clarification issues Cc memo below following is a status on those items The pricing and consistency in pricing for handling intramonth changes does appear to be an issue Since the contract didnt spell out in detail location by location pricing and I think intentionally so we believe the best way to handle this for April forward is to agree monthly during bid week of the process and pricing for each location I know Chris Germany has prepared a proposal that I think he has discussed generally not specific numbers with Brian Doug and Charlie I will ask that he forward this proposal TODAY and finalize the process for April ASAP Let me know if you do not think a monthly process of agreeing to the changes is sufficient Local production unfortunately I think we have opened a can of worms here Here is what is happening Your people are nominating this production we are not even set up to do behind the citygate nominations but the contracts were assigned to us in the Wholesale transaction That means they were valued by us and put into our system at a value We are reviewing this detail now and are finding quite a few discrepancies between the prices that were listed on the Wholesale Deal List and the actual contract prices with the producers So this is one issue we will have to address as indemnification items Thats problem one Problem two is that I am assuming you all would like this production back since you are doing all the nominations We need to work on a solution for doing this if that is what you want For Jan Feb Mar however it appears that we will be the ones paying the producers so we will need to get volume information from your schedulers in order to get this billed and payed for properly Ill follow up with more information on this in the next couple of days Monthly invoices regarding the pipeline demand charges it sounds like Chris has been trying to verify all the charges before he sends copies of the pipeline invoices on to you Maybe we should change this process to one where he sends them to you as soon as he gets them instead of waiting on his confirmation and review of all the charges This means you may see quite a bit of incorrect data but at least youll have something Let us know what you would prefer Regarding the January invoice specifically I do know that the Columbia Gulf and Columbia Gas packet of pipeline invoices was mailed to your office yesterday March Chris will get all remaining demand charge statements to your office by Wednesday April and all corrections he is aware of as of this date by Friday April I apologize for the delay Swap confirmations I spoke with Jeff Hodge and he believes he has a packet of all the confirmshe is in Calgary today and will be back on Monday Is that soon enough for this to be sent to you If not please advise and Ill see if his assistant can search for this data Thanks for clarifying the storage proxy schedule with the remaining inventory balances on PM To cc Subject storage clarification issues I forgot the storage attachment Forwarded by Melissa FlewellynCESColumbiaGas on PM Melissa Flewellyn PM To internet cc Subject storage clarification issues Colleen Attached is an updated storage proxy schedule for COH and AGL showing what our balance will be as of April As always if you have any questions please let me know Im sending a copy of the document to Denny Pick for signature and will then send it to Jeff Hodge to get signature from Enron Aside from the storage issue there are several other items that we need to discuss Below is a brief description of each Please let me know how you think we could best deal with these whether its via phone call or having an inperson meeting down in your office Pricing I left you a message about this last week According to Chris Germany all changes to volumes after firstofthemonth must me negotiated In the contract however it specifically refers to pricing intramonth using gas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change Consistency During our discussions with Chris it sounds as though some pipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates to intramonth changes Id just like to make sure that we agree on the pricing mechanism and then apply it consistently Local production Apparently there was local production that John Singer purchased specifically to back Retail customers and this production was not removed from the Wholesale book prior to the sale We need to discuss how to handle this production Monthly invoices We still havent seen the complete January invoice As I understand it the demand charges have not all been sent over and several items that need to be changed havent yet been changed Also Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requested backup documentation on the demand charges but we still havent received anything Swap confirmations For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in place with Enron to keep Retails existing hedge positions in tact I still do not have executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements Rich Contos and I have both called several people about getting a complete set of copies but we cant seem to find the right person over there Whenever you have time to discuss these please let me know Thanks Melissa storage proxyxls

by CES with the wholesale package Im assuming that if these deals were not entered into Sitara by Mark Friedman and the TAGG people meaning you had to enter them in yourself at some later point which it sounds like we did they were probably not included in the Wholesale package If this is the case then the deals are not really ours and are presumably CES Retail If CESRetail does not want the deals

NRON Subject Citygate Production GAS behind TCO PLEASE READ Kathy we may need Colleen Sullivans interpretation of behind the citygate production Back in January Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES Retail John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron If these deals stay with Enron should they be at EES since they are behind the citygate or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for CES This could be a can of worms Colleen what is the contract interruption Does the citygate production deals stay with Enron If they stay with Enron then does CES realize this Are the producers receiving two payments one from Enron and one from CES Maybe this has already be discussed and decided but I havent heard the official word Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate delivery that CES needs The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to Enron are reduced by the production I think Chris put these buysells in the system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole Currently the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply The pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to the market demand tickets but the market demand numbers need to be increased Then you could eliminate the buysell tickets that Chris Germany has been creating However if this production gas is not Enrons then Enron is creating a lot of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments From Katherine L Kelly ECT AM To Joan NRON Robert CT cc Wade R CT Subject Re CES Pool Gas Hey guys I wanted yall to see the below messages as well since these are TCO deals Im little confused now because Wade had informed me that these were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points We found a few like this on CNG last week The way we have been handling this is to show a buy from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buysell with CES retail Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail but right now hes priorities are just a bit different I guess why Im a little confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPAs Wade Do you know whether deal is pool or a citygate deal If its pool I dont know how we could have missed this all month because we would have had to nominate it in Navigator Joanie Do you have any insight into this Forwarded by Katherine L KellyHOUECT on AM

us with the Wholesale package I need to know who the producers are for each of the deals the volumes of the deals and the term which I can get from John Singer Then we will take that information and try to match it up with the list of deals given to us by CES with the wholesale package Im assuming that if these deals were not entered into Sitara by Mark Friedman and the TAGG people meaning you had to enter them in yourself at some later point which it sounds like we did they were probably not included in the Wholesale package If this is the case then the deals are not really ours and are presumably CES Retail If CESRetail does not want the deals then we will value the transactions get together and discuss the best way to handle them ie us or EES then propose a transfer of the deals to Enron In summary if you can get the information noted above to me Ill take it from there and find out if the deals have already been assigned to us or not Thanks Joan NRON PM To Katherine L CT Colleen CT cc Chris CT Wade R CT Victor CT Robert CT Joann NRON Subject Citygate Production GAS behind TCO PLEASE READ Kathy we may need Colleen Sullivans interpretation of behind the citygate production Back in January Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES Retail John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron If these deals stay with Enron should they be at EES since they are behind the citygate or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for CES This could be a can of worms Colleen what is the contract interruption Does the citygate production deals stay with Enron If they stay with Enron then does CES realize this Are the producers receiving two payments one from Enron and one from CES Maybe this has already be discussed and decided but I havent heard the official word Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate delivery that CES needs The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to Enron are reduced by the production I think Chris put these buysells in the system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole Currently the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply The pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to the market demand tickets but the market demand numbers need to be increased Then you could eliminate the buysell tickets that Chris Germany has been creating However if this production gas is not Enrons then Enron is creating a lot of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments From Katherine L Kelly ECT AM To Joan NRON Robert CT cc Wade R CT Subject Re CES Pool Gas Hey guys I wanted yall to see the below messages as well since these are TCO deals Im little confused now because Wade had informed me that these were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points We found a few like this on CNG last week The way we have been handling this is to show a buy from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buysell with CES retail Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail but right now hes priorities are just a bit different I guess why Im a little confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPAs Wade Do you know whether deal is pool or a citygate deal If its pool I dont know how we could have missed this all month because we would have had to nominate it in Navigator Joanie Do you have any insight into this Forwarded by Katherine L KellyHOUECT on AM From Katherine L Kelly AM To Wade R CT cc Robert CT Subject Re CES Pool Gas Im sorry Wade but there definitely seems to be a problem with manpower around here Chris is in charge of handling all of the CES retail so he needs to set up the corresponding sales and price them My hands are kind of tied on the pathing until he is able to

generally concur with Shelleys summary On the fourth bullet in the first section tighter tolerances a lot of parties more than I expected kvetched about the fact that pipelines seemed to be using the Order filings to make their penalty provisions even worse higher fees tighter tolerances and then proposing new default or mandatory services that looked a lot like penalties There was the usual affiliate bashing particularly on the shippermusthavetitle rule discussions Southern Company also brought it up in connection with LNG import facilities eg Cove Point and Elba Island It seems pretty clear that the January conference which is to address marketing affiliates will be pretty heated Based on their comments in this conference I expect BPAmoco is going to be particularly aggressive rabid even and Dynegy will almost certainly be chiming in We need to start developing a strategy to counter some of their most virulent arguments Forwarded by Rebecca W CantrellHOUECT on PM Michael

nron Subject Memo from Shelley Corman FERC Staff Conference Today Today FERC Staff held its conference to discuss what regulatory changes are necessary to promote further market liquidity The conference was fairly well attended by FERC staff including Dan Larcamp and Shelton Cannon Some common themes Gas markets are generally well functioning and major changes are not necessary Commodity markets are very liquid FERC policies GISB and Order have helped to make capacity markets more liquid Shippers are unhappy with tighter tolerances and new balancing services in Order No compliance filings Standardization is necessary to promote liquidity with pipelines making the distinction that standardization of transactional protocols is a good idea standardization of product offerings is not There is very little consensus on further areas for change In nearly every case a change advocated by one shipper group is opposed by another In any event most said that now is not the time for sweeping changes Areas without consensus Shippermusthavetitle rule LDCs argue it should be removed while Process Gas and producers think that removal will undermine the capacity release market Production area rate design LDCs argued that they need the ability to buy service downstrream of a market pool Reliant and Koch also argued that pipelines should have to have separately stated production and market rates The producers opposed any attempt to shift costs to the production area SFV East Coast LDCs Michcon and APGA argued for moving off of SFV The producers and industrials oppose Illinois PowerDynegy also argued for moving off SFV LDC Positions The LDCs main themes were removing the shippermusthavetitle and enabling LDCs to hold space downstream of market centers However they also argued that pipelines should not be permitted to offer new services to the electric generation market that reduce the flexibilities LDCs have historically enjoyed since the system was built for LDCs This is the point that AGA raised in the blanket intervention to all Order compliance filings Carl Levander of Columbia did a nice job of refuting the notion that LDCs are entitled to unwritten flexibility that they have enjoyed in the past on a best efforts basis perhaps in part due to the fact that the pipeline may not have been fully subscribed LDCs generally stating that compliance filings did a poor job of allowing capacity segmentation continued to stress the need for segmentation including geographical segmentation of ROFR capacity Some Specific Proposals NGSA called for more targeted information to be included in Form filings A number of customer groups noted the need for more and better information though specific needs were not well defined Several parties ask FERC to reconsider national standardized penalties especially given expected high prices this winter and the possibility for arbitrage Alliance of Energy Suppliers marketing arm of EEI called for a dialogue between power generators and INGAA to develop a new firm tariff with hourly variability They also called for a change in GISB nomination deadlines to match the power grid Dan Larcamp asked whether EEI is open to efforts to standardize scheduling times across the power grid as well The GISB EndUser group represented by Salt River Project complained about the need to standardize the confirmation process and called for gas transactions to be tagged like electric transactions ECommerce and Capacity Trading Dave Neubaurer did a great job of driving home the themes that capacity trading can occur if FERC and industry are willing to allow more speedy transactions remove posting periods and long contract execution periods He made an effective case that no major regulatory changes are necessary Robert Levin of the NY Mercantile Exchange echoed this theme admonishing the FERC not to micromanage the types of trading platforms or to try to insist on a single platform He said that liquidity cannot be legislated From his perspective natural gas markets are the best functioning commodity markets in the world FERC should worry about transferring the good stuff from natural gas to electric markets not the reverse

consistency in pricing for handling intramonth changes does appear to be an issue Since the contract didnt spell out in detail location by location pricing and I think intentionally so we believe the best way to handle this for April forward is to agree monthly during bid week of the process and pricing for each location I know Chris Germany has prepared a proposal that I think he has discussed generally not specific numbers with Brian Doug and Charlie I will ask that he forward this proposal TODAY and finalize the process for April ASAP Let me know if you do not think a monthly process of agreeing to the changes is sufficient Local production unfortunately I think we have opened a can of worms here Here is what is happening Your people are nominating this production we are not even set up to do behind the citygate nominations but the contracts were assigned to us in the Wholesale transaction That means they were valued by us and put into our system at a value We are reviewing this detail now and are finding quite a few discrepancies between the prices that were listed on the Wholesale Deal List and the actual contract prices with the producers So this is one issue we will have to address as indemnification items Thats problem one Problem two is that I am assuming you all would like this production back since you are doing all the nominations We need to work on a solution for doing this if that is what you want For Jan Feb Mar however it appears that we will be the ones paying the producers so we will need to get volume information from your schedulers in order to get this billed and payed for properly Ill follow up with more information on this in the next couple of days Monthly invoices regarding the pipeline demand charges it sounds like Chris has been trying to verify all the charges before he sends copies of the pipeline invoices on to you Maybe we should change this process to one where he sends them to you as soon as he gets them instead of waiting on his confirmation and review of all the charges This means you may see quite a bit of incorrect data but at least youll have something Let us know what you would prefer Regarding the January invoice specifically I do know that the Columbia Gulf and Columbia Gas packet of pipeline invoices was mailed to your office yesterday March Chris will get all remaining demand charge statements to your office by Wednesday April and all corrections he is aware of as of this date by Friday April I apologize for the delay Swap confirmations I spoke with Jeff Hodge and he believes he has a packet of all the confirmshe is in Calgary today and will be back on Monday Is that soon enough for this to be sent to you If not please advise and Ill see if his assistant can search for this data Thanks for clarifying the storage proxy schedule with the remaining inventory balances on PM To cc Subject storage clarification issues I forgot the storage attachment Forwarded by Melissa FlewellynCESColumbiaGas on PM Melissa Flewellyn PM To internet cc Subject storage clarification issues Colleen Attached is an updated storage proxy schedule for COH and AGL showing what our balance will be as of April As always if you have any questions please let me know Im sending a copy of the document to Denny Pick for signature and will then send it to Jeff Hodge to get signature from Enron Aside from the storage issue there are several other items that we need to discuss Below is a brief description of each Please let me know how you think we could best deal with these whether its via phone call or having an inperson meeting down in your office Pricing I left you a message about this last week According to Chris Germany all changes to volumes after firstofthemonth must me negotiated In the contract however it specifically refers to pricing intramonth using gas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change Consistency During our discussions with Chris it sounds as though some pipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates to intramonth changes Id just like to make sure that we agree on the pricing mechanism and then apply it consistently Local production Apparently there was local production that John Singer purchased specifically to back Retail customers and this production was not removed from the Wholesale book prior to the sale We need to discuss how to handle this production Monthly invoices We still havent seen the complete January invoice As I understand it the demand charges have not all been sent over and several items that need to be changed havent yet been changed Also Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requested backup documentation on the demand charges but we still havent received anything Swap confirmations For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in place with Enron to keep Retails existing hedge positions in tact I still do not have executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements Rich Contos and I have both called several people about getting a complete set of copies but we cant seem to find the right person over there Whenever you have time to

Order filings to make their penalty provisions even worse higher fees tighter tolerances and then proposing new default or mandatory services that looked a lot like penalties There was the usual affiliate bashing particularly on the shippermusthavetitle rule discussions Southern Company also brought it up in connection with LNG import facilities eg Cove Point and Elba Island It seems pretty clear that the January conference which is to address marketing affiliates will be pretty heated Based on their comments in this conference I expect BPAmoco is going to be particularly aggressive rabid even and Dynegy will almost certainly be chiming in We need to start developing a strategy to counter some of their most virulent arguments Forwarded by Rebecca W CantrellHOUECT on PM Michael

nron Subject Memo from Shelley Corman FERC Staff Conference Today Today FERC Staff held its conference to discuss what regulatory changes are necessary to promote further market liquidity The conference was fairly well attended by FERC staff including Dan Larcamp and Shelton Cannon Some common themes Gas markets are generally well functioning and major changes are not necessary Commodity markets are very liquid FERC policies GISB and Order have helped to make capacity markets more liquid Shippers are unhappy with tighter tolerances and new balancing services in Order No compliance filings Standardization is necessary to promote liquidity with pipelines making the distinction that standardization of transactional protocols is a good idea standardization of product offerings is not There is very little consensus on further areas for change In nearly every case a change advocated by one shipper group is opposed by another In any event most said that now is not the time for sweeping changes Areas without consensus Shippermusthavetitle rule LDCs argue it should be removed while Process Gas and producers think that removal will undermine the capacity release market Production area rate design LDCs argued that they need the ability to buy service downstrream of a market pool Reliant and Koch also argued that pipelines should have to have separately stated production and market rates The producers opposed any attempt to shift costs to the production area SFV East Coast LDCs Michcon and APGA argued for moving off of SFV The producers and industrials oppose Illinois PowerDynegy also argued for moving off SFV LDC Positions The LDCs main themes were removing the shippermusthavetitle and enabling LDCs to hold space downstream of market centers However they also argued that pipelines should not be permitted to offer new services to the electric generation market that reduce the flexibilities LDCs have historically enjoyed since the system was built for LDCs This is the point that AGA raised in the blanket intervention to all Order compliance filings Carl Levander of Columbia did a nice job of refuting the notion that LDCs are entitled to unwritten flexibility that they have enjoyed in the past on a best efforts basis perhaps in part due to the fact that the pipeline may not have been fully subscribed LDCs generally stating that compliance filings did a poor job of allowing capacity segmentation continued to stress the need for segmentation including geographical segmentation of ROFR capacity Some Specific Proposals NGSA called for more targeted information to be included in Form filings A number of customer groups noted the need for more and better information though specific needs were not well defined Several parties ask FERC to reconsider national standardized penalties especially given expected high prices this winter and the possibility for arbitrage Alliance of Energy Suppliers marketing arm of EEI called for a dialogue between power generators and INGAA to develop a new firm tariff with hourly variability They also called for a change in GISB nomination deadlines to match the power grid Dan Larcamp asked whether EEI is open to efforts to standardize scheduling times across the power grid as well The GISB EndUser group represented by Salt River Project complained about the need to standardize the confirmation process and called for gas transactions to be tagged like electric transactions ECommerce and Capacity Trading Dave Neubaurer did a great job of driving home the themes that capacity trading can occur if FERC and industry are willing to allow more speedy transactions remove posting periods and long contract execution periods He made an effective case that no major regulatory changes are necessary Robert Levin of the NY Mercantile Exchange echoed this theme admonishing the FERC not to micromanage the types of trading platforms or to try to insist on a single platform He said that liquidity cannot be legislated From his perspective natural gas markets are the best functioning commodity markets in the world FERC should worry about transferring the good stuff from natural gas to electric markets not the reverse

by CES with the wholesale package Im assuming that if these deals were not entered into Sitara by Mark Friedman and the TAGG people meaning you had to enter them in yourself at some later point which it sounds like we did they were probably not included in the Wholesale package If this is the case then the deals are not really ours and are presumably CES Retail If CESRetail does not want the deals

NRON Subject Citygate Production GAS behind TCO PLEASE READ Kathy we may need Colleen Sullivans interpretation of behind the citygate production Back in January Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES Retail John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron If these deals stay with Enron should they be at EES since they are behind the citygate or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for CES This could be a can of worms Colleen what is the contract interruption Does the citygate production deals stay with Enron If they stay with Enron then does CES realize this Are the producers receiving two payments one from Enron and one from CES Maybe this has already be discussed and decided but I havent heard the official word Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate delivery that CES needs The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to Enron are reduced by the production I think Chris put these buysells in the system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole Currently the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply The pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to the market demand tickets but the market demand numbers need to be increased Then you could eliminate the buysell tickets that Chris Germany has been creating However if this production gas is not Enrons then Enron is creating a lot of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments From Katherine L Kelly ECT AM To Joan NRON Robert CT cc Wade R CT Subject Re CES Pool Gas Hey guys I wanted yall to see the below messages as well since these are TCO deals Im little confused now because Wade had informed me that these were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points We found a few like this on CNG last week The way we have been handling this is to show a buy from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buysell with CES retail Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail but right now hes priorities are just a bit different I guess why Im a little confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPAs Wade Do you know whether deal is pool or a citygate deal If its pool I dont know how we could have missed this all month because we would have had to nominate it in Navigator Joanie Do you have any insight into this Forwarded by Katherine L KellyHOUECT on AM From Katherine L Kelly AM To Wade R CT cc Robert CT Subject Re CES Pool Gas Im sorry Wade but there definitely seems to be a problem with manpower around here Chris is in charge of handling all of the

generally concur with Shelleys summary On the fourth bullet in the first section tighter tolerances a lot of parties more than I expected kvetched about the fact that pipelines seemed to be using the Order filings to make their penalty provisions even worse higher fees tighter tolerances and then proposing new default or mandatory services that looked a lot like penalties There was the usual affiliate bashing particularly on the shippermusthavetitle rule discussions Southern Company also brought it up in connection with LNG import facilities eg Cove Point and Elba Island It seems pretty clear that the January conference which is to address marketing affiliates will be pretty heated Based on their comments in this conference I expect BPAmoco is going to be particularly aggressive

nron Subject Memo from Shelley Corman FERC Staff Conference Today Today FERC Staff held its conference to discuss what regulatory changes are necessary to promote further market liquidity The conference was fairly well attended by FERC staff including Dan Larcamp and Shelton Cannon Some common themes Gas markets are generally well functioning and major changes are not necessary Commodity markets are very liquid FERC policies GISB and Order have helped to make capacity markets more liquid Shippers are unhappy with tighter tolerances and new balancing services in Order No compliance filings Standardization is necessary to promote liquidity with pipelines making the distinction that standardization of transactional protocols is a good idea standardization of product offerings is not There is very little consensus on further areas for change In nearly every case a change advocated by one shipper group is opposed by another In any event most said that now is not the time for sweeping changes Areas without consensus Shippermusthavetitle rule LDCs argue it should be removed while Process Gas and producers think that removal will undermine the capacity release market Production area rate design LDCs argued that they need the ability to buy service downstrream of a market pool Reliant and Koch also argued that pipelines should have to have separately stated production and market rates The producers opposed any attempt to shift costs to the production area SFV East Coast LDCs Michcon and APGA argued for moving off of SFV The producers and industrials oppose Illinois PowerDynegy also argued for moving off SFV LDC Positions The LDCs main themes were removing the shippermusthavetitle and enabling LDCs to hold space downstream of market centers However they also argued that pipelines should not be permitted to offer new services to the electric generation market that reduce the flexibilities LDCs have historically enjoyed since the system was built for LDCs This is the point that AGA raised in the blanket intervention to all Order compliance filings Carl Levander of Columbia did a nice job of refuting the notion that LDCs are entitled to unwritten flexibility that they have enjoyed in the past on a best efforts basis perhaps in part due to the fact that the pipeline may not have been fully subscribed LDCs generally stating that compliance filings did a poor job of allowing capacity segmentation continued to stress the need for segmentation including geographical segmentation of ROFR capacity Some Specific Proposals NGSA called for more targeted information to be included in Form filings A number of customer groups noted the need for more and better information though specific needs were not well defined Several parties ask FERC to reconsider national standardized penalties especially given expected high prices this winter and the possibility for arbitrage Alliance of Energy Suppliers marketing arm of EEI called for a dialogue between power generators and INGAA to develop a new firm tariff with hourly variability They also called for a change in GISB nomination deadlines to match the power grid Dan Larcamp asked whether EEI is open to efforts to standardize scheduling times across the power grid as well The GISB EndUser group represented by Salt River Project complained about the need to standardize the confirmation process and called for gas transactions to be tagged like electric transactions ECommerce and Capacity Trading Dave Neubaurer did a great job of driving home the themes that capacity trading can occur if FERC and industry are willing to allow more speedy transactions remove posting periods and long contract execution periods He made an effective case that no major regulatory changes are necessary Robert Levin of the NY Mercantile Exchange echoed this theme admonishing the FERC not to micromanage the types of trading platforms or to try to insist on a single platform He said that liquidity cannot be legislated From his perspective natural gas markets are the best functioning commodity markets in the world FERC should worry about transferring the good stuff from natural gas to electric markets not the reverse
