Hello all My husband and I just returned from a trip to the Alsace region of France over the Thanksgiving holiday and I thought I would pass on a little something that applies to the Christmas season I learned Alsace lies at the It seems the tradition of decorating a tree for Christmas began in this area if there were no borders it would be part of the Black Forest region of Germany The Alsacians are a generous hardworking loving people as a whole Many wonderful people have come from this region One of the greatest is Dr Albert Schweitzer Dr Schweitzer began as a master organist built them actually and wrote books about them Then he felt called to the ministry and was a pastor with a compassionate heart He was in Paris at a missions conference and was moved to hear of the tribes in Africa lost without hope practically no medical care and felt the Holy Spirit move in his life once again He studied medicine and he his wife and a team of compassionate men and women moved to Gabon on the West Coast of Africa and opened a hospital There they cared for the sick in body and spirit The tradition of the Christmas tree began in the early s There was a pastor who was coming home in the early winter evening having visited a parishioner It was nearing the time of celebrating the Birth of Jesus As he made his way through the dark woods he came upon a fir tree bathed in light It seemed a star sat upon the top of the tree The sight held such wonder that he wanted to share it with his family Then he began to see the true story and felt that maybe it was not just coincidence that he happened up that sight He cut the tree and began to dress it up in red with white candles for his church and here is what he told the people in my words of course The tree is to remind us why Jesus came He came to die upon the tree for our freedom The evergreen represents life even when death is all around all the other trees loose their leaves and die but only the evergreen goes against the flow Its life flows from deep within The life of the Christian flows from deep within So the tree represents life The red ribbons and bow represent His Blood shed for us The scarlet ribbon that covers the tree as His Blood that covers our sins The white candles represent purity we are cleansed and made pure through the shed blood upon the tree and Light that Jesus is the Light of the World and the light on the tree is the Light on our lives He said WE are the light of the world when we allow Him to live in us As time passed all kinds of things have been added and the REAL purpose of the tree has been forgotten One more VERY important thing that is added to a European tree is the manger It is set up under the tree in the center with a place of prominence Usually the Christ Child is not added until Christmas morning The tree in Europe is left in place until January when the Three Wise Men came from the east to worship the King and this is when gifts are usually exchanged While I love the giving and the getting and the gathering and the eating all the fun things that go with Christmas as much as the next person and maybe more than some I would like to encourage us all as we enter the season If you have an artificial or real tree a color theme or mix and match as you set the tree remember Who died on a tree for you and your home Let it represent in your home His sacrifice on the bare tree Lets pray for the opportunity to witness in a different way to our unsaved friends and family If you have a tree in your home this year and you have unsaved family as you decorate it each time you admire it pray Father let this tree represent You in this home Let Your Light shine through me Let me share Your gifts You have given me with those You place in my path As I wrap each present I pray Your anointing goes with that gift Let the sweater the scarf the article of clothes represent Your covering over that loved one Let that toy bring joy to that child and open a way for me to minister in a fresh way to that young heart Each time the keyboard on that computer is touched as I touch it Lord I know Your Spirit linger there as it did for Elijah on that bed and the child was raised I want Your resurrection power to flow through me to each person You have given me to care for As I hang ornaments on the tree let each one represent a habit a fear a concern a pain a past unforgiven a sickness a financial burden a child a husband a wife a future unknown and uncertain and the act of hanging be an act of faith of hanging it on the cross An act of placing that care in Your capable Hands As the lights are strung on the tree and home let Your light shine through me Let my home be a beacon of Your Love in a dark hurting crying sighing dying world As I meet with friends and family and reach out to hug let my arms be Your Arms reaching out in love Use me mold me make me what I ought to be so I can be more like You In Jesus NameAmen Just a thought I wanted to share We have a chance to make a real difference in our homes as we allow Jesus to make a difference in our hearts I love you allCarol Word

<13384404.1075855553397.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,mary.moore@enron.com,2000-11-29 07:50:00,Focusing on the Christ in Christmasis from Carol Word she is working on the Prayer List and will send it shortly Hello all My husband and I just returned from a trip to the Alsace region of France over the Thanksgiving holiday and I thought I would pass on a little something that applies to the Christmas season I learned Alsace lies at the It seems the tradition of decorating a tree for Christmas began in this area if there were no borders it would be part of the Black Forest region of Germany The Alsacians are a generous hardworking loving people as a whole Many wonderful people have come from this region One of the greatest is Dr Albert Schweitzer Dr Schweitzer began as a master organist built them actually and wrote books about them Then he felt called to the ministry and was a pastor with a compassionate heart He was in Paris at a missions conference and was moved to hear of the tribes in Africa lost without hope practically no medical care and felt the Holy Spirit move in his life once again He studied medicine and he his wife and a team of compassionate men and women moved to Gabon on the West Coast of Africa and opened a hospital There they cared for the sick in body and spirit The tradition of the Christmas tree began in the early s There was a pastor who was coming home in the early winter evening having visited a parishioner It was nearing the time of celebrating the Birth of Jesus As he made his way through the dark woods he came upon a fir tree bathed in light It seemed a star sat upon the top of the tree The sight held such wonder that he wanted to share it with his family Then he began to see the true story and felt that maybe it was not just coincidence that he happened up that sight He cut the tree and began to dress it up in red with white candles for his church and here is what he told the people in my words of course The tree is to remind us why Jesus came He came to die upon the tree for our freedom The evergreen represents life even when death is all around all the other trees loose their leaves and die but only the evergreen goes against the flow Its life flows from deep within The life of the Christian flows from deep within So the tree represents life The red ribbons and bow represent His Blood shed for us The scarlet ribbon that covers the tree as His Blood that covers our sins The white candles represent purity we are cleansed and made pure through the shed blood upon the tree and Light that Jesus is the Light of the World and the light on the tree is the Light on our lives He said WE are the light of the world when we allow Him to live in us As time passed all kinds of things have been added and the REAL purpose of the tree has been forgotten One more VERY important thing that is added to a European tree is the manger It is set up under the tree in the center with a place of prominence Usually the Christ Child is not added until Christmas morning The tree in Europe is left in place until January when the Three Wise Men came from the east to worship the King and this is when gifts are usually exchanged While I love the giving and the getting and the gathering and the eating all the fun things that go with Christmas as much as the next person and maybe more than some I would like to encourage us all as we enter the season If you have an artificial or real tree a color theme or mix and match as you set the tree remember Who died on a tree for you and your home Let it represent in your home His sacrifice on the bare tree Lets pray for the opportunity to witness in a different way to our unsaved friends and family If you have a tree in your home this year and you have unsaved family as you decorate it each time you admire it pray Father let this tree represent You in this home Let Your Light shine through me Let me share Your gifts You have given me with those You place in my path As I wrap each present I pray Your anointing goes with that gift Let the sweater the scarf the article of clothes represent Your covering over that loved one Let that toy bring joy to that child and open a way for me to minister in a fresh way to that young heart Each time the keyboard on that computer is touched as I touch it Lord I know Your Spirit linger there as it did for Elijah on that bed and the child was raised I want Your resurrection power to flow through me to each person You have given me to care for As I hang ornaments on the tree let each one represent a habit a fear a concern a pain a past unforgiven a sickness a financial burden a child a husband a wife a future unknown and uncertain and the act of hanging be an act of faith of hanging it on the cross An act of placing that care in Your capable Hands As the lights are strung on the tree and home let Your light shine through me Let my home be a beacon of Your Love in a dark hurting crying sighing dying world As I meet with friends and family and reach out to hug let my arms be Your Arms reaching out in love Use me mold me make me what I ought to be so I can be more like You In Jesus NameAmen Just a thought I wanted to share We have a chance to make a real difference in our homes as we allow Jesus to make a difference in our hearts I love you allCarol Word
