immediately put this issue to bed My opinion is that we should stick with the original plan to either exchange all the GP interests in the second and thirdtier OLPs for a interest in the MLP or eliminate the interest in the third tier partnerships In both cases the result is that the GP receives a or a interest in the consolidated income of the MLP and seliminate any need for a fairness opinion on the part of the Audit Committee I briefly went over the calculation wRod on late Tuesday and he was tentatively in agreement but wanted to study this over the holiday The issues raised by an effective interest in the third tier partnerships would make a fairness opinion very very impractical Give me a call on Thursday to discuss We want to go over our final recommendation wStan on

PROPOSAL FOR EOTT REORGANIZATION doc To Stan Horton Rod Hayslett Mitch Taylor Jessica Uhl Dana Gibbs Lawrence Clayton Molly Sample Lori Maddox Ann Ballard Robert Eickenroht Re Reorganization The purpose of this memorandum is to discuss a proposal relating to the reorganization of EOTT Energy Partners that will enable it to prepare and file as soon as possible a registration statement covering publicly offered debt On Thursday I received a voice mail from Paula Dubberly of the SEC staff indicating that the staff would not go along with our idea of avoiding the requirement for separate operating limited partnership financial statements by having EOTT Energy Partners the MLP guarantee the general partner interests in the operating partnerships It is clear that the staff has no interest in helping us although it clearly has the power to do so Although I plan to call Paula I have little hope that it will do any good I previously prepared a powerpoint presentation showing the steps in the reorganization and a memorandum with a timetable for effecting the reorganization The reorganization steps are straightforward The principal time consideration was the action of the Audit Committee in approving the reorganization which will involve a transaction between EOTT Energy Corp and the MLP that might be challenged absent a determination of fairness from the Audit Committee That transaction is the exchange of EOTT Energy Corps general partner interests in the original three operating limited partnerships for an additional interest in the MLP itself I also prepared a memorandum setting forth the case for giving EOTT Energy Corp an additional based on the argument that this would speed up the reorganization and reduce its costs by avoiding the need for the Audit Committee to hire an investment banking firm to render a fairness opinion I have done some additional thinking and believe that it makes sense to consider effecting the reorganization and then engaging the Audit Committee afterward to determine with the assistance of an investment banking firm a fair exchange ratio The terms of the reorganization would provide that the interest received by EOTT Energy Corp would be a minimum of a interest and a maximum of a interest but that the actual percentage interest would be determined by the Audit Committee following the reorganization based appraisals of the interests by an independent investment banking firm The Audit Committee would determine the value of EOTT Energy Corps interests in the original operating partnerships and based on that value an equivalent additional interest in the MLP The MLP could proceed with the registration statement because the difference between the minimum and maximum amount that EOTT Energy Corp would receive is immaterial and irrelevant to potential debt holders because it merely measures how the equity holders divide the pie The reorganization could be effected without a unitholder vote if the EOTT Energy Corp board of directors determines that the reorganization does not adversely affect the limited partners in any material respect I believe that this is a determination that the board can reasonably make without the need for advance Audit Committee action The only issue with the structure of the transaction is that the general partner of the operating limited partnerships will now be whollyowned by the MLP and the wholly owned subsidiary that is the general partner rather than EOTT Energy Corp would be liable for the debts and obligations of any operating limited partnership to the extent its liabilities exceeded its assets However in light of the fact that such a scenario is remote and there are great advantages in terms of cost savings in effecting the reorganization the board could reasonably determine that any adverse effects are immaterial I believe that if this approach is adopted the MLP could be in a position to file a registration statement within three weeks of the commencement of the process I have prepared a revised timetable for such a proposal RSB CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE The information in this email may be confidential andor privileged This email is

RE EOTT FollowupDocument link Lawrence Clayton I will be lucky if I have this agreement signed before pmalso this guy has no business getting a copy of our loan documents This is unheard of Lawrence Clayton To Oram Andrew EOTTEXTERNAL cc Susan ott Dana ott Subject RE EOTT FollowupDocument link Susan Ralph AM On the increase of the interim facility we plan to communicate closing on Friday before mkt opening We cannot commit to forwarding a copy of this to Moodys on Thursday ok This will be a wait and see We will not know the st impact until late Jan but the impact is not expected to be lt There is no mm loss I indicated that the st impact may be a mm a month reduction in gross margins could be more or less As I indicated this is a GUESS on my part and will be confirmed during the st qtr To be sure that you are clear on this one EOTTs monthly EOR Pipeline margins are impacted by many factors Availability of credit although important is lesser to the many other market factors effectively managed daily by our experienced operating marketing and trading personnel To extrapolate this to a full year mm would be wrong Additionally we have taken over commercial operations of the plant This will result in a variance higher or lower to the mm in originally projected under the tolling storage agreements To take this to ZERO would be more than wrong but ABSURD Again as I have indicated in prior conversations there is nothing from a debt or liquidity standpoint that sbe pressuring Moodys to act now You have already taken a downgrade once and further downgrade in my opinion is not warranted until more concrete facts are known EOTT has significant unencumbered assets which provide us many different options There is no disintegrationdoomsday capability as we are largely an asset company and our profitability and cashflows although impacted by our marketing is not per se dependent upon it on a lt basis I continue to encourage Moodys to not overreact during this time that supplier confidence and reassurances are very important to EOTT but rather to have their rating based upon the underlying facts and not speculation of what might happen under worse case assumptions Even though the environment has changed Im sure you agree that ratings are not determined or maintained based upon these WORSE CASE type assumptionsscenarios Oram Andrew Andrew To oodyscom cc Subject RE EOTT Followup AM Dear Lawrence Thank you for the updating phone conversation this morning To summarize some key points from today as well as some points weve discussed far into the past I was pleased to hear that you are going to sign an interim credit agreement sometime tomorrow As I understand it no later than tomorrow Thursday EOTT will email or fax to me an executed signed interim bank credit facility enabling the issuance of million in letters of credit by this Friday December This Friday is when EOTT needs to begin posting LCs in support of its January business For all the reasons we discussed we must have this document to take to the standing EOTT rating committee I will try to have todays meeting postponed until Thursday but early to mid Thursday afternoon will be the latest we could wait since EOTT must be seen in the market to be normally issuing LCs by Friday and this need will grow in the ensuing days as January volumes are bid for We can not think of a sound business or financial reason why the million facility would not be executed before then and this facility is important to your current ratings I understand that you continue to be confident the permanent working capital and LC facility would be completed around late January You reiterated that EOTT will run its business at the volume of activity that can be supported by million of LC support In the past roughly billion of revenues were supported by LCs equating to only of revenues due to prior success in expanding open account credit arrangements with sellerssuppliers as well as the natural netting of receivables and payables exposures with the same customer EOTT believes it will be able to run at the volume of business it targets with a million facility As I mentioned at least until the market settles down we believe this will require EOTT to reduce its level of business By cutting back on your lower margin business you may be able to limit the loss of EBITDA to in the range of million per month I understand that you would not expect EGLI to formally announce its intentions on the tolling and storage takeorpay agreements until January and that EOTT is working on a range of contractual alternatives with other parties Moodys will have to treat as nil the revenue generating potential of the MTBE storage and pipeline grid until alternative arrangements with third parties are completed As I mentioned again our rating reflects the strength of your liquidity and LC arrangements and longer term earnings cash flow business risks and sector risks of EOTT relative to its capital structure and financial risks Financial flexibility is pivotal and nailing down the LC arrangements is critical to keeping the current rating We will also evaluate the longer term earnings potential relative to balance sheet debt any effective offbalance sheet debt and leases should they be utilized receivables monetizations and inventory salerepurchase agreements Until the MTBE arrangements are made and until EOTT rewins prior levels of open account credit capacity it seems that EOTTs annualized runrate EBITDA would be reduced by at least the missing million from the MTBE assets and the million millionmonth of lost margin due to reduced volumes and higher cost caused by living within your million LC ceiling and incurring higher LC fees Regards Andy Oram Original Message From Oram Andrew Sent Tuesday December PM To Cc Subject RE EOTT Followup Dear Lawrence and Susan I need to report back Wednesday to my bosses and to the EOTT rating committee with an update on EOTTs banking arrangements and confirmed LC capacity as well as provide insight into the other items covered in the following email I sent to you last Thursday Prior to tomorrows meeting Id hoped to have some feedback from you on the items discussed below I would be grateful to pass along any information you would like me to present to tomorrows rating committee Best regards Andy Original Message From Oram Andrew Sent Thursday December PM To Cc Subject EOTT Followup Many thanks for the email and phone message back I look forward to speaking Monday for an update If you get a chance it would be helpful to receive further insight by Monday on the following issues You mentioned below that the pipeline segment needs little LC support so well need to refine our own understanding of that Wed surmised that since the minority of pipeline revenue as reported comes from third parties and the large majority of pipeline revenue is reported to be coming from EOTT intersegment sources the intersegment volumes come from part of the North America Crude Oil Segments activity It would run some of its volumes at some point between the point of purchase and the point of delivery through the Pipeline segment If thats the case wed assume that North American Crude Oils needs to post LCs or gain open account standing with the sellerproducer should be counted as LCs needed for Pipeline throughput Substantial volumes is needed to generate Pipelines reported revenue volume x roughly tariff and the intersegment volumes and values crude price x volume are quite large Id be grateful if you could help us understand this a bit better To expand on your point below does that mean that Standard Chartered is honoring the full million of uncommitted arrangements to sell AR and inventory The hard sell I would have here is to state that Standard Chartered is going to provide million of interim credit availability million uncommitted and million interim committed to one customer If so great Also is there some ability to satisfy your LC needs by posting cash in lieu of LCs by selling more AR under the existing line RE any hedging activity on the Nymex can you comment how much if any cash is posted to support your hedging activity Regarding Enrons ownership we assume Enrons interest in EOTT was pledged to the lenders when Enron monetized its EOTT holdings I gather that your comment below states that the pledge of the Enron units and GP interest do not complicate a sale of EOTT to an industry partner if that were to become the optimal course of action Many thanks for any help you can provide Regards Andy Original Message From mailto Sent Thursday December AM To AndrewOrammoodyscom Cc Subject Re Phone Message Got your voice message and was pleased to see that you were successful in getting Moodys to take no action on this week We will call you on Monday to clarify the LC facility status which we expect to be favorable In the interim let me address a few of your points There is little LC capacity needed to support our pipeline revenues Negotiations wSC are for a committed LC facility for mm which have no impact on existing facilities A transaction wan industry player snot be significantly impacted by Enrons monetization of its equity interest which do not include the GP Oram Andrew Andrew To oodyscom cc Subject Phone Message AM Dear Lawrence I left two phone messages seeking information that would be helpful for an internal meeting here at pm EST today on EOTT They generally cover The bank negotiation status LCs and combined open account and LC capacity needed to support the pipeline segment We have our assumptions but I wanted to cross check this with you Clarification to be sure that Standard Chartered is prepared to give EOTT full access to both its million uncommitted facility about million utilized as of and its new committed short term million letter of credit facility A question or two on scenarios for doing a transaction with an industry partner also in light of Enrons earlier monetization of its interest in EOTT as I discussed in further detail in phone message Any further information you might provide beyond that from yesterdays phone call that would help us specify how EOTT will replace the credit support LCs beginning to rolloff next week would be helpful We understand you are pursuing several alternatives that may take time to formalize but anything tangible you can give us now would be very helpful Thank you and best regards Andy Oram The information contained in this email message and any attachment
