there I decided that things at work were too hectic and I couldnt spare the time away from the office I SO look forward to talking with you Have a wonderful evening So is it Survivor or Friends Original Message From mailto Sent Thursday April PM To Subject Hello Hey thereim trying to send you this thing againit just really reminded me of us in college Let me know if it still doesnt work As for mestill no wedding plans Your recap of life in armadillo sounds exactly like our life in houstonworkeatsleepworkeatsleepkind of depressingI often feel we are ships passing in the night and not romantic little newlyweds But we managed to take a vacation in park city a month agolearned to snowboard which was a blast We also have a longer trip planned in June to go to Alaska which I think will be good medicine for the day to day grind My job is going very well I am trading gas now for enron and trading that crazy california market you probably hear about on the newsvery exciting and the group is very fun Ive been able to do a lot of travelling as part of the perks of the job I went to portland in jan and skied for the first time in my adult lifeabsolutely loved it and booked a trip BY MYSELF yesby myself a month later in park city It was great Lots of time to myself and a great looking private ski instructor for hrs a day A few weeks ago I went to the Cayman Islands with my groupand couple of us are going to vegas this weekend I also went to south beach a month ago with a broker i do business with in newyork we have to go theredefinitely a girls trip Then lastly Ill be going to the kentucky derby next monthSo basically this has been like some huge dream I havent woken up from yet Unfortunately all this play comes at the wrong time in my lifethis is the life to have when you are right out of collegenot settling downBut oh wellI am definitely taking advantage of it knowing that in due time things will slow down John is liking his job and doing well Still a sweetheart We are looking at early for possible relocation from TX At this moment I hope to be able to transfer to our Portland office and trade powerbut more importantly live in what I think is the most beautiful state in the US Well see thoughthings certainly change with time and it is easy to keep pushing off something major like thatIm still shocked that I am still in houston Unfortunately and fortunately I really like my job right now finally The dogs are wellgrowing up fast Bought a harness for Jake and w john on a skateboard and me on bladeswe were pulled down the block at lightening speed chasing after a standard poodle last night It was hilarious What elsewhat elseI am done w c schooli did a program that was equivalent to a culinary degree I was working at a restaurant after that on saturdays and a bakery occasionallybut with this new jobi gave those things up and hardly have the time to cook and bakethough i do fit it in every once in a while Anywaywe should really see eachother in person You name the weekend and I will fly up to armadilloi am seriousand of course you are always more than welcome to come here It doesnt matter to me Alsoif you and Tom want to plan any sort of ski vacation next season and need peopleLET ME KNOW I plan to do a tremendous amount of that next year I think John might have knee surgery in Septemberso for the of us to goFebruary would be best or afterwe could always go to canadaI would love to go there My family is doing wellthough my gma is getting very old and slowvery sad My mom takes care of her when she is not working and it has been wearing on her as well Not just to give the carebut just to see her grow old Makes me sadsomething though that I think most families are having to deal with I have nephews and one niece I cant imagine with my current job situation and possible move to Portlandwhen we would have kidsthough I really want toit just sucksits such an either or situation career wise I dont want to have our kids raised by a sitter or a nanny if we can avoid it AUgh Sometimes I feel like I could just choke on all the pressureanxiety I sometimes feel about the whole thing Ive said before that I feel like age is just this big wall where I have to accomplish all these things before I get thereand then BAM have kids I just dont feel there yetbut I dont want to keep pushing the wall back AUGh Im sure we could rap a lot on this subjectwhich is why we should get together Like I said Name the date John and I have cell phones not a home phone Mine is John is You can also call me anytime though afternoons are much much better at work at Im looking forward to talking to you soon and hearing more about your job and how things are going Againlet me know if this thing below is unreadableI will fax it to you Take care LoveMO IT MAKES YOU THINK Sometime in between moving into the dorm And begging for an ID Somewhere in the middle of an oclock class And watching Friends on our inch TV Sometime after the night you forgot With the guy you dont remember Maybe before the five tests in three days Or the party every night in September Sometime in the car on the way to Daytona For the roadtrip of the year After class gets out with that gay TA After you finish the last warm beer Shortly after you figured out This newfangled email thing And after you stopped dreaming about The fun a ID would bring Maybe the morning after you pulled the allnighter But finally got the paper done Or maybe when you cant remember The last Sunday night you had fun Somewhere between the day you met your dorm roommate And you were sure you got one of the duds And the day years later when shes still your roommate And shes one of your best buds Definitely after you realized how lucky you are To have such a great group of friends And after you get that sick feeling in you stomach Wondering what will happen when it ends Maybe on the beach for spring break Hot sun tan bodies cold beer Maybe after you started looking for a job And your happy world turned to fear Soon after you discovered theres just not enough time To do everything you should But not before you realized Thanksgiving dinner Never tasted so good Sometime after the day your parents came to visit So you were forced to make your bed Or the morning after a tough night at the bars And you cant believe the things you said Sometime after you enjoy the beautiful weather Though it means missing a class Probably after laughing on Homecoming weekend Watching old alumni drunk off their collective ass Somewhere between day one and year four The best years of your life were spent And looking back with a smile and a sigh You wonder where those years went You try to figure out who made you a victim Of the most serious crime You offer a reward for any information leading To the one who stole the time The day is coming closer and closer Until one day it will be your last And someone is guilty of doing this to you The years have gone way too fast Sometime when you were too busy to notice Happy as a newborn pup Someone came along and did the unthinkable Somebody grew us up Kristi Weaber on PM Please respond to To cc Subject RE Fwd Its only taken me months to reply Ive been meaning to write you back and tell you that my attachment didnt open I was at home a few weeks ago and figured that you probably had broken down and gotten a normal telephone with a listed number by now but I was wrong I will not gloss over the fact that I have failed miserably as the friend of a newly engaged person in that I have not been seeking regular updates from you on the progress of everything Also I generally wonder how you are doing outside of that premarital thing Have you determined a time frame for the marriage Location Houston vs Bali How is work going Are you still taking culinary classes Is John still with the Canadian company or at least the company that does a lot of work in Canada How is your Grandma Mother Jake Things here in Armadillo are status quo We just work sleep eat work sleep eat eat some more and occasionally do things with the few couple friends we have in town Pretty boring life but it keeps up too damn busy Its all perspective I suppose I miss you terribly and hope that you can describe for me what I was supposed to be able to open as an attachment Im not sure why it didnt work Take care and I look forward to talking with you soon Kristi Original Message From mailto Sent Monday September PM To Subject Fwd Okay Everything in this email reminded me of our shenanigans in college Enjoy the walk down memory
