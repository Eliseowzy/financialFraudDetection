Lydia Cannon Jolie Carter Juanita Carter Karen Ener ITOLCOM Subject Fwd Fw REALLY CUTE This is dedicated to every woman who ever attempted to get into a regular workout routine or use one of those AbDoer machines Dear Diary For my fiftieth birthday this year my husband the dear purchased a week of personal training at the local health club for me Although I am still in great shape since playing on my high school softball team I decided it would be a good idea to go ahead and give it a try I called the club and made my reservations with a personal trainer Ill call Bruce who identified himself as a yearold aerobics instructor and model for clothing and swimwear My husband seemed pleased with my enthusiasm to get started The club encouraged me to keep a diary to chart my progress Monday Started my day at am Tough to get out of bed but found it was well worth it when I arrived at the health club to find Bruce waiting for me He is something of a Greek God with blond hair dancing eyes and a dazzling white smile Woo Hoo Bruce gave me a tour and showed me the machines He took my pulse after five minutes on the treadmill He was alarmed that my pulse was so fast but I attribute it to standing next to him in his Lycra aerobic outfit I enjoyed watching the skillful way in which he conducted his aerobics class after my workout today Very inspiring Bruce was encouraging as I did my situps although my gut was already aching from holding it in the whole time he was around This is going to be a FANTASTIC week Tuesday I drank a whole pot of coffee but I finally made it out the door Bruce made me lie on my back and push a heavy iron bar into the air then he put weights on it My legs were a little wobbly on the treadmill but I made the full mile Bruces rewarding smile made it all worthwhile I feel GREAT Its a whole new life for me Wednesday The only way I can brush my teeth is by laying on the toothbrush on the counter and moving my mouth back and forth over it I believe I have a hernia in both pectorals Driving was okay as long as I didnt try to steer or stop I parked on top of a GEO in the club parking lot Bruce was impatient with me insisting that my screams bothered other club members His voice is a little too perky for early in the morning and when he scolds he gets this nasally whine that is VERY annoying My chest hurt when I got on the treadmill so Bruce put me on the stair monster Why the hell would anyone invent a machine to simulate an activity rendered obsolete by elevators Bruce told me it would help me get in shape and enjoy life He said some other shit too Thursday Bruce was waiting for me with his vampirelike teeth exposed as his thin cruel lips were pulled back into a full snarl I couldnt help being a half an hour late it took me that long to tie my shoes Bruce took me to work out with dumbbells When he was not looking I ran and hid in the mens room He sent Lars to find me then as punishment put me on the rowing machine which I sank Friday I hate that bastard Bruce more than any human being has ever hated any other human being in the history of the world Stupid skinny anemic little cheerleader wannabe bastard If there were a part of my body I could move without unbearable pain I would beat him with it Bruce wanted me to work on my triceps I dont have any triceps And if you dont want dents in the floor dont hand me the barbells or anything that weighs more than a sandwich Which I am sure you learned in the sadist school you attended and graduated magna cum laude from Bruce you Nazi bastard The treadmill flung me off and I landed on a health and nutrition teacher Why couldnt it have been someone softer like the drama coach or the choir director Saturday Bruce left a message on my answering machine in his grating shrilly voice wondering why I did not show up today Just hearing him made me want to smash the machine with my planner However I lacked the strength even to use the TV remote and ended up catching eleven straight hours of the Weather Channel Sunday Im having the Church van pick me up for services today so I can go and thank GOD that this week is over I will also pray that next year my husband the BASTARD will choose a gift for me that is fun like a root canal or a hysterectomy Suzanne Cox Tenor Networks S Syracuse Way Suite Greenwood Village CO fax Do You Yahoo Yahoo Photos Share your holiday

Lydia Cannon Jolie Carter Juanita Carter Karen Ener ITOLCOM Subject Fwd Fw REALLY CUTE This is dedicated to every woman who ever attempted to get into a regular workout routine or use one of those AbDoer machines Dear Diary For my fiftieth birthday this year my husband the dear purchased a week of personal training at the local health club for me Although I am still in great shape since playing on my high school softball team I decided it would be a good idea to go ahead and give it a try I called the club and made my reservations with a personal trainer Ill call Bruce who identified himself as a yearold aerobics instructor and model for clothing and swimwear My husband seemed pleased with my enthusiasm to get started The club encouraged me to keep a diary to chart my progress Monday Started my day at am Tough to get out of bed but found it was well worth it when I arrived at the health club to find Bruce waiting for me He is something of a Greek God with blond hair dancing eyes and a dazzling white smile Woo Hoo Bruce gave me a tour and showed me the machines He took my pulse after five minutes on the treadmill He was alarmed that my pulse was so fast but I attribute it to standing next to him in his Lycra aerobic outfit I enjoyed watching the skillful way in which he conducted his aerobics class after my workout today Very inspiring Bruce was encouraging as I did my situps although my gut was already aching from holding it in the whole time he was around This is going to be a FANTASTIC week Tuesday I drank a whole pot of coffee but I finally made it out the door Bruce made me lie on my back and push a heavy iron bar into the air then he put weights on it My legs were a little wobbly on the treadmill but I made the full mile Bruces rewarding smile made it all worthwhile I feel GREAT Its a whole new life for me Wednesday The only way I can brush my teeth is by laying on the toothbrush on the counter and moving my mouth back and forth over it I believe I have a hernia in both pectorals Driving was okay as long as I didnt try to steer or stop I parked on top of a GEO in the club parking lot Bruce was impatient with me insisting that my screams bothered other club members His voice is a little too perky for early in the morning and when he scolds he gets this nasally whine that is VERY annoying My chest hurt when I got on the treadmill so Bruce put me on the stair monster Why the hell would anyone invent a machine to simulate an activity rendered obsolete by elevators Bruce told me it would help me get in shape and enjoy life He said some other shit too Thursday Bruce was waiting for me with his vampirelike teeth exposed as his thin cruel lips were pulled back into a full snarl I couldnt help being a half an hour late it took me that long to tie my shoes Bruce took me to work out with dumbbells When he was not looking I ran and hid in the mens room He sent Lars to find me then as punishment put me on the rowing machine which I sank Friday I hate that bastard Bruce more than any human being has ever hated any other human being in the history of the world Stupid skinny anemic little cheerleader wannabe bastard If there were a part of my body I could move without unbearable pain I would beat him with it Bruce wanted me to work on my triceps I dont have any triceps And if you dont want dents in the floor dont hand me the barbells or anything that weighs more than a sandwich Which I am sure you learned in the sadist school you attended and graduated magna cum laude from Bruce you Nazi bastard The treadmill flung me off and I landed on a health and nutrition teacher Why couldnt it have been someone softer like the drama coach or the choir director Saturday Bruce left a message on my answering machine in his grating shrilly voice wondering why I did not show up today Just hearing him made me want to smash the machine with my planner However I lacked the strength even to use the TV remote and ended up catching eleven straight hours of the Weather Channel Sunday Im having the Church van pick me up for services today so I can go and thank GOD that this week is over I will also pray that next year my husband the BASTARD will choose a gift for me that is fun like a root canal or a hysterectomy Suzanne Cox Tenor Networks S Syracuse Way Suite Greenwood Village CO fax Do You Yahoo Yahoo Photos Share your holiday

Lydia Cannon Jolie Carter Juanita Carter Karen Ener ITOLCOM Subject Fwd Fw REALLY CUTE This is dedicated to every woman who ever attempted to get into a regular workout routine or use one of those AbDoer machines Dear Diary For my fiftieth birthday this year my husband the dear purchased a week of personal training at the local health club for me Although I am still in great shape since playing on my high school softball team I decided it would be a good idea to go ahead and give it a try I called the club and made my reservations with a personal trainer Ill call Bruce who identified himself as a yearold aerobics instructor and model for clothing and swimwear My husband seemed pleased with my enthusiasm to get started The club encouraged me to keep a diary to chart my progress Monday Started my day at am Tough to get out of bed but found it was well worth it when I arrived at the health club to find Bruce waiting for me He is something of a Greek God with blond hair dancing eyes and a dazzling white smile Woo Hoo Bruce gave me a tour and showed me the machines He took my pulse after five minutes on the treadmill He was alarmed that my pulse was so fast but I attribute it to standing next to him in his Lycra aerobic outfit I enjoyed watching the skillful way in which he conducted his aerobics class after my workout today Very inspiring Bruce was encouraging as I did my situps although my gut was already aching from holding it in the whole time he was around This is going to be a FANTASTIC week Tuesday I drank a whole pot of coffee but I finally made it out the door Bruce made me lie on my back and push a heavy iron bar into the air then he put weights on it My legs were a little wobbly on the treadmill but I made the full mile Bruces rewarding smile made it all worthwhile I feel GREAT Its a whole new life for me Wednesday The only way I can brush my teeth is by laying on the toothbrush on the counter and moving my mouth back and forth over it I believe I have a hernia in both pectorals Driving was okay as long as I didnt try to steer or stop I parked on top of a GEO in the club parking lot Bruce was impatient with me insisting that my screams bothered other club members His voice is a little too perky for early in the morning and when he scolds he gets this nasally whine that is VERY annoying My chest hurt when I got on the treadmill so Bruce put me on the stair monster Why the hell would anyone invent a machine to simulate an activity rendered obsolete by elevators Bruce told me it would help me get in shape and enjoy life He said some other shit too Thursday Bruce was waiting for me with his vampirelike teeth exposed as his thin cruel lips were pulled back into a full snarl I couldnt help being a half an hour late it took me that long to tie my shoes Bruce took me to work out with dumbbells When he was not looking I ran and hid in the mens room He sent Lars to find me then as punishment put me on the rowing machine which I sank Friday I hate that bastard Bruce more than any human being has ever hated any other human being in the history of the world Stupid skinny anemic little cheerleader wannabe bastard If there were a part of my body I could move without unbearable pain I would beat him with it Bruce wanted me to work on my triceps I dont have any triceps And if you dont want dents in the floor dont hand me the barbells or anything that weighs more than a sandwich Which I am sure you learned in the sadist school you attended and graduated magna cum laude from Bruce you Nazi bastard The treadmill flung me off and I landed on a health and nutrition teacher Why couldnt it have been someone softer like the drama coach or the choir director Saturday Bruce left a message on my answering machine in his grating shrilly voice wondering why I did not show up today Just hearing him made me want to smash the machine with my planner However I lacked the strength even to use the TV remote and ended up catching eleven straight hours of the Weather Channel Sunday Im having the Church van pick me up for services today so I can go and thank GOD that this week is over I will also pray that next year my husband the BASTARD will choose a gift for me that is fun like a root canal or a hysterectomy Suzanne Cox Tenor Networks S Syracuse Way Suite Greenwood Village CO fax Do You Yahoo Yahoo Photos Share your holiday
