Adams Date November Highlights Scotts Patriotic Duty Boss and Coworker Quotes Holiday Gift Ideas True Tales of Induhviduals DNRC Update There are people in the DNRC each more attractive generous and intelligent than those who do not read the free Dilbert Newsletter Maybe thats a coincidence but Im starting to doubt it My Patriotic Duty Ive been wondering about the best way to offer my patriotic services in this time of global conflict I dont think Id be a good candidate for Special Ops Id be the one with the wheeled carryon bag saying Hey guys I have sand in my shoe Is anyone else hungry Can I use my flashlight now Im already donating money to patriotic causes and I bought some plastic flags made in China but I felt I needed to do more Then it hit me There is one patriotic duty for which I have prepared my entire life dehumanizing the enemy In a sense thats been my fulltime job for years I just need to replace the word management with Taliban So lets get started Ive been trying to figure out the Talibans longterm strategy and I think I got it Theyre trying to reverse evolution Their uncontrolled body hair is a good start Living in caves was an obvious step too The hard part was eliminating any trace of intelligence in the children But theyve made great strides in that area Have you seen the video of the Taliban schools where the little kids squat on the floor and rock back and forth chanting all day No math no social studies just rocking and chanting For PE they use sticks to whack stuffed dummies labeled Bush and Blair Im not sure how they know how to spell Bush and Blair On any given morning theyre probably whacking dummies labeled Tqwft and Upxpgt but its a good aerobic workout either way Just for fun ask yourself what part of the Taliban curriculum could NOT be accomplished by for example a monkey Rocking back and forth Chanting Beating a dummy with a stick Even if a monkey only got a D in chanting he would still graduate with honors from a Taliban school thanks to his high overall grades in rocking and whacking As I write this our generals are trying to figure out how to get the Taliban out of their caves Theyre running sophisticated war game scenarios and calculating risks and gathering intelligence I have one word for them bananas I dont want my patriotic words misconstrued as ethnic or religious insults As soon as the evildoers stop doing evil I am willing to promote them to fullfledged Induhviduals and insult them on equal footing with everyone else who doesnt read the Dilbert Newsletter Now that weve dehumanized the Taliban lets get on to the important work of dehumanizing our bosses coworkers and family members Induhvidual Confusion Some topics seem to confuse Induhviduals more than others For example they seem to have special trouble with concepts involving wildlife vision and their own pants See for yourself in these true quotes from Induhvidual bosses and Coworkers submitted by DNRC members A VP was speaking at a meeting and said Well you can lead a horse to water but you cant make him crap Someone up front said Thats drinkcant make him drink To which the VP said Thats stupid In the kingdom of the blind the oneeyed horse is king A coworker once said Looks like hes thrown a wrench in the monkeyworks A twoprawn approach is necessary Here is a mangled expression the CIO at our company told me the other day We were discussing an issue we both agreed upon and he said I was preaching to the blind He wont last hes just a flash in the pants One of the employees called in to say that she couldnt come to work because she had to have an autopsy My boss was telling a very involved story about something that happened to him He leaned back nonchalantly and offered as a philosophical summary Sometimes fact is stranger than truth Its a catch Our former boss suffered from the excessive use of mixed metaphors An alltime howler was the day we asked him what his plans were to ensure success for a campaign and his reply was Dont worry Ive got an ace up my hole At a management meeting my CEO said Our company is like a living orgasm Now thats what I call job satisfaction I overheard a manager congratulating an Induhvidual on having achieved a goal The Induhvidual replied It was nothing You planted the seed and I ran with it In a meeting a coworker of mine referred to the carrot at the end of the tunnel We are going to be shooting from the seat of our pants on this one These all came from the same boss Vision is in the eyes of the beholder Part of the verbiage is a language thing Eventually I want it now Its not that kind of zero There are a lot of areas for efficiency reductions In the last year youve turned around When a highpowered agent of the company walked into the lunch room our secretary remarked to our group that she couldnt stand him because he was so egotesticle One of my coworkers spit coffee out of his nose which just added to the moment I think you might have hit the nail on the button caught between a rock and a wet spot And my nomination for scariest thing a boss ever said I was thinking about you in the shower this morning and I thought of a name for you IMVironment on

Induhviduals Here now more true tales of Induhviduals as submitted by members of the DNRC The story in your last newsletter about the kid named Ampersand reminded me of another version I heard recently One of my relatives met a woman who wanted to call her kid LATRINE It took me an hour to stop laughing long enough to ask if anybody had pointed out what a latrine is They had She was apparently still intent on using it When I received my new credit card it had the number two after my name instead of Roman numeral II as it should have indicating that my name is the same as my fathers I called the banks customer service number and asked that their records be changed to use the Roman numeral two II instead of the number two The customer service rep said Im sorry sir My computer doesnt have Roman numerals I just went to see the Cirque du Soleil During one performance where a man and woman were flying around by having scarves under their arms attached to this huge wheel thing in the air while doing complicated acrobatics at the same time an Induhvidual behind me said to her companion That must take a lot of practice At my bookstore a customer returned three of Shakespeares books because The DARN things are in the form of PLAYS At the grocery store the checkout woman scanned all of my items then picked up the rubber divider and looked it over for the bar code so she could scan it She asked Do you know how much this is I said Ive changed my mind I dont think Ill buy that today She said Okay I paid her and left Dilbert Fodder Whats bugging you about your job Let me know and you might see it in a Dilbert comic or newsletter The best comic fodder involves workplace peeves devious strategies frustrations of dealing with others conflicting objectives
