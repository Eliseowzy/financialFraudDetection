Telegram Gazette Staff BOSTON Considerable progress has been made to restructure the states electric power industry but four years into the process several lingering issues need revisiting officials said yesterday At a daylong forum at the Federal Reserve legislators utility executives and consumer advocates said the law likely needs some finetuning but the benefits of restructuring have largely come to pass The restructuring law passed amid the promise of lower electric rates and competitive suppliers has not been a panacea but it has done much of what was intended said James Connelly chairman of the Department of Telecommunications and Energy A robust retail market has failed to emerged but restructuring has shepherded into place a surplus of wholesale power that insulates the region from Californialike problems Mr Connelly told an audience of about For the first time in Massachusetts default customers for one utility Fitchburg Gas and Electric Light Co are poised to pay less than their standardoffer counterparts he said We hope thats indicative of things to come Mr Connelly said Weve got some work to do on that but hopefully well see something shortly that will push that ball further down the field DTE which was battered last year for allowing utilities to recoup the costs of rising fuel prices made the right call Mr Connelly said The process might have been painful but it sent a message to the market that should stir more interest from other suppliers House Speaker Thomas M Finneran who organized the event said he wanted to hear a broad range of opinions before considering how to address the laws potential shortcomings Im encouraged by what I see and hear Mr Finneran said during a break I like to think were taking a longterm view If Massachusetts is to succeed we need a dependable supply of energy Without that you revert to the same status as a Third World country Mr Finneran said he was not concerned only businesses and residential customers have opted to purchase electricity from a competitive supplier even though it was one of the restructuring acts goals He said the rapid price increases last year kept many people from leaving their standardoffer service but falling prices in recent weeks will likely prompt many customers to consider a competitive supplier Its not a fatal consequence Mr Finneran said We need to get a more robust market out there and how we do that is one of the issues we need to talk more about Standardoffer service which will be phased out was crafted to give customers savings of percent during the first two years of restructuring Defaultservice customers are those who signed up for power after the industrys March restructuring moved to a different utility service territory or returned to their old utility after leaving a competitive power supplier Standardoffer customers are those who have bought power from the same utility since before restructuring Standardoffer customers initially saw price cuts totaling an estimated billion but those subsidies curtailed suppliers from entering the market Mr Connelly said The temptation to extend standardoffer service should be resisted he said It was necessary to give consumers a sense of value but it has been a major roadblock to the emergence of competitive suppliers Rep John J Binienda Sr DWorcester said new air emissions standards might need revisiting because they would likely force some older power plants to go offline Losing that reliable supply of energy might be a problem if it cannot be easily replaced said Mr Binienda chairman of the House Energy Committee David L OConnor commissioner of the Division of Energy Resources said current price trends are encouraging but the state remains a long way away from achieving the full vision of restructuring Utilities such as Massachusetts Electric and NSTAR which were to be solely distribution companies remain involved in procurement because of few competitive suppliers he said Shortterm price hikes for wholesale power have yet to curtail the retail demand for electricity and the reliability of some distribution companies has been poor in some cases he said This is a symptom of a system that remains relatively immature Mr OConnor said Under the law investorowned utilities moved out of the generating business and became mostly distribution companies But the laws fine print also enabled utilities to recoup millions they say they have lost from selling power at prices below the cost of generation Those added costs soared last year because of rising oil and natural gas prices producing a tempest which put the law under reexamination Cheryl A LaFleur president and chief executive officer of Massachusetts Electric said now is the time to study restructuring the industry because standardoffer service ends Feb She said standardoffer rates and default rates are quite close and will likely fall if fuel prices continue to decline Competitive suppliers are still not interested in the retail market said both Ms LaFleur and George R Gantz senior vice president of Unitil Corp the parent of Fitchburg Gas and Electric Light The transition to a marketbased environment for energy generation has not always been palatable but the law is fundamentally sound and workable Mr Connelly said DTE has tried to walk a tight rope this year balancing the needs of consumers against those of an industry vital to everyones wellbeing he said The rolling blackouts in California this year showed everyone how hard a job that can be he said California showed that a public utilities commission can kill a market by doing foolish and cowardly things he said Copyright Worcester Telegram Gazette Corp
