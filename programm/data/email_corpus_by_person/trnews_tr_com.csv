which issues telecom related or not will come to a head under a Democraticled Commerce Science and Transportation Committee But incoming Chairman Ernest F Hollings D SC already has singled out one item for immediate attention downsizing the Commerce Committee The panel gained two seats for a total of at the outset of the th Congress Under a Senate powersharing pact that went into effect last January all the committees were drawn up to reflect the Senates split between Democrats and Republicans TR Jan But with Sen James Jeffordss R Vt departure from the GOP expected to take effect this

final determination the spokesman told TR today It is too early to discuss specific Commerce Committee agenda items for the remainder of the year the Hollings spokesman said But before he begins pushing an agenda Sen Hollings will confer with current Commerce Committee Chairman John McCain R Ariz he added While the committees priorities have yet to be determined the style in which they work

behalf of mobile phone users who claimed their privacy was invaded Their phone records were reviewed without their permission as part of the research project the plaintiffs said Wireless Technology Research LLC has agreed to turn over the remaining million of a million insurance policy that the wireless industry purchased for it in the wake of the litigation As part of the settlement agreement of those funds will be set aside to fund a voluntary surveillance registry to assess whether there is a link between mobile phone use and illnesses The registry will be run by WTR Chairman George L Carlo who had a falling out with the wireless industry after he accused it of failing to act on research that he said indicated a link between mobile phone use and adverse health effects The settlement also reserves for future legal expenses of Mr Carlo and WTR In addition mobile phone subscribers included in the class would get a discount on a book Mr Carlo coauthored last year Cell

Association which is a defendant in the case also declined to comment saying industry attorneys were reviewing the proposed settlement CLEC ASKS FCC TO STAY RECIPROCAL COMPENSATION ORDER Competitive local exchange carrier CLEC Core Communications Inc CoreTel has asked the FCC to stay the effectiveness of a recent order overhauling reciprocal compensation rules The new rules are designed to phase out payments received by carriers for connecting calls to Internet service providers ISPs CoreTel said the order could force it to abandon some of its markets CoreTel took issue with two provisions of the order in Common Carrier dockets and TR April One is the ban on carriers receiving reciprocal compensation for terminating calls to ISPs in any new markets entered after the adoption of the order The other is the growth cap provision which limits annual increases in a carriers reciprocal compensation revenue The order allows CLECs that already are operating in a particular geographic area to continue receiving reciprocal compensation revenues up to the limit set by the growth cap while hampering new CLECs CoreTel noted That situation puts new CLECs entering those markets at an extreme competitive disadvantage it said The business that CoreTel will lose as a result of these new rules and the competitive advantage they confer on established CLECs is incalculable and irremediable at some later date CoreTel said It will suffer irreparable harm if the provisions arent stayed pending judicial review the company added NEWS IN BRIEF New FCC Cable Bureau Chief Kenneth Ferree has

Wood has proposed rules to regulate the inclusion of noncommunications charges on phone bills Existing law which authorizes only communications related charges on phone bills is scheduled to expire

noncommunications charges Telecom companies may not disconnect or threaten to disconnect basic local phone service for nonpayment of noncommunications charges Under the proposed rules telecom

Utilities Commission require Pacific Bell to permit MCImetro Access Transmission Services LLCs customers to presubscribe to Pacific Bells intraLATA local access and transport area long distance service The recommendation was made in a draft arbitrators report about the companies interconnection agreement Pacific Bell said the requirement would be confusing to customers and would require the company to identify a separate billing channel or generate a bill solely for intraLATA long distance service It is blatantly discriminatory for Pacific to refuse to provide intraLATA toll service to MCIs local service customers Ms Jones said She said Pacifics arguments of customer confusion and billing concerns do not have merit Customers could receive three different bills for the three different services and other carriers cope with billing for only one of those three services There is no reason that Pacific should not be able to provide a bill which includes only intraLATA services

Bells deadline for filing information demonstrating its compliance with the interLATA local access and transport area marketentry requirements of section of California code The section requires the

fully open local exchange access and that the company isnt engaging in anticompetitive behavior or improper crosssubsidization Pacific Bell asked the PUC to extend the deadline from June until midJune

It ordered trunks in the Grinnell and Sigourney exchanges although it has no assigned NXX codes there The companys tariff also fails to include a residential rate It was deleted in a Jan tariff

encourage increased subscribership and infrastructure rollout in tribal areas Common Carrier docket MICHIGAN Customers can bring complaints without counsel The Public Service Commission yesterday ruled that business and residential telephone customers can bring slamming or cramming complaints to the commission without the assistance of an attorney The PSCs ruling involved a complaint filed by Seaway Painting LLC against WorldCom Inc about a billing dispute The PSC dismissed the complaint as requested by the petitioner but concluded that Seaway may refile its complaint and proceed with the assistance of a person of its choice who need not be a licensed attorney The commission based its decision on a provision of the Michigan Telecommunications Act which provides Hearings shall be conducted in a manner as to optimize expediency convenience and the ability of end users to bring and prosecute without the assistance of counsel complaints alleging slamming or cramming while

transport area services in the state The company expects to file its application later this month with the FCC which under the Telecommunications Act of will consult with the US Department of Justice and the relevant state regulators before issuing a decision The state regulators role is to advise the FCC on whether a Bell company has complied with the local exchange marketopening mandates of the Act In a vote the PUC told Verizon that it must agree to a permanent performance assurance plan with selfexecuting remedies based on the New York model already accepted by the FCC The company also must withdraw its pending judicial challenge of the PUCs authority to impose remedies aimed at preventing backsliding on local exchange marketopening commitments The PUC said the company must agree to

PROCEDURES Two environmental groups have launched an attack on the FCCs antenna licensing process saying the agency should assess the direct indirect and cumulative effects before issuing new licenses Friends of the Earth and the Forest Conservation Council issued their appeal in petitions asking the FCC to deny antenna license applications The groups say the environmental assessments prepared for those projects fail to include the information and analysis mandated by the National Environmental Policy Act NEPA Council of Envi ronmental Quality regulations and FCC rules In addition applicants failed to meet the requirements of the Endangered Species Act the Clean Water Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act the groups allege The companies seeking permission to build the new antennas dismiss the charges They say their applications fully comply with applicable regulations The environmental groups fail to provide any specific justification or evidence against their projects and lack standing in the proceeding the companies say The groups challenge should be raised in a formal rulemaking proceeding they add Of course the Commission must consider and evaluate goodfaith challenges to environmental compliance American Tower LP said in defense of its plans for a Maryland antenna tower Complaints as vague insubstantial and deficient as those in the present petition however are unfair waste already strained compliance resources of both Commission and applicants and can cause serious harm to a given tower project or even to the overall industry through unnecessary

MODEM OPENACCESS TRIAL onlinetrdtdTdhtm NEWS IN BRIEF onlinetrdtdTdhtm SBC WITHDRAWS BID TO OFFER InterLATA SERVICES IN MISSOURI SBC Communications Inc today withdrew its petition to offer inregion interLATA local access and transport area services in Missouri in the face of FCC concerns about rates for unbundled network elements and the adequacy of its operation support systems OSSs SBC said it would provide additional evidence supporting its Missouri application and refile a petition with the FCC as soon as possible The FCC would have days after the filing of the new petition to decide whether SBC had complied with section of the Telecommunications Act of which mandates that Bell operating companies meet a point competitive checklist of marketopening requirements before they can offer inregion interLATA services Refiling the application would enable SBC to further address questions raised by the Department of Justice and others over SBCs original application as well as provide updated evidence of continued compliance with section SBC said Justice didnt recommend that the FCC reject the application but it did raise several questions including whether SBCs unbundled network element rates in Missouri complied with the FCCs TELRIC totalelement longrun incremental cost standard TR May We believe our application for Missouri passes all the tests and Missouri regulators agreed by unanimously endorsing our application said Priscilla HillArdoin SBC senior vice president Our markets are open as the rapid growth of competition in the state demonstrates But it is important that our application record include a comprehensive response to several new issues raised since our Missouri application was filed We would rather the FCC vote on the most current information available In a statement issued late this afternoon FCC Chairman Michael K Powell said During the FCC Common Carrier Bureaus review of SBCs section application for authority to offer long distance service in Missouri concerns surfaced related to cost based pricing in its region and operation support systems OSS Given these concerns SBC has chosen to withdraw the application Mr Powell said the proceeding was terminated until such time as SBC has addressed these issues and is prepared to resubmit its application LAWMAKERS POLICY ADVOCATES PITCH BROADBAND SERVICE BILLS With key votes on broadband services legislation approaching in the House including a possible floor vote on HR later this month telecom lawmakers and industry officials today made a new round of policy pitches on the subject Their audience was the more than congressional staffers at todays Internet Caucus luncheon in the US Capitol The luncheon at times seemed like a minihearing Lawmakers offered their usual arguments challenged each others claims and asked those in attendance for support In a separate panel held later industry representatives drew swords over broadband services legislation Carrying the flag for the Bell companies bill of choice the Internet Freedom and Broadband Deployment Act HR were Rep WJ Billy Tauzin R La its author and Reps Rick Boucher D Va and Bob Goodlatte R Va Filling out the congressional panel were two of the more outspoken skeptics of the datarelief legislation Reps Steve Largent R Okla and Christopher Cannon R Utah Rep Largent argued that HR s provision to eliminate the in region interLATA local access and transport area restrictions on the Bell companies provision of data services would remove the Bells incentive to open their local markets Its like changing the rules of the game in the middle of the game he said No other industry has that kind of domination by one entity like the Bells do in the local loop Rep Tauzin fired back saying the Bell companies were always in the middle of a game The point marketopening checklist found in section of the Telecommunications Act of has become points he said And the FCC has gummed things up so badly that ATT Corp can sit there beautifully and stymie entry into the cable modem market he said HR would correct that discrepancy and spur competition by putting the Bells provision of advanced services on equal regulatory footing with the broadband offerings of cable TV providers said Reps Boucher and Tauzin But ATT loves the status quo so much thats why theyve spent all this money on TV ads opposing HR Rep Tauzin said There is a good chance that HR will be taken up on the House floor before the July break he said Rep Cannon who advocates a different approach to spurring advanced service deployment said ATT Chairman and Chief Executive Officer C Michael Armstrong told him yesterday that Congresss consideration of HR has contributed to Wall Streets sour outlook on the competitive local exchange carrier CLEC industry Mr Armstrong said he had no interest in buying a CLEC as long as HR is out there Rep Cannon said I dont agree that those companies are failing because of bad business plans he added The Bells have blocked their access to local markets During the industry panel HR s provision to scale back the FCCs rules on line sharing sparked debate between Larry Clinton vice presidentlarge company affairs for the US Telecom Association and Thomas Koutsky VPlaw and public policy for ZTel Technologies Inc If you want competition for local phone service you dont want line sharing Mr Clinton told attendees But Mr Koutsky said the point of line sharing and unbundling was to provide rings for CLECs to climb into the market Passage of HR would remove those marketaccess elements he said CARRIERS ASK WIRELESS BUREAU TO RETHINK E DECISION Four carriers have asked the FCCs Wireless Telecommunications Bureau to reconsider its decision regarding who should pay for Phase I enhanced E systems In a May letter bureau Chief Thomas J Sugrue said the selective router maintained by incumbent local exchange carriers was the proper demarcation point for allocating E implementation costs between wireless carriers and public safety answering points PSAPs TR May Mr Sugrue was responding to a request for clarification from the King County Wash E program TR Aug The bureaus decision supported the PSAPs argument regarding the demarcation point Carriers on the other hand had maintained that PSAPs should be responsible for E network components or upgrades beginning at the wireless carriers mobile switching center not the selective router In a petition filed yesterday in Common Carrier docket Qwest Wireless LLC Verizon Wireless VoiceStream Wireless Corp and Nextel Communications Inc said the bureaus decision is inconsistent with the Commissions rules and underlying orders and is beyond the bureaus delegated authority They asked the bureau to designate the mobile switching center as the demarcation point The carriers charged that the bureau failed to follow the Ad ministrative Procedure Acts mandate that it consider and respond to significant comments filed in the record of the proceeding The companies also said the bureaus decision required a formal rulemaking by the full Commission MCI SHARES BEGIN TRADING AGAIN AS WorldCom ISSUES TRACKING STOCK WorldCom Inc has split each share of its common stock into two tracking stocks one of which will reflect the performance of the unit that provides long distance service to consumers and small businesses WorldCom is calling that unit the MCI Group because WorldCom acquired most of that business when it bought MCI Communications Corp The MCI Group also includes WorldComs wireless messaging and dialup Internet access operations The other tracking stock will reflect the performance of the WorldCom Group which includes the companys highgrowth data Internet international and commercial voice businesses Each existing WorldCom share has been converted into one WorldCom Group tracking share and of an MCI Group tracking share Bernard J Ebbers WorldComs president and chief executive officer has been talking for nearly a year about separating the slowgrowing consumer long distance business from the faster growing WorldCom operations TR July The split was approved today at a shareholders meeting in Clinton Miss The two tracking stocks will provide two distinct clear and compelling investment opportunities Mr Ebbers said The MCI Group stock will pay a quarterly dividend of cents per share WorldCom shares wont pay a dividend The new shares will begin trading tomorrow on the Nasdaq stock market ATT COMPLETES CABLE MODEM OPENACCESS TRIAL ATT Broadband today said it had completed a sixmonth trial in Boulder Colo that allowed multiple Internet service providers ISPs to offer highspeed access over ATTs cable modem platform The company said it was on schedule to offer consumers their choice of cable modem ISPs by mid ATT Broadband said more than endusers and four ISPs participated in the trial which cost about million The Boulder trial will be

applications by yearend from Bell companies eager to provide inregion interLATA local access and transport area services Under section of the Telecom munications Act of before a Bell company can offer in region interLATA services it must show that it has complied with a point competitive checklist of local marketopening man dates Section stipulates that the FCC has the final say on whether a Bell company is allowed to offer inregion interLATA services The FCC however must consult with the US Department of Justice and the relevant state commissions before reaching a decision Without state commission backing receiving FCC approval is thought to be virtually impossible With the Nov nod of approval from the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission Verizon Rhode Island Incs interLATA application filing with the FCC is imminent a Verizon spokesper son said Verizon Rhode Islands sister telcos in New Hampshire Maine Vermont and New Jersey are waiting for their respective state regulator to complete reviews of the telcos compliance with section A Verizon spokesperson said the company expected the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities to reach a decision sometime next month Verizon will file with the FCC soon thereafter The spokesperson cited competitors and regulators concerns about the pricing of interconnection and unbundled network elements UNEs as a frequent obstacle in getting state endorsement of Verizons interLATA bids In New Jersey for example the consumer advocate has talked about the low number of lines served by competitors and she blames pricing for this the spokesperson said But local rates are so low in New Jersey that its difficult for competi tors to enter the market Verizon already has received FCC approval to provide interLATA services in New York Connecticut Massachusetts and Pennsylvania BellSouth Telecommunications Inc is awaiting the FCCs deci sion on whether or not it should be allowed to offer interLATA services in Georgia and Louisiana The Commissions decision is expected Dec BellSouth received state commission support for its interLATA service bid in Mississippi Oct and the South Carolina commissions backing Nov A company spokesperson said BellSouth might submit the two states applications together when it files at the FCC State commission hearings on BellSouths interLATA service applications have ended in North Carolina Florida and Kentucky but the commissions have yet to issue decisions The Alabama Public Service Commission has scheduled hearings Nov and on BellSouths thirdparty OSS operation support system test ing The Tennessee Regulatory Authority has yet to formally schedule hearings but BellSouths spokesperson said OSS testing was expected to begin in that state by Jan Referring to obstacles BellSouth faces in regulatory reviews of its competitive checklist compliance the company spokesperson said there was constant anecdotal complaining by our competi tors It takes an awful lot of time to go through and figure out what the real problem is He continued The law does not require perfection but our competitors would like to see perfec tion With the FCCs Nov approval of SBC Communications Incs ArkansasMissouri application the company has received authority to provide interLATA services throughout its fivestate South western Bell service territory The FCC approved SBCs Texas application in June of and its joint KansasOklahoma appli cation last January Due to its acquisition of Southern New England Telephone Co SBC also offers interLATA services in Connecticut but did not need approval under section of the Act to do so SBC submitted an updated interLATA filing for its Pacific Bell subsidiary to the California Public Utilities Commission in May According to a company spokesperson SBC thought it would be helpful to do so considering a new PUC chairman came on board earlier this year An administrative law judge is still review ing the California application but SBC expects a decision by the end of this month the spokesperson said SBC anticipates a decision by the full commission by yearend A review of section compliance by SBCs Nevada Bell subsid iary is pending at the Nevada Public Utilities Commission A company spokesperson said SBC was not aware of any outstanding issues with regard to the application but the Nevada commission has signaled its interest in the decision of the California commission Therefore the states respective decisions will likely be closely in tandem the spokesperson said In SBCs fivestate Ameritech Corp territory OSS testing is under way SBC predicts the various state commissions in that region will reach decisions by the first quarter of next year At that point SBC will submit its applications to the FCC Instead of following a statebystate approach to OSS testing Qwest Corp has taken a multistate approach in its attempt to obtain state backing for its interLATA service aspirations Of the states in Qwests service territory are taking part in a regionwide collaborative process to conduct OSS testing under the auspices of the Regional Oversight Committee ROC Arizona chose not to participate in the multistate proceedings it is conducting its own review of Qwests performance The ROCs OSS testing process is about complete and should be finished by mid to late December Qwest said The company expects decisions from the first batch of state commissions soon a spokesman said He noted that Arizona Colorado and Iowa were moving along well in their proceedings The Iowa Utilities Board found Nov that Qwest had satisfied the emerging servic es portion of the checklist bringing the total number of ap proved checklist items to On the other hand the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission on Nov issued an initial order finding that Qwest had failed to comply with checklist item four unbundled local loops and with the emerging services requirements and the public interest The initial order said Qwest was obligated to build new facili ties when existing facilities were fully utilized and it must provision facilities for competitive local exchange carriers CLECs on the same terms as it would for its retail customers A WUTC staff member acknowledged that this position was different from that of other state regulators within Qwests territory Qwest has not yet filed any section applications with the FCC but expects to do so by yearend or early Its just not an easy process the spokesman said It just takes time Margaret Boles NEXTEL PROPOSES SPECTRUM SWAP WITH PUBLIC SAFETY USERS Nextel Communications Inc proposed swapping megahertz of spectrum in the MHz MHz and MHz bands with public safety users to mitigate interference to public safety commu nications from commercial services in the MHz band The proposed swap would give public safety agencies access to a MHz block of contiguous spectrum in the lower MHz band according to Nextel This spectrum would be adjacent to the MHz frequency band already allocated by the FCC for future public safety usage Nextel said in a statement announcing its plan The proposed swap was laid out in a white paper filed with the FCC today The proposed swap would give Nextel MHz of spectrum in the upper MHz band and MHz in the gigahertz band the company said In return public safety interests would receive from Nextel MHz in the MHz band MHz of SMR specialized mobile radio spectrum in the lower noncontiguous channels of the MHz band and MHz in the MHz band Nextel has been at odds with public safety agencies over com plaints that Nextels MHz SMR operations cause interference to their communications systems TR Sept Public safety agencies had asked the FCC to impose conditions on Nextels recent acquisition of licenses from Pacific Wireless Technolo gies Inc to protect their systems from interference The FCC approved the transfer but without the conditions TR Nov notes Ed Rovetto FCC CLARIFIES PAY PHONE

the Com mission declined requests to modify the basic compensation scheme for such calls In an earlier second order on reconsideration the FCC had modified its percall compensation rules to address situations in which the payphone provider must obtain payment when a switch based reseller is involved in the call Those rules provided that the first interexchange carrier to which a payphone service provider routes a call must compensate the provider track or arrange for tracking of all compensable calls and send call completion data to the payphone provider The FCC today rejected petitions asking it to modify that regime It reaffirmed that for the purposes of payphone compensation only calls that are answered by the called party are considered completed and therefore are compensable The FCC also clarified that it supports the preservation and establishment of direct relationships and agreements between payphone service providers and switchbased resellers for track ing and payment of payphone compensation It added that the liability of the first facilitiesbased IXC is limited to the extent that switchbased resellers enter into such direct relationships The FCC added that it did not by revisiting the payphone rules intend to nullify any current or future contrac tual relationships Brian Hammond PAY PHONE BILLING DISPUTE A federal district judge sent a case back to a state smallclaims court involving a pay phone operator that claimed it was under paid by a long distance provider for dialaround phone calls Dialaround phone calls are made by dialing a tollfree number to

telecommunications and the Internet subcommittee who voted against the Internet Freedom and Broadband Deployment Act HR are asking a top Verizon Communications Inc policy advocate for more specifics about the rational regulation broadband policy model that he began floating back in August TR Aug Writing Nov to Thomas J Tauke senior vice presidentpublic policy and external affairs for Verizon Reps Bill Luther D Minn and Heather Wilson R NM suggested that Mr Taukes proposal could serve as a starting point for negotiations between the main parties involved in the fight over HR the broad band deregulation bill championed by Reps WJ Billy Tauzin R La and John Dingell D Mich But first they said more details are needed about key provisions of the plan As members with an acute interest in the TauzinDingell broadband bill and its impact on CLEC competitive local exchange carrier access to unbundled network elements we were encouraged by your proposals to maintain network access for competitors they wrote Because we remain hopeful that compromise between all interested parties is possible we hope you can assist us in understanding what kind of access Verizon is contemplating Their letter comes in advance of a possible floor vote next month on HR which would relieve ILECs of certain unbundling requirements for advanced services During the House Energy and Commerce Committees vote on the bill Reps Luther and Wilson came within one vote of adding language to the measure that would have preserved the FCCs mandates on line sharing which allows CLECs to offer highspeed Internet services over the highfrequency portion of a loop while the incumbent continues offering voice services over the lowfrequency portion The current version of the bill allows for line sharing but only over allcopper lines Where fiber is installed between a central office and an end user the bill gives CLECs access to the incumbents networks only as far as the remote terminal Mr Taukes rational regulation proposal would give CLECs some access at the remote terminal but its still not clear how much say Reps Luther and Wilson They also want to know more about Mr Taukes proposal to allow CLECs to purchase fiber bandwidth from the Bells at commercially reasonable rates How would such rates be calculated the lawmakers asked in their letter to Verizon When you say that a competitor would be allowed to interconnect at the remote terminal does this mean a CLEC should be allowed to install a dedicated line card or extend its own line into the remote terminal Reps Luther and Wilson also asked for a clarification on what buying bandwidth and commercially reasonable rates entails and whether the plan would permit a CLEC to lease Verizons facilities in order to provide customers with highspeed data services If so would a competitor be allowed to do so on an unbundled basis they asked Ryan Oremland TELECOM BUSINESS STOCK SALE WILL BOLSTER KPNs CREDIT RATING LEAVING

competition particularly in Germany where it offers service through EPlus Mobilfunk GmbH Germany has four facilitiesbased wireless service providers and is due to get two more SP noted A sixplayer

reviews members implementation of WTO trade policy objectives with input from the WTO secretariat and the member governments own policy statement Slovakias second TPRB review was completed Nov The private sector now accounts for of GDP and has become the main source of growth for Slovakia the report said Regulatory authorities are being established in key services to facilitate privatization and safeguard competition it noted Slovakia Telecom recently divested of its ownership overseas and the republic created a Telecommunications Office in July the body noted The sector is to be further liberalized from when the state monopoly over basic telecommunications using the public fixed network is due to end The Telecommunications Act of provides licensed entrants from with nondiscriminatory access to the public network within a reasonable time at a price based on justified costs the body said Slovakia also is set to implement universal service mechanisms it added Slovakia also is crafting competition legislation along EU lines with greater independence given to its antimonopoly office Price fixing is banned as is abuse of dominant market power by companies not subject to substantial competition it said Slovak law prohibits mergers if they create or strengthen a firms dominant market position in a way that reduces competi tion according to the report Privatization

premature attempts by incumbent local exchange carriers to convince the FCC to eliminate some elements from the national list of UNEs that ILECs must offer to competitors CompTel recommended that the FCC establish May as the earliest date upon which any party could file a petition to have a UNE removed from the mandatory list It also recommended the FCC convene a federalstate joint conference to get feedback from the states on UNE issues CompTel added that the FCC should clarify that the threeyear UNE review is not an inquiry into all national UNEs so any party seeking to scale back or remove a UNE from the FCCs mandated list bears the burden of proof Finally it asked the FCC to announce that it would not consider removing or scaling back the availability of a UNE if the requesting ILEC

acute in Europe where carriers paid dearly for licenses to offer third generation wireless services US carriers continue to suffer from factors that are less evident in Europe such as service cannibalization Mr Governali asserted In the US a significant number of younger consumers are using wireless service rather than wireline service when they establish a new household he said In Europe however wireless service generally is more expensive than in the US and wire line service is less costly That dampens the effects of canni balization he said But some analysts think European wireless rates are due to fall With several new entrants lined up to launch service in some countries competition could lead to a price war Mr Sawtell suggested that some smaller operators might launch aggressive pricing plans as a last roll of the dice if other tactics failed to generate market share for them At the same time he said many smaller operators dont have the financial resources or confidence for a sustained price war They run the risk of debasing the market to everyones detri ment including their own he said While European carriers bask in a renewal of investor confidence the US telecom sector still faces a potential restructuring that will involve one or more mergers between Bell companies and large interexchange carriers Mr Governali said He once thought such mergers might begin next year but now thinks merger mania wont resume until I dont think this will happen as quickly as we hoped Tom Leithauser NTELOS MULLS OPTIONS AFTER RIVAL SUITOR MAKES SUPERIOR OFFER FOR

Frank Keating R has recommended assessing a tax on telecom services as part of a plan that would replace the state income tax with a tax on several services Rep Clay Pope D chairman of the House Revenue and Taxation Committee said he didnt have all the data necessary to make an informed judgment about Mr Keatings proposal Extending a state tax to telephone and utility bills barber shops and beauty salons apartment rentals and hotel rooms bank fees and services would increase expenses for most Oklahomans Mr Pope said The governor claims that under his proposal everyone would get an immediate raise Mr Pope added But if his plan is indeed revenue neutral then somebody will have to pay for someone elses tax exemptions At this point it is impossible for us to know who would be the winners and who would be the losers The current Republican tax plan appears to be counterproductive to helping create an environment in Oklahoma that encourages growth and opportunity House Majority Leader Danny Hilliard D said VIRGINIA SCC says bring recipcomp dispute to FCC The Corporation Commission has told KMC Telecom of Virginia Inc to bring its interconnection dispute related to Verizon Virginia Incs nonpayment of reciprocal compensation charges to the FCC KMC asked the SCC to enforce its agreement with Verizon which it said requires reciprocal compensation for payment of Internet service provider ISP traffic The agreement requires the companies to pay reciprocal compensation for local calls KMC pointed out that the SCC determined in an earlier case that ISP traffic should be considered local The company said the FCCs recent decision on compensation for ISP traffic shouldnt affect the SCCs decision KMC noted that the FCC said its decision doesnt alter existing contractual obligations and does not preempt any state commission decision regarding compensation for ISPbound traffic for the period prior to the effective date of the interim regime we adopt here The FCCs order excluded ISP traffic from reciprocal compensation and ordered a month transitional scheme governing compensation for Internet traffic The SCC said it remains steadfast in its concern regarding the possibility of conflicting results by the Virginia commission and the FCC The SCC added the most practical action is for this commission to decline jurisdiction and allow the parties to present their case to the FCC Case PUC TEXAS SW Bell calls new DSL PMs extreme punitive Southwestern Bell Telephone Co has asked the Public Utility Commission to reconsider or stay its decision revising the incumbents DSL digital subscriber line service performance measures SW Bell said the new measures were extreme and punitive SW Bell asked the commission to consider the financial and operational costs of implementing the performance changes compared to the benefits if any to CLECs competitive local exchange carriers In October the commission changed SW Bells penalty structure for missing DSL performance measures from a per occurrence to a per measure method The commission also required SW Bell to improve the accuracy level of its LFACS loop facilities assignment and control system database which competitors use to qualify loops and test the accuracy of its loop qualification information SW Bell said the revised penalty structure increased its potential DSLrelated penalty payments to more than million a year The per measure payments require SW Bell to pay huge penalties regardless of volumes inviting competitors to arbitrage the remedy plan as an additional revenue source SW Bell said The per measure penalty structure could require SW Bell to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars per month to a competitor that has only one missed order SW Bell added The new accuracy requirements would require SW Bell to manually inventory every plant record in the state the incumbent said The potential cost associated with this effort could exceed billion SW Bell said Testing a sample of its loop qualification information would cost more than million SW Bell added Project VIRGINIA Broadstreet customers must find a new carrier About Broadstreet Communications

auditing firm has verified that Verizons operations support systems for the state are the same as those already approved in Massachusetts After the PUC has completed its review process and makes a recommendation the FCC will have days to review Verizons section application The FCC also must consult with the US Department of Justice before making its final decision Verizon said that the states local distance market is irreversibly open to competition as shown by the fact that Maine telephone lines are served by competitors Of those lines are served by competitors that lease Verizons lines on a wholesale basis and are owned by competitors Earlier this year the company filed similar requests for market entry with state regulators in New Hampshire Vermont Rhode Island and New Jersey Verizon is authorized to provide service in Massachusetts New York Connecticut and Pennsylvania PENNSYLVANIA Senate minority leader opposes PUC nomination Senate minority leader Robert Mellow D Lackawanna has said he opposes the nomination of Kim Pizzingrilli to the Public Utility Commission because if she was confirmed the PUC would be composed of five Republican members In a letter sent to Gov Mark Schweiker R Mr Mellow called for the withdrawal of Ms Pizzingrillis nomination and asked that a Democratic nominee be submitted He said it is neither productive nor sound public policy to have all five members of the PUC made up of the same political party Former Gov Tom Ridge R nominated Ms Pizzingrilli for the position early this month Ms Pizzingrilli is currently the secretary of the commonwealth a position she assumed in Before becoming secretary of the commonwealth Ms Pizzingrilli was the deputy secretary of regulatory programs at the Virginia Department of State A spokesman

to establish marketbased prices for certain services now offered to competitive local exchange carriers as unbundled network elements UNEs The availability of unrestricted unbundled local switching operator service and directory assistance as UNEs ended Oct under SW Bells TA Texas interconnection agreement About competitive local exchange carriers have signed the TA The TA contains a sunset provision that permits SW Bell to provide those offers no longer identified as UNEs by the FCC at market prices upon days notice to competitors SW Bell told the Public Utility Commission that it hadnt decided whether to reprice certain UNEs in part due to the pendancy of certain regulatory and judicial proceedings Carriers that provide service by leasing a platform of combined unbundled network elements UNEP asked the commission to require SW Bell to continue to provide such services as UNEs ATT Communications of Texas LP McLeod USA Telecommunications Services Inc and the Texas UNE Platform Coalition estimate that about access lines in Houston Dallas Fort Worth and San Antonio would be denied competitive alternatives if SW Bell stopped offering unrestricted local switching as a UNE If SW Bell stopped offering operator service and directory assistance as a UNE competitors would be required to establish costly transport arrangements to access alternative providers the carriers said Docket WASHINGTON ALJ says Verizon must make agreement available A Utilities and Transportation Commission administrative law judge has proposed directing Verizon Northwest Inc to make a North Carolina GTE South IncTime Warner Inc interconnection agreement available to Focal Communications Corp of Washington Focal asked the UTC to intervene when Verizon refused to make the agreement available Focal said the conditions imposed by the FCC on the merger of Bell Atlantic Corp and GTE Corp included a mostfavored nation MFN provision for outofregion and inregion arrangements Under the merger order the new company had to make any interconnection arrangement unbundled network element UNE or interconnection provision that it agreed to in the former GTE service area before the merger to any carrier throughout the former GTE region after the merger On Nov Focal submitted a letter to the FCCs Common Carrier Bureau requesting an interpretation of the MFN provision in the merger order In December the bureau said that the merger orders MFN provisions apply to entire interconnection agreements Verizon however maintained that it was only required to make available interconnection arrangements UNEs and provisions of the agreement that were the express subject of section c of the federal Telecommunications Act of The company noted that the MFN provision in the order only addressed that specific subsection The incumbent added that it was under no obligation to make available interconnection arrangements UNEs and provisions of the agreement that were the subject of section b of the Act The ALJ determined that section c includes subsection b He added that Verizons conduct unfairly deprived Focal of its rights under the Bell AtlanticGTE Merger Order The ALJ pointed out that the bureaus letter had the same force and effect as actions taken by the FCC He said Verizon was clearly bound to comply with its findings as of the fate it was written The ALJ therefore proposed that Focals request to optin to entire agreement be made effective as of Dec The ALJs initial order isnt effective until the UTC issues a final order Parties have days after service of this initial order to file a petition for administrative review replies are due five days after service of the petition Docket UT Focal Communications Corporation of Washington Petitioner v Verizon Northwest Inc Respondent MISSOURI PSC rules against ATT in tariff dispute The Public Service Commission has approved competitive local exchange carrier CLEC Mark Twain Communications Cos wireless termination service tariff which establishes perminute rates wireless carriers must pay for terminating wireless traffic on Mark Twains network The commission concluded that it would be inequitable to permit incumbent local exchange carriers ILECs to recover wireless termination costs through tariffs and deny CLECs the same opportunity ATT Wireless Services Inc asked the PSC to reject the tariff ATT said the tariff was illegal because it didnt provide reciprocal compensation for traffic exchanged between Mark Twains and wireless carriers networks The companies currently exchange traffic under a billandkeep arrangement ATT said Mark Twain disputed ATTs assertions Mark Twain said it hadnt agreed to a billandkeep arrangement Its tariff was modeled after PSCapproved tariffs filed by small ILECs Mark Twain said Commissioner Connie Murray issued a dissenting opinion Although CLECs are entitled to compensation for terminating wireless traffic tariffs arent the appropriate method for providing compensation Ms Murray said Unlike ILECs Mark Twain isnt required to negotiate or arbitrate an interconnection agreement Ms Murray said Approving Mark Twains tariff will significantly reduce any possibility that the parties will be able to negotiate a mutually agreeable interconnection agreement she said Case TT OHIO Lawmaker proposes E council fund Sen Priscilla Mead R District has introduced SB which would create the Enhanced Wireless Government Assistance Fund and the Ohio E Council According to Sen Mead SB would be the first step to update emergency service technology to identify the number and location of emergency calls placed with a cellular phone or other wireless communication device The E Council would provide the counties in Ohio with assistance in becoming compliant with FCCmandated emergency response services Money from the E fund would be used for only the onetime costs of designing upgrading purchasing leasing programming installing or maintaining the necessary data hardware software and trunking required for any public safety answering point In the FCC mandated that state governments update their public safety answering point PSAP facilities to handle enhanced service by April The FCC also asked wireless carriers to begin providing Phase II automatic location identification ALI for wireless calls by Oct or within six months of receiving a request from a PSAP whichever occurred later PSAPs in Ohio failed to meet the FCC deadlines The FCC approved Phase II waivers with certain modifications extending the deployment schedules proposed by Verizon Wireless Sprint PCS and Nextel Communications Inc for their networks and by ATT Wireless Services Inc and Cingular Wireless LLC for the GSM Global System for Mobile communications portions of

the appropriate amount for the transport and termination of Sprint originated traffic on espires network Under the agreement espire can designate its switch as a tandem and endoffice switch In its complaint the company asked the commission to find that espires switch was properly designated as a tandem switch and an endoffice switch for the purpose of receiving compensation for transporting and terminating local traffic If the commission finds that the designation was properly made espire said Sprint should be ordered to pay reciprocal compensation retroactively and prospectively at the tandem call termination rate Docket TENNESSEE ACCESS asks for BellSouth winback investigation ACCESS Integrated Networks Inc AIN has asked the Regulatory Authority to initiate a show cause proceeding

violated BellSouths tariffs by offering three free months of local service to win back a local business customer XO Tennessee Inc said a BellSouth senior account executive made the same offer to a

NoCall List Legislation VIRGINIA Verizon asks court to dismiss antitrust lawsuit Verizon Communications has asked a federal court to dismiss an antitrust lawsuit filed against it last month by Cavalier Telephone LLC In the complaint filed at the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia Cavalier alleges that Verizon violated antitrust and other laws by blocking competition and maintaining monopoly power in the local exchange service market The competitive local exchange carrier is seeking treble damages and punitive damages of million In documents filed yesterday Verizon argued that Cavaliers lawsuit fails to state a legitimate antitrust claim under the federal Sherman Act Verizon also claims that the federal Telecommunications Act of provides adequate remedies for Cavalier short of an antitrust action Its surprising that Cavalier claims its unable to compete when it serves over access lines and also claims to be adding lines a month said Robert Woltz presidentVerizon Virginia This success belies Cavaliers claims against Verizon MICHIGAN Ameritech fails to comply with four checklist items The Public Service Commission has said it doesnt appear that AmeritechMichigan has complied with four items on the point competitive checklist in section of the federal Telecommunications Act of The commission said it issued the preliminary order to provide Ameritech Michigan with forewarning that redirection is needed to gain the commissions endorsement of the telcos bid to enter the interLATA local access and transport area services market under section of the Act The PSCs order discusses checklist items two access to network elements four local loop transport seven access to and directory assistance and access to databases and signaling In examining checklist item two the commission discussed WorldCom Incs complaint that Ameritech hasnt been sending lineloss reports on CLEC competitive local exchange carrier toCLEC migrations WorldCom said absent notification that its customer has chosen to receive service from a different provider it continues to bill for its services At the same time the new CLEC initiates billing and the customers are double billed WorldCom explained WorldCom asserted that Ameritech has taken a cavalier attitude about this problem The commission said the problem has a grave potential effect on competition for local exchange service and is one of the most serious of the problems raised in this case It directed Ameritech to file a report on its efforts to resolve the problem within days of its Dec order The PSC said in order for Ameritech to comply with checklist item four it must facilitate the migration of voice service from itself to a CLEC with line splitting over the UNEP unbundled network elementplatform The commission said a CLEC doesnt need to gain approval from the data CLEC before providing voice service to a customer and migrate the service from line sharing to line splitting The commission rejected Ameritechs assertion that the FCCs orders support its position that the data CLEC has a right of first refusal for the voice portion of the loop when a customer seeks to change his voice provider from the incumbent The PSC also ordered Ameritech to streamline the process for ordering and provisioning the UNEP when line splitting is involved The commission further examined Ameritechs compliance with checklist item seven and determined that the company must provide directory assistance listings DAL at costbased rates Ameritech has said the FCC recognized DAL as a competitive wholesale service and declined to expand the definition of directory assistance to include DAL or to require that DAL be provided at forwardlooking prices The PSC said the FCCs conclusion only relates to incumbents that provide customized routing Ameritech doesnt provide reasonable customized routing the PSC added During its examination of checklist item the PSC determined that the access to calling name CNAM database should be considered a UNE Ameritech said it wasnt a UNE because the PSC didnt do an analysis concerning whether the database met the necessary and impair standards of sections and of the Act The PSC answered that it didnt need to go through the necessary and impair analysis because the FCC already did The PSC also rejected Ameritechs assertion that the unbundled element is only access to the database and not the database itself Case U CALIFORNIA Audit reveals doesnt need split overlay The Public Utilities Commission has conducted an audit of telephone number utilization in the area code and determined that as long as the FCC requires wireless carriers to pool numbers there likely wont be an immediate need for a split or overlay The audit found that the crucial factor in determined when the area code will exhaust is when wireless carriers will begin numberblock pooling In February the FCC extended the deadline until Nov for cellular carriers to support the technology that allows pooling If cellular carriers dont start participating in the pool in November it appears likely that the demand from wireless carriers for phone numbers will exhaust the supply of prefixes in the area code within months the PUC said The audit also illustrated the need for carriers to keep better track of the use and availability of phone numbers the PUC said For example carriers erroneously reported telephone numbers as unavailable the commission noted TEXAS MCImetro agrees to bill customers for incollect calls MCImetro Access Transmission Services LLC has agreed to bill its customers for incollect calls beginning Jan in an interim agreement between it and Southwestern Bell Telephone Co Incollect or alternatively billed calls include collect calls and other calls that are billed to a different phone number than the originating callers number The interim agreement will remain in effect pending the outcome of the commissions decision in Docket an MCImetro arbitration petition SW Bell had asked the Public Utility Commission to require MCImetro to bill its customers for incollect calls and remit collected amounts to the incumbent SW Bell said it shouldnt be required to provide incollect service to MCImetros customers at no charge SW Bell said it had seen a dramatic rise in recent months in the volume of MCImetro customers incollect calls The problem is particularly acute for incollect calls made from prison pay phones and it forces SW Bell to forgo up to million in revenue a month the incumbent said MCImetro also agreed to back bill its customers for incollect services provided since August block customers from making incollect calls if they fail to pay for incollect services days after they are billed and track uncollected incollect charges MCImetro said it would bill customers for incollect charges on a bill separate from its bill for local services through a thirdparty billing agent Docket TEXAS ATT stops paying Allegiances access charges Allegiance Telecom of Texas Inc has asked the Public Utility Commission to require ATT Corp to pay for Allegiances intrastate switched access services Since ATT has intermittently paid for some of Allegiances terminating access services but has refused to pay for any of the companys originating access services Allegiance said ATT is paying incumbents intrastate access charges while it refuses to pay Allegiances lawfully tariffed rates Allegiance said ATT is also paying its affiliates intrastate access charges even when they equal or exceed Allegiances rates the company said ATTs discrimination against unaffiliated competitive local exchange carriers confers a significant advantage on ATTs local service provider affiliates Allegiance added In November ATT paid XO Texas Inc more than in intrastate access charges after XO filed a complaint with the commission ATT asked the PUC to dismiss XOs complaint without prejudice to ATTs right to pursue a claim for XOs unreasonable switched access service charges ATT said it reserved its right to challenge XOs tariffed rates with any appropriate court Docket TEXAS SW Bell defends daily usage feed charge Southwestern Bell Telephone Co has asked the Public Utility Commission to deny MCImetro Access Transmission Services LLCs request to eliminate the incumbents DUF daily usage feed charge SW Bell charges MCImetro and other competitive local exchange carriers cents for every call attempt made by their UNEP unbundled network elementplatform customers The charge which is designed to provide competitors with a record of local calls should be eliminated because cost studies support a zero rate MCImetro said The DUF charge unexpectedly increased MCImetros cost of providing UNEP service to local residential customers by nearly cents per month per customer MCImetro said The DUF record is integral to every UNEP local service provider to have the ability to bill SW Bell said SW Bell bears costs associated with providing this service and should be allowed to recover such costs the telco said SW Bell added that it planned to complete a study analyzing its DUF cost elements and would charge competitors a new rate after completing the cost study Docket TEXAS Staff wants to reverse NeuStar decision The Public Utility Commission staff has recommended reversing North American Numbering Plan administrator NeuStar Incs decision denying Personal Touch Communications LPs request for a second NXX code in the Greenville rate center The staff concluded that NeuStars denial was an entry barrier because it prevented Personal Touch from providing EAS extended area service an optional twoway tollfree expanded local calling plan NeuStar denied Personal Touchs request because it had failed to meet the rate center monthstoexhaust criteria required before obtaining additional numbering resources To qualify for additional numbering resources carriers must have no more than a sixmonth inventory of phone numbers in a rate center The commission will review the staffs recommendation Jan Docket PENNSYLVANIA Net to return numbers The Public Utility Commission has ordered Net Communications Inc to return about unused and inactive telephone numbers in the NXX of the area code The PUC is acting under the authority of the FCC which allows state commissions to reclaim NXX codes that havent been assigned to customers within a sixmonth period The PUC said its action would help slow area code depletion in the state PENNSYLVANIA Deadline for views on servicequality guidelines extended The Public Utility Commission has extended the comment date on proposed interim qualityofservice guidelines from Dec to Jan The proposed guidelines which apply to all local service providers revisit the PUCs standards and billing practices for residential telephone service rules The interim guidelines would set rules for changing local service providers require carriers to make

National Conference of State Legislators NCSL aide told TRDaily not to expect any immediate movement at the state or local levels to impose ecommerce or Internet access taxes Thats because only a handful of state legislatures are currently in session and none of them are currently considering bills that would defy the moratorium the NCSL staffer said Theres also a misconception that the legislatures would be the only govern mental bodies to approve measures to tax Internet access the aide said Instead he explained such change could come from state tax departments that interpret their current tax laws as applying to the Internet The House on Oct did approve a bill HR to extend the current moratorium until Nov but a push to take up similar legislation in the Senate was blocked late last night Both chambers are expected to return from their brief recesses on Tuesday Oct Gayle Kansagor QWEST BOOSTS STAKE IN KPNQwest LEANS AGAINST EXERCISING OPTION TO BECOME MAJORITY OWNER Qwest Communications International Inc has no current intention to acquire a majority stake in its European joint venture even though it will receive an option to do so said Joseph Nacchio Qwests chairman and chief executive officer Qwest said late yesterday it would boost its voting stake in KPNQwest NV from to by paying million for million shares Qwests principal shareholder Anschutz Co will buy six million shares In a related transaction KPNQwest said it would buy Global TeleSystems Inc GTS Qwest has an option to boost its stake in KPNQwest by acquiring some or all of the remaining shares held by its European partner Dutch carrier KPN NV But Mr Nacchio suggested Qwest was leaning against exercising that option Rather than invest more in Europe Qwest has many domestic uses for its cash he said In addition its new investment in KPNQwest will give it adequate influence over the venture without requiring that the ventures finances be consolidated with Qwests as would be the case if Qwest had majority control he said I dont know the reason to step up any more than we have he told analysts during a conference call Qwest may assign its option to other potential partners with whom it has held discussions he added Its new investment in the joint venture will move KPNQwest to the position in Europe that wed always envisioned which is kind of a mirror image of Qwest on the far side of the Atlantic he said Its going to eliminate a complicated structure that was useful when we set up the joint venture but no longer was providing the kind of governance we thought the venture needed Rather than equal representation from each partner the new KPNQwest board will have three directors from Qwest one from KPN and two independent members While Qwest will retain special rights to approve certain strategic decisions KPN will lose its equivalent rights The transaction which the companies expect to close by yearend will help KPN in its effort to reduce debt by billion by year end TRDaily Sept KPN now will be allowed to sell large blocks of KPNQwest shares as early as a year earlier than permitted under a previous agreement For KPNQwest the transaction will clarify its governance and enable it to respond more quickly to market conditions Mr Nacchio said The related transaction to acquire GTS a Londonbased carrier means that KPNQwest will change its focus from building networks to deploying service said Jack McMaster KPNQwests president and CEO The GTS assets will deepen KPNQwests network presence throughout Europe will add accounts to KPNQwests customer base and will double its Webhosting sites Mr McMaster said The million acquisition will be accomplished through a prepackaged bankruptcy filing in the US and the Netherlands KPNQwest will issue million in convertible notes to GTS bondholders in exchange for GTS bonds and convertible securities with a face value of billion KPNQwest will assume GTSs million credit facility and million in capital leases A bank syndicate has agreed to provide the combined company with a credit facility of million A majority of bondholders have consented to the exchange GTS said The transaction will require approval from bankruptcy courts in the US and the Netherlands European regulators and KPNQwest shareholders Closing is expected in March This transaction represents the completion of the consensual restructuring process that we began late last year said Robert Amman GTSs chairman and CEO We greatly regret that no value can accrue to our preferred and common shareholders Mr Nacchio said KPNQwest and GTS together would be able to take advantage of the hole left in the global marketplace by the failure of Concert the global joint venture of ATT Corp and British Telecommunications plc TRDaily Oct Theres a greater void to serve multinational accounts particularly in the theaters of North America and Europe he said I think its ironic that in the same industry two of the old traditional market leaders dissolved a venture to accomplish exactly what were stepping up to do Time will tell whos right Tom Leithauser NOKIA SCIENTIFICATLANTA BUCK TREND MANAGE TO POST PROFITS IN

onlinetrdtdTdhtm NEWS IN BRIEF onlinetrdtdTdhtm FCC MAY RAISE SPECTRUM CAP EVENTUALLY LIFT IT ENTIRELY The FCC is considering raising for months the cap on how much spectrum wireless carriers may hold in any one market before eliminating the restriction sources said on Monday Currently wireless carriers can only hold megahertz of spectrum in urban markets and MHz in rural markets FCC Chairman Michael K Powell has proposed raising the limit to MHz in urban markets for months according to sources Some other Commissioners have indicated they would be willing to establish a higher limit according to one source Under proposals being discussed after months the FCC would either sunset the restriction or forbear from enforcing it a source said The Commission plans to vote on the proposed changes at its Nov meeting sources said Much of the wireless industry has long urged the FCC to remove the cap saying it is no longer needed to ensure competition in the marketplace and instead is thwarting carriers growth Since the Sept attacks industry officials have stressed that carriers need access to additional frequencies to handle the increased traffic after emergencies We think the time has come to eliminate the cap altogether said Diane Cornell vice presidentregulatory policy for the Cellular Telecommunications Internet Association The market is very competitive She added that the Commission and the Justice Department have the authority to reach out and address any competition issues But smaller providers and some consumer advocates contend that the cap is still necessary to ensure that smaller players are not forced out of the market Paul Kirby SBC COMMUNICATIONS SHOWS LOW REVENUE GROWTH PLANS TO CUT SEVERAL THOUSAND JOBS SBC Communications Inc posted yearoveryear revenue growth of just in the third quarter excluding onetime items and said on Monday it plans to eliminate several thousand jobs and cut capital spending by up to next year For the quarter ended Sept SBC generated billion of revenues less than one percentage point above the yearago total Driving topline performance during the quarter were billion in data revenues up from billion in last years third quarter a net gain of DSL direct subscriber line Internet service lines and revenue growth at Cingular Wireless in which SBC holds a equity stake Net income of billion or per share met forecasted levels and was slightly higher than the billion of profit recorded in the yearago quarter SBC said it continues to work toward its previouslystated fullyear earnings target of per share With larger financial performance gains hard to come by SBC management indicated the firm will be concentrating on expense savings to shore up future results The impact of a tough economy is being exacerbated by an adverse and uncertain regula tory environment so weve taken the steps required to maintain our keen focus on controlling expenses strengthening margins and maintaining financial flexibility said Edward Whitacre Jr chief executive officer Overall conditions have worsened in recent months making for one of the most challenging business environments in recent memo ry Mr Whitacre said He added that the current downturn is expected to hamper business and consumer demand through in turn putting significant pressure on SBCs ability to improve its financial performance next year In response to these challenges we must reduce our work force by several thousand jobs and cut our capital spending by approximately in the CEO said In particular Mr Whitacre blamed existing federal telecom regulations for exerting a significant drag on expansion of the firms DSL business and adding hundreds of millions of dollars to SBCs costs in providing the service And because of the heavy hand of regulations SBC said the company will slow its build out of broadband service No responsible company could justify fully deploying broadband capabilities and investing in new advanced networks in the face of this uncertain environment Mr Whitacre said Cutting against the grain of a broader market rally SBC common stock fared poorly on Monday closing down per share or about at Goldman Sachs telecom analyst Frank Governali noted that while SBC made its bottomline target for the quarter the earnings report revealed a greater than expect ed erosion in revenue growth As a result the analyst trimmed expectations on SBCs revenue growth to from a previous figure of and cut the fullyear earnings estimate from per share to per share John Curran US BANKRUPTCY COURT RESCHEDULES NextWave HEARING ON DISCLOSURE STATEMENT A bankruptcy court on Monday rescheduled a NextWave Telecom Inc hearing that had been scheduled for today NextWave had asked for the hearing to be continued until Nov but the

the second half of next year Ryan Oremland VERIZON SEEKS END TO UNBUNDLED LOCAL SWITCHING The FCC should eliminate or at a minimum significantly limit incumbent local exchange carriers obligation to provide local switching to competitors as an unbundled network element UNE Verizon Communications Inc told the FCC late Friday Oct In response to a federal appellate courts remand of an earlier FCC order that listed the UNEs incumbent telcos must provide competitors the Commission is currently considering which network elements it is necessary for a competitor to have access to It is also considering whether failure to provide access to a given UNE would impair a competitors ability to provide service The US Court of Appeals in Washington had remanded the FCCs previous UNE order in Common Carrier docket because it failed to consider the necessary and impair standards laid out section d of the Telecommunications Act of In an ex parte letter filed late Friday Oct Verizon told the FCC that the deployment and use of competitive local switch ing is a success story and that therefore unbundled provision of local switching is not necessary It also argued that the availability of unbundled local switching at prices based on the TELRIC totalelement longrun incremental cost methodology undermines investment in competing facilities Lynn Stanton CLEARER VISION ON BROADBAND POLICY REQUIRED COM EXECUTIVE SAYS A significant problem with the slow deployment of broadband services is a lack of clear policy vision on the issue as well as a commonly shared definition of broadband itself said Eric Benhamou chairman of Com Corp and Palm Inc on Monday in a talk before the New America Foundation Our expectations have been significantly disappointed he said For some the definition of broadband is kilobits per second while others think an ISDN integrated services digital network line is broadband Mr Benhamou said We have set our sights fairly low in trying to use existing architectures like copper wires or coaxial cable Its not how you would build it from scratch he said But while the Telecommunications Act of failed to create competition in the local market and to spur CLEC competitive local exchange carrier broadband deployment the Act did bring more options for broadband services from other sources such as wireless cable TV and even incumbent local exchange carriers he said Mr Benhamou said the information technology industry has lacked a powerful inspiring vision for broadband IT executives need to get together and create a strong vision such as Delivery of megabits per second to million households by the end of the decade he said That focus on a common goal would create a technologyneutral policy transformation he said and advances in technology and innovation would make that goal possible He also urged against government favoritism in promoting the availability of broadband There should be no policy for the promotion of any technology for example DSL digital subscriber line or cable modem services Its bad when government picks the technology Ed Rovetto TELECOM EARNINGS ROUNDUP Brightpoint Inc an Indianapolisbased mobile

OPEN QUESTION FCC Chairman Michael K Powell said on Tuesday it was a very open question whether the agency and other parties can reach a settlement to end the yearold dispute over NextWave Telecom Incs C and F block PCS personal communications service licenses There are a lot varied interests at the table and whether they can all be aligned in a way that everyone finds satisfactory is still a very open question Mr Powell told reporters during a briefing in Washington Im an attorney and Ive been in many discussions and negotiations This thing has moving parts and moving constituencies Several wireless carriers that bid on NextWaves spectrum at an auction earlier this year are negotiating an agreement with NextWave and the FCC that could free up the valuable spectrum sources have said Asked to predict the chances of a successful outcome Mr Powell replied I learned a long time ago I dont express any odds on anything associated with NextWave Mr Powell stressed that the Commission wouldnt compromise its rules or policies just to reach a settlement It is important to recognize that from the Commissions standpoint it has certain principles certain commitments to auction integrity that it has defended throughout the extent of the NextWave litigation and it has no intention of flushing them down the drain just in the name of getting a quick return he said On another spectrumrelated issue Mr Powell said the FCC still plans on establishing procedures by the end of this year to allow Northpoint Technology Ltd and other terrestrial wireless systems to share the Kuband with direct broadcast satellite DBS operators He defended the agency against criticism that it was taking too long to complete the proceeding saying it had the re sponsibility to wade through a thicket of extremely complex legal and technical questions Mr Powell said its very important to recognize that this is one of the most challenging set of issues that the Commission has faced in the context of a new service and it needs to tread carefully In addition to technical issues about how terrestrial wireless operators can share the Kuband without causing interference to DBS systems Mr Powell said there are very difficult legal questions about possible licensing and allocation as a consequence of a statutory regime that has different rules and obligations for terrestrialdelivered services than it does for satellite services Paul Kirby POWELL OUTLINES POINT AGENDA FOR COMMISSION FCC Chairman Michael K Powell today said he would apply his deregulatory marketbased philosophy to address a host of issues the most important of which will be spurring deployment of broadband services The widespread deployment of broadband infrastructure has probably become the central communications policy objective today he said at a press briefing in Washington He stressed the importance of the FCC taking actions to spur the digital broadband migration That could be an arduous process he said but is essential to survival He outlined five areas that he said would drive the FCCs agenda for the next several years broadband deployment competition policy spec trum allocation policy a reexamination of the foundation of media regulations and homeland security measures Shortly after he took over as chairman Mr Powell said he didnt have a list of specific regulatory objectives that he planned to pursue But today he sounded a different note It really stresses me that we dont have a more coherent cognizant vision of what were doing here he said Were just running around reacting to the latest issues The initial work to act on his agenda will be started within six months and will be substantially underway within a year he said Various proceedings will be used to address his agenda he said What were going to try to do is create clearly identifiable vehicles where key policy issues will be debated Otherwise he said the agency gets machinegunned with petitions and other filings from companies trade groups and other interested parties trying to get action on particular issues Regarding broadband services Mr Powell stressed the importance of limiting regulations that inhibit deployment It is clear that substantial investment is required to build out the new networks and we should limit regulatory costs and regulatory uncertainty he said Our focus should be on demonstrable and competitive risks and discriminatory provisioning As it mulls broadband regulations the FCC plans to continue studying the market and working with states he said The agency will clarify regulatory classification and access obligations expeditiously he said He cited three proceedings that would focus on broadband services the ongoing new networks pro ceeding the cable openaccess proceeding and the third generation G wireless spectrum allocation proceeding Regarding competition Mr Powell said the Commission needed to make prudent course corrections in our policies to spur competition Facilitiesbased competition is the ultimate objective he said He stressed the need for simplified enforceable connection rules More specifically the chairman said the Commission would conclude outstanding phase I pricing flexibility proceedings and initiate a set of new proceedings over the next six months that will pro vide vehicles for rethinking our current framework He said a triennial review would provide the principle docket for evaluating unbundled network elements policy The Commission will initiate a proceeding focusing on performance measurement and enforcement in an attempt to streamline the essential performance measures used for making judgments about compliance with the local competition provision he added He also said the agency would initiate a dominance and non dominance proceeding to ask how do we develop a framework that might be used to deregulate on a carrierspecific or service specific basis depending on the level of competition and market power On spectrum allocation Mr Powell found plenty of fault with the way the government doles out valuable frequencies The nations approach to spectrum allocation is seriously fractured he said adding it was a politicized reactive process He called for a more comprehensive marketdriven policy that would allow spectrum users to decide the best uses of bands The chairman said the Commission should encourage the development of secondary spectrum markets improve interference protection standards back the development of unlicensed frequencies map out the uses and users of all spectrum promote spectral efficiency and protect frequencies used for public safety Paul Kirby ATT EXITS FIXED WIRELESS BUSINESS QUARTERLY RESULTS SURPASS EXPECTATIONS After tinkering for five years with fixedwireless technology as a way to bypass incumbent local exchange carriers ILECs and reach consumers directly ATT Wireless Services Inc is killing the venture formerly known as Project Angel It took too much time money and effort to deploy the service and the financial return was less than ATT Wireless earns from other operations executives said today Fixed wireless antenna towers for example were expensive and timeconsuming to build and new subscribers often had to wait too long for ILECs to transfer their service to the fixed wireless system said John Zeglis ATT Wirelesss chairman and cochief executive officer These challenges probably could have been met he said during a conference call with financial analysts But we dont have that much patience for a nonstrategic business ATT Wireless inherited the fixed wireless business from ATT Corp when the two companies began separating last year ATT essentially invented fixed wireless technology and began market tests in Despite setbacks ATT continued to invest in the venture then known as Project Angel Some skeptics surmised that the existence of the fixed wireless program gave ATT ammunition in its negotiations with other network operators for access to consumers ATT Wirelesss goal was to have customers for the fixed wireless service which competes against ILECs in the provision of voice telephony and highspeed Internet access to residential customers But the fixedwireless venture fell short of expectations Mr Zeglis said In the third quarter the business went off track he said This decision is as clear cut as it is bittersweet ATT Wireless is the second major service provider to pull back recently from the fixed wireless business Last week Sprint Corp said it would stop taking new customers for its fixedwireless service but would continue serving its existing base of subscribers TRDaily Oct It wasnt clear whether WorldCom Inc would follow suit Unlike ATT Wireless WorldComs fixed wireless unit targets businesses rather than consumers WorldCom is on target to launch service in markets by yearend a spokeswoman said ATT had more than fixed wireless customers Over the next several months they will be transferred back to the ILECs that previously served them ATT Wireless will explore using its fixedwireless spectrum to provide other wireless services Having been unsuccessful in selling the business ATT Wireless will take a billion charge against earnings in the fourth quarter to account for its shutdown The announcement about the fixed wireless unit coincided with the release of ATT Wirelesss financial performance for the quarter that ended Sept Financial analysts seemed pleased by both It was a solid quarter which we believe is a positive in this environment said Merrill Lynch Cos Linda Mutschler ATT Wirelesss third quarter revenue was billion a increase over the same period a year ago EBITDA earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization was million a increase over last year The carrier added subscribers about the same as during the yearago quarter Its main weakness was churn which was versus in the previous quarter and the yearago quarter Some of the churn was involuntary and resulted from extending service to too many customers with bad credit said Mohan Gyani president and coCEO ATT Wireless has eliminated some of its less desirable distribution channels he said Were out of the business of attracting customers with a propensity for bad debt In the fourth quarter ATT Wireless expects to add another to one million new subscribers Fullyear revenue growth is expected to be and capital expenditures capex will be around billion About of the capex will go toward the deployment of a GSM Global System for Mobile communication overlay and GPRS general packet radio service network over of its footprint by yearend The remaining will be built next year The upgrades will enable ATT Wireless to offer socalled G data services Tom Leithauser LUCENT STILL LOOKS TO FOR RETURN TO PROFITABILITY Lucent Technologies Inc today insisted it was still on track to begin generating profits again in the fiscal year which for Lucent began Sept Restructuring actions will drive our return to profitability and positive cash flow in fiscal year said Henry Schacht Lucents chairman and chief executive officer Revenues in the current quarter which ends Dec will be less than those generated in the previous quarter Mr Schacht said But sales will pick up in the March quarter he predicted We are seeing early signs of increased customer spending in some segments of our business for that quarter he said For the quarter that just ended Lucent today reported revenues of billion compared with billion in the previous quarter Excluding billion in onetime charges Lucents loss per share from continuing operations was versus in the previous quarter Lucent is in the midst of a massive restructuring that will cut its workforce in half and eliminate many lowmargin operations In the most recent quarter jobs were eliminated Lucent said and annual expenses were cut by million Tom Leithauser RURAL TELCOS EYE ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE FOR UNIVERSAL SERVICE CAP BILL Several trade groups that represent rural telco interests have been pounding the pavement on Capitol Hill in a bid to get the Universal Service Support Act S HR attached to any economic stimulus package that moves through Congress over the next few weeks The legislation would remove the caps on the overall size of the Universal Service Fund and on the amount that carriers are allowed to receive in universal service support The FCC recently adopted an indexed cap that adjusts for inflation TR May but rural telco interests still want policymakers to move forward with a full repeal of the cap In a recent letter to members of the Senate Finance Committee which has primary jurisdiction over the economic stimulus issue the rural telco groups touted lifting of the caps as a way to stimulate investment in new telecom infrastructure and drive economic growth in rural areas The telecom industry plays a critical role in ensuring the nations economic and national security but rural telephone companies are hamstrung by arbitrary federal rules said the letter which was signed by the Organization for the Promotion and Advancement of Small Telecommunications Companies the National Telephone Cooperative Association the National Rural Telecom Association and the US Telecom Association Proponents of lifting the caps say they cause service providers in highcost areas to miss out on about million in annual universal service assistance and discourage upgrades and investment in newly acquired local exchange properties Congress can free these companies to make investments by including the Universal Service Support Act in the economic stimulus package the telco groups wrote Additionally because universal service support is privately funded through carriertocarrier transactions repeal of the caps would not add to the cost of the stimulus package the groups said in the Oct letter Finally repealing the caps would facilitate another major policy objective of Congress and the presidentinvestment in the platform need for full broadband deployment Several telecom interests have been eyeing Congresss work on the fiscal stimulus package as a possible means for gaining some quick legislative relief TR Oct The Houses main economic stimulus plan HR has cleared the Ways and Means Committee and awaits consideration on the floor In the Senate where work on the economic stimulus bill is still in the early stages a Dear Colleague Letter has been circulating urging Finance Committee leaders to consider approving S Ryan Oremland VERIZON

for Southwestern Bell Telephone Cos switched and special access orders In June the Texas Public Utility Commission required SW Bell to implement performance measures for special access service but subsequently decided to reconsider its decision and arbitrate the issue The Texas performance measure under consideration doesnt apply to SW Bells switched orders SW Bell said the KCC lacked authority to implement performance measures for special access which is provided according to terms and conditions set in SW Bells state and federal tariffs Sprint Communications Co LP agrees with SW Bell Special access is not an element of interconnection UNEs unbundled network elements or resold service Sprint said Docket SWBTMIS NEW JERSEY Peretz calls for BPU to dismiss Verizon long distance bid Ratepayer Advocate Blossom A Peretz has asked the Board of Public Utilities to dismiss Verizon New Jersey Incs bid to offer inregion interLATA local access and transport area services under section of

received any comments from any interested party other than the staff Instead the commission will provide notice of the agreement on its Web site Under the new rules if a carrier decides to adopt an agreement that has already been approved by the commission and the adoption notice was filed unilaterally by the requesting carrier the requesting carrier must file an adoption notice with the affected carrier The affected carrier will then have days to file an objection with the commission If no objections are filed then the agreement will take effect on the nd day The rules authorize the affected carrier to object to the adoption if the costs of providing the particular interconnection service or element to the requesting carrier are greater than the costs of providing it to the carrier that originally negotiated the agreement The affected carrier also may object if the interconnection service or element isnt technically feasible In addition if the proposed agreement has expired or been cancelled the affected carrier can object to its adoption Docket AR TEXAS SW Bell CLECs spar over special access Southwestern Bell Telephone Co has disputed the Public Utility Commissions authority to establish performance measures for the companys special access or dedicated transport services sold to CLEC competitive local exchange carriers The PUCs performance measures were established to monitor SW Bells compliance with the point competitive checklist in section of the federal Telecommunications Act of In June the PUC required SW Bells provision of special access

decision and arbitrate the issue Specialaccess performance measures arent within the commissions jurisdiction SW Bell said If the commission has jurisdiction to establish performance measures for special access its limited to intrastate service SW Bell added About of SW Bells special access service is ordered from the companys interstate FCC tariff SW Bell said Time Warner Telecommunications of Texas LP supports special access performance measures Time Warner said the PUCs authority to establish specialaccess performance measures is provided in section b of the Act which authorizes states to ensure the continued quality of telecommunications A state law authorizing the PUC to implement competitive safeguards also authorizes the PUC to implement specialaccess performance measures Time Warner added Receiving timely and quality service whether a CLEC orders service out of a tariff or an interconnection agreement is essential to the development of competition Time Warner said Special

than the growth projected There were more funds available than anticipated and the last biennium the staff supplemented the surcharge by spending down the ending balance the staff said In addition

activities for calendar days after customers switch their local service to a competitor the PSC staff told TR The original waiting period was business days The Georgia and Louisiana commissions

records Internet Protocol IP storage data can be transmitted at a peak throughput of Megabytes per second and at a sustained throughput of more than MBps between Sunnyvale Calif and Newark NJ several companies announced today Dell Computer Corp Hitachi Data Systems Nishan Systems QLogic Corp and Qwest Communications International Inc used the Internet Fibre Channel Protocol to transmit the storage data The companies said this launch capitalized on the successful deployment of the Promontory Project in September The first phase of the project demonstrated that multiple ports on a Nishan IP storage switch could collectively process IP storage data from Fibre Channel and iSCSI end systems at a rate sufficient to saturate the OC channels on an OC coasttocoast wide area network link This second phase of the project demonstrates the ability of a pair of Nishan IP storage switches linked by a single transcontinental fullduplex Gigabit Ethernet connection to convert between Fibre Channel

SPECTRUM CAP The Commerce Department today called on the FCC to lift the cap on the amount of spectrum carriers may hold in any one market calling the restriction arbitrary and outdated The development is a boost to the efforts of major wireless carriers that have lobbied the FCC to repeal the cap Nancy Victory head of the Commerce Departments National Telecommunications Information Administration sent a letter to FCC Chairman Michael K Powell calling for the repeal of the cap on commercial mobile radio service CMRS providers and the cellular crossinterest rule which restricts an entitys ownership interest in cellular carriers operating in the same market In todays CMRS market characterized by multiple national providers and numerous local carriers rules such as these that draw arbitrary lines in the name of ensuring competition are simply not needed Ms Victory wrote Indeed their retention will more likely result in consumer harm The rules arbitrary constraints on system capacity limit service availability as well as stifle the deployment of innovative new offerings on the CMRS networks Repealing the restrictions will not leave the CMRS market exposed and susceptible to anticompetitive behavior or harmful consolidation she said She noted that the FCC and the Justice Department had the authority to stop anticompetitive practices The agencies existing authority is more than sufficient to protect against future anticompetitive conduct or consolidation that threatens the public interest she said Retaining the cap would hurt consumers because carriers would be unable to keep up with growing demand or handle unusually large call volumes in certain instances Ms Victory said citing emergencies such as the terrorist attacks on the US With re spect to new services the limits set by the rules discourage the offering of innovative new services over existing CMRS networks she added Commerce Secretary Donald L Evans said the phrase all circuits are busy should be retired alongside other relics of the industrial age and replaced by the opportunities and innovations that consumers have come to expect in the st century But a conflict apparently exists within the Bush administration over the spectrum cap The Small Business Administration has complained that the FCC has failed to describe how modifying the cap would affect small businesses or propose alternatives to minimize any negative effects TR April Lifting the cap could ease pressure on the FCC and the Bush administration to find spectrum for thirdgeneration G wireless services Industry representatives have said the caps repeal is particularly important in light of the fact that G spectrum might be unavailable for some time Thomas E Wheeler president and chief executive officer of the Cellular Telecommunications Internet Association praised the Commerce Department stance on the cap The Department has taken a bold policy position that will bring new and innovative services to consumers across America he said Currently wireless carriers can only hold megahertz of spectrum in urban markets and MHz in rural markets FCC Chairman Michael K Powell has proposed raising the limit to MHz in urban markets for months according to sources Other Commissioners have indicated they would be willing to establish a higher limit according to one source Under proposals being discussed after months the FCC would either sunset the restriction or forbear from enforcing it a source said The Commission plans to vote on the proposed changes at its Nov meeting sources said Paul Kirby POWELL DEFENDS COMMISSIONs SUPPORT FOR MHz BANDCLEARING PACTS FCC Chairman Michael K Powell has moved to justify the agencys backing of voluntary bandclearing agreements between TV broadcasters that operate in the megahertz band and wireless carriers that want the spectrum The pacts may actually serve to both increase revenues to the US Treasury through auction funds and facilitate the clearing of these frequencies for new commercial and public safety uses he said Responding to Sen Ernest F Hollingss D SC recent letter on the issue TR Oct Mr Powell said the FCC was endorsing the bandclearing option as a way to address a looming quandary The Telecommunications Act of permits broadcasters to keep their frequencies in the MHz band until at the earliest while the Balanced Budget Act mandates that the FCC auction the frequencies before then he noted Relicensing this encumbered spectrum without clearly articulating the rights and obligations of new licensees visavis the incumbents before the end of the DTV transition would produce further uncertainty of when the current broadcasters would vacate Mr Powell said in a letter released today by the Commission The Commissions actions clarifying these rights thus facilitate the transition to the new uses that Congress has deemed important not the least of which is public safety he wrote Freeing up the Mhz band will double the amount of public safety spectrum available in the US and provide for nationwide availability of interoperable communications channels which now more than ever are in extremely high demand he wrote Mr Powell added I have no idea how much it will cost the auction winners to clear the incumbents before the end of the transition but I do believe that by these efforts the US Treasury and American consumers will ultimately be compensated with greater auction returns and more valuable service offerings respectively Ryan Oremland ATT MEETS THIRD QUARTER EXPECTATIONS ANALYSTS SEE DISMAL ATT Corps third quarter results largely met Wall Streets reduced expectations but some analysts anticipate the companys fortunes will dim even further in Merrill Lynch Co and Lehman Brothers today downgraded the companys shares because they foresee continued declines in ATTs core businesses next year Merrill Lynch analyst Adam Quinton lowered his intermediateterm opinion on ATT shares from accumulate to neutral Blake Bath of Lehman Brothers lowered his rating from strong buy to buy Previously we were looking for a increase in business services revenue in Mr Quinton said in a report Given the sluggish economy declining market share and continued pricing pressure we are now looking for a yearoveryear decline of On the consumer services side the analyst had expected a revenue decline of in he now thinks that unit will post a decrease Of course the pressure on ATTs core telco operations are not company specific he said A Merrill Lynch survey of chief information officers at major US companies suggests that information technology spending will fall next year he noted He predicted businesses would spend less on the kinds of telecom and consulting services offered by the three major interexchange carriers IXCs ATT Sprint Corp and WorldCom Inc At the same time the three big IXCs also will receive less wholesale revenue because many of their wholesale service customers emerging IXCs and Internet service providers have gone out of business he said He expects WorldCom to show similar symptoms when it unveils its quarterly results on Thursday In anticipation of a poor showing by WorldCom on the consumer long distance side Mr Quinton reduced his nearterm rating on WorldComs MCI Group shares from accumulate to reduce He lowered his longterm rating from neutral to reduce MCI Group is a separately traded company that includes WorldComs consumer and smallbusiness services In discussing its quarterly results yesterday ATT acknowledged that would be a tough year Because it sells services to a wide range of businesses ATTs operations mirror the American economy said C Michael Armstrong chairman and chief executive officer At best he said the US economy might begin its recovery in the second half of next year For the third quarter ending Sept ATT recorded revenues of billion On a pro forma basis thats a decrease over the yearago figure The company posted earnings per share EPS of from continuing operations compared with a year ago The companys financial report was complicated by the recent separation of ATT Wireless and large onetime charges related to the breakup of its Concert global joint venture ATT Broadband added cable telephony subscribers in the third quarter versus in the second quarter of this year As of Sept it had cable telephony customers It added cable modem subscribers down from the added in the second quarter Cable modem customers now total million ATT executives said they still were pondering whether to sell ATT Broadband or proceed with plans to make it a separate company ATT has been in talks with Comcast Corp and other potential buyers ATTs fourth quarter forecast calls for EPS from continuing operations of and a slightly accelerated decline in revenues compared with the second quarter Capital expenditures will be billion to billion this year but will decline by next year ATT executives said they would cope with slowing business conditions by continuing to cut costs They declined to provide specifics but the Communications Workers of America which represents ATT workers said the company was planning to cut positions Tom Leithauser NEXTEL UPBEAT ON FINANCIAL TARGETS LEAP WIRELESS CAUTIONS ON FUNDING Nextel Communications Inc turned in third quarter results at the higher end of expectations after reporting few bad effects from the Sept terrorist attacks The company sounded an upbeat note on its ability to meet fullyear financial targets and carry strong momentum into Meanwhile fellow wireless provider Leap Wireless International Inc also reported strong subscriber growth for its Cricket service but sounded a note of caution on requirements to refinance its vendor debt in little more than a year from now For the quarter ended Sept Nextel reported operating revenues of billion up from billion in the yearago quarter Nextels domestic operations accounted for billion up over the comparable quarter last year EBITDA earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization before a million charge related to Nextels Philippines operation improved to million from million for last years third quarter Driving financial performance improvements were net customer additions of for Nextels domestic business and customer additions on a proportionate global basis At quarters end Nextel counted million customers on a proportionate global basis During a quarter marked by a national tragedy we turned in solid performance in line with our plans and fullyear guidance said Timothy Donahue the companys president and chief executive officer In a conference call Nextel officials reaffirmed full year financial guidance of revenues exceeding billion billion of EBITDA from domestic operations and net customer additions of up to million I strongly believe we can build on this momentum for the fourth quarter of and build on it into Mr Donahue said Unlike many companies Nextel was able to shrug off quickly the effect of the Sept attacks As terrible as these events were they underscored the importance of wireless said Jim Mooney chief operating officer This event caused an unforeseen but very temporary interruption to our business he explained He added that Nextels runrate for customer additions was back to normal within a few days of Sept Net new domestic customer additions might have hit for the quarter were it not for the attacks he said Going forward Nextel will focus on continued expense control and renewed emphasis on sales to enterprise and government customers as key determinants of future results In particular Nextel will target the utilities financial services government public safety and transportation sectors These industries are becoming the early adopters of wireless technologies said Mr Mooney On the expense side Nextel will continue reining in costs as it drives toward profitability The firm spent million on domestic capital expenditures in the third quarter down from million in the second quarter Over the next few years we have the opportunity to drive billion to billion of operating costs out of our business Mr Mooney said Nextels business plan is fully funded and the firm had billion of available cash and credit as of Sept he added While topline trends at Leap Wireless mirror those at Nextel the longterm funding outlook for the two firms is less similar Leap today reported net new customer gains of for its Cricket wireless service in the third quarter nearly double the net new additions in the second quarter and reflecting rollout of the service in additional markets The service counted customers at Sept and management increased guidance for total customer count to at least million customers by yearend But accompanying strong quarterly revenues gains to million were operating losses of million Leap Wireless said it had the resources to fund its business plan and purchase licenses won at auction but it cautioned it would need to refinance or reschedule vendor debt prior to January or raise additional capital to pay a portion of that debt We expect to seek additional financial resources to support the further expansion of our business when terms and conditions appear favorable to the company and its stakeholders Leap said We also intend to continue pursuing opportunities to maximize the value of our current spectrum portfolio John Curran NextWave SETTLEMENT TALKS DRAW IRE OF SMALL BIDDERS Small entities that bid on spectrum that has since been returned to NextWave Telecom Inc have been frozen out of settlement talks involving the carriers C and F block PCS personal communications service licenses two bidders complained today In a letter to FCC Chairman Michael K Powell Vincent D McBride and Scott D Reiter of Santa Monica Calif noted that representatives of major carriers including some with significant foreignownership interests such as Verizon Wireless ATT Wireless Services Inc and VoiceStream Wireless Corp were participating in the settlement negotiations As we recall the C and F block PCS licenses were originally earmarked by the FCC for Americanowned small businesses in order to satisfy the intent of Congress they wrote The sad fact is that most of these C and F block licenses that were set aside for small businesses are now in the hands of a select few international behemoth telecoms It galls us to witness the FCC privately negotiating with these same select few behemoth telecoms for licenses once set aside for small businesses Not only have true small businesses been treated as secondclass citizens in this auction we have been frozen out of all negotiations concerning these very same licenses Messrs McBride and Reiter added We should be treated fairly and equitably and given the same options and rights as any of the other winning bidders in auction No The bidders said they supported Verizon Wirelesss request for additional time to pay off the balance of its debt to the government but they want small businesses that participated in the auction should be given a say on the issue If Verizon cant readily raise the approximately billion needed for their final payment it is even harder for true small businesses to raise the capital they said They called on the FCC to return to bidders deposits paid on spectrum that has since been returned to NextWave Mr Reiter submitted net bids of for four licenses at the auction while Mr McBride bid million for one license Paul Kirby CONTENT SHORTCOMINGS HINDER BROADBAND GROWTH NOT LACK OF CONNECTIONS ITAA SAYS A lack of compelling content rather than any shortfalls in availability is the chief culprit in slowerthanexpected growth of broadband services declared Harris N Miller president of the Information Technology Association of America Its the content stupid said Mr Miller on Wednesday as the ITAA kicked off Positively Broadband campaign to spur the demand side of the broadband equation People wont buy broadband service to get their email faster he said They need compelling uses for it According to Mr Miller bandwidth supply isnt the problem He cited a recent Morgan Stanley Dean Witter study showing that of households have access to cable modem service have access to DSL digital subscriber line services and of homes are covered by satellite broadband services But the takeup rate trails the supply that is out there indicating a demand gap he said The most promising areas for spurring the demand side are what Mr Harris called ework egovernment ehealth eeducation and e entertainment uses Richer nextgeneration broadband applications could help broadband adoption he said But we need a broadband vision or roadmap to follow In the debate over broadband deployment Washington policymakers have focused on mixing the cement for building the highway instead of on what will get people to drive on it argued Mr Miller Governments policies for spurring broadband acceptance should be policy neutral he said Moreover the government should offer no sustained subsidies to spur broadband acceptance but could use targeted nondiscriminatory incentives to address social policy holes such as the digital divide Mr Miller added Ed Rovetto COURT PROBES ROLE OF PERUS GOVERNMENT IN AWARDING CONTRACT FOR TELECOM NETWORK A Peruvian court has issued an injunction preventing government owned carrier OSIPTEL and GilatToHome Peru from continuing work on a very small aperture terminal VSAT network for telephone services in rural Peruvian communities Irvine Califbased STM Wireless Inc sought the injunction GilatToHome Peru is a subsidiary of Gilat Satellite Networks Ltd of Israel STM in a joint venture with Peruvian CIFSA Telecom won the competitive bidding for the project last year with a million offer Gilat submitted a bid that was million higher than STMs In papers filed with the court STM contended that even though the contract was awarded to its consortium the Peruvian government allowed Gilat to lower its bid to match STMs then transferred the contract from STM to Gilat The court said it found enough irregularities to question the legality of the governments handling of the contract The court also found that OSIPTEL had violated Peruvian law regard ing competitive bidding for government contracts when it allowed Gilat to lower its bid after the process had ended The court ruling requires Gilat and OSIPTEL to cease work under the contract immediately STM Chief Executive Officer Emil Youssefzadeh speaking to what he views as an overly close relationship between Gilat and Perus national telecom service provider said One way or the other Gilat is now the VSAT supplier for all three rural telephone tenders that OSIPTEL has ever conducted While we are pleased with the courts decision the ruling shows that OSIPTEL has been clearly favoring Gilat in a highly questionable manner STM also is suing Gilat Satellite Networks in California STM alleges that Gilat had improper privileged access to government information This information allowed Gilat to make a public announcement of government actions even though government records indicate that these actions had not yet occurred We have brought this matter to the attention of Peruvian Presi dent Alejandro Toledo and US government officials Mr Youssefzadeh said This incident could raise questions about Perus willingness and ability to allow US companies to compete fairly in the Peruvian marketplace Peru is aggressively pursuing an expansion of trade between it and the US under the Andean Trade Preference Act Erin McConaha who monitors Latin America for the office of the US Trade Representative in Washington said she was unaware of the STM case Im glad to hear about this and will look into it she said There is wildly differing opinion here about Peru Michael Romanello PRIVACY COUNCIL WANTS AUDIT OF MICROSOFTS PASSPORT SERVICE The federal government must establish a system of checks and balances to ensure that personal information gathered by systems such as Microsoft Corps Passport service are kept private Privacy Council Chief Executive Officer Larry Ponemon said in a conference call today He questioned where datamining programs by public corporations could lead The US Federal Trade Commission FTC received a letter last week from several consumer and privacy groups complaining that Microsofts failure to disclose risks associated with the collection and use of personal information in its Passport service was an unfair and deceptive trade practice The service which will coincide with the scheduled release of Microsoft XP tomorrow will enable consumers to provide certain information to Microsoft that will authenticate them when they shop online with participating vendors The privacy groups asked the FTC to order the software giant to revise its XP registration procedures so that Microsoft XP purchasers are informed clearly that they dont need to register for the Passport service to access the Internet As companies like Microsoft move from technology vendors to information intermediaries whos to say Microsoft is not planning to do more sophisticated things with your data including surveillance Mr Ponemon said Windows XP by itself is not creating a privacy issue but it could be without the right checks and balances If youre in an organization that is collecting data you have an obligation to protect that information and it is true that Microsoft has to be very sensitive to security features Mr Ponemon called for more government funding and technology tools to enforce privacy violators There is a tendency to create rules that are difficult to enforce even if your best intentions are to crack down on bad players he said The real concern is FTC will not have the resources to truly crack down The ability to enforce against privacy abuse is very minuscule Jerry Ashworth NEWS IN BRIEF The Senate today confirmed Phillip Bond to be undersecretary for technology for the Department of Commerce and John H Marburger III to be director of the Office

issued by a facilitator Liberty Consulting Group on Qwest Corps performance assessment plan The PAP seeks to ensure that the local market remains open after Qwest receives authorization from the FCC to provide inregion interLATA local access and transport area service under section of the federal Telecommunications Act of The commission is part of a multistate group examining Qwests plan The states used the PAP adopted by the Texas Public Utility Commission for Southwestern Bell Telephone Co as a starting point The collaborative adopted Texass twotiered payment approach where Tier payments go to competitive local exchange carriers and Tier payments go to the states The collaborative eliminated the Texas plan payment caps on individual performance measures restructured collocation payments and raised Tier performance measures classified at medium to high The Liberty Group recommended several PAP changes in its report that would help Qwest meet its goals and fall within what we construe as the FCC standards applicable for such plans For example although the Liberty Group said the hard penalty cap as proposed by Qwest was consistent with previous FCC decisions the group recommended that the states include several cap movement principles The report is available at OSSandPAPFINALQPAP REPORTDOC Docket D TEXAS Staff proposes revisions to slamming rules The Public Utility Commission staff has proposed revisions to the PUCs slamming rules Slamming is the unauthorized switch of a customers preferred carrier The proposed revisions would add verification requirements adopted by the FCC after the rules took effect add electronic LOAs letters of authorization as a verification method for switching telecom service and require telecom companies to submit change orders within days after receiving a customers verification The PUC is slated to review the staffs proposed rules Nov but ATT Communications of Texas LP asked the commission to postpone its decision so that the staff can conduct a workshop to discuss additional proposed revisions to the rules Some incumbent local exchange carriers have attempted to implement their own local slamming penalties often before there is a determination of whether an improper switch has occurred ATT said The revised rules should prohibit this unreasonable and anticompetitive activity ATT said Project NEW YORK PSC postpones Verizon number pooling deadline The Public Service Commission has extended the deadlines for Verizon New York Inc to pool unused number blocks in the and area codes because of the September terrorist attacks in New York City Verizon said that the numbers which would otherwise be available are now in use for displaced customers and emergency services The PSC said the postponement was consistent with recent actions to suspend other regulatory requirements affecting Verizon in the wake of the World Trade Center attacks The commission further noted that the postponement allows Verizon to devote its full attention to the restoration efforts in New York City The area code was originally slated to be pooled by Oct and the area code was scheduled for pooling

A settlement to resolve the dispute over NextWave Telecom Incs C and F block PCS personal communications service licenses is complete sources told TRDaily today Over the weekend FCC staffers intend to brief key congressional aides on the accord with an eye toward having everyone on board for an announcement early next week sources said But a top senator today raised concerns that a settlement with NextWave could shortchange US taxpayers What troubles me is that spectrum auction revenues are being lost just when they are most needed said Sen John McCain R Ariz the ranking member on the Senate Commerce Science and Transportation Committee in a letter to Senate Majority Leader Thomas A Daschle D SD and Minority Leader Trent Lott R Miss Sen McCain noted the numerous demands on the US budget due to the Sept terrorist attacks including funding the war rebuilding damaged infrastructure and propping up weakened industries Since revenues are essential to each of these vital tasks I believe that the government can no longer afford to simply pay off a company whose only contribution to the American economy has been to manipulate for private gain the results of an improperly designed auction of a valuable public good Sen McCain added Sen McCain noted NextWave reportedly would walk away with billion in a settlement and the US Treasury would get about billion By contrast the government would have received billion for NextWaves spectrum if an appeals court hadnt ruled that the FCC illegally reclaimed the carriers licenses A reauction earlier this year of NextWaves licenses netted a total of billion including licenses that didnt belong to NextWave The senator also noted that Verizon Wireless reportedly had asked to delay until May paying the balance of what it would owe on the licenses it bid on at the reauction What assurances will the American taxpayer have that the federal government will receive the billions owed to them from the January reauction Sen McCain asked The taxpayers of this country deserve an agreement that properly ensures that settlement funds are paid in full before the American taxpayer is asked to participate in any settlement The expected billion in receipts from Januarys reauction would have provided revenue desperately needed to address the recent terrorist attacks upon this country and I am disturbed that an American company would force American taxpayers to forgo some of that money by exploiting legal technicalities he added But if this does happen then this Congress must use its oversight authority to ensure that this matter is resolved upon terms that protect the American people from being shortchanged once again Lawmakers endorsement of any NextWave settlement is crucial Congress would be asked to approve legislation that would codify the accord sources said Paul Kirby BUSH ADMINISTRATION SAYS IT OPPOSES NORTHPOINTS EFFORTS TO AVOID AUCTIONS Northpoint Technology Incs attempt to gain access to Kuband spectrum for free has suffered a major setback The Bush administration has weighed in against the company saying it opposes any efforts to restrict the FCCs ability to assign terrestrial licenses by competitive bidding The development represents a victory for the direct broadcast satellite DBS and terrestrial wireless industries which have fought Northpoint on the issue Sources have said that Northpoint was attempting to get senators to tack a rider onto a fiscal year appropriations bill that would prohibit the FCC from auctioning spectrum to terrestrial wireless providers if those frequencies were licensed to satellite services without such competitive bidding TR Oct The FCC last year said that terrestrial wireless systems can share the Kuband with DBS providers and it is now considering technical and service rules for licensing Northpoint including whether to auction the spectrum TR Dec In an Oct statement regarding the Senate agriculture appropriations bill the White Houses Office of Management and Budget said the Bush administration would strongly oppose any amendment that would restrict the FCCs ability to assign via competitive bidding spectrum licenses that could be used by terrestrial ie nonsatellite services Such a provision would interfere with the efficient allocation of federal spectrum licenses provide a windfall to certain users and reduce federal revenues OMB added The Satellite Broadcasting and Communications Association which represents DBS providers praised the Bush administrations position There is no public policy or legal justification for Congress to accept Northpoints outrageous proposal to change current law and give Northpoint the use of this spectrum for free said Andy Wright SBCAs acting president But Antoinette Cook Bush Northpoints executive vice president responded It is very hypocritical for SBCA to urge auctions for our company when its members such as Hughes Electronics Corp successfully urged Congress to enact legislation last year to exempt themselves from auctions while their applications were pending to share spectrum with Northpoint She added that Northpoint only seeks fair and equal treatment with other companies seeking to use the same spectrum The existing statutory exemption plainly gives satellites an enormous competitive advantage over us and were simply asking the Congress and the administration to restore a technologically neutral regulatory process Paul Kirby COMMISSIONERS BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT SUFFERS FROM UNCERTAINTY SLOW REGULATORY PROCESSES FCC Commissioners today disputed that theres a broadband crisis in the US Broadband deployment is occurring on a reasonable and timely basis compared with the pace of earlier technologies Com missioner Kathleen Q Abernathy said She and Commissioners Michael J Copps and Kevin J Martin shared their ideas for spurring the deployment of advanced services today at a national broadband summit in Arlington Va Sponsors of the summit included the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners and the National Exchange Carrier Association Inc Commissioner Copps called broadband a precious right for all Americans but said it was too early to say we have a broadband divide Commissioner Martin said the country should focus on broadband as a fundamental national priority We need to change the way government taxes broadband services and creates regulatory financial disincentives he said He specifically singled out state and local government burdens such as franchise fees rightofway fees and permitting processes We need more strict enforcement of the collocation rules additional performance measures on unbundled network elements and the FCC should reconsider which elements should be made available he said Regulators also need to remove the regulatory underbrush of federal state and local rules he said The FCC should move expeditiously on the cable open access pro ceeding and perhaps create a rocket docket to resolve complaints filed with the Enforcement Bureau he said According to one source there are thousands of pending Internet service provider complaints Commissioner Abernathy said the FCC should look at what it could do to encourage investment in telecom facilities We need to look at the decision and rulemaking processes and address issues sooner she said We are behind the curve on technology advances Mr Copps said the current pessimism regarding broadband deployment was misguided Broadband can revitalize the economy he said But the FCC gets in trouble when it doesnt look at the supplyandde mand issues for a service and sets policies to encourage certain services He cited thirdgeneration wireless services and digital TV as examples where expectations hadnt been met The train cant carry freight until the tracks are laid he said The FCCs role is to eliminate barriers regulate with clarity and transparency and speed decision making he added Ed Rovetto ERICSSON FOCUSES ON COSTCUTTING AS MOBILE GEAR MARKET RECEDES As its customers pause to consider how and when to deploy third generation G wireless services Telefon AB LM Ericsson is counting on deeper costcutting to combat slower sales The efficiency program as the costreduction effort is known is ahead of schedule President and Chief Executive Officer Kurt Hellstrom said today The company cut billion Swedish kronor million in the quarter that ended Sept and will save billion kronor million by yearend he said It reduced headcount by employees during the quarter bringing its headcount cuts to so far this year The Swedish telecom equipment maker lent more weight to its cost cutting prospects by announcing that Michael Treschow would become chairman effective March He will resign as president and CEO of Electrolux and will succeed Lars Ramqvist as Ericssons chairman Mr Treschow is known for his effective costcutting management skills at Electrolux and Atlas Copco and we believe he is just what Ericsson needs in this difficult operating environment said Adnaan Ahmad of Merrill Lynch Co Ericssons third quarter results fell short of expectations The company recorded sales of billion kronor billion a drop from a year ago Net losses totaled billion kronor million versus a net gain of billion kronor million a year ago The outlook for the rest of this year and isnt particularly bright The company revised its prediction that sales for the entire mobile systems industry would remain flat or show modest growth next year It now expects the market to be down as much as Its own sales will track that industry trend it said The companys third quarter results were weaker than expectations and its fourth quarter guidance was disappointing said Jeffrey Schlesinger of UBS Warburg LLC Moodys Investors Service meanwhile downgraded the companys longterm debt rating to Baa from A There are still no signs of a recovery in the demand for mobile phone equipment Moodys said On the contrary Moodys expects more carriers to defer upgrades to the GPRS general packet radio service standard to postpone installations of G networks or to agree with partners on network sharing The rating downgrade is based on Ericssons increasing reliance on wireless infrastructure equipment and on the anticipated further slowdown and heightened price competition in this segment as wireless operators are very carefully considering their complicated technology migration strategies Moodys said Tom Leithauser JDS UNIPHASE SEES DEMAND FALLING FURTHER AFTER FIRST QUARTER SALES DROPPED JDS Uniphase Corp a bellwether in the optical networking equipment sector late Thursday said it still couldnt see the bot tom of the demand slump that sequentially trimmed its revenues by nearly half in the firms fiscal first quarter ending Sept JDSs revenues in the quarter fell to million below the million reported for the fourth quarter of fiscal ending June During the first quarter of fiscal JDS racked up million of revenues The latest quarter was accompanied by a million net loss excluding some downsizing and other charges versus a million profit in the yearago quarter Our industry continues to be affected by declining carrier capital spending and a weak overall economic environment commented Jozef Straus cochairman president and chief executive officer In the short term at least JDS executives expect neither of those trends to abate The company anticipates sales for the second quarter will be approximately below the first quarter as the downturn in the companys markets continues JDS said in its earnings release late yesterday Excluding charges related to costcutting measures JDS expects to report a small net loss for the second quarter The firm declined to offer any financial performance guidance beyond then In the meantime JDS said it would continue to reduce expenses while funding development of new products We believe these next generation systems will be part of a future industry recovery and that we are well positioned to help our company and our customers return to growth the firm said JDSs costcutting measures thus far have produced million of annual savings with another million of savings targeted Included in the downsizing have been substantial layoffs and closure of manufacturing facilities The cuts in operating expenses have not come cheaply Through the end of September JDS took million of charges related to cost saving efforts It expects up to million in additional charges to complete the program John Curran MOODYs DOWNGRADES ATTs DEBT RATINGS Moodys Investors Service reduced ATT Corps debt ratings and said it might issue further downgrades The core telephony unit was downgraded to A from A and the less creditworthy broadband cable TV division was lowered to Baa from A The ratings on ATTs shortterm debt were lowered from prime the highest rating on such debt to prime Moodys new ratings on ATT are roughly equivalent to those of another big rating agency Fitch But they are one notch below where Standard Poors rates the company ATTs ratings are under review at SP and might be lowered in the near future The downgrades can add to ATTs cost of raising funds in the debt market but ATTs debt securities still are considered investment grade Moodys said its downgrade reflected the deterioration in the prospective performance of the companys telephony operations and concerns that debt reduction efforts from the sale or monetization of noncore assets are likely to fall short of previous expectations Moodys expects profitability to decline over the intermediate term as Bell companies are permitted to enter the long distance business in more and more states the rating agency said There is not at this time a clearcut growth area to offset this decline Bear Stearns Co debtmarket analyst Marion Boucher Soper said the downgrade should not come as a surprise given that ATTs ratings have been under review for downgrade since the announcement of its restructuring a year ago Tom Leithauser TELECOM EARNINGS ROUNDUP CommScope Inc a maker of broadband and other communications cables said revenues for the third quarter fell to

Bush today signed antiterrorism legislation that gives law enforcement officials sweeping new wiretap and electronic surveillance authority The House voted Oct in favor of the legislation HR while the Senate passed it yesterday Under a provision inserted by the House the wiretap and electronic surveillance portions of the legislation expire at the end of unless renewed by Congress The federal governments process for allocating spectrum is inefficient with too many frequencies reserved for lowvalue uses and too few dedicated to highvalue purposes according to an analysis funded by the wireless industry The bottom line is that inefficient spectrum allocation imposes costs on the economy by discouraging innovation raising costs to consumers and otherwise reducing the benefits that consumers and businesses would have obtained from new wireless technologies said the analysis which was commissioned by the Cellular Telecommunications Internet Association and prepared by Sebago Associates Inc an economic policy consulting firm More spectrum should be allocated for commercial wireless services and the FCC should permit licensees to trade spectrum in secondary markets the analysis said Among the authors of the study was Martin N Baily a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington and former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers

ACS ANs interim and refundable unbundled network element UNE rate at The existing UNE rate was set in and at that time the commission said the prices were temporary and would require a full study The commission determined that it would use the FCCs forward looking cost model to calculate ACSANs interim UNE rate ACS AN ran the FCC model and its own version model to compute its forwardlooking costs The FCC model produced a rate and the version model yielded a rate ACSAN therefore asked the RCA to set the rate for Anchorage at per local loop The commission hasnt approved the version model General Communication Inc GCI opposed the interim rate stating that ACSAN failed to show that the rate was consistent with applicable FCC pricing rules GCI added that the FCC model ACSAN used wasnt the model used by ACSANs affiliates in Fairbanks or Juneau GCI asserted that unless ACSAN could demonstrate that its proposed rate was consistent with FCC rules it should be rejected GCI said it ran the FCC model using Anchorage customer and wire center information with the inputs from the JuneauFairbanks arbitration and produced a loop rate Using FCC default values GCI produced a rate Although ACSAN said the record supports a interim and refundable rate it was unable to tie that request to any data filed with the National Exchange Carriers Association the commission said The RCA added that the request was premised on an untested and unapproved methodology The commission said it wouldnt order interim UNE rates based on a UNE pricing model which hasnt been adopted by us or on cost support date and inputs which have not been subject to scrutiny The commission pointed out that incorrectly set UNE prices could undermine the intent of the federal Telecommunications Act of in a manner that couldnt be remedied by refundable rates Docket U OHIO Bill would strip alt reg from noncompliant carriers Rep Kirk Schuring R District has introduced HB which would require telecom companies to comply

said Docket MINNESOTA Lawmakers to discuss broadband availability Legislators on the Committee on Regulated Industries headed by Rep Ken Wolf R District plan to meet with local officials in Lakefield and Blue Earth tomorrow to discuss the availability of broadband Internet access in rural Minnesota A committee spokesperson told TR that the hearings in Lakefield and Blue Earth would give proponents and opponents of broadband legislation the opportunity to demonstrate why House action may or may not be necessary The spokesperson described the hearings in Lakefield and Blue Earth as a fact finding investigation where local citizens and local telecom providers can discuss broadband issues with committee members Representatives have proposed no broadband legislation at this time The spokesperson added that Lakefield residents and city officials were likely to express their support for legislation that would make it easier for area residents to receive broadband services In contrast the spokesperson added that there are a number of opponents to statefunded support for any kind of broadband legislation in Blue Earth because service is already available there Any taxes or regulations imposed on telecom providers or citizens could have a negative effect on other statefunded programs The spokesperson said the committee intended to bring these broadband hearings to local communities to receive comments from local telecom providers and community members rather than lobbyists representing the large carriers We are trying to steer testimony to local opponents and proponents he said Sprint Corp and Frontier Corp two local telecom providers in Lakefield and Blue Earth would likely present testimony at the hearing the spokesperson said According to the spokesperson the member committee should only miss about five to of its members for this short series of on the road meetings The committee also plans to tour a central office CO from a selected local telecom provider in

the changes and said it wouldnt acquire the exchanges if its requests werent granted Citizens was opposed to a condition condition four prohibiting it from paying a dividend to its parent company Citizens Communications Co if doing so would jeopardize the utilitys ability to provide safe and reliable service at reasonable rates Citizens asserted that condition four would impede its access to capital markets Without capital it cant invest in infrastructure to improve and expand service Citizens said The commission modified the condition to require the boards of directors of all the operating companies and the parent company to give first priority to the capital needs of the utility The condition also would direct the parent company to provide sufficient resources to the operating companies to provide safe and reliable service The decision also decreases the number of years Citizens must maintain capital expenditures at historical levels from five years to three years conditions and The commission concluded that approving this request doesnt eviscerate its objective of ensuring that Citizens provides adequate services to all of its customers The commission was concerned about the companys spending levels because it determined that the operating companies would be adversely affected by the exchange purchase The commission pointed out that considerable public benefit would be realized if the sale was consummated Those benefits include bringing telephone service to the unserved territory occupied by the Hoopa Valley Tribe and the Yurok Tribe modernizing the infrastructure and service for the remote BarO Boys juvenile detention facility and provisioning digital subscriber line service in Crescent City The commission said We conclude that rather than allow the public to lose these significant benefits of phone service and because of the health and safety consequences of not having phone services we should grant Citizens petition Application and VIRGINIA SCC says FCC should decide recip comp dispute The State Corporation Commission has declined jurisdiction in a dispute between US LEC of Virginia LLC and Verizon Virginia Inc that involves contractual obligations to pay reciprocal compensation for Internet service provider ISPbound traffic US LEC asked the SCC to enforce the companies interconnection agreement that requires Verizon to pay reciprocal compensation for the transport and termination of ISPbound traffic US LEC pointed out that SCC found that calls to ISPs were local traffic and subject to reciprocal compensation payments in a case between Cox Virginia Telecom Inc and Bell Atlantic Virginia Inc In this case the SCC concluded that the FCCs decisions to treat ISPbound traffic as interstate in nature supercedes its jurisdiction in this case The SCC said it was steadfast in its concern regarding the possibility of conflicting results by this commission and the FCC and therefore encourages the parties to request interpretation of this interconnection agreement from the FCC The order may be found at scccaseinfopuccasecpdf Case PUC MICHIGAN Senate proposes wiretapping bill Sen William Van Regenmorter R District

recent terrorist events The spokesperson said that the executive legislative and judicial branches of government are all involved in putting together these security measures The spokesperson added

access services The Department of Telecommunications and Energy has decided to use Verizon Massachusetts Incs interstate special access service data in its proceeding to review the telcos intrastate special access services The DTE found that the total number of intrastate circuits that Verizon submitted was so small that performance results on those circuits may not give a very useful or detailed picture of Verizons provisioning process The DTE has decided that although the FCC has exclusive jurisdiction over the quality of service of federally tariffed special access services it does not preclude the DTE from using interstate data to inform the department about the provisioning of interstate services Verizon has said that the provisioning of its federal circuits is the same as the provisioning of its instate circuits The department said that it wasnt secondguessing any conclusion reached by the FCC and would not apply any findings to interstate services DTE Investigation by the

onlinetrdtdTdhtm TELECOM EARNINGS ROUNDUP onlinetrdtdTdhtm NEWS IN BRIEF onlinetrdtdTdhtm HOLLINGS GIVES THUMBS DOWN TO MHz BANDCLEARING PLAN Senate Commerce Science and Transportation Committee Chairman Ernest F Hollings D SC today called outrageous the FCCs support for voluntary bandclearing agreements for the megahertz band saying such action clearly violates the mandates and standards to which the FCC is required to adhere Allowing industry to negotiate private marketplace deals that dictate the governance and the transfer of spectrum to earn profits on the spectrum through such arrangements is outrageous he said in a letter today to FCC Chairman Michael Powell Sen Hollings noted that the FCC was required by law to reassign the MHz spectrum channels through an auction When Congress enacted these statutory provisions it did not envision that the FCC would hand over its authority to manage spectrum to industry and to the marketplace The fact is that the FCC must refrain from bending the law to meet the excessive demands of industry he wrote It must simply apply the law as was intended by Congress The letter follows on the heels of the FCCs Wireless Telecommunications Bureaus decision earlier this week to hold the longdelayed MHz band auction on June The bureau delayed the sale in July the fifth such postponement to give officials more time to consider three petitions before the Commission related to the agencys attempts to facilitate the voluntary bandclearing agreements between incumbent TV broadcasters and wireless carriers TR July The Commission acted on those requests last month clearing the way for the sale to proceed TR Sept In its action last month the FCC gave TV broadcasters operating in channels additional flexibility to transition to digital TV DTV Some broadcasters say the rule changes will help spur bandclearing pacts that could result in them leaving the spectrum earlier than Congress requires In exchange the broadcasters would receive payments from wireless carriers Broadcasters currently dont have to return their spectrum until at the earliest But the wireless industry says it shouldnt be forced to pay broadcasters to vacate the spectrum early Even after the auction the broadcasters will have to be paid extortion money to move Its a sad state of affairs when broadcasters have to be bought off for what they promised to give back and Congress has directed to a higher public safety use said Thomas E Wheeler president and chief executive officer of the Cellular Telecommunications Internet Association In related news the DTV hearing that was planned for tomorrow in the House telecommunications and the Internet subcommittee has been postponed again House leadership has closed all House office buildings until at least next Tuesday in the wake of an anthrax scare on Capitol Hill Paul Kirby Ryan Oremland GILMORE STRESSES NEED FOR IMPROVED COORDINATION ON INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION Far greater coordination between the government private sector and intelligence community is needed if efforts to shield the nations critical infrastructure from physical threats or cyberattacks are to be successful Virginia Gov James Gilmore R told a House panel today Gov Gilmore also serves as chairman of the Advisory Panel to Assess the Capabilities for Domestic Response to Terrorism Involving Weapons of Mass Destruction which was established by Congress in Testifying this morning before the House Science Committee Gov Gilmore advised against making any major structural changes to the way federal agencies and state or local interests tackle critical infrastructure protection issues Rather we need to marshal the efforts of millions of government workers the intellectual power housed in our universities and the entrepreneurial spirit of our private sector to deter prevent detect and should our vigilance falter to respond when attacks occur he said Along with his call for stepping up coordination Mr Gilmore also recommended that Congress take the following actions create an independent advisory body similar to his panel to review cybersecurity protection programs set up a nonprofit organization devoted solely to the task of overseeing information sharing between the government and private sector establish a Cyber Court to handle investigations of potential cyberrelated crimes and develop a comprehensive research and development plan for enhancing security A critical first step to protecting cybersecurity Mr Gilmore said was the executive order that President Bush signed yesterday to set up an interagency board to study critical infrastructure issues The order also creates a National Infrastructure Advisory Council which will be comprised of representatives from the private sector academia and state and local governments Chairing the Presidents Critical Infrastructure Protection Board will be Richard Clarke who is the presidents new special adviser on cyberspace security issues Membership will consist of officials from federal departments and some agencies including the FCC The board will recommend policies and coordinate programs for protecting information systems for critical infrastructure including emergency preparedness communications and the physical assets that support such systems the order says The crux of the advisory councils focus will be on the banking transportation energy manufacturing and communications industries as well as emergency government services the order says Also today representatives from the competitive local exchange carrier industry today called on all facilitiesbased competitors and incumbents to convene a forum to review various network security issues including procedures for rerouting telecom traffic during emergency situations Because incumbent local exchange carriers and CLEC networks interconnect with each other we have a mutual interest in preserving the reliability of these networks Association for Local Telecommunications Services President John Windhausen Jr said in a statement We need to work together to develop a common plan for security and restoration of service in the event of future attacks The US Telecom Association without commenting directly about the ALTSs proposal said it already had launched such a review Since we represent all of the telecom industry We are working now and will continue working in the future to address the issue of network security a USTA spokesman told TRDaily Ryan Oremland CABLE MODEM OPEN ACCESS LOOKS LIKE FINANCIAL WINNER AOL TIME WARNER SAYS AOL Time Warner Inc today touted the early results of its efforts to allow unaffiliated Internet service providers ISPs to use its cable modem platforms The embrace of open access might prove to be a financial

EarthLink Inc becoming one of the first cable TV operators to let cable modem customers choose their ISP Time Warner Cable also offers two ISPs affiliated with AOL Time Warner AOL HighSpeed Cable and Road Runner The multiple ISP program has been costly said J Michael Kelly the companys executive vice president and chief financial officer He didnt quantify the cost but said the company had to invest in new systems and change its business processes to launch the program Nevertheless Time Warner Cable intends to expand the program beyond its current markets he said Robert W Pittman AOL Time Warners cochief executive officer said the multiple ISP offering had not diverted revenue from the companys original ISP Road Runner Theres very little cannibalization of Road Runner he said What that says is these are incremental ISP sales for the cable company which I think is a positive trend not only for our company but for the cable industry AOL Time Warner said its Road Runner service added subscribers during the threemonth period that ended Sept It didnt provide numbers for EarthLink or AOL HighSpeed Cable Road Runners customer base is now million The cable TV business generated revenues of billion in the quarter more than the yearago figure For all of AOL Time Warner third quarter revenues were billion a increase over a year ago EBITDA earnings before interest taxes

COMPLETION STILL CUTTING COSTS Hughes Electronics Corp officials today said negotiations regarding a potential acquisition of the company were nearing a conclusion but they gave no indication as to the ultimate outcome of the discussions Meanwhile Hughes said it continued to gouge excess expenses out of its cost structure during the third quarter The good news is that News Corp and EchoStar remain interested commented Jack Shaw Hughes chief executive officer during a conference call to discuss third quarter results Though I cant say how it will play out we are nearing the home stretch he said Both suitors have been circling Hughes since this summer and EchoStar Corp underscored its desire with an unsolicited stock merger bid in early August valued at billion So far the merger talks have survived a stumbling stock market the Sept terrorist attacks and comments by Hughes parent company General Motors Corp that declining stock prices of all firms concerned were a complicating factor in reaching an agreement Since GMs warning to that effect last month Hughes Echostar and News Corp share prices have bounced back by between and For the third quarter Hughes posted revenues of billion up from the yearago figure of billion Topline growth was led by strongerthanexpected performance at the firms DirecTV business which generated net new subscribers during the quarter At Sept DirecTV counted a total of million subscribers up from a year ago Hughes results also benefited from consensusbeating numbers at its PanAmSat unit where quarterly performance was bolstered by a major new contract as well as heightened demand by TV news companies for satellite services At the bottom line Hughess third quarter EBITDA earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization sagged to million under the weight of million in employee severance charges In the comparable quarter last year Hughes generated million of EBITDA The third quarter was very important for Hughes because we made key structural and management changes across the business Mr Shaw said As a result we are now positioned to generate sub stantially improved operating results The firms million of severance charges during the quarter Mr Shaw said will yield million of annual savings beginning next year and will contribute to the firms drive to become cashflow positive by Headcount cuts in the past three months have reduced Hughess workforce by globally and by at the DirecTV operations Mr Shaw said As Hughes management is still scrubbing the numbers and extracting more costs the CEO said he would refrain from providing financial guidance and would furnish new projections in about a month Michael Gaines chief financial officer expressed confidence that PanAmSat would succeed in repaying to Hughes a billion term loan by yearend As a result the company will have sufficient funding to satisfy most of its spending requirements next year he said John Curran AT HOME RESUMES CONNECTING NEW DATA CUSTOMERS AFTER CABLE TV PARTNERS ADDRESS FINANCIAL ISSUES At Home Corp has resumed connecting new cable modem customers for some cable TV operators after those operators apparently offered financial concessions Agreements have been reached with ATT Corp Comcast Corp Cox Communications Inc and Canadas Rogers Communications Inc an At Home spokeswoman said The companies wouldnt disclose terms of the agreements which the spokeswoman said addressed certain outstanding financial issues Those issues apparently were the cause last week of At Homes decision to discontinue new cable modem hookups for its cable TV partners At Home is in bankruptcy and its creditors decided the firm could not afford to continue expanding the cable modem business At Home had suggested it might resume operations if its cable TV partners offered more financial assistance The cable TV operators had little choice most of them would have been unable to fill the void left by At Home in time to avoid

PROMISE OF RURAL BROADBAND SERVICE CABLE TV COMPETITION MAY NOT BE ENOUGH TO SAVE EchoStarHUGHES MERGER Charles Ergen today told regulators what they like to hear that he could provide rural broadband service and cable TV competi tion But the chairman and chief executive officer of EchoStar Communications Corp might find that encouraging words arent enough to win approval for EchoStars effort to merge with Hughes Electronics Corp On the surface the merger of the two largest providers of direct broadcast satellite DBS service would seem as illfated as WorldCom Incs attempt to buy Sprint Corp a merger of the second and third largest long distance carriers But Mr Ergen says thats an applestooranges comparison Hes confident that regulators will look at the broader picture in which EchoStar and Hughes are providers of payTV service not just DBS service In that universe he insists they are small fish that need to get bigger to compete against ATT Broadband AOL Time Warner and the other sharks in the cable TV ocean Attorneys at the Department of Justice totally do understand this industry he said this morning during a press conference While there certainly are concerns that regulators will have this transaction ultimately will be approved he said Well work with regulators and Congress to alleviate their concerns Even before the ink was dry on the merger agreement Mr Ergen began offering conditions to make the merger more palatable to policymakers He said he would agree to a national price plan so that rural customers dont pay more than urban customers The merger would leave a few million rural customers with a single provider of payTV service and there will be worries that those customers could be gouged Mr Ergen hinted that additional conditions would be offered but he declined to say what they were You dont negotiate those in the press he said Weve made a million bet that this transaction will be completed he said referring to the breakup fee that EchoStar will pay Hughes if regulatory concerns derail the merger Blair Levin an analyst with Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc expects derailment A national pricing plan is not enough to win over DoJ he said today in a report Such a proposal would involve DoJ in ongoing price and service regulation which it is loath to do Moreover price is only one benefit of competi tion EchoStar would have to convince DoJ officials that any negative consequence of the transaction would be offset by a positive impact that the combined EchoStarHughes would provide a more viable competitor to cable TV Mr Levin said He noted that a similar tactic failed in the WorldComSprint deal Those compa nies argued that they should be allowed to merge to create a more powerful competitor in the localservice market But their potential to dominate longhaul markets did them in Opponents some of them powerful already are taking aim at the EchoStarHughes deal Cable TV operators will oppose it as will News Corp Ltd a jilted contender for Hughes A merger of EchoStar and Hughes means there will be no choice for millions of television consumers in rural America News Corp Chairman and CEO Rupert Murdoch said Mr Murdoch has no intention of waving the white flag and may pursue a number of strategies in an effort to block this transac tion said David Kestenbaum of ABNAMRO He suggested that leading banks with strong ties to News Corp may be wary of participating in funding the EchoStarHughes transaction Northpoint Technology Inc which is seeking to launch a terres trial service that would share DBS spectrum said the EchoStar Hughes merger agreement caps a long history of anticompetitive conduct by the satellite industry and demonstrates their failure to provide competitive choices for rural Americans The FCC surely could not have foreseen that the free spectrum it issued to several major DBS companies a decade ago would come to be controlled by a single monopolist Northpoint President Sophia Collier said The proposed merger is likely to generate hearings in the various congressional committees with jurisdiction over telecommunica tions and antitrust issues Senate Commerce Science and Transportation Committee Chairman Ernest F Hollings D SC vowed today to give the proposed merger a close look saying he was troubled by the prospects of the two largest satellite companies becoming one That kind of consolidation would leave consumers with few if any choices he said Our committee will continue to look into this and other consolidation matters The Senate Judiciary Committee is also planning to examine the proposed merger before Congress adjourns later this year a spokesman said Sen Mike DeWine R Ohio the ranking member of the antitrust business rights and competition subcommittee said that while the proposed merger clearly raises serious antitrust concerns they are not necessarily fatal to the deal If this merger is completed millions of consumers that now have the benefit of competition for subscription TV may find their choices narrowed to just two providers he said in a statement today By the same token the merger of these two companies could generate efficiencies that allow the combined company to provide new local services to a number of small and midsize markets Furthermore this deal may create a stronger satellite competitor that is better able to aggressively compete headto head with the cable TV industry Sen DeWine said Tom Leithauser Ryan Oremland FINANCIAL HURDLES AWAIT EchoStarHUGHES In addition to regulatory hurdles EchoStar Communications Corps effort to merge with Hughes Electronics Corp must overcome some financial obstacles The companies will need billion to complete the transaction and hope to get that amount from capital markets that can best be described as stingy If capital markets dont cooperate the companies have arranged two billion bridge loans from Deutsche Bank and General Motors Hughess parent company The GM bridge commitment is secured by a pledge of billion of EchoStar stock held in a trust controlled by the companys chairman and chief executive officer Charles Ergen He put up the stock after another bank backed out of the deal the companies said The transaction valued at billion will be accomplished in stages First Hughes will be spun off from GM Then EchoStar will be merged into Hughes The resulting entity will be called EchoStar and will offer service under Hughess DirecTV brand name DirecTV has more than million subscribers while EchoStars DISH Network serves about million customers Hughes also had a buyout offer from News Corp Ltd but GM decided the EchoStar bid was superior When we added up the value we saw in the relationship with EchoStar it just far exceeded any other option said Jack Shaw CEO of Hughes The companies expect to complete the transaction in the second half of next year Tom Leithauser DESPITE PACKED AGENDA LAWMAKERS TAKE ON RURAL BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT FCC UNE RULES Congresss work on antiterrorism legislation and national securi ty matters may have relegated most bigticket telecom items to the legislative backburner in recent weeks but that hasnt stopped some key lawmakers from forging ahead on bills to spur broadband service deployment in rural areas and examine the FCCs unbundled local switching rules In fact with little fanfare the Senate recently approved a fasttrack bill to set up competitively neutral telecom grant programs in rural areas that dont have basic dialup Internet access services Added as an amendment to the fiscal year spending bill for the Department of Agriculture by Sen Thad Cochran R Miss the legislation would permit the Secretary of Agriculture to distribute grants to the state public service commissions which in turn would oversee the establishment of grant programs to encourage carriers to build advanced networks and provide affordable broadband services in Internetstarved communities The Senate approved the overall spending bill last Thursday Oct by a vote Other efforts to stimulate broadband service deployment through financial incentives have also picked up in the House There Minority Leader Richard Gephardt D Mo has joined with several Democrats to urge the Senate leadership to consider attaching broadband tax credit legislation to that chambers economic stimulus package Writing last week to Senate Majori ty Thomas A Daschle D SD and Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus D Mont the lawmakers touted the Broadband Internet Access Act S HR as a way to increase network connectivity security productivity and infrastructure invest ment in rural communities The legislation has cosponsors in the House and in the Senate they said Clearly such broad support indicates the need to extend a highspeed information system to all Americans This legislation provides the vehicle for delivering such a system and we urge you to include it in the stimulus package said the Oct letter which was signed by Reps Gephardt Robert Matsui Calif Anna Eshoo Calif Rush Holt NJ Zoe Lofgren Calif Ellen Tauscher Calif Rosa DeLauro Conn Mike Honda Calif and Nancy Pelosi Calif Meanwhile the House Small Business Committee plans to revisit the telecom scene this week with a Nov hearing to review small businesses access to telecom services and whether a decision by the FCC unduly restricts access by small businesses to competi tive telecom services The hearing is set for pm in the panels regulatory reform and oversight subcommittee which held a pair of telecomrelated hearings earlier this year TR May and May A subcommittee aide told TR Daily today that the major focus of the hearing would be the FCCs rules governing when an incumbent local exchange carrier ILEC must make unbundled local switching available to carriers that provide service by leasing a platform of combined unbundled network elements UNEP Under existing rules ILECs dont have to provide unbundled switching when CLECs plan to use the network element to service business customers with four or more lines in a density zone pricing area in the top metropolitan statistical areas Debate over access to unbundled local switching has been conten tious pitting competitive local exchange carriers against the incumbent telcos and at times against each other TR March UNEPbased carriers are urging the FCC to expand the availability of unbundled local switching while CLECs that have their own switches and incumbent LECs are advocating that the Commission scale it back Last week for example Verizon Communications Inc asked the FCC to eliminate or significant ly limit ILECs obligations to provide local switching to competitors as a UNE TR Oct Former Small Business Committee Chairman James M Talent R Mo was highly critical of the FCCs rules regulating the provision of UNEs to competitors saying they were hindering UNE P carriers from obtaining the necessary switching services to serve smallbusiness customers TR July While Rep Talent may no longer hold the gavel the Small Busi ness committees position on the FCCs unbundled local switching rules hasnt changed the committee aide said today The committee is still very concerned that the FCCs UNE rules violate the Small Business Act and the Regulatory Flexibility Act because they hinder small companies from obtaining telecom services the aide said Ryan Oremland FCC CARRIERS WORK ON DETAILS TO RESOLVE NextWave DISPUTE The FCC and other parties involved in negotiations to resolve the NextWave Telecom Inc dispute are still exchanging draft settlement documents a source told TR Daily on Monday Sources last Friday said all the parties had reached a settlement to the fiveyear saga over NextWaves C and F block PCS personal communications service licenses and were hammering out the final details TR Oct Theres still a lot of details that have to be worked out one source said today Sources have said the FCC hoped to announce the settlement early this week As part of the agreement NextWave would walk away with about billion while the US government would get about billion Under an additional stipulation NextWave has agreed to pay Verizon Wireless about million and ATT Wireless Services Inc between million and million a source said The payments are designed to cover the amount the carriers have lost in interest on deposits they paid the government for NextWave spectrum they bid on at an auction earlier this year the source said The money also will pay the costs of providing bank letters of credit the source said Those letters will be provided in January by Verizon Wire less and Alaska Native Wireless LLCwhich is partly owned by ATT Wireless The two carriers were the top bidders at the auction In addition NextWave has agreed to pay the federal government million the source said Paul Kirby ALAMOSA RAMPS UP THIRD QUARTER REVENUES BUT NET LOSS WIDENS BY MILLION Alamosa Holdings Inc which sells Sprint PCS service in states mostly in the West and Southwest generated booming sequential revenue growth of during the third quarter but also saw its net loss balloon to million as a result of the rapid addition of new customers For the quarter ended Sept Alamosa posted total revenue of million up from million in the same quarter last year Of the third quarter total million was subscriber revenue and million was roaming revenue Alamosa added customers to its rolls during the quarter ending the period with subscribers We had a tremendous third quarter fueled by phenomenal customer acquisitions declared David Sharbutt chief executive officer in a conference call today The rapid customer growth was fueled in part by an increased push for sales under Alamosas automatic spending limit program The ASL program requires no customer deposit to begin service but limits the customer to of charges It allows Alamosa to refuse to provide additional service above the customers spending limit While the ASL program allows customers with higher credit risk to obtain service bad debt expenses are held down by the limit company executives explained As of Sept a total of of Alamosas customers were on the ASL plan versus at June Results to date from the ASL program have been better than our expectations explained Mr Sharbutt The CEO added that ASL program customers yield higher average revenue per user ARPU results than regular customers and this metric tends to offset a higher customer churn rate within the group For the quarter Alamosas monthly ARPU trended slightly higher to per customer from during the second quarter Churn rates for the third quarter rose to from in the second quarter Kendall Cowan chief financial officer offered that third quarter churn rates were not alarming as second quarter churn was unusually low for a company like us He speculated that increased churn may be a result possibly of the slowing in the economy though we are seeing no indication of that in areas of the country that we cover At least one Wall Street analyst was less optimistic about results driven by the ASL program Although things are working well right now we are concerned about potential repercussions of the ASL program namely higher churn and bad debt expense in the future commented Cynthia Motz of Credit Suisse First Boston Going forward Alamosa executives nudged upward fullyear expec tations on customer count to a range of to from a prior range of to At the same time Alamosa increased its fullyear EBITDA earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization loss forecast to a range of million to million from the prior guidance of million to million Lending assistance to better bottomline performance Alamosa cut its fullyear guidance on capital expenditures to a range of million to million from the previous estimate of up to million Echoing the drive toward better profitability Mr Sharbutt commented We continue to see improvements in operat ing efficiencies as we are nearing the completion of our network buildout and have transformed the company from being in the mode of launching markets quickly to adding subscribers and operating those markets in the most productive manner He added that Alamosa expected to begin offering third generation G services in the middle of next year but he didnt say what the financial effect of that would be John Curran TELECOM EARNINGS ROUNDUP

Former Verizon Attorney Joins Firm Mobility Concepts Names Marketing VP BTI Telecom CFO To Resign Rogers Adds Board Members From ATT Antenova Appoints New Director TELECOM REGULATION IXCs BUSINESS USERS TEAM ON PLAN FOR USF COLLECTIONS ATT Corp WorldCom Inc and two groups representing business users of telecom services have submitted a proposal to overhaul the broken and unsustainable system governing how carriers recover Universal Service Fund contributions from their custom ers But the proposal for a flat USF fee on every telecom connection is likely to face opposition from incumbent local exchange carriers and others Earlier this year the FCC began looking at a variety of possible changes to the way it collects USF contributions Among the possibilities raised in the Common Carrier docket proceed ing was whether contributions should be collected through flat fees on customer bills rather than through fees based on inter state revenues The proposal now being floated by ATT WorldCom the eCommerce Telecommunications Users Group and the Ad Hoc Telecommunications Users Group would allow for collection of USF contributions through flat fees on customers bills Residential and single line business customers for wireline services would pay per month per line residential and business wireless customers also would pay per month Assessments for pagers would be cents per month Multiline business customers would cover the remaining USF needs Under an interim step proposed to take effect Jan those needs would be calculated by taking the estimated USF funding required for and removing the amount covered by the other line charges The remainder would be recovered from multi line businesses with a perline charge A permanent solution that would take effect one year later would create three levels of perline fees for multiline busi ness customers Customers with a facility capacity of less than megabits per second would pay the level USF charge customers with a capacity of between Mbps and Mbps would pay five times that amount and customers with higher capacity facilities would pay times the level charge The basic level charge would be set at the appropriate level to cover the remaining funding needs of the USF The group said the oneyear interim period would allow carriers to develop the systems they need to develop the capacitybased assessments on multiline business customers During a conference call with reporters this afternoon Joel Lubin ATT vice presidentfederal government affairs said the current system was not competitively neutral Customers of long distance carriers pay for about of the USF he said while customers of local telephone companies and wireless carriers pay dramatically less With USF funding needs increasing and long distance revenues lagging the current system cant be sustained Mr Lubin said So long distance carriers want the system to be based on connections not customers he said The proposal is similar to one submitted by WorldCom in its initial comments in the proceeding The groups represented in the current coalition came together after the comments were filed with the FCC in June and they submitted their proposal to the FCC earlier this month Incumbent LECs have opposed flatfee proposals in the past This proposal appears to be no exception Lawrence E Sarjeant VP regulatory affairs and general counsel at the US Telecom Association said a perline charge was an an unlawful way to collect carriers contributions to the USF It fails to satisfy the requirement for a competitively neutral support mechanism he said Every service provider benefits from the fund and every provider should share the responsibility for contributing to the fund Mr Sarjeant said The large IXCs effort to change the univer sal service contribution mechanism is simply an attempt to fatten their bottom lines at the expense of other telecommunications carriers Brian Hammond SBCs InterLATA BID WINS APPROVAL BUT RAISES QUESTIONS ON DSL RESALE SBC Communications Inc has won the FCCs approval to offer in region interLATA local access and transport area services in Missouri and Arkansas although questions raised about SBCs DSL digital subscriber line service resale efforts have prompted the Commission to promise a new proceeding to look at unresolved DSL resale issues SBC now has authorization to offer inregion interLATA services in each of its original five states Arkansas Missouri Texas Oklahoma and Kansas The FCC found that it had met the point competitive checklist of marketopening steps outlined in section of the Telecommunications Act of Bell operat ing companies must meet those requirements before being cleared to offer inregion interLATA services One area of controversy in the proceeding involved SBCs compli ance with one of those points provision of wholesale services to resellers Section c of the Act re quires incumbent local exchange carriers to provide services at wholesale rates to resellers The services subject to the resale mandate are telecom services that an incumbent provides at retail and to subscribers that arent telecom carriers Some commenters told the FCC that SBC had failed to comply with the resale mandate as it pertained to DSL services They said SBC in combination with its Internet service provider affiliate offered DSL service on the retail market and therefore should make the underlying DSL transport component available to competi tive local exchange carriers CLECs for resale The FCC however said neither the Act nor Commission precedent explicitly addresses the unique facts or legal issues raised in the case The FCC hasnt addressed a situation in which an incumbent only offers DSL as part of an Internet access service rather than as a standalone retail product it said We expect that how we decide questions about the regulatory treatment of the underlying transmission facilities provided by incumbent LECs to their affiliate information service providers could have farreaching implications for a wide range of issues that would be more appropriately handled separately the FCC said Accordingly because Commission precedent does not address the specific facts or legal issues raised here we decline to reach a conclusion in the context of this section proceeding it said Instead the FCC said it would initiate a proceeding by yearend and would endeavor to complete the proceeding as soon as possible next year Some Commissioners appear to be leaning SBCs way on the issue Commissioner Kathleen Q Abernathy wrote separately to address the difficult and complex questions regarding SBCs DSL resale obligations She said the FCC appropriately concludes that the FCC cant find SBC in violation of the resale requirement because it has never held that an incumbent LECs DSL Internet access service as opposed to a distinct enduser DSL transport serv ice is subject to the resale obligation Based on the current record and existing precedent it appears that SBCs enduser Internet access service does not entail provision of a telecommunications service at retail and there fore that SBC is not required to make that service available for resale under section c she wrote I note that my analysis of this question is not free from doubt and both I and the Commission may adopt a different approach in the future based on a fully developed record FCC Commissioner Kevin J Martin made similar comments in his separate statement While the Commission may ultimately address this issue in more detail those who argue that this highspeed Internet access service provided to end users should be subject to section c must show how in light of Commission precedent this is a telecommunications service being offered at retail he wrote FCC Commissioner Michael J Copps called the ruling the closest of close calls He said the DSL resale proceeding could conceivably lead to changes in the implementation of the majority decision to authorize SBC to provide interLATA services in Missouri and Arkansas I am seriously troubled that for small business and residential customers SBC does not make available for resale pursuant to section c any DSL service offerings Mr Copps said The need to resolve these issues soon in the separate proceeding is made even starker when one considers the harmful impact of the failure to provide such an offering He worried that ILECs could use the loophole to limit the availability of other services for resale Meanwhile Qwest Communications International Inc chimed in to say that its wholesale service performance is comparable or better on key performance measures than SBC Steven Davis Qw ests senior vice presidentpolicy and law said his companys overall level of performance is already as good or better in our state region than SBCs successful filings That shows that were close to successfully reentering the long distance business in our region Mr Davis said Brian Hammond INDUSTRY COALITION PROPOSES ULTRAWIDEBAND REGULATORY REGIME An industry coalition has proposed a regime it says the FCC should use for regulating ultrawideband UWB devices The proposal includes prohibiting commercial UWB devices between and gigahertz In a Nov letter to FCC Chairman Michael K Powell the group suggests that the Commission regulate UWB devices using the following categories groundpenetrating radars automotive collision radars communications devices experimental devices and future categories of devices The letter was sent on behalf of aviation wireless satel lite and Global Positioning System companies and trade groups including the Air Transport Association of America American Airlines Delta Air Lines United Airlines Lockheed Martin Corp US GPS Industry Council Nokia QUALCOMM Inc WorldCom Inc Sirius Satellite Radio and XM Satellite Radio The coalition proposed that the FCC permit UWB groundpene trating radar applications below GHz permit UWB communica tions devices between and GHz and automotive collision radar devices between and GHz prohibit commercial UWB devices between and GHz limit outofband emissions so UWB devices dont interfere with incumbent systems develop an expedited UWB licensing scheme seek public comment before adopting new regulations and permit experimental UWB device use under the FCCs current rules The coalition also renewed its call for the FCC to adopt a further notice of proposed rulemaking in its proceeding in Engineering and Technology docket UWB companies say a further notice is unnecessary FCC officials have said they plan to take action in the proceeding by yearend UWB companies have maintained that the devices would be able to operate between and GHz without causing harmful interference to existing systems But UWB marketers have expressed some willingness to compromise to address the concerns of other spectrum users For example in a Nov ex parte filing one such company Time Domain Corp said it would support restrict ing the eligibility of operators of outdoor tracking and radar below GHz in an effort to reduce the number of users Paul Kirby C BLOCK AUCTION BIDDER MAY CHALLENGE NextWave DEAL A company that participated in the C block auction involv ing NextWave Telecom Inc said today it might file a court challenge to the settlement involving NextWave the US govern ment and other carriers Will Yandell chief executive officer of Memphis Tennbased Eldorado Communications LLC complained that the settlement effectively undercuts the integrity of the Commissions auction process and the evenhanded application of the FCC rules Stephen Roberts Eldorados managing director told TRDaily the company could challenge the settlement in court We think there can and should be remedies for the guys who follow the rules he said Eldorado won three licenses at the C block auction but later returned them because it said NextWave had pushed the prices for the spectrum up too high On Nov the company filed an emergency petition with the FCC asking the agency to halt all private settlement negotiations TR Nov It argued that the negotiations violated FCC rules the Administrative Procedure Act and constitutional due process guarantees On Nov the company filed a Freedom of Information Act request seeking all documents and data related to the FCCs participation in the settlement Under the settlement announced Friday the US government would get about billion NextWave would walk away with about billion and carriers that bid on NextWaves licenses at an auction earlier this year would get the spectrum TR Nov The parties are seeking legislation that would codify the agree ment and direct courts to handle any challenges in an expedited manner Paul Kirby TELECOM BUSINESS GLOBAL CROSSING WILL GET M FROM SALE OF IPC TRADING SYSTEMS Global Crossing Ltd bought IPC Communications Inc last year because it needed customers It now is selling a large piece of IPC because it needs cash But the million generated by the sale of IPC Trading Systems wont even fund Global Crossing through according to one financial analyst Bermudabased Global Crossing needs to collect million through the sale of noncore assets just to get through next year said Frank J Governali of Goldman Sachs Asset sales may get Global Crossing through but under our revised assump tions the company will be in breach of its existing bank cove nants The company is currently in discussions with the banks to work out new covenant terms This is a critical piece of the puzzle for Global Crossingss survival An investment group led by Goldman Sachs Capital Partners has agreed to pay cash for IPC Trading Systems which provides desktop units used by securities traders Global Crossing paid billion in stock for IPC in mid The trading system part of the business at that time was generating more than half of IPCs revenue The remainder came from IPCs private networks and Webhosting operations Global Crossing acquired IPC to gain applications and users for its global wholesale network IPC and its IXnet Inc subsid iary had a large customer base in the financial services market which was one of the vertical markets that Global Crossing was targeting Included in the sale of IPC Trading Systems are its AsiaPacific assets which Global Crossing transferred in July to its affili ate Asia Global Crossing Ltd Global Crossing and Asia Global Crossing will remain the preferred provider for IPC Trading Systemss telecom needs the companies said They didnt dis close how much revenue that business might generate for Global Crossing Global Crossing also is attempting to sell Global Marine Systems an undersea cable construction business that it bought from Cable Wireless plc in for million in cash and assumed debt The divestiture of IPC as well as other noncore assets such as Global Marine Systems will strengthen our focus on becoming one of the worlds leading telecommunications service providers and at the same time improve our companys cash position said John Legere chief executive officer of Global Crossing and Asia Global Crossing Tom Leithauser MOTOROLA OFFERS M FOR

above comparablematurity Treasury yields The year Treasury note as of Friday carried a yield of around and the year bill was yielding about Should Verizon go forward with the debt sale proceeds could

REGIONAL Arguss to extend cable TV networks MISSOURI Staff backs competitive status for SW Bell LD service The Public Service Commission staff has recommended granting competitive status to Southwestern Bell Long Distances and SBC Long Distances long distance service The staff also asked the commission to approve the Southwestern Bell Telephone Co subsidiaries applications to provide long distance service and tariffs The staff originally wanted to deny the subsidiaries competitive status because they had opportunities to potentially subsidize their long distance service Competitive long distance companies can increase their rates on days notice and decrease their rates on seven days notice without filing costofservice studies The staff now believes the FCCs affiliate rules combined with the commissions ability to suspend and review tariffs will safeguard against provisioning long distance service priced below cost The subsidiaries proposed offering businesses long distance service for rates ranging from cents to cents per minute depending on minimum revenue commitments and term length The subsidiaries will charge residential customers cents per minute for long distance service according to their tariffs The staff which estimates the subsidiaries will pay about cents per minute in switchedaccess charges to provide domestic long distance service concluded that the proposed rates werent priced below cost The shackling of the subsidiaries with noncompetitive status would thwart the subsidiaries ability to compete in the long distance market SW Bell said There is absolutely no basis for singling out the subsidiaries for disparate regulatory treatment SW Bell said A noncompetitive classification would subject the companies tariffs to a day notice requirement and file and suspend procedures for tariff changes which could delay approval of tariff changes for up to months SW Bell said Noncompetitive status would also require the subsidiaries to file costofservice studies with proposed rate changes The FCC last week approved SW Bells application to provide in region interLATA local access and transport area service under section of the federal Telecommunications Act of The FCCs approval takes effect Nov but the subsidiaries cant provide service until the state commission approves the companies applications to provide long distance service The commission may issue a ruling on the subsidiaries applications today the staff told TR Case TA TA NEW JERSEY BPU lowers UNE rates The Board of Public Utilities today reduced the rate competitors must pay Verizon New Jersey Inc to lease the unbundled network elements UNEs necessary to offer consumers local phone service from to a difference of about Ratepayer Advocate Blossom A Peretz said she was pleased with todays board decision Ms Peretz had filed a June brief with the BPU urging the board to reduce the wholesale UNE rate to less than per line per month from the price the BPU set in The next step is to see whether this new UNE rate actually works and serves as an incentive to telephone companies to come to New Jersey to offer local service in competition to Verizons near monopoly said Ms Peretz We should know by next spring whether we will have irreversible competition in the local telephone market she said alluding to Verizons intention to file for section authorization to offer interLATA local access and transport area service in the state Todays decision also established an unbundled network element platform UNEP rate of about lower than the existing rate the BPU said UNEPs are combinations of the loop and switching elements in one package that the BPU requires incumbent local exchange carriers to offer to competitors The board first established UNE rates in After the US District Court in Newark struck down the UNE pricing regime adopted by the BPU for Verizon New Jersey Inc then Bell Atlantic Corp the BPU decided to begin a proactive rate review a spokesman for the BPU told TR Docket TO In the Matter of the Boards Review of Unbundled Network Elements Rates Terms and Conditions of Bell AtlanticNew Jersey Inc MAINE OPA calls Verizon altreg plan unlawful The Public Advocate has asked the state Supreme Court to vacate Verizon Maine Incs fiveyear alternative regulation plan alleging that the plan is unlawful The Public Utilities Commission approved the plan last May The Public Advocate said that plan which increased residential monthly rates by per line was based on insufficient Verizon cost information a spokesman for the Public Advocates office told TR The plan is expected to produce an additional million in annual revenue for Verizon over its fiveyear term The Public Advocate asserted that PUC violated a the statutory requirement which states that residential and small business ratepayers should not be required to pay more for local telephone service than they would have been required to pay under traditional ratebase or rateofreturn regulation The Public Advocate added that the commission failed to hold a proper hearing and collect the evidence necessary to make a determination of whether the alternative regulation plan would cost consumers more than traditional ratebased regulation The Public Advocate had asked the PUC consider Verizons revenue requirements early in the proceeding but the PUC rejected the request The Public Advocate said Verizon was subsequently permitted to present revenue evidence similar to the evidence the PUC had rejected during the rebuttal stage of the case This action violated the state constitutions due process clause the Public Advocate argued The Public Advocate also said that the increased local service rates would be used to compensate Verizon for the loss of certain specific revenues from nonlocal services instead of the cost of providing local services Docket ILLINOIS Bills would update criminal code Rep Edward Acevedo D District has introduced a pair of bills HB and HB that would amend the Criminal Code of and the Emergency Telephone System Act to help combat terrorism and false terrorism reports HB would make it illegal to make a false report of terrorism or other danger The bill states that making a false complaint or request by calling the emergency response system would be considered a class two felony Violators would face imprisonment and in fines The bill also would require violators to pay restitution to public safety agencies for total outofpocket expenses incurred during the intentional false alarm A spokesperson from the Speaker of the Houses office told TR that HB also would delete language in the code related to making threats over the emergency response system HB would then amend the code to impose stronger penalties and to add language about false terrorism The spokesperson added the bills are part of a comprehensive antiterrorism package being pushed by Chicago The bills await committee referral OREGON Prepaid phone card company settles with AG NorteCom Inc has entered into an agreement with Attorney General Hardy Meyers that settles charges which stated that the company was selling prepaid phone cards with another companys tollfree number printed on the back Under the settlement NorteCom must provide its customers with new cards or restitution The Department of Justice was alerted to the problem by Thomas and Ann Taylor owners of North Star Marine Inc The Taylors were concerned about the number of distraught consumers who were attempting to use a prepaid calling to call family in Mexico but instead were reaching the Taylors business the AG said The Taylors said they received up to calls a day Two numbers were printed on the cards one that connected callers directly to Mexico and the Taylors number that was supposed to be used when calling from Mexico to the US the AG said The Taylors complained to the company but the calls continued Under the Assurance of Voluntary Compliance which was filed in Marion County Circuit Court NorteCom must obtain a new numberin addition to providing restitution or new cards to consumers The agreement admits no violation of law NEW HAMPSHIRE Verizon to remove callingcard discount The Public Utilities Commission has decided to allow Verizon New Hampshire Inc to remove a callingcard discount from the CallAround Optional Toll Calling Plan The tariff which was scheduled to take effect Oct was suspended until Nov to provide the PUC time to consider the possible harm removing the discount would cause to consumers PUC staff recommended rejecting the tariff arguing that customers using the calling cards would see a rate increase while the revenue effect on the company is in the companys own worlds negligible The PUC authorized Verizon to increase rates for new customers but grandfathered existing callaround customers DT MISSOURI SBC LD applications remain pending The Public Service Commission wont decide this week whether to approve SBC Communications Incs long distance subsidiaries applications for certificates to offer long distance service The earliest the commission could consider the applications Nov a commission staff member told TR Last week the FCC approved SBCs application to provide in region interLATA local access and transport area service under section of the federal Telecommunications Act of The FCCs approval takes effect Nov but SBC cant provide service until the PSC approves the subsidiaries applications Southwestern Bell Long Distance and SBC Long Distance are the subsidiaries that applied for the certificates The commissions review of the applications was delayed by its decision to investigate ATT Communications of the Southwest Incs allegations that the tariffs contained in the applications included rates that were predatory because they were priced below cost ATT subsequently withdrew its request for a hearing on the matter after concluding that the PSCs procedural schedule didnt provide sufficient time to conduct adequate discovery ATT said it wasnt willing to commit its limited resources to a proceeding that denies ATT an adequate opportunity to be heard on competitively important issues SBC characterized ATTs predatory pricing claims as further attempts to delay SBCs entry into the long distance market and dispute the incumbents access charges Case TA TA KENTUCKY Nonprimary listings not subject to wholesale discounts The Public Service Commission has concluded that nonprimary listings arent a telecommunications service and therefore dont qualify for a wholesale discount in interconnection agreements with UNEP unbundled network elementplatform competitive local exchange carriers Brandenburg Telecom LLC asked the commission to require Verizon South Inc to charge its wholesale rate for nonprimary or additional listings The commission concluded additional listings are not network elements necessary to provide telecommunication service Primary listings qualify for cost based rates the PSC said If Brandenburg was reselling Verizons service additional listings would be available at a wholesale discount the PSC said Because Bradenburg provides facilitiesbased service it must pay Verizons tariffed retail rates the PSC added Case IOWA Board to hold hearing on Qwest prices The Utilities Board has scheduled a Dec hearing to consider prices Qwest Corp proposed in June for wholesale services and unbundled network elements UNEs The prices would be for new UNEs Qwest intends to offer through its statement of generally available terms SGAT In July the consumer advocate objected to Qwests proposal raising issues about whether the proposed prices were cost based and whether the costing methodology Qwest used to derive the proposed prices complied with applicable state and federal law Docket RPU FLORIDA Workshop to review rateincrease notice plan The Public Service Commission has scheduled a Jan workshop to review a proposed rule requiring telecom companies to mail customers notices of rate increases at least days before they take effect Under current rules telecom companies can implement rate increases by filing tariffs In May the Office of Public Counsel asked the PSC to implement the notification rule Customers should not be forced to pay any higher rates or receive services under different terms and conditions

which issues telecom related or not will come to a head under a Democraticled Commerce Science and Transportation Committee But incoming Chairman Ernest F Hollings D SC already has singled out one item for immediate attention downsizing the Commerce Committee The panel gained two seats for a total of at the outset of the th Congress Under a Senate powersharing pact that went into effect last January all the committees were drawn up to reflect the Senates split between Democrats and Republicans TR Jan But with Sen James Jeffordss R Vt departure from the GOP expected to take effect this week Democrats are pushing a new reorganization plan that would give them a oneseat advantage on each committee For the Commerce Committee Sen Hollings prefers trimming a Republican from the panel rather than adding a Democrat his spokesman said He feels the Commerce Committee is starting to get too large and plans to work with incoming Majority Leader Thomas A Daschle D SD to come up with a final determination the spokesman told TR today It is too early to discuss specific Commerce Committee agenda items for the remainder of the year the Hollings spokesman said But before he begins pushing an agenda Sen Hollings will confer with current Commerce Committee Chairman John McCain R Ariz he added While the committees priorities have yet to be determined the style in which they work wont be changing the spokesman said Clearly Sens McCain and Hollings have a longstanding working relationship and cover issues that transcend party lines They pride themselves on moving things out of that committee in bipartisan fashion and that isnt going to change he added On the telecom front Sen Hollings is in line to become chairman of the communications subcommittee but hes not expected to assume that post Instead the subcommittees gavel likely will return to Sen Daniel K Inouye Hawaii who last held the top spot there in A HollingsInouye pairing would be good news for those who dont

OF PRIVATE CELLPHONE RECORDS The group that led a sixyear million industryfunded effort to study the health effects of mobile phones has agreed to settle a classaction lawsuit The suit was filed in on behalf of mobile phone users who claimed their privacy was invaded Their phone records were reviewed without their permission as part of the research project the plaintiffs said Wireless Technology Research LLC has agreed to turn over the remaining million of a million insurance policy that the wireless industry purchased for it in the wake of the litigation As part of the settlement agreement of those funds will be set aside to fund a voluntary surveillance registry to assess whether there is a link between mobile phone use and illnesses The registry will be run by WTR Chairman George L Carlo who had a falling out with the wireless industry after he accused it of failing to act on research that he said indicated a link between mobile phone use and adverse health effects The

local exchange carrier CLEC Core Communications Inc CoreTel has asked the FCC to stay the effectiveness of a recent order overhauling reciprocal compensation rules The new rules are designed to phase out payments received by carriers for connecting calls to Internet service providers ISPs CoreTel said the order could force it to abandon some of its markets CoreTel took issue with two provisions of the order in Common Carrier dockets and TR April One is the ban on carriers receiving reciprocal compensation for terminating calls to ISPs in any new markets entered after the adoption of the order The other is the growth cap provision which limits annual increases in a carriers reciprocal compensation revenue The order allows CLECs that already are operating in a particular geographic area to continue receiving reciprocal compensation revenues up to the limit set by the growth cap while hampering new CLECs CoreTel noted That situation puts new CLECs entering those markets at an extreme competitive disadvantage it said The business that CoreTel will lose as a result of these new rules and the competitive advantage they confer on established CLECs is incalculable and irremediable at some later date CoreTel said It will suffer irreparable harm if the provisions arent stayed pending judicial review the company added NEWS IN BRIEF New FCC Cable Bureau Chief Kenneth Ferree has

Wood has proposed rules to regulate the inclusion of noncommunications charges on phone bills Existing law which authorizes only communications related charges on phone bills is scheduled to expire July The proposed rules are designed to prevent cramming which is the placement of unauthorized charges on phone bills The proposed rules require telecom companies to obtain a customers written consent before including noncommunications charges on phone bills Customers may revoke their consent at any time without charge and may identify a dollar maximum per charge and per billing cycle on noncommunications charges Telecom companies may not disconnect or threaten to disconnect basic local phone service for nonpayment of noncommunications charges Under the proposed rules telecom companies must take reasonable precautions to screen vendors and billing agents before agreeing to provide noncommunications billing services for them Noncommunications charges must be identified in a separate section of phone bills Comments are due June Rulemaking MISSOURI House passes rightsofway bill The House has passed a bill restricting local governments authority to regulate public

Utilities Commission require Pacific Bell to permit MCImetro Access Transmission Services LLCs customers to presubscribe to Pacific Bells intraLATA local access and transport area long distance service The recommendation was made in a draft arbitrators report about the companies interconnection agreement Pacific Bell said the requirement would be confusing to customers and would require the company to identify a separate billing channel or generate a bill solely for intraLATA long distance service It is blatantly discriminatory for Pacific to refuse to provide intraLATA toll service to MCIs local service customers Ms Jones said She said Pacifics arguments of customer confusion and billing concerns do not have merit Customers could receive three different bills for the three different services and other carriers cope with billing for only one of those three services There is no reason that Pacific should not be able to provide a bill which includes only intraLATA services

transport area services in the state The company expects to file its application later this month with the FCC which under the Telecommunications Act of will consult with the US Department of Justice and the relevant state regulators before issuing a decision The state regulators role is to advise the FCC on whether a Bell company has complied with the local exchange marketopening mandates of the Act In a vote the PUC told Verizon that it must agree to a permanent performance assurance plan with selfexecuting remedies based on the New York model already accepted by the FCC The company also must withdraw its pending judicial challenge of the PUCs authority to impose remedies aimed at preventing backsliding on local exchange marketopening commitments The PUC said the company must agree to

PROCEDURES Two environmental groups have launched an attack on the FCCs antenna licensing process saying the agency should assess the direct indirect and cumulative effects before issuing new licenses Friends of the Earth and the Forest Conservation Council issued their appeal in petitions asking the FCC to deny antenna license applications The groups say the environmental assessments prepared for those projects fail to include the information and analysis mandated by the National Environmental Policy Act NEPA Council of Envi ronmental Quality regulations and FCC rules In addition applicants failed to meet the requirements of the Endangered Species Act the Clean Water Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act the groups allege The companies seeking permission to build the new antennas dismiss the charges They say their applications fully comply with applicable regulations The environmental groups fail to provide any specific justification or evidence against their projects and lack standing in the proceeding the companies say The groups challenge should be raised in a formal rulemaking proceeding they add Of course the Commission must consider and evaluate goodfaith challenges to environmental compliance American Tower LP said in defense of its plans for a Maryland antenna tower Complaints as vague insubstantial and deficient as those in the present petition however are unfair waste already strained compliance resources of both Commission and applicants and can cause serious harm to a given tower project or even to the overall industry through unnecessary

Pennsylvania Inc plans to accept conditions that the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission imposed today on its support for the companys planned application to provide interLATA local access and transport area services in the state The company expects to file its application later this month with the FCC which under the Telecommunications Act of will consult with the US Department of Justice and the relevant state regulators before issuing a decision The state regulators role is to advise the FCC on whether a Bell company has complied with the local exchange marketopening mandates of the Act In a vote the PUC told Verizon that it must agree to a permanent performance assurance plan with selfexecuting remedies based on the New York model already accepted by the FCC The company also must withdraw its pending judicial challenge of the PUCs authority to impose remedies aimed at preventing backsliding on local exchange marketopening commitments The PUC said the company must agree to increase certain penalties from to And the commission said Verizon must agree to increase remedies for failing to provide accurate electronic billing to competitors the company could face payments as high as per affected competitive local exchange carrier for missing an electronic billing standard Commissioners Nora Mead Brownell and Terrance J Fitzpatrick dissented Commissioner Brownell said I cannot in good conscience affirm that these markets are open as envisioned under the Act Both dissenting commissioners listed several areas in which Verizon had failed to show that local markets are open to competition But Colleen McCloskey senior vice presidentstate government relations and external affairs at Verizon said she believed those concerns were addressed by the conditions the PUC laid out Ms McCloskey noted that New York Massachusetts and Pennsylvania comprise the lions share of Verizon Communications Incs access lines Verizon already is providing interLATA service in New York and Massachusetts Winning approval in Pennsylvania would mean the company is making substantial progress toward meeting an FCC requirement for Verizons regaining control of Internet backbone service

MEETINGS WITH LAWMAKERS FCC Commissioner Kathleen Q Abernathy still in her first week on the job already is sending letters to members of Congress seeking meetings to discuss the Commissions work In an interview today with TR she said she viewed her new role as an interpreter of Congresss statutory mandate The public never has a chance to vote for FCC Commissioners unlike members of Congress she noted Many of the predictions and assumptions made about the pace of technological and market change when the Telecommunications Act of was passed were wrong Ms Abernathy said But that doesnt mean the Act has been a failure she added She cited increasing choices for consumers as one of the positive gains made since The commissioner who was directorgovernment affairs at Broadband Office Inc emphasized the importance of information provided by Congress industry officials consumer groups and state regulators Despite her experience in various industry segments shes not an engineer or an economist she said She appreciates organized presentations and creative ideas she added See Mondays TR for a full transcript of the interview TWO ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS CHALLENGE FCCs ANTENNA LICENSING PROCEDURES Two environmental groups have launched an attack on the FCCs antenna licensing process saying the agency should assess the direct indirect and cumulative effects before issuing new licenses Friends of the Earth and the Forest Conservation Council issued their appeal in petitions asking the FCC to deny antenna license applications The groups say the environmental assessments prepared for those projects fail to include the information and analysis mandated by the National Environmental Policy Act NEPA Council of Envi ronmental Quality regulations and FCC rules In addition applicants failed to meet the requirements of the Endangered Species Act the Clean Water Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act the groups allege The companies seeking permission to build the new antennas dismiss the charges They say their applications fully comply with applicable regulations The environmental groups fail to provide any specific justification or evidence against their projects and lack standing in the proceeding the companies say The groups challenge should be raised in a formal rulemaking proceeding they add Of course the Commission must consider and evaluate goodfaith challenges to environmental compliance American Tower LP said in defense of its plans for a Maryland antenna tower Complaints as vague insubstantial and deficient as those in the present petition however are unfair waste already strained compliance resources of both Commission and applicants and can cause serious harm to a given tower project or even to the overall industry through unnecessary

its network at the expense of consumers The PSC ordered the access charge reductions to be passed through to West Virginia toll customers Verizon responded People shouldnt hold their breath waiting for ATT to pass along any savings Case no TC ATT Communications of West Virginia Inc v Bell AtlanticWest Virginia Inc CALIFORNIA Wood proposes anticramming rules Public Utilities Commissioner Charles Wood has proposed rules to regulate the inclusion of noncommunications charges on phone bills Existing law which authorizes only communications related charges on phone bills is scheduled to expire July The proposed rules are designed to prevent cramming which is the placement of unauthorized charges on phone bills The proposed rules require telecom companies to obtain a customers written consent before including noncommunications charges on phone bills Customers may revoke their consent at any time without charge and may identify a dollar maximum per charge and per billing cycle on noncommunications charges Telecom companies may not disconnect or threaten to disconnect basic local phone service for nonpayment of noncommunications charges Under the proposed rules telecom companies must take reasonable precautions to screen vendors and billing agents before agreeing to provide noncommunications billing services for them Noncommunications charges must be identified in a separate section of phone bills Comments are due June Rulemaking MISSOURI House passes rightsofway bill The House has passed a bill restricting local governments authority to regulate public rightsofway The measure now goes to Gov Bob Holden D Southwestern Bell Telephone Co and competitive local exchange carriers support the bill but the Missouri Municipal League fought the bill tooth and nail a league spokesperson told TR SB would prohibit local governments from requiring telecom companies to obtain a franchise to use rightsofway but would grandfather franchise agreements in effect

Utilities Commission require Pacific Bell to permit MCImetro Access Transmission Services LLCs customers to presubscribe to Pacific Bells intraLATA local access and transport area long distance service The recommendation was made in a draft arbitrators report about the companies interconnection agreement Pacific Bell said the requirement would be confusing to customers and would require the company to identify a separate billing channel or generate a bill solely for intraLATA long distance service It is blatantly discriminatory for Pacific to refuse to provide intraLATA toll service to MCIs local service customers Ms Jones said She said Pacifics arguments of customer confusion and billing concerns do not have merit Customers could receive three different bills for the three different services and other carriers cope with billing for only one of those three services There is no reason that Pacific should not be able to provide a bill which includes only intraLATA services

Bells deadline for filing information demonstrating its compliance with the interLATA local access and transport area marketentry requirements of section of California code The section requires the

encourage increased subscribership and infrastructure rollout in tribal areas Common Carrier docket MICHIGAN Customers can bring complaints without counsel The Public Service Commission yesterday ruled that business and residential telephone customers can bring slamming or cramming complaints to the commission without the assistance of an attorney The PSCs ruling involved a complaint filed by Seaway Painting LLC against WorldCom Inc about a billing dispute The PSC dismissed the complaint as requested by the petitioner but concluded that Seaway may refile its complaint and proceed with the assistance of a person of its choice who need not be a licensed attorney The commission based its decision on a provision of the Michigan Telecommunications Act which provides Hearings shall be conducted in a manner as to optimize expediency convenience and the ability of end users to bring and prosecute without the assistance of counsel complaints alleging slamming or cramming while

Research LLC has agreed to turn over the remaining million of a million insurance policy that the wireless industry purchased for it in the wake of the litigation As part of the settlement agreement of those funds will be set aside to fund a voluntary surveillance registry to assess whether there is a link between mobile phone use and illnesses The registry will be run by WTR Chairman George L Carlo who had a falling out with the wireless industry after he accused it of failing to act on research that he said indicated a link between mobile phone use and adverse health effects The settlement also reserves for future legal expenses of Mr Carlo and WTR In addition mobile phone subscribers included in the class would get a discount on a book Mr Carlo coauthored last year Cell

local exchange carrier CLEC Core Communications Inc CoreTel has asked the FCC to stay the effectiveness of a recent order overhauling reciprocal compensation rules The new rules are designed to phase out payments received by carriers for connecting calls to Internet service providers ISPs CoreTel said the order could force it to abandon some of its markets CoreTel took issue with two provisions of the order in Common Carrier dockets and TR April One is the ban on carriers receiving reciprocal compensation for terminating calls to ISPs in any new markets entered after the adoption of the order The other is the growth cap provision which limits annual increases in a carriers reciprocal compensation revenue The order allows CLECs that already are operating in a particular geographic area to continue receiving reciprocal compensation revenues up to the limit set by the growth cap while hampering new CLECs CoreTel noted That situation puts new CLECs entering those markets at an extreme competitive disadvantage it said The business that CoreTel will lose as a result of these new rules and the competitive advantage they confer on established CLECs is incalculable and irremediable at some later date CoreTel said It will suffer irreparable harm if the provisions arent stayed pending judicial review the company added NEWS IN BRIEF New FCC Cable Bureau Chief Kenneth Ferree has
