DISPATCH offers you a jump on special travel deals and news emailemailjspeta Companies Turn to Grades and Employees Go to Court By REED ABELSON An increasingly popular technique for evaluating employees is prompting lawsuits charging discrimination at three big companies At issue is the ranking of managers professionals and sometimes lowerlevel employees from best to worst or grading them on a bell curve and then using that ranking to help determine pay and sometimes whether to fire someone In their suits all filed over the last year or so employees at Microsoft Ford Motor and Conoco say the rating systems are unfair because they favor some groups of employees over others white males over blacks and women younger managers over older ones and foreign citizens over Americans A growing number of companies are turning to grading systems also known as forced rankings or distributions as a way of making sure managers evaluate employees honestly and make clearer distinctions among them At companies that do not compare employees with one another this way nearly every employee can come away feeling above average like the children of Lake Wobegon But under the grading system managers are forced to identify some people as low performers At General Electric for example supervisors identify the top percent and bottom percent of their managerial and professional employees every year The bottom percent are not likely to stay As John F Welch Jr General Electrics chief executive wrote last month to shareholders A company that bets its future on its people must remove that lower percent and keep removing it every year always raising the bar of performance and increasing the quality of its leadership Ranking or grading employees is also common at technology companies like Cisco Systems and Hewlett Packard But recently the concept has been catching on more broadly according to management consultants One reason is that as the economy slows companies often lay off employees Cisco for example announced earlier this month that it would let go as many as workers and would use grading as one way to identify people to lay off Companies are playing their version of Survivor said David Thomas a professor at the Harvard Business School Another reason is that some companies are eager to copy Mr Welch long viewed as one of the most successful managers in America Defenders of these systems say anyone who gets a low grade is likely to view the process as unfair A students love grades F students hate grades said John Sullivan a human resources professor at San Francisco State University But the techniques which some employees label with terms like rank and yank have come under sharp criticism While they appear to offer an objective way to judge employees they can be vulnerable to bias Mr Thomas said Managers may stereotype employees when evaluating them on vague criteria like career potential deciding that older workers for example may have a harder time keeping up with new technology In some cases managers can view these systems as a tool to be used to weed out the ones you dont want said Thomas S McLeod a lawyer in Canton Mich who represents employees suing Ford in another case Critics of the system also argue that companies should not apply a bell curve in which a small number of employees get the highest and lowest rankings and a much larger number are grouped in the middle The bell curve model assumes a normal distribution among a very large group of random individuals not small groups What is more across a company people who belong to a particularly talented unit will suffer if a certain number of them must be given poorer grades than they would get in another unit You end up with dysfunctional results said Edward E Lawler III a business professor at the University of Southern California Some lawsuits contend that Microsofts grading systems are discriminatory One filed last October seeks classaction status on behalf of blacks and women The suit states that the rating system permits managers who are predominantly white males to rate employees based upon their own biases rather than based upon merit According to the lawsuit employees are rated on a fivepoint scale with only a certain percentage permitted to receive each score Employees doing the same job in the same unit are also given a stack ranking from most to least valuable Managers decide those rankings largely using what are called lifeboat discussions where they choose which employees they would want with them if stuck in a lifeboat Managers had no other clear criteria according to Christine Webber a lawyer at Cohen Milstein Hausfeld Toll who is representing the employees Grading is highly subjective at Microsoft according to Peter M Browne a former executive who is also suing the company charging discrimination Mr Browne who is black said managers were forced to use a curve in evaluating even small groups He said he had to rate a group of five on a curve for example in deciding which ones would not receive stock options You werent told anything just meet the curve Mr Browne said He says managers ended up favoring people with whom they socialized People gravitate to people who are like them and the system just forces that he said Microsoft defends its system as fair and helpful We want to give the highest compensation to the very top performers said Deborah Willingham senior vice president for human resources adding that the system included checks and balances to ensure fair treatment Employees can appeal their ratings for example and are largely responsible for developing the criteria by which they are evaluated Ms Willingham also said the company did not ask its managers to give a fixed percentage of their employees any given score We dont force that curve to look any certain way she said Microsoft has no formal stack rank policy she said And when managers do have lifeboat discussions they are a tool to consider which employees they would want to keep if they were starting again While the company would not comment on the lawsuits Microsoft expressly prohibits discrimination Ms Willingham said Similar criticisms emerged in a lawsuit brought last month against Ford It argues that the companys new grading system discriminates against older workers The company which adopted what it calls its performance management process a year ago gives its managers A B or C grades Last year the company awarded percent an A percent a B and percent a C Ford also faces a second lawsuit asserting that it unfairly discriminated against older white males in its gradingIt would not comment on the litigation but defended its use of grades We believe the system is fair and nondiscriminatory a company spokeswoman said We are in a very competitive industry and we need all of our employees to be the best they can be At Conoco employees contend that the company discriminated against United States citizens and older workers when it laid off a dozen geophysicists and other scientists in based on a ranking from one to four according to a lawsuit filed last year The majority of those let go were Americans according to the suit as opposed to British Norwegian and Canadian professionals The rating system was selectively enforced and there were instances of manipulation said John Zavitsanos the lawyer representing the workers Even though some were given higher ratings on earlier rankings they were eventually given the lowest possible rating of four Conoco based in Houston has extensive operations in the North Sea and many of the senior managers at the division in question are British according to Mr Zavitsanos While Conoco said it could not comment on the litigation it said its evaluations were based on several factors including performance skills and expertise The company said ratings often changed as more information was collected and people were evaluated in larger groups Conoco company also denied that decisions were based on anything other than individual capabilities Companies do need something in making pay decisions downsizing decisions said Jim Kochanski a consultant with Nextera Enterprises The problem is that companies may not take enough care in deciding how people should be ranked They can get it very wrong

behalf of blacks and women The suit states that the rating system permits managers who are predominantly white males to rate employees based upon their own biases rather than based upon merit According to the lawsuit employees are rated on a fivepoint scale with only a certain percentage permitted to receive each score Employees doing the same job in the same unit are also given a stack ranking from most to least valuable Managers decide those rankings largely using what are called lifeboat discussions where they choose which employees they would want with them if stuck in a lifeboat Managers had no other clear criteria according to Christine Webber a lawyer at Cohen Milstein Hausfeld Toll who is representing the employees Grading is highly subjective at Microsoft according to Peter M Browne a former executive who is also suing the company charging discrimination Mr Browne who is black said managers were forced to use a curve in evaluating even small groups He said he had to rate a group of five on a curve for example in deciding which ones would not receive stock options You werent told anything just meet the curve Mr Browne said He says managers ended up favoring people with whom they socialized People gravitate to people who are like them and the system just forces that he said Microsoft defends its system as fair and helpful We want to give the highest compensation to the very top performers said Deborah Willingham senior vice president for human resources adding that the system included checks and balances to ensure fair treatment Employees can appeal their ratings for example and are largely responsible for developing the criteria by which they are evaluated Ms Willingham also said the company did not ask its managers to give a fixed percentage of their employees any given score We dont force that curve to look any certain way she said Microsoft has no formal stack rank policy she said And when managers do have lifeboat discussions they are a tool to consider which employees they would want to keep if they were starting again While the company would not comment on the lawsuits Microsoft expressly prohibits discrimination Ms Willingham said Similar criticisms emerged in a lawsuit brought last month against Ford It argues that the companys new grading system discriminates against older workers The company which adopted what it calls its performance management process a year ago gives its managers A B or C grades Last year the company awarded percent an A percent a B and percent a C Ford also faces a second lawsuit asserting that it unfairly discriminated against older white males in its gradingIt would not comment on the litigation but defended its use of grades We believe the system is fair and nondiscriminatory a company spokeswoman said We are in a very competitive industry and we need all of our employees to be the best they can be At Conoco employees contend that the company discriminated against United States citizens and older workers when it laid off a dozen geophysicists and other scientists in based on a ranking from one to four according to a lawsuit filed last year The majority of those let go were Americans according to the suit as opposed to British Norwegian and Canadian professionals The rating system was selectively enforced and there were instances of manipulation said John Zavitsanos the lawyer representing the workers Even though some were given higher ratings on earlier rankings they were eventually given the lowest possible rating of four Conoco based in Houston has extensive operations in the North Sea and many of the senior managers at the division in question are British according to Mr Zavitsanos While Conoco said it could not comment on the litigation it said its evaluations were based on several factors including performance skills and expertise The company said ratings often changed as more information was collected and people were evaluated in larger groups Conoco company also denied that decisions were based on anything other than individual capabilities Companies do need something in making pay decisions downsizing decisions said Jim Kochanski a consultant with Nextera Enterprises The problem is that companies may not take enough care in deciding how people should be ranked They can get it very wrong

draft data protection policy that would put Enron in compliance with EU directives Look for it in the next few days Michelle Kelly Noel NRON PM To Michelle CT cc Sharon NRON Subject RE nextlaw Michelle It occurred to me as I sent the message below to Michael Brown that you may be the lawyer I need to coordinate with Is that true Forwarded by Kelly Noel HiggasonCorpEnron on PM Kelly Noel Higgason PM To Michael R CT cc Sharon NRON Subject RE nextlaw Michael Please see message below in which Christopher Millard of Clifford Chance indicates that a project that CC is working on with Enron Europe may involve subscription to the Nextlaw subscription service Sharon Butcher and I are working on a project for Enron Corp HR that requires research on data protection laws in the various countries in which Enron has employees It is likely that we will subscribe to Clifford Chances Nextlaw service a database of data protection legislation in various countries One of the advantages of Nextlaw is that it is a more costeffective approach than engaging local counsel in each jurisdiction to provide the legal research and subscribers are entitled to quarterly updates of the information on the database during the annual subscription period At the end of my message to Christopher please see the list of countries that we need information about My guess is that any of the jurisdictions you need are covered If so I would propose to Christopher that if as I anticipate Enron Corp subscribes to Nextlaw for the project Sharon and I are working on Enron Europe should be entitled to access and use the information for the other project Christopher references We certainly dont want Enron to pay for the subscription service twice Please tell me which lawyer in your group I should include in discussions Thanks Forwarded by Kelly Noel HiggasonCorpEnron on PM Christopher liffordChancecom on PM To cc Ben liffordChancecom Subject RE nextlaw Kelly Very good to hear from you after all this time Enrons subscription to NextLaw has indeed expired though we are starting to do some data protection work with Enron Europe and were planning to show them NextLaw soon as we believe it would be very useful to them In the meantime I would be pleased to talk with you and Sharon on Monday at Houston time about how we might assist you with your new project We have indeed expanded the coverage of our NextLaw service over the last few months Of the jurisdictions you list below are now covered by NextLaw Dont quote me on this but to my knowledge of the remaining only Columbia has a data protection law which is currently in force and Canada has a new law which is not yet in force I am copying this to my colleague Ben Ebdon in our Clifford Chance Online group in the hope that he will be able to join us on the call on Monday In the meantime I hope you have a good weekend Best regards Christopher Christopher Millard Clifford Chance Limited Liability Partnership Aldersgate Street London ECA JJ England Voice Fax Email Original Message From mailto Sent Friday May PM To Cc Subject nextlaw Christopher You may remember me from our conversations about months ago which resulted in Enron subscribing to Clifford Chances Nextlaw subscription service Enrons annual subscription lasped several months ago but we are in need of similar services again for a different HR project Enron senior management has tasked the HR department with the creation of an internal expert directory with which all Enron employees can identify other Enron employees who have specific skills such as language capabilities experience with particular kinds of projects political contacts etc that may be useful for new intiatives As you can imagine the data that must be collected from all Enron employees worldwide is significantly more complex than the information we were gathering from international employees when we engaged your firm previously We would now like legal advice about what consents must be obtained from employees in various foreign jurisdictions in order to collect and publish the information whether certain information gathered must be requested on a voluntary basis and conversely what information we can require that employees provide etc Please note that all information to be requested will be collected for business purposes our internal legal department has already informed HR and management that certain information about personal interests hobbies and nonprofessional memberships should not be collected or asked for I am hopeful that in the time since we last spoke your firm has added additional jurisdictions to the subscription service since many of the countries in which we have employees were not on the database in early I will list the jurisdictions that are relevant for this project at the end of this message however in certain jurisdictions Enron has only a few employees and we may elect not to include those employees in the expert directory if we determine that the cost of the legal research for that jurisdiction is not justified by the benefit to Enron I am also wondering whether the information included in the database is sufficient for this more complicated project My colleague Sharon Butcher and I would like to discuss our new project with you to see if Clifford Chance is again willing and able to provide the local research that we require and to get an estimate of the cost involved We were hoping to call you at am Houston time on Monday May nd Please let me know if this time is not convenient and we will arrange for another call I can be reached by telephone fax or email kellynoel nron I hope you are well and look forward to our work together Regards Kelly Noel Higgason Argentina Australia Brazil

extraordinary growth thus far in I am especially proud of the accomplishments of Energy Operations in supporting this growth I wanted to express my appreciation for all the hard work and dedication that you have demonstrated We have done great work and I want to recognize you for that Although we have done much we have additional goals to accomplish within ENA and Energy Operations this year Therefore as we go forward I want to make sure that you have all the necessary tools to do the best possible job and that any barriers that may impede your work are removed To help in this effort I have asked a consulting organization SJ Bashen Corporation to survey our organization to take its pulse if you will to help us understand what in our environment fosters success and where we could improve in essence to assist us in acquiring the necessary tools and breaking down any barriers SJBC is comprised of seasoned consultants who assist organizations like ours to help on issues like this SJBC will meet with members of our group in a private setting where we can highlight our successes discuss our concerns ask our questions make our comments and the like This collective information then is studied by SJBC with the goal of providing us an opinion regarding our strengths and weaknesses Specific input will not be identified by the individual who provided that input Many of you will be receiving a phone call in the near future from a SJBC consultant Please schedule a time to participate at your earliest opportunity as this effort will be a success for our group only if we cooperate to the fullest extent Of course given the size of our group it will not be possible to meet with each of you Therefore if you have not received a call from SJBC by August but would like to share your thoughts with them please feel free to contact Cheryl Brown at and Cheryl will be glad to include you in our survey Communication is one of Enrons core values I want to stress that only through open communication will this survey be a success Please be candid Thank you Sally

<5792819.1075853545835.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,michelle.cash@enron.com,2000-11-26 18:00:00,Quarterly Business Reviewplease take the text of this email and turn it into a document that is presentable so that I can give it to Mark at our Quarterly Business Review Meeting at Monday actually I will need it by noon so that I can revise it Thanks Michelle Transactions Major Events of September November Garden State Paper closing and transition Triple Lutz issues surrounding potential divestiture including internal discussions review of data requests and responses review and comment on both PSA documents negotiations with both buyers representatives and discussions with clients Issues include salaries of employees hired by buyer effect of Enron severance plan other benefits for divested employees including unvested stock options insurance vacation etc process for divesture payment of severance obligations possible redeployment etc Crane monitor due diligence PSA review and comment client discussions Falcon review diligence reports client discussions E limited involvement in PSA and schedule review data requests Anticipated Issues for December February Triple Lutz continued negotiations and document drafting Transition issues for divestiture will continue to be significant Litigation by persons who lose their jobs as a result of the transaction and who choose not to sign the waiver for double the severance benefits is possible East Coast Power If we sell our interest in ECP there will be many transition issues due to Enrons providing benefits payroll etc for ECP personnel Also there will be transition issues for other services including legal services that Enron has been providing for ECP CraneFalcon could move forward Crane is more likely Issues of labor unions and Canadian law will require attention on transition issues Litigation Major Events of September November No employeeinitiated litigation for Noncompete litigation Currently suit pending against Alonzo Williams in Sharolyn Woods court Suit filed no TRO sought Service in process Minor litigation Marentz Co v Enron Suit for nonpayment of placement fee Maximum damages K Discovery period ends this week courtordered mediation to follow Anticipated Issues for December February I expect that we will be filing noncompete litigation in February and March as people leave after they are paid their bonuses We should discuss the continued use of Bill Ogden for noncompete litigation Documents Generated Major Events of September November New Consulting Services Agreement I prepared a new form of Consulting Services Agreement to replace old Master Service Agreement and Project Work Description for Net Works contract personnel I received minor comments from outside counsel as well as client group feedback I will finalize the agreement so that the new document can go into effect on Standard Agreements I prepared draft employment agreements draft consulting services agreements separation agreement and releases retention letter agreements The number of employment agreements seems low to me particularly in trading My understanding is that Lavorato does not want to put every person in trading under contract but wants to wait and see how they perform There are potential legal risks with this approach if we want to enforce our noncompete provisions Anticipated Issues for December February I expect that after bonus amounts are announced there will be a flurry of contract activity in efforts to pay people through means other than the bonus pool Investigations Major Events of September November Anonymous Letters Sent to Office of Chairman about Energy Operations I directed the investigation and supervised outside consultants once the company decided to employ them I and the team reviewed the results with Sally Beck in early November and proposed methods to address the results of the consultants surveys Sally Beck is contemplating communication to employees on results of survey Other proposals can be discussed verbally Texaco Hacker We had a situation where one of our employees logged onto the Texaco computer system using an ID of a former coworker He then sent inappropriate emails to her coworkers posing as her The investigation results led to termination of employment for cause Anticipated Issues for December February I expect that there will be some claims that will need to be investigated following PRCbonus discussions Training Major Events of September November Increased role as trainer I provided interview training for all Net Works employees who are involved in the Technology Track about sessions Anticipated Issues for December February EIM Ray Bowen has asked Julia and I to provide training to the Industrials Group The focus will be on labor and employment issues in the acquisition of assets as well as the integration of assets into the Enron family All of Wholesale The harassment prevention training is going to be repeated early next year for all persons hired in the last months Refresher training is being developed and will be delivered for those who already went through the first round PreHire Testing Major Events of September November Many Wholesale groups are looking at preemployment testing as a method of screening out applicants I am working with the Training and Development groups to ensure that the tests meet legal standards I have suggested experts for HR to use in validation of such tests to ensure that the tests will result in a successful employee ReSkilling One aptitude test is being employed in the selection of potential employees who may be reskilled to perform IT jobs working under Beth Perlman Anticipated Issues for December February I expect the testing issue to continue to be hot particularly since John Lavorato likes the concept for use in the Trading Track rotations for the AA program Employee RelationsTerminations Much of my time is spent providing advice on employee relationstermination issues approximately per week total No two situations are alike and they require significant time Anticipated Issues for December February After PRCbonus time this area of practice will be exceptionally busy The company will put persons who received a Needs Improvement or lower rating on a performance improvement plan Generally I review those before they are put in place If they are not successful then terminations are likely probably early in the first half of Those issues are timeconsuming and full of risks Work for Portfolio Assets Major Events of September November Ecogas winddown issues Mariner Change of Control Agreements CGAS harassment prevention training arranged for Littler Mendelson to provide training for CGAS personnel East Coast Power Agreements advice and counselling on various issues Anticipated Issues for December February CGAS Revising employment agreements for key personnel Mariner Employment agreement negotiation Conclusions ENA ENA has not been able to hire commercial talent at the levels of manager and above I expect to see a great emphasis on hiring Lavorato has placed processes in place for hiring at that level including the requirement of an interview with the OOC before someone can be hired at the level of manager or above Salaries need to be reviewed for equity by gender as well as by race Net Works Net Works has hired over employees and contractors in I expect that a portion of those will be bad hires and will have to be managed out Generally the IT personnel are not the best about counselling and documentation so there may be significant work to be done to ensure that risks are managed in that situation I have seen improvement in that group working with HR and they have invited me to conduct training so it may improve over time Contractors are another issue at Net Works A significant portion of the work force is contract personnel Microsoft issues could arise if contractors are allowed to stay on too long Misclassification under the FLSA is another issue Net Works has too many employees in the exempt category who should be classified as nonexempt I have raised this issue with HR and they are working through it It will not be an easy fix EIM The biggest issues facing EIM include the attraction and retention of talent as well as MA activity HR has hired a person from Azurix to handle diligence for EIM but only time will tell whether she will be able to handle the job EGM EGM has the same issues of hiring and retention of talent as other groups within Wholesale That plus the added earnings pressures will make retention of key personnel essential I expect to see continued pressure to shorten the noncompete duration for this group

CS at this time I think the way to couch it is that we do not want to receive them at this time but that they are free to check with us in a couple of months to see whether that has changed That way we arent making it an absolute ban Thanks for the information Michelle Debi Vanwey AM To Michelle CT cc Robert NRON Subject Re Contracting Solutions Thanks for your feedback If we accept resumes from an agency it means establishing a full working relationship with them which is time consuming for the recruiter We have to constantly QA them and answer their phone calls and it is more work than it seems from the outside They almost need to be coached all the time unless they are really good which is rare CS is one of the fairly high maintenance agencies This is why we are going to a preferred vendor list We have lots of agencies that want to work with us and choosing those that we can count on to get us good candidates quickly and take the least amount of our time saves a lot of time for the recruiters After Jennifer told Kathyrn she wasnt going to work with her Kathyrn did flood her inbox with unsolicited resumes That would certainly make me not want to work with them I can force the issue and ask one of the recruiters to work with them if you feel we need to however I feel that until Kathryn cools off a little this would not be productive As for the apology I will always apologize if I am clearly in the wrong however I think that definitely in this case it would be construed as an admission of wrongdoing on Enrons part Im fine with letting go of it This has been a good learning experience for me There have been a couple of phone calls this week where I was consciously more polite with agencysales phone calls than I would have been prior to last week Jennifer had some fear up yesterday about addressing an issue with an agency because of the CS issue which is understandable and were working through it together I want her to be able to stay in her power with these people and we just need to learn new ways to do that Its a tough job dealing with agencies day after day really wears you down Were going to write some scripts for talking with them in the future and the recruiters will route all the new ones through me so they all get the same story Were also putting some new processes in place so that we are consistent in our relationships with agencies Hopefully this will help eliminate some of these issues in the future Thanks for all your help Debi Michelle Cash PM To Debi CT cc Robert NRON Jennifer NRON Subject Re Contracting Solutions Debi Your plan sounds good to me You all have done a good job of researching this data and I believe we are in a strong position My one question is whether it is worth it to tell them we are not accepting resumes from them What is the harm in accepting them Are we obligated to interview the candidate Given this situation it is possible that telling them not to send resumes will fan the flames for no good reason especially since their proven track record is only for one placement It does not appear as if they are flooding us with resumes Let me know if my assumption is not correct Also I am not sure your apology is necessary It certainly is wellintentioned but I wouldnt want it to be construed as some sort of admission of wrongdoing So unless you feel compelled Thanks Michelle Debi Vanwey PM To Michelle CT Robert NRON cc Jennifer NRON Subject Contracting Solutions Our research is complete with John Nguyen and Mark Delaro There is only one John Nguyen that works for Enron and he is at EBS This is not the same John Nguyen that was sent from Contracting Solutions I talked with the Enron John personally and compared past employment to the CS John The John Nguyen that was sent by CS was sent on to Keith Dziadek for an opening he had We got no response from Keith which for him is considered a no We have no record of Mark Delaro ever being sent in by CS He was directly recruited by Ergos presented by them and hired through them Jennifer talked with Mark and he states that he has never talked to a recruiting firm named Contracting Solutions If CS did indeed present his resume to Enron then they should be able to produce the email with datetime stamp Neither Jen nor I have asked them for this yet I feel Robert and I should meet with them tomorrow to bring closure to the situation Robert had mentioned that we should be able to get back with them this week and I think we should make good on the promise Here are my recommendations please give me your thoughts I owe the Account Manager an apology for being rude on the phone Clarify with them that we do not owe them a fee on Mark Delaro or John Nguyen based on above facts Clarify with them that we are not doing business with them at this time The recruiters have just given me their final preferred vendor list and CS is not on it since no one is interested in working with them We should let them know that yes they do have an MSA which is an agreement for contract placement but this does not require us to accept resumes from them We accept resumes only from those agencies that we ask to assist us with recruiting We should offer to take another look at them in days give them a second chance and have the guidelines for the trial period well defined They should contact me directly at that time We should address the relationship between Jennifer and Kathryn the difficulties being that Jennifer made a decision not to work with them Kathryn tried to force her business on Jennifer after the decision had been made and Kathyrn brought her personal problems into the conversation in order to press the point They should be aware of the basis of Jennifers decision not to employ them as a vendor inadequate resume flow poor working relationship with account manager We have no proof that Jennifer has spread bad press about CS to any other company including Continential Shell Services and Dynegy and after addressing this issue with her do not believe that this occurred Nor did she did send Mark Delaros resume to Ergos We have no reason to believe that she has ever acted out of integrity while working for Enron nor that she will in the future Cheryl Charles Maddison presented her resume to Robert and Ryan and Ryan forwarded to me in the past weeks and has not claimed association with CS We have no recruiter openings at this time and she has been informed of this by Ryan and myself Debi

react to and treat the symptoms number of absolute categories without full consideration of the root cause and setting a plan to address it The real change issue as I see it is job description and position classification The real project is to rationalise the job structures within Enron simplify wherever possible Target a cut from categories to say This impacts not only the PRC but how we look at compensation across the levels function performed eg commercial commercial support technical and specialization areas eg legal accounting IT engineering HR etc With respect to current yearend PRC it is hard to change the agreed process midstream It is doable if we can show wherehow certain of the categories are equivalent and should be considered together Only caveat is to ensure we do not render the root cause untreatable by addressing symptoms Tim Gerry How would you like to approach this Two key groups we need to link in are Compensation Mary Joyce Pam Butler and PRC Gina Corteselli

assign value to roles in ENA commercial deal making function this is very easy to do how much they profit they generate grade has very little place in this world In other areas it is harder and grading provides a methodology far from perfect for grouping and providing structure around a set of skills and how they are valued in the organisation To lose them without providing some other method of measuring value eg a more robust PRC process would run the risk of making a sometimes too subjective process even more subjective Give me a small number of loose grades anytime So we should aim for nearer to and head away from the having levels for admins does smack of bureacracy Would be interested to be involved in looking at this Neil free market radical Drew C CT AM To David CT cc Cindy NRON

Unnecessary Hiearchy equals X Bureaucracy Im disappointed that we havent followed up on the conversation we had a few weeks ago relating to the hierarchical levels we apparently preside over here at Enron My view remains we should have a strong ambition to significantly reduce and simplify the current grade structures Far from adding additional levels a fundamental analysis should be made of the need for any more than from top to bottom In this regard I would lay down the following challenge for your comments why would the following structure not work better in promoting a flat entrepreneurial open fast paced organisation while also significantly reducing the bureaucracy Number of PRC levels Commercial SupportTechnical Key MDVP Same Collapse Deal Makers Management Collapse

very closely because it was filed against Microsoft and because of the large potential class of plaintiffs Class action suits are an employers worst nightmare think Texaco and CocaCola Please feel free to share this with your management No Monday October Page A ISSN News Discrimination Suit Filed by Microsoft Salaried Employee Alleges Discrimination Based on Race Sex SEATTLEA suit has been filed against Microsoft Corp alleging the company maintains a systemic and pervasive practice of discriminating against African American and female salaried employees affecting pay rates and promotion opportunities Donaldson v Microsoft Corp WD Wash No CP Such discrimination at the company is the standard operating procedure the lawsuit said The suit filed Oct in federal court in Seattle seeks back pay other job benefits and compensatory and punitive damages for a proposed class of about African American employees and some female employees Mark Murray company spokesman said Microsoft does not tolerate discrimination of any kind We take these kinds of issues very seriously Murray said regarding the lawsuit The company has an active diversity policy and seeks to recruit and promote minorities and women Murray told BNA Oct He said he could not comment on any specific aspects of the lawsuit The class would include all current and former female salaried employees who worked for Microsoft beginning Feb and all current and former African American salaried employees who worked at the company beginning Oct Microsoft employs some workers in the US the complaint said About percent to percent are African American and about percent are women Murray said the company has about employees in the US including in Western Washington In the US percent of Microsoft employees are women and percent minorities he said The lawsuit was filed by Cohen Milstein Hausfeld Toll of Seattle The named plaintiff Monique Donaldson sued on behalf of herself and a class of all similarly situated African American and similarly situated female salaried employees at Microsoft African American and female salaried employees of Microsoft are routinely subjected to a pattern and practice of race and sex discrimination affecting the terms and conditions of their employment at the company the complaint said The violationsof Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of the Civil Rights Act of and Civil Rights Act of are systemic in nature and constitute a pattern and practice of conduct which permeates Microsofts operations the lawsuit maintains Excessive Subjectivity Alleged The complaint said the company allows excessive subjectivity in decisions involving promotions and compensation Microsoft has retaliated against employees in the class who complained either internally or externally about Microsofts treatment of African American and female employees by giving unjustified lowered performance evaluations and constructively terminating them The lawsuit said the company uses an excessively subjective evaluation system that allows managers who are predominantly white males to rate employees based upon their own biases rather than based upon merit Performance evaluations for instance use a fivepoint scal but scores of five the highest number are not awarded Within any organization of the company only a certain number of employees are allowed to receive each score which can range from to the lawsuit said Thus no matter how good or bad the actual performance of employees a certain number of them must still receive the lower scores Any employee with a score is placed on a personal improvement plan or asked to resign the complaint said Stack rankings are used to rank employees in the same job category and organizational unit from best to worst the complaint said Employees can be ranked higher under the stack ranking than others who receive numerically higher performance evaluations the lawsuit said Obtaining higher stack rankings is often governed by an employees personal popularity with other managers because the rankings mix employees working for different managers In addition to allowing discrimination in performance appraisals the company also has a pattern of paying African American and female employees salaries substantially lower than those paid white males doing similar work with the same or lesser skills and with similar or lesser experience the lawsuit said Furthermore excessively subjective decisionmaking criteria are applied in promotions which favor white males with fewer qualifications than African Americans and female employees By Nan

remain on their home country payroll system we are struggling with a convenient method to have them pay US taxes both income and possibly social security as well as receive US Currently David Oxley is on such an arrangement He is paid by the UK a portion of his pay to maintain UK benefits The remainder of his salary is paid on US payroll This allows him to pay in FIT withholding No FICAMedicare is necessary due to the totalization agreement with the UK Unfortunately this created some extra work on the domestic benefits group as they had to code the HR system not to provide him with Flex dollars healthwelfare and retirement benefits We indicated in his employment agreement that he was not eligible for these benefits I am looking for an easier and more efficient way to do this Would it be

place between ENA and Enron Expat Services In general the contract is between ENA and the employee if the person is an expat The assignment letter covers the employees transfer to Expat Services We havent usually amendedassigned the agreement over to Expat Services because the payrollbenefits etc are through ENA If there are changes to his ENA agreement it is very easy for me to do them and I am happy to handle it If Mr Slovenski is a VP level or above employee I simply cannot remember right now then Executive Compensation needs to be involved I hope this answers your questions I have copied Sharon Butcher on this email because she has been involved with assignmentsexpats for several years If you have further questions please reply to both of us so that we can be aware of questions Thanks

privileges Matthias Lee AM To Michelle CT cc Lilian CT Angeline CT Michelle CT Kimberly CT John L CT John CT Subject Re URGENT Employment Contract Rich Slovenski Michelle Subject to any views Michelle Cash has I would be happy to assist by drafting the agreed amendments to the Richs Contract I understand from Lilian that changes would only be to the Annex and would not affect the main body of the Contract I can work with Lilian on this once she is able to finalise the agreed amendments with John Nowlan I note your advice that ENA is the correct employing entity and the intended arrangement is a secondment from Enron Expat Services to ENA However your suggestion for a clause in the Contract to reference the secondment would not be sufficient to put the arrangement in place Rather there should be an agreement between Enron Expat Services and ENA I believe such an agreement is likely to be in place as Rich is not the first expat here in Singapore from ENA John Chismar and John Thomas who are here precede him Because I do not have the background to the relevant intercompany arrangement between ENA and Enron Expat Services I would suggest you discuss with Michelle Cash on to clarify this issue and perhaps make the necessary amendments to the letter of offer which presently provides that Enron Expat Services is the employer and that Rich will be expected to provide services for ENA instead of secondment from ENA to Enron Expat Services Regards Matt Michelle Hargrave PM To Lilian CT cc Matthias CT Kimberly CT John L CT John CT Tim Poullain CT Angeline CT Michelle CT Alan CT Subject Re URGENT Employment Contract Rich Slovensky Lillian We were discussing this with our International HR Rep and we feel that since the offer letter indicates Enron Expat Services as the employe the employment agreement should reflect employment by ENA and we need to add a clause secunding Mr Slovinski to Enron Expat Service PLEASE have Matthias make the amendments so we can get this in place as soon as possible I am sure that as long as Legal in Singapore makes the necessary changes it will be fine The important thing is to get Rich to sign the contract You did receive the employment agreements we fedexd you on June th didnt you Make the necessary changes and send a copy to us This was our first Expat and it has been a real learning experience Regards Michelle Lilian Low PM To Michelle CT cc Matthias CT Kimberly CT John L CT John CT Tim Poullain CT Angeline CT Michelle CT Alan CT Subject Re URGENT Employment Contract Rich Slovensky Michelle Per my email to you and Kim copied John Nowlan and John Chismar dated June there were some amendments to his package which was only approved that day I do not have the soft copy of the executables to make the changes nor am I sure if I m allowed to make amendments to them without legal reviewing them Since Legal Singapore is aware of the situation and if it is agreeable we can make amendments to the existing hard copies and have Matthias review them This should expedite this However we still need to know who would be the employers of Rich ENA or Expat services Lilian Michelle Hargrave To Matthias CT cc Kimberly CT

L CT John CT Lilian CT Tim Poullain CT Angeline CT Michelle CT Alan CT Subject URGENT Employment Contract Rich Slovensky Michelle Kimberly Please allow me to introduce myself I am Legal Counsel for ECT Singapore It has just been brought to my attention by our HR Specialist Lilian Low that the employment contract for our new trader Rich Slovensky has not been executed You would appreciate that that gives us a slew of control compliance and legal issues Apart from confidentiality issues Rich does not presently have authority to bind ECT Singapore in contracts Please let me have your very urgent advice whether we can expect Richs employment contract to be in place immediately to regularise the situation or whether we have to implement measures to stop Richs trading activity Additionally I noticed that the cover letter offering employment to Rich refers to employment with Enron Expat Services but the employment contract states that ENA is the employer Please clarify or rectify as appropriate Regards Matt Lee

pretend to be Jeff Skilling as I discussed with you Brian this morning So we probably should start with that group to see if there are any gaps in the email system I would suggest that someone from

to determine who misused that email address This is not to say that an employee should be disciplined for raising complaints obviously that would be retaliatory in nature And so if this person had simply left an anonymous voice message or oldfashioned letter with OTC I would have no issue But here this person has sent a communication ostensibly from ECTs OTC and apparently has access to do so

Sherri NRON cc Subject Performance Review Process Forwarded by Office ChairmanCorpEnron on AM Office of the CT AM To Office NRON cc Subject Performance Review Process After having lived through another PRC process it has become exceedingly obvious that there are several issues that need improvement in the process With all our discussions about Communication within Enron I am now communicating to your level issues that I have communicated in years past to other parties without change Enron needs to lay out the groundrules in total that will pertain to the upcoming review period and communicate them in advance of the review period not during the PRC process to be applied after the performance has already occurred and upon which each employee cannot change their behavior for such review period This is only fair to our employees so that they know the criteria upon which they will be evaluated in advance The PRC system needs to be changed whereby any and all people that are willing to provide input on performance of any individual can be done without a bunch of red tape There is this idea that unsolicited input works within the system but it requires too much effort to get throught the hurdles and it still requires that the supervisor approve such input There needs to be an unobstructed communication line for this input The theory of upward feedback should also be questioned I have never been asked to provide input to my direct boss President of Houston Pipe Line in all the years that I have worked for that position Are Managing Directors exempt from this process This issue is also addressed in below in a different manner How can appropriate feedback be given if those that work directly with individuals are not given the opportunity to communicate There is still way too much preferrential selection of reviewers in the process There should be set out for each employee a listing of absolute minimum reviewers certain people that must be solicited depending upon the job function I have seen too many circumstances where the obvious people to provide input were not even solicited There was one individual that partially worked directly for another during this past review period and was not even asked for input What constitutes an average employee and what that category is within our PRC definitions is still being debated It has been described by several HR representatives that it is eitherand both Strong or Satisfactory Neither one of the definitions describes such performance as simply doing the job Because of such confusion the reviewers when they provide input do not effectively and precisely rate the employee What we end up with in the PRC is an overinflated representation of each employee and the committee has to pull the entire group back a notch With better definitions and communication to our employees on how to interpret the definitions it will give us a better process and set the standards in writing that seem to be lacking Thanks for your listening ear

Michelle Forwarded by Michelle CashHOUECT on AM Michelle Cash AM To Brian NRON cc David CT Gina nron Kathryn CT Cindy NRON Subject Re Performance Review Process I agree with Brian I recently learned that someone can hack into the emeet site and pretend to be Jeff Skilling as I discussed with you Brian this morning So we probably should start with that group to see if there are any gaps in the email system I would suggest that someone from Net Works Roberto DeLeon or his crew would be the appropriate technical support for this endeavor I agree with Brian that the focus should be on the impersonation of the office of the chairman and not the content of the email itself I am happy to assist in any way you would like Michelle Brian NRON AM To David CT cc Gina nron Michelle CT Kathryn CT Cindy NRON Subject Re Performance Review Process David I am less concerned about the substantive comments of the message as I am about the forgery of the ECT OTC mailbox Unless Michelle or another opines differently I believe it is incumbent upon us to determine who misused that email address This is not to say that an employee should be disciplined for raising complaints obviously that would be retaliatory in nature And so if this person had simply left an anonymous voice message or oldfashioned letter with OTC I would have no issue But here this person has sent a communication ostensibly from ECTs OTC and apparently has access to do so in the future In my mind that activity must be addressed and ceased I suspect that it is technologically feasible to determine the source of the message Unless there is objection I would recommend an investigation which my group can do to determine the author Brian David CT AM To Gina nron Michelle CT Kathryn CT Brian NRON cc Cindy NRON

Performance Review Process After having lived through another PRC process it has become exceedingly obvious that there are several issues that need improvement in the process With all our discussions about Communication within Enron I am now communicating to your level issues that I have communicated in years past to other parties without change Enron needs to lay out the groundrules in total that will pertain to the upcoming review period and communicate them in advance of the review period not during the PRC process to be applied after the performance has already occurred and upon which each employee cannot change their behavior for such review period This is only fair to our employees so that they know the criteria upon which they will be evaluated in advance The PRC system needs to be changed whereby any and all people that are willing to provide input on performance of any individual can be done without a bunch of red tape There is this idea that unsolicited input works within the system but it requires too much effort to get throught the hurdles and it still requires that the supervisor approve such input There needs to be an unobstructed communication line for this input The theory of upward feedback should also be questioned I have never been asked to provide input to my direct boss President of Houston Pipe Line in all the years that I have worked for that position Are Managing Directors exempt from this process This issue is also addressed in below in a different manner How can appropriate feedback be given if those that work directly with individuals are not given the opportunity to communicate There is still way too much preferrential selection of reviewers in the process There should be set out for each employee a listing of absolute minimum reviewers certain people that must be solicited depending upon the job function I have seen too many circumstances where the obvious people to provide input were not even solicited There was one individual that partially worked directly for another during this past review period and was not even asked for input What constitutes an average employee and what that category is within our PRC definitions is still being debated It has been described by several HR representatives that it is eitherand both Strong or Satisfactory Neither one of the definitions describes such performance as simply doing the job Because of such confusion the reviewers when they provide input do not effectively and precisely rate the employee What we end up with in the PRC is an overinflated representation of each employee and the committee has to pull the entire group back a notch With better definitions and communication to our employees on how to interpret the definitions it will give us a better process and set the standards in writing that seem to be lacking Thanks for your listening ear

like a sabbatical Besides below documentation Ive made the case verbally that we can point to the following to show that someone o n leave is still an employee k account distribution is not triggered can continue in Enron medical benefits Cash balance vesting continues ie service is bridged employee cant compete or work for someone else will sign waiver to that a ffect Accountants will not answer my question unless I obtain legal opinion that employment status is maintained Can you give legal opinion If not Da vid shall we incur expense of seeking outside opinion of counsel to get th is question answered Original Message From Butler Pam SentThursday July PM ToTyler Tracy CcFarmer Stanley SubjectRE Question on stock grants legal clarification requested Tracy currently someone is placed on inactive status when they go on unpai d leave of absence they cease participation in all plans but can continue to have medical coverage if they choose to make the necessary contribu tions since they are on no pay status no FICA or SUTAFUTA is paid in fo r headcount purposes they cease to be included in total headcount reporting So it is hard to say whether it qualifies under the below provisions For the sake of this opinion however if we wanted to pursue sabbaticals f or a select few and could code them as active sabbatical and thus show them up for headcount purposes then what would the answer be Original Message From Tyler Tracy SentMonday July PM ToButler Pam CcFarmer Stanley SubjectRE Question on stock grants legal clarification requested Pam Just to make sure we are clear on our end what you are saying is that the grantee would be considered an Enron employee under common law under the st andards set forth in Question b in FIN as follows A grantee is an employee if the grantor exercises or has the right to exer cise sufficient control over that individual to establish an employeremplo yee relationship That relationship shall be determined based on common law as illustrated in case law and currently under US Internal Revenue Servi ce Revenue Ruling Accordingly for purposes of applying Opinion a grantee meets the definition of an employee if the grantor consistently r epresents that individual to be an employee under common law The definitio n of an employee for payroll tax purposes under the US Internal Revenue C ode includes common law employees Accordingly a grantor that classifies a grantee potentially subject to US payroll taxes as an employee under Opi nion must also except as provided in paragraph represent that indivi dual as an employee for payroll tax purposes A grantee does not meet the d efinition of an employee under Opinion solely because the grantor repres ents that individual as an employee for some but not all purposes For ex ample a requirement or decision to classify a grantee as an employee for U S payroll tax purposes does not by itself indicate that the grantee is an employee for purposes of Opinion because the grantee must also be an employee of the grantor under common law We will base part of our conclusion on the answer we are provided Thanks f or the clarification in advance Tracy A Tyler

requested Tracy someone on leave of absence without pay is changed to inactive statu s but is not terminated During this inactive phase no payments generally would be made to the employee If any payment were made to the employee heshe would be charged US FICAMedicare etc For example an employee on inactive status could exercise vested options while on leave this income would be reported as employee compensation and to the extent FICA limits ha d not been reached would be FICAMedicare taxed at time of payout Since they are not earning a salary per se during the leave no FUTASUTA taxes

absence We need further legal clarification rega rding one point before we can properly assess the situation you described i n your previous email When you state It is also assumed that employees on unpaid leaves maintai n their active employment status we need to know the manner in which yo u are defining an active employee For purposes of evaluation under FIN the definition of an employee is a person under common law as illustrated under US Internal Revenue Ruling potentially subject to US payroll t axes as an employee of the grantor of the options During the leave of abs ence does the grantee continue to meet the definition of an employee under this statute We need a legal opinion as to employee qualification under the Revenue Ruli ng above before we can further investigate proper

replies I received from within the firm so far One Fortune client told a Littler attorney that he had participated in a company conference call about the issue earlier this week The sense he got from the call was that almost every company was planning to pay employees the difference between their normal wages and military base pay exclusive of allowances for a certain period which varied among the companies Many were going to pay for days some for days and a few for a year One of the companies that was opting for days had previously provided a pay differential for weeks Another attorney was advised by a major energy industry client that it was paying the difference between the military pay and the employees salary for one year One attorney has spoken to several firm clients over the past few days about this and almost all of them are going to exceed the legal requirements by offering some form of continued compensation but no specifics as to duration Another Littler lawyer was told by a large industrial client that it would pay the difference between military pay and normal salary and continue benefit coverage with no indication about maximum duration Thomas J Dowdalls Littler

August PM To Richter Brad Cash Michelle Subject FW Compliance with Enron Code of Ethics Dealbench Importance High Dear Brad and Michelle I have reviewed the letter from Tobias Munk Has Enron determined that it will no longer be involved with DealBenchcom and given permission to allow Mr Munk to independently raise funds for a proposed management buyout or sale to an independent third party or Has Enron determined that it will not go forward with DealBenchcom at this time but it is possible in the future that it will still be involved with DealBenchcom I note that Mr Munk states that Enron is actively seeking a buyer for the platform What discussions have taken place with respect to a transaction for the purchase of DealBenchcom Regardless of Mr Munks intentions as stated in his letter of August Enron must make a determination to allow Mr Munk to use Enrons idea etc for DealBenchcom as it is proprietary and belongs to Enron and not Mr Munk If Enron has made the decision to sell DealBenchcom and Mr Munk now no longer an Enron employee is able to put together a group to purchase this Internet platform I dont believe that this would constitute a violation of the Conflict of Interests Policy as described in Enrons Code of Ethics It appears that Mr Munk is requesting permission from Enron to move forward with respect to DealBenchcom as described in his letter Please confirm Enrons intentions with respect to DealBench In addition please advise of any communicationsdiscussions with Mr Munk regarding DealBenchcom and his ability to be a part of DealBenchcom

mailtoIMCEANOTESNotestineCKerryCKNotestinelittlerEcomE NRONcom Sent Friday August AM To Cash Michelle Cc Zimmermann Ashley Subject FW Child Pornography issue Michelle I wanted to follow up with some additional information regarding the child porn issue The consensus seems to be that the company does not need to report the child porn if it does not want to The only exception to this is individuals engaged in an electronic communication service or a remote computing service to the public are obligated under USC to report child porn to the Cyber Tip Line at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children I looked at the definitions of electronic communication service and remote computing service and the second does not seem to apply although the former could apply The statute appears to qualify both as providing those services to the public so I would not think an email system for employees would apply The definition of electronic communication service is pretty broad though If you want me to investigate this further let me know but I would think we have a good argument that we do not provide these services to the public The child porn statute USC A covers pornography involving girls under the age of so much porn could be child porn There are enhanced penalties for certain types of child porn and for child porn involving children under the age of There is an affirmative defense under the statute if the possessor of child porn destroys it or reports it to a law enforcement agency Therefore it seems the best course of action is to destroy anything the company has and there does not appear to be a reporting obligation Ashley anonymously called the FBI and the DA and their responses are indicated below The information obtained from the FBI and DAs office is consistent with my recommendations Kerry E Notestine Littler Mendelson PC Chevron Tower McKinney Street Houston Texas fax wwwlittlercom Original Message From Zimmermann Ashley Sent Thursday August PM To Notestine Kerry Subject Child Pornography issue Kerry I did a little bit of further research on this issue First as Brian King stated simply downloading or making a copy of child pornography for any reasoneven to provide it as evidence to law enforcement is a crime in the US so the client should not attempt to copy it The client should attempt to obtain the URL Web address and report that information to law enforcement if the client decides to report it Second the statute making it illegal to knowingly receive or distribute child pornography through interstate or foreign commerce through any means including by computer or receive or distribute child pornography that has been received or distributed by someone else through interstate or foreign commerce in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States is USC Section A It is not clear whether our client has a duty to report the finding of child pornography on its computer system USC Section states that whoever while engaged in providing an electronic communication service or a remote computing service to the public through a facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce obtains knowledge of facts or circumstances from which a violation of sections A involving child pornography is apparent shall as soon as reasonably possible make a report of such facts or circumstances to the Cyber Tip Line at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Chidlren The number for the Cyber Tip Line is Depending upon how you read the above paragraph our client might have a duty to report its finding child pornography on its computer system to the Cyber Tip Line despite the fact that it has been unable to determine who put it on there For practical advice I contacted the FBI and a Harris County DA The FBI duty agent I talked to said that if the company does not know who put the pornography on there they do not have a duty to report it However he suggested that they contact the Field Office in San Juan Puerto Rico because the office might have certain equipment specialists etc that could assist the client in determining who put the child pornography on the system and further investigating the issue The phone number for the FBI in San Juan is and if the client calls heshe should just ask to speak to a duty agent and explain what they found and how they found it Note there is also a special FBI Office that handles crimes against children that offices number is Additionally the Harris County DA I talked to was not concerned that it would be some type of spoliation of evidence to destroy the pornography and agreed that it is a crime simply to knowingly receive it but recommended that the client contact the FBI in Puerto Rico so that they could decide whether they wanted to pursue it before the client destroyed it Let me know if you wish me to look into this further Ashley This email may contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of the

Cindy Oxley David SubjectMy Redeployment Experience THIS MESSAGE IS PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL Mr Lay After attending the All Employee Meeting at The Hyatt on Thursday Aug ust th during the QA period someone sent the comment stating Redeploy ment is a Joke You commented and stated that if anyone had any questions or concerns regarding this matter to shoot a email to you and you would respond After that statement regarding redeployment I felt compelled to do just what you said send a message about my redeployment experienc e I am doing this for two reasons to prevent what has happened to me from the HR representatives side of redeployment from happening to any other Enron employee whether redeployment or any other experience with Enr ons HR reps and to let you know the redeployment process at Enron is effective and efficient and two of the MAIN values of Enron must be exal ted higher Those values are Communication and Respect I received redeployment from Enron Broadband Services Investment grou p on Monday June th Sheila Walton a HR rep spoke to me regardi ng what the process would entail During this meeting Sheila mentioned t he redeployment process to me but discussed and stressed to me more my o ptions when I departed the company rather than my options to locate anoth er position with the company not at all promoting the advantage of redep loyment and its many success stories With no directions from Sheila Walt on I took it upon myself to contact Joyce Barrett in the redeployment grou p for advice and guidance I met Joyce through a infoluncheon hosted for EBS assistants and the DoubleTree to give information about redeployment and how the process works and its successes Because of a lack of Commu nication to the redeployment department after a week I did not have any information about me going into redeployment so at the end of the week I had no location for a redeployment desk and I was leaving my department a t the end of the week of June Due to this lack of communication I had to take off Monday Tuesday June th th to have my desk churned and locate a space for me for days Joyce Barrett contacted me with a location and more information reg arding my redeployment process Located in Allen Center I setup my se arch for a new job at Enron and my goal was to do my best to find a job within Enron because that was a opportunity that I felt I owed myself and Enron as a whole by becoming Enron proud and believing in the visions a nd values I met with Marie Jensen of Spearion to review my resume and sh arpen my interview tactics Joyce Barrett Michele Hargrave and Brinella Knight were in contact with me to find out how my job search was going and lending support in any way I had many interviews with companies outsid e and within Enron An experience to meet new and interesting people and a opportunity that I feel I would have not been able to have without redep loyment so I have no regrets about being redeployment I must tell you that I was afraid because a lot about this process I was unsure of and m y HR rep did nothing to assure me or inform me that this transition is on e that can be rewarding as well as a strong challenge With Enrons values system Respect Integrity Communication and Exce llence in place and strongly promoted by you and Jeff Skilling before hi s departure I want to stress to you that my experience with the HR side of redeployment has NOT carried out the value system that Enron promotes and Im sure whoever sent the comment about redeployment in that meeting had every meaning of HR person representing Enron in such a way that a jo ke is a kind way of putting it No one should be treated this way On J uly I took a temporary position in the Associate Analyst Prog ram headed by Billy Lemmons and Traci Warner working with Jeff Davis John Walt and Cathy Lira as well as supporting the group as a whole I worked in this department until August I received a message from Shi rley Cox Sheila Waltons assistant inquiring whether or not I had a posi tion within Enron I called Shirley back and gave her information about t he temporary assignment I had taken in the Associate Analysts Program O n August th a call was made by Sheila Walton to a Sr Admin in the Ass ociate Analyst Program inquiring whether I was working this department The admin passed the information to Jeff Davis and he contacted Sheila W alton as to where I was working and how long I had been working in the dep artment With a remorseful sounding voice Sheila proceeded to inquiry to Jeff more details to which Jeff provided her I had overtime hours that I tried to put into the system but I was unable to get into the time sys tem After the conversation with Jeff Davis and Sheila Walton I find o ut Sheila had started the process to delete me from the system before my original end date of August th I accepted a permanent position with Enron Networks as a Admin Assistant II on August reporting to Sam Leuschen I started that position on August On August after days of employment was terminated from the position and Enron du e to Business Reorganization in Enron Networks I am very concerned about the way this matter was handled and the seri es of events that surrounded this action As a result I would like to d iscuss with you and or someone in the responsible capacity and go into fur ther detail I have received a form letter stating that Enron can termina te my employment at will at any time and for any reason I feel this act ion has been provoked for other reasons In ending this message to you Mr Lay you must know that redeployme nt at Enron is a effective tool that should remain in place You should a lso know and commend those persons who work in and closely with the redepl oyment group Enough good things cannot not be said about those people wh o go out of their way to get you the help the encouragement the tools yo u need while facing this process I realize that a business decision was made and EBS downfall was a business decision but this matter is not a business one When redeployment takes place the human side of you feel s omewhat lost hurt and you take it personallyalthough I realize it was a business decision This occurrence was targeted and directed at me person ally by Sheila Walton Human resources should work with the human being to make you a better person through visions and values not to be treated in humanely Whether they are Enrons values or values in general HR repres entatives should portray what human beings should have most of allVALUE S and when there is no communication no respect no integrity the jok e begins and excellence is lost I look forward to hearing from you or someone in your office soon I can be contacted at the numbers listed below at

What is the latest on this Lets discuss at some point m Original Message From ENRON Sent Wed PM To Cc Whalley Greg Frevert Mark Kean Steven J Mcconnell Mike Olson Cindy Subject my unfair treatment at Enronplease HELP Ms MingchengLian ManagerEGMFundamentals Dear Mr Lay My employment with Enron is to be terminated the reason given by HR for not meeting performance standards However I firmly believe that this is not the real reason the real one being for defying the wishes of my manager Mr Lowell BezanisManager EGM who I believe was acting in a discriminatory way towards me I have since filed a written complaint to Enrons EEO Committee This committee having investigated the case has acknowledged that there were working environment issues but has refused to provide me with a written report of their findings As a consequence my reasonable request for a redeployment package has been rejected If my employment is to be prematurely terminated I not only lose my job but also my residence status in the US where I have lived in the past years The HR department is fully aware of my situation and I feel that they were taking advantage of this fact when they asked me to sign a waiver not to sue Enron in exchange for protecting my status for days I now feel that I am being pushed into a corner unnecessarily since all I have set out to achieve is to bring an awareness of the working conditions and the discrimination which is rife not only towards myself but also to other employees some of whom have left as a result in the department and to move forward with practicable solutions I have enjoyed a number of years as an employee of Enron where I have performed to the best of my ability often receiving compliments from clients This cannot be the only way to solve this issue The Trigger and Retaliation Since Mr Bezanis has been my line manager internal training opportunities have repeatedly been denied to me On August I attended a class of natural gas structuring Mr Bezanis called the Learning Center refusing to pay the associated costs however I was welcomed to remain in the class at no charge I felt that this situation could not continue and so I made an appointment with Ms Shanna Funkhouser my HR representative The day previous to the aforementioned meeting I was summoned to appear before MsFunkhouser Mr Bezanis and Mr Jeff Andrews were present in the conference room as I entered Feeling intimidated I requested that I meet with Ms Funkhouser privately the next day in order to submit a formal complaint regarding the EEO as agreed previously She refused and continued with what I can only describe as adisciplinary by accusing me of excessive use of Enron property and equipment I was suspended and sent home with pay with possible termination Ms Funkhouser explained that her actions were based on the following the assumption that I was making long distance personal calls from work that I was making jobapplications by company email Unequal Employment Opportunities and Unfair Treatment As a manager Mr Bezanis has Intentionally and consistently limited my employment opportunities in terms of training and performance appraisals He has repeatedly disapproved of my training courses without good cause since he refuses to explain his disapproval Shown unfavorable bias towards my job performance PRC process which according to the PRC rules should be judged also by my peers and clients by review Until now Iam still have not been informed of my PRC results Made efforts to suppress my innovative ideas such as that of creating an energy index as a potential useful trading instrument My idea was warmly welcomed by the team in the Department Offsite but the reaction of Mr Bezanis was of anger for not going through him first I was banned by him from developing the idea further Discrimination It is our belief that Mr Bezanis has difficulty dealing with women employees especially competent women as equals His rough stifling and unfair management style has led to the resignation of Ms Courtney Campbell the other only woman reporting to him Hostile Working Environment The working environment under Mr Bezanis has been an intimidating and abusive one Derogatory language offensive to women is frequent and common Very little respect is paid to our integrity and intelligence We are managed by threats rather than constructive comments Wrongful Termination Knowing I was unfairly treated Enron HR has not helped address my concerns I was told that my employment is to be terminated due to my lowest ranking in the midyear PRC process Ms Cindy Olson admitted that the PRC practices might be unfair but she said she had no power to reopen the past PRC cases I feel I have been subjected to a victimization campaign while the whole Enron organization attempts to protect the managers no matter how wrong they are I request your attention and help during my most difficult time I thank you for your understanding and commitment to a happy and positive resolution in this case Yours sincerely Mingcheng Lian

SubjectSPECIAL EDITION The EmploymentSource Newsletter IMAGE The EmploymentSource Newsletter SPECIAL EDITION Our Mission is To Help Employers Enhance Employee Relations While Minimizi ng Employment Claims Please forward this newsletter to your friends and coworkers To subscri ber or unsubscribe see bottom of newsletter We at EPS share our grief and prayers with our fellow Americans in the wak e of the terrorist attacks We offer our condolences to those of you who have lost loved ones friends or colleagues This tragedy has touched eac h of our lives While focusing on businessasusual is difficult right now we are moving quickly to adapt to the needs of our clients We are addin g special segments to our HR classes to address organizational response an d workers reactions to the crisis and we will continue to work to meet y our special needs We are committed to providing a compassionate resource should you need one What NOW Kathleen K Edmond Esq MBA LICSW Employment Practices Solutions Senior Consultant MinneapolisSt Paulke Soon very soon we will all need to get ourselves and our companies back to business whether we are ready or not How can we do this in a way t hat is respectful and helpful but at the same time doesnt create issues t hat do not exist First understand that we are all affected Not just those of us who had family friends coworkers or neighbors in New York Washington or who were passengers on the airlines Our world has permanently changed Th is is not a dramatic overstatement It is simply the truth We cannot und o what happened yesterday but we can influence how we deal with the change and how we can be stronger as a result of the horrible attack on our coun try our safety and our sense of security yesterday Let me simply make a list I apologize if this is not Pulitzer Prize mat erial Timeliness is the most important factor at the moment Speak to the organization Pull management together first to discuss the ir responsibilities as managers and give them guidance Acknowledge their dual roles as managers in the organization and individuals with personal feelings While it will take time to absorb the full impact of what has happened it will be necessary to get back to the business at hand Depending on the size and configuration of the organization talk to every one as a group Either get them together in person a group email voice mail teleconference whatever means are available to you At this point it is most important to let people know that we are all stunned but that we are pulling together It is not important to have all the answers rig ht now Communication will continue Acknowledge that our world is now different The sense of safety and sec urity we had before September th is gone We must each individually and organizationally replace that with something different Acknowledge that individuals will respond and recover at different paces Some will want to get back to work as quickly as possible to regain their sense of normalcy and control Others will have difficulty focusing for a long time Most likely it will be sporadic and not a constant inability to focus This is a very normal response to a crisis Depending on your organization and the level of direct impact you may cho ose to bring a professional counselor or team of counselors on site for a day or longer They can conduct group processes and individual counseling Another possibility is a chat room where employees can share their experie nces feelings and have a place to vent The question will arise how l ong should the chat room be operational For right now dont set a time l imit but review it in a couple of weeks or a month If participation is decreasing which I except that it will in a month determine a date to c lose it down and make an organizational announcement to that effect When closing it down dont go dark without notice Just let people know tha t it is time to end that part of the recovery process Allow people to talk periodically during the day The need for the amoun t of discussion will change over the next weeks In the next day or so pro bably little work will get done But by the end of the week and certainl y next week business will resume Consider allowing employees additional personal time off for memorial serv ices blood donations or other communityfocused recovery events Remind people to use your Employee Assistance Program company counselors health benefits religious leaders and other local counseling resources as available Have someone in the organization pull together a resource l ist of local and organizational telephone numbers for employees and their families Talk about the impact on your specific business and what effect if any it has on your company Maybe it affects your communications transportation distribution or some other aspect of your operations If members of your corporate family have been killed in these attacks con sider a memorial service later this week or next for all employees to atte nd whether they personally knew the individuals or not Assure them that business will go on subdued perhaps different in some w ays but there will be continuity Recognize that people will be angry sad scared and confused for some per iod of time The risk of discriminatory judgments and remarks is increase d If you hear such remarks challenge gently if necessary but help peo ple understand that it is a normal reaction to the attacks on our safety Remind them to take care of themselves and their families and friends It is important to keep talking to each other and their children even those very young children Here is a good article they can use wwwwomencent ralmsncomparentingarticlestragedyasp We do not know what will be happening in the next weeks or months There may be additional armed conflict We have entered a time of uncertainty that will continue to affect the national psyche and our individual lives As organizations we are well advised to be prepared to address the effec t it will have on our employees You will need to address the corporate travel policy What will you do if an employee is afraid to travel to New York for a business trip Consider making other meeting arrangements at least for the near term Longer term you will have questions about what to do with employees who ca nnot seem to focus after a reasonable length of time And you will have qu estions about what is a reasonable length of time and proper disciplinary actions if needed We will address those questions as they arise but for now they are beyond the scope of this communication Please feel free to email or call us if you have specific questions Yesterday I was conducting a Best Practices seminar in Minneapolis as the terrorist attacks were unfolding on the East Coast As we did not know the magnitude of what was about to happen we decided to continue with the work in front of us but to be cognizant of the events that were occurring The day and the response of the participants were instructive to what to expect at work Participants were engaged but at some level distracted We took a break every hour or so for an update on events We talked ab out our personal feelings We changed our agenda to spend the last half h our of the day planning about how we would lead our organizations through this tragedy We discussed the role of Human Resources and the Legal depa rtments We wondered at the inconsistency of the beautiful day the sunsh ine and the green grass in the suburbs of Minneapolis and the horror we we re hearing on the news We encouraged people who had two hours of drive t ime to leave a half hour early to be home with their families We all took calls and made calls during the day to check on family and friends In other words we took care of ourselves and we took care of others We also worked and planned for the future I urge you to do the same About the author Kathleen Knutson Edmond is a Senior consultant

draft data protection policy that would put Enron in compliance with EU directives Look for it in the next few days Michelle Kelly Noel NRON PM To Michelle CT cc Sharon NRON Subject RE nextlaw Michelle It occurred to me as I sent the message below to Michael Brown that you may be the lawyer I need to coordinate with Is that true Forwarded by Kelly Noel HiggasonCorpEnron on PM Kelly Noel Higgason PM To Michael R CT cc Sharon NRON Subject RE nextlaw Michael Please see message below in which Christopher Millard of Clifford Chance indicates that a project that CC is working on with Enron Europe may involve subscription to the Nextlaw subscription service Sharon Butcher and I are working on a project for Enron Corp HR that requires research on data protection laws in the various countries in which Enron has employees It is likely that we will subscribe to Clifford Chances Nextlaw service a database of data protection legislation in various countries One of the advantages of Nextlaw is that it is a more costeffective approach than engaging local counsel in each jurisdiction to provide the legal research and subscribers are entitled to quarterly updates of the information on the database during the annual subscription period At the end of my message to Christopher please see the list of countries that we need information about My guess is that any of the jurisdictions you need are covered If so I would propose to Christopher that if as I anticipate Enron Corp subscribes to Nextlaw for the project Sharon and I are working on Enron Europe should be entitled to access and use the information for the other project Christopher references We certainly dont want Enron to pay for the subscription service twice Please tell me which lawyer in your group I should include in discussions Thanks Forwarded by Kelly Noel HiggasonCorpEnron on PM Christopher liffordChancecom on PM To cc Ben liffordChancecom Subject RE nextlaw Kelly Very good to hear from you after all this time Enrons subscription to NextLaw has indeed expired though we are starting to do some data protection work with Enron Europe and were planning to show them NextLaw soon as we believe it would be very useful to them In the meantime I would be pleased to talk with you and Sharon on Monday at Houston time about how we might assist you with your new project We have indeed expanded the coverage of our NextLaw service over the last few months Of the jurisdictions you list below are now covered by NextLaw Dont quote me on this but to my knowledge of the remaining only Columbia has a data protection law which is currently in force and Canada has a new law which is not yet in force I am copying this to my colleague Ben Ebdon in our Clifford Chance Online group in the hope that he will be able to join us on the call on Monday In the meantime I hope you have a good weekend Best regards Christopher Christopher Millard Clifford Chance Limited Liability Partnership Aldersgate Street London ECA JJ England Voice Fax Email Original Message From mailto Sent Friday May PM To Cc Subject nextlaw Christopher You may remember me from our conversations about months ago which resulted in Enron subscribing to Clifford Chances Nextlaw subscription service Enrons annual subscription lasped several months ago but we are in need of similar services again for a different HR project Enron senior management has tasked the HR department with the creation of an internal expert directory with which all Enron employees can identify other Enron employees who have specific skills such as language capabilities experience with particular kinds of projects political contacts etc that may be useful for new intiatives As you can imagine the data that must be collected from all Enron employees worldwide is significantly more complex than the information we were gathering from international employees when we engaged your firm previously We would now like legal advice about what consents must be obtained from employees in various foreign jurisdictions in order to collect and publish the information whether certain information gathered must be requested on a voluntary basis and conversely what information we can require that employees provide etc Please note that all information to be requested will be collected for business purposes our internal legal department has already informed HR and management that certain information about personal interests hobbies and nonprofessional memberships should not be collected or asked for I am hopeful that in the time since we last spoke your firm has added additional jurisdictions to the subscription service since many of the countries in which we have employees were not on the database in early I will list the jurisdictions that are relevant for this project at the end of this message however in certain jurisdictions Enron has only a few employees and we may elect not to include those employees in the expert directory if we determine that the cost of the legal research for that jurisdiction is not justified by the benefit to Enron I am also wondering whether the information included in the database is sufficient for this more complicated project My colleague Sharon Butcher and I would like to discuss our new project with you to see if Clifford Chance is again willing and able to provide the local research that we require and to get an estimate of the cost involved We were hoping to call you at am Houston time on Monday May nd Please let me know if this time is not convenient and we will arrange for another call I can be reached by telephone fax or email kellynoel nron I hope you are well and look forward to our work together Regards Kelly Noel Higgason Argentina Australia Brazil

<31163027.1075860500162.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,michelle.cash@enron.com,2000-08-11 02:53:00,Re Contracting Solutions Cc I will defer to your expertise on whether we should actively accept resumes from CS at this time I think the way to couch it is that we do not want to receive them at this time but that they are free to check with us in a couple of months to see whether that has changed That way we arent making it an absolute ban Thanks for the information Michelle Debi Vanwey AM To Michelle CT cc Robert NRON Subject Re Contracting Solutions Thanks for your feedback If we accept resumes from an agency it means establishing a full working relationship with them which is time consuming for the recruiter We have to constantly QA them and answer their phone calls and it is more work than it seems from the outside They almost need to be coached all the time unless they are really good which is rare CS is one of the fairly high maintenance agencies This is why we are going to a preferred vendor list We have lots of agencies that want to work with us and choosing those that we can count on to get us good candidates quickly and take the least amount of our time saves a lot of time for the recruiters After Jennifer told Kathyrn she wasnt going to work with her Kathyrn did flood her inbox with unsolicited resumes That would certainly make me not want to work with them I can force the issue and ask one of the recruiters to work with them if you feel we need to however I feel that until Kathryn cools off a little this would not be productive As for the apology I will always apologize if I am clearly in the wrong however I think that definitely in this case it would be construed as an admission of wrongdoing on Enrons part Im fine with letting go of it This has been a good learning experience for me There have been a couple of phone calls this week where I was consciously more polite with agencysales phone calls than I would have been prior to last week Jennifer had some fear up yesterday about addressing an issue with an agency because of the CS issue which is understandable and were working through it together I want her to be able to stay in her power with these people and we just need to learn new ways to do that Its a tough job dealing with agencies day after day really wears you down Were going to write some scripts for talking with them in the future and the recruiters will route all the new ones through me so they all get the same story Were also putting some new processes in place so that we are consistent in our relationships with agencies Hopefully this will help eliminate some of these issues in the future Thanks for all your help Debi Michelle Cash PM To Debi CT cc Robert NRON Jennifer NRON Subject Re Contracting Solutions Debi Your plan sounds good to me You all have done a good job of researching this data and I believe we are in a strong position My one question is whether it is worth it to tell them we are not accepting resumes from them What is the harm in accepting them Are we obligated to interview the candidate Given this situation it is possible that telling them not to send resumes will fan the flames for no good reason especially since their proven track record is only for one placement It does not appear as if they are flooding us with resumes Let me know if my assumption is not correct Also I am not sure your apology is necessary It certainly is wellintentioned but I wouldnt want it to be construed as some sort of admission of wrongdoing So unless you feel compelled Thanks Michelle Debi Vanwey PM To Michelle CT Robert NRON cc Jennifer NRON Subject Contracting Solutions Our research is complete with John Nguyen and Mark Delaro There is only one John Nguyen that works for Enron and he is at EBS This is not the same John Nguyen that was sent from Contracting Solutions I talked with the Enron John personally and compared past employment to the CS John The John Nguyen that was sent by CS was sent on to Keith Dziadek for an opening he had We got no response from Keith which for him is considered a no We have no record of Mark Delaro ever being sent in by CS He was directly recruited by Ergos presented by them and hired through them Jennifer talked with Mark and he states that he has never talked to a recruiting firm named Contracting Solutions If CS did indeed present his resume to Enron then they should be able to produce the email with datetime stamp Neither Jen nor I have asked them for this yet I feel Robert and I should meet with them tomorrow to bring closure to the situation Robert had mentioned that we should be able to get back with them this week and I think we should make good on the promise Here are my recommendations please give me your thoughts I owe the Account Manager an apology for being rude on the phone Clarify with them that we do not owe them a fee on Mark Delaro or John Nguyen based on above facts Clarify with them that we are not doing business with them at this time The recruiters have just given me their final preferred vendor list and CS is not on it since no one is interested in working with them We should let them know that yes they do have an MSA which is an agreement for contract placement but this does not require us to accept resumes from them We accept resumes only from those agencies that we ask to assist us with recruiting We should offer to take another look at them in days give them a second chance and have the guidelines for the trial period well defined They should contact me directly at that time We should address the relationship between Jennifer and Kathryn the difficulties being that Jennifer made a decision not to work with them Kathryn tried to force her business on Jennifer after the decision had been made and Kathyrn brought her personal problems into the conversation in order to press the point They should be aware of the basis of Jennifers decision not to employ them as a vendor inadequate resume flow poor working relationship with account manager We have no proof that Jennifer has spread bad press about CS to any other company including Continential Shell Services and Dynegy and after addressing this issue with her do not believe that this occurred Nor did she did send Mark Delaros resume to Ergos We have no reason to believe that she has ever acted out of integrity while working for Enron nor that she will in the future Cheryl Charles Maddison presented her resume to Robert and Ryan and Ryan forwarded to me in the past weeks and has not claimed association with CS We have no recruiter openings at this time and she has been informed of this by Ryan and myself Debi

react to and treat the symptoms number of absolute categories without full consideration of the root cause and setting a plan to address it The real change issue as I see it is job description and position classification The real project is to rationalise the job structures within Enron simplify wherever possible Target a cut from categories to say This impacts not only the PRC but how we look at compensation across the levels function performed eg commercial commercial support technical and specialization areas eg legal accounting IT engineering HR etc With respect to current yearend PRC it is hard to change the agreed process midstream It is doable if we can show wherehow certain of the categories are equivalent and should be considered together Only caveat is to ensure we do not

assign value to roles in ENA commercial deal making function this is very easy to do how much they profit they generate grade has very little place in this world In other areas it is harder and grading provides a methodology far from perfect for grouping and providing structure around a set of skills and how they are valued in the organisation To lose them without providing some other method of measuring value eg a more robust PRC process would run the risk of making a sometimes too subjective process even more subjective Give me a small number of loose grades anytime So we should aim for nearer to and head away from the having levels for admins does smack of bureacracy Would be interested to be involved in looking at this Neil free market radical Drew C CT AM To David CT cc Cindy NRON

need for any more than from top to bottom In this regard I would lay down the following challenge for your comments why would the following structure not work better in promoting a flat

very closely because it was filed against Microsoft and because of the large potential class of plaintiffs Class action suits are an employers worst nightmare think Texaco and CocaCola Please feel free to share this with your management No Monday October Page A ISSN News Discrimination Suit Filed by Microsoft Salaried Employee Alleges Discrimination Based on Race Sex SEATTLEA suit has been filed against Microsoft Corp alleging the company maintains a systemic and pervasive practice of discriminating against African American and female salaried employees affecting pay rates and promotion opportunities Donaldson v Microsoft Corp WD Wash No CP Such discrimination at the company is the standard operating procedure the lawsuit said The suit filed Oct in federal court in Seattle seeks back pay other job benefits and compensatory and punitive damages for a proposed class of about African American employees and some female employees Mark Murray company spokesman said Microsoft does not tolerate discrimination of any kind We take these kinds of issues very seriously Murray said regarding the lawsuit The company has an active diversity policy and seeks to recruit and promote minorities and women Murray told BNA Oct He said he could not comment on any specific aspects of the lawsuit The class would include all current and former female salaried employees who worked for Microsoft beginning Feb and all current and former African American salaried employees who worked at the company beginning Oct Microsoft employs some workers in the US the complaint said About percent to percent are African American and about percent are women Murray said the company has about employees in the US including in Western Washington In the US percent of Microsoft employees are women and percent minorities he said The lawsuit was filed by Cohen Milstein Hausfeld Toll of Seattle The named plaintiff Monique Donaldson sued on behalf of herself and a class of all similarly situated African American and similarly situated female salaried employees at Microsoft African American and female salaried employees of Microsoft are routinely subjected to a pattern and practice of race and sex discrimination affecting the terms and conditions of their employment at the company the complaint said The violationsof Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of the Civil Rights Act of and Civil Rights Act of are systemic in nature and constitute a pattern and practice of conduct which permeates Microsofts operations the lawsuit maintains Excessive Subjectivity Alleged The complaint said the company allows excessive subjectivity in decisions involving promotions and compensation Microsoft has retaliated against employees in the class who complained either internally or externally about Microsofts treatment of African American and female employees by giving unjustified lowered performance evaluations and constructively terminating them The lawsuit said the company uses an excessively subjective evaluation system that allows managers who are predominantly white males to rate employees based upon their own biases rather than based upon merit Performance evaluations for instance use a fivepoint scal but scores of five the highest number are not awarded Within any organization of the company only a certain number of employees are allowed to receive each score which can range from to the lawsuit said Thus no matter how good or bad the actual performance of employees a certain number of them must still receive the lower scores Any employee with a score is placed on a personal improvement plan or asked to resign the complaint said Stack rankings are used to rank employees in the same job category and organizational unit from best to worst the complaint said Employees can be ranked higher under the stack ranking than others who receive numerically higher performance evaluations the lawsuit said Obtaining higher stack rankings is often governed by an employees personal popularity with other managers because the rankings mix employees working for different managers In addition to allowing discrimination in performance appraisals the company also has a pattern of paying African American and female employees salaries substantially lower than those paid white males doing similar work with the same or lesser skills and with similar or lesser experience the lawsuit said Furthermore excessively subjective decisionmaking criteria are applied in promotions which favor white males with fewer qualifications than African Americans and female employees By Nan

that I can give it to Mark at our Quarterly Business Review Meeting at Monday actually I will need it by noon so that I can revise it Thanks Michelle Transactions Major Events of September November Garden State Paper closing and transition Triple Lutz issues surrounding potential divestiture including internal discussions review of data requests and responses review and comment on both PSA documents negotiations with both buyers representatives and discussions with clients Issues include salaries of employees hired by buyer effect of Enron severance plan other benefits for divested employees including unvested stock options insurance vacation etc process for divesture payment of severance obligations possible redeployment etc Crane monitor due diligence PSA review and comment client discussions Falcon review diligence reports client discussions E limited involvement in PSA and schedule review data requests Anticipated Issues for December February Triple Lutz continued negotiations and document drafting Transition issues for divestiture will continue to be significant Litigation by persons who lose their jobs as a result of the transaction and who choose not to sign the waiver for double the severance benefits is possible East Coast Power If we sell our interest in ECP there will be many transition issues due to Enrons providing benefits payroll etc for ECP personnel Also there will be transition issues for other services including legal services that Enron has been providing for ECP CraneFalcon could move forward Crane is more likely Issues of labor unions and Canadian law will require attention on transition issues Litigation Major Events of September November No employeeinitiated litigation for Noncompete litigation Currently suit pending against Alonzo Williams in Sharolyn Woods court Suit filed no TRO sought Service in process Minor litigation Marentz Co v Enron Suit for nonpayment of placement fee Maximum damages K Discovery period ends this week courtordered mediation to follow Anticipated Issues for December February I expect that we will be filing noncompete litigation in February and March as people leave after they are paid their bonuses We should discuss the continued use of Bill Ogden for noncompete litigation Documents Generated Major Events of September November New Consulting Services Agreement I prepared a new form of Consulting Services Agreement to replace old Master Service Agreement and Project Work Description for Net Works contract personnel I received minor comments from outside counsel as well as client group feedback I will finalize the agreement so that the new document can go into effect on Standard Agreements I prepared draft employment agreements draft consulting services agreements separation agreement and releases retention letter agreements The number of employment agreements seems low to me particularly in trading My understanding is that Lavorato does not want to put every person in trading under contract but wants to wait and see how they perform There are potential legal risks with this approach if we want to enforce our noncompete provisions Anticipated Issues for December February I expect that after bonus amounts are announced there will be a flurry of contract activity in efforts to pay people through means other than the bonus pool Investigations Major Events of September November Anonymous Letters Sent to Office of Chairman about Energy Operations I directed the investigation and supervised outside consultants once the company decided to employ them I and the team reviewed the results with Sally Beck in early November and proposed methods to address the results of the consultants surveys Sally Beck is contemplating communication to employees on results of survey Other proposals can be discussed verbally Texaco Hacker We had a situation where one of our employees logged onto the Texaco computer system using an ID of a former coworker He then sent inappropriate emails to her coworkers posing as her The investigation results led to termination of employment for cause Anticipated Issues for December February I expect that there will be some claims that will need to be investigated following PRCbonus discussions Training Major Events of September November Increased role as trainer I provided interview training for all Net Works employees who are involved in the Technology Track about sessions Anticipated Issues for December February EIM Ray Bowen has asked Julia and I to provide training to the Industrials Group The focus will be on labor and employment issues in the acquisition of assets as well as the integration of assets into the Enron family All of Wholesale The harassment prevention training is going to be repeated early next year for all persons hired in the last months Refresher training is being developed and will be delivered for those who already went through the first round PreHire Testing Major Events of September November Many Wholesale groups are looking at preemployment testing as a method of screening out applicants I am working with the Training and Development groups to ensure that the tests meet legal standards I have suggested experts for HR to use in validation of such tests to ensure that the tests will result in a successful employee ReSkilling One aptitude test is being employed in the selection of potential employees who may be reskilled to perform IT jobs working under Beth Perlman Anticipated Issues for December February I expect the testing issue to continue to be hot particularly since John Lavorato likes the concept for use in the Trading Track rotations for the AA program Employee RelationsTerminations Much of my time is spent providing advice on employee relationstermination issues approximately per week total No two situations are alike and they require significant time Anticipated Issues for December February After PRCbonus time this area of practice will be exceptionally busy The company will put persons who received a Needs Improvement or lower rating on a performance improvement plan Generally I review those before they are put in place If they are not successful then terminations are likely probably early in the first half of Those issues are timeconsuming and full of risks Work for Portfolio Assets Major Events of September November Ecogas winddown issues Mariner Change of Control Agreements CGAS harassment prevention training arranged for Littler Mendelson to provide training for CGAS personnel East Coast Power Agreements advice and counselling on various issues Anticipated Issues for December February CGAS Revising employment agreements for key personnel Mariner Employment agreement negotiation Conclusions ENA ENA has not been able to hire commercial talent at the levels of manager and above I expect to see a great emphasis on hiring Lavorato has placed processes in place for hiring at that level including the requirement of an interview with the OOC before someone can be hired at the level of manager or above Salaries need to be reviewed for equity by gender as well as by race Net Works Net Works has hired over employees and contractors in I expect that a portion of those will be bad hires and will have to be managed out Generally the IT personnel are not the best about counselling and documentation so there may be significant work to be done to ensure that risks are managed in that situation I have seen improvement in that group working with HR and they have invited me to conduct training so it may improve over time Contractors are another issue at Net Works A significant portion of the work force is contract personnel Microsoft issues could arise if contractors are allowed to stay on too long Misclassification under the FLSA is another issue Net Works has too many employees in the exempt category who should be classified as nonexempt I have raised this issue with HR and they are working through it It will not be an easy fix EIM The biggest issues facing EIM include the attraction and retention of talent as well as MA activity HR has hired a person from Azurix to

remain on their home country payroll system we are struggling with a convenient method to have them pay US taxes both income and possibly social security as well as receive US Currently David Oxley is on such an arrangement He is paid by the UK a portion of his pay to maintain UK benefits The remainder of his salary is paid on US payroll This allows him to pay in FIT withholding No FICAMedicare is necessary due to the totalization agreement with the UK Unfortunately this created some extra work on the domestic benefits group as they had to code the HR system not to provide him with Flex dollars

including the above people as well as Mikie Rath and Dolores Lenfest We probably need to do this as soon as possible in the new year Can you also include Jane Pleli Joann Hill and Sherry Lessner there may be issues with us changing current environment prior to that we need to consider Thanks Cb From Jane Allen ECT PM To Michael B NRON cc Cynthia NRON Michelle CT David O nron Mary nron David CT Subject Re Payroll Company for Incoming Foreign Nationals Okay so what is our next step Who can get the company set up Thanks Jane Michael B NRON PM To Jane CT cc Cynthia NRON Michelle CT David O nron Mary nron David CT Subject Re Payroll Company for Incoming Foreign Nationals For the employees to be provided with domestic benefits they could just be placed on the standard domestic payroll whereas the employees not to have domestic benefits could be on the new company As Cynthia states below the new company as a whole would not be adopting benefit plans Logistically there would just need to be different procedures for setting up the new hires on the correct company Also the administration of the cross charges will be much easier once SAP Payroll comes online Currently there is some manual intervention when charging from one company like Expat Services to the appropriate accounting company Mike From Jane Allen ECT AM To Cynthia NRON Michelle CT cc David O nron Cynthia NRON Mary nron David CT Michael B NRON Subject Re Payroll Company for Incoming Foreign Nationals Good point we would want to pick and choose as some may not want to remain on home country payroll or a home country payroll may not exist Michelle can you comment from a legal perspective Thanks Jane Cynthia NRON AM To Jane CT cc David O nron Cynthia NRON Mary nron David CT Subject Re Payroll Company for Incoming Foreign Nationals The not making them eligible for domestic benefits is easy The new payroll company will simply not adopt the plans I am assuming that the number of employees nor associated demographics in this company will not create a discrimination problem One question though will we treat all foreign nationals the same or will you want to pick and choose who receive domestic benefits and who does not If the answer is yes to this we will probably need to run some legal traps Let me know if we can help Cb From Jane Allen ECT AM To Michael B NRON cc David O nron Cynthia NRON Mary nron David CT Subject Payroll Company for Incoming Foreign Nationals As Enron expands globally we are faced with a growing issue of more and more foreign nationals entering the US on varied lengths of assignment For some it is necessary that they remain on their home country payroll to maintain retirement benefits as our domestic benefits structure k cash balance etc does not provide them with equivalent benefits based on the fact they will return to their home country to retire If they remain on their home country payroll system we are struggling with a convenient method to have them pay US taxes both income and possibly social security as well as receive US Currently David Oxley is on such an arrangement He is paid by the UK a portion of his pay to maintain UK benefits The remainder of his salary is paid on US payroll This allows him to pay in FIT withholding No FICAMedicare is necessary due to the totalization agreement with the UK Unfortunately this created some extra work on the domestic benefits group as they had to code the HR system not to provide him with Flex dollars healthwelfare and retirement benefits We indicated in his employment agreement that he was not eligible for these benefits I am looking for an easier and more efficient way to do this Would it be possible to create a payroll company here in the US for arriving foreign nationals that remain on their home country payroll that would allow them a mechanism to receive a portion of their pay in US into a US account pay in FIT and possibly FICAMedicare not make them eligible for domestic benefits I would appreciate you and the others I have copied looking into this Thanks Jane

Forwarded by Michelle CashHOUECT on AM Phillip SYDNEY NRONDEVELOPMENT AM To John NRON cc PaulTYO akerNet NRON Alan NRON Michelle NRON Subject Re Enron and PDI Japan Hi John The battery of tests includes the following a Global Personality Inventory GPI description The GPI is a leadership personality inventory based on data collected and developed by a team of industrialorganizational psychologists from around the world The GPI measures personality for the work context in general and for professional for the work context and contains distinct scales that can be combined to form dimensions relevant to most job models Japan norms Japanese midlevel frontline manager and individual contributor norms available b Advanced Progressive Matrices Ravens description This nonveral test is the same as that used by Enron Australia through CoyneDidsburyPDI and correlates highly with other tests of problem solving capacity Global PDI managerexecutive norms available c Leadership Inventoryplus description a PDIstructured tool used in the selection of entry and midlevel managers measuring those basic abilities traits values interests and motivations that are critical to effective leadership The LI includes both personality and cognitive ability ie numerical analytical and verbal reasoning components US manager norms available The intention is to use the testing on local hires not US nationals to confirmexpand on information gained in the interviewing process Reference checking is a very poor substitute for interviews accompanied by some objective abilities testing against standard norms The important thing is that we dont use this information as a be all and end all test of whether we take on a candidate or not The bottom line is in my professional opinion these tests are an important part of a high quality recruiting effort and have been demonstrated as such in Australia on several occasions unless there are significant legal impediments I want to proceed with them Thanks From John NRON on CDT To Phillip SYDNEY TaylorENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT PaulTYO akerNetcom cc Alan CT Michelle CT Subject Re Enron and PDI Japan Phil I have raised the issue of

including me on the distribution of this I received your voice mail and was glad to be in the loop In general we try to avoid any type of personalitypsych testing because of issues relating to the Americans with Disabilities Act which prohibits preemployment medical testing It does apply to US citizens working for Enron in foreign locations ie extraterritorially Before we go forward and do this type of testing it is useful to ascertain the purposegoal of the tests Why do they want this information Is there another less intrusive way to obtain that information eg references from prior employers etc As noted below there may be Japanese laboremployment law issues that address this type of activity as well I suggest that we obtain the information above as well as the opinion requested below and then determine how to proceed Michelle John NRON PM To Michelle CT cc Alan CT Subject Enron and PDI Japan Michelle Pursuant to my voicemail I am forwarding the attached email traffic for

Alan NRON Michelle NRON Subject Re Enron and PDI Japan Hi John The battery of tests includes the following a Global Personality Inventory GPI description The GPI is a leadership personality inventory based on data collected and developed by a team of industrialorganizational psychologists from around the world The GPI measures personality for the work context in general and for professional for the work context and contains distinct scales that can be combined to form dimensions relevant to most job models Japan norms Japanese midlevel frontline manager and individual contributor norms available b Advanced Progressive Matrices Ravens description This nonveral test is the same as that used by Enron Australia through CoyneDidsburyPDI and correlates highly with other tests of problem solving capacity Global PDI managerexecutive norms available c Leadership Inventoryplus description a PDIstructured tool used in the selection of entry and midlevel managers measuring those basic abilities traits values interests and motivations that are critical to effective leadership The LI includes both personality and cognitive ability ie numerical analytical and verbal reasoning components US manager norms available The intention is to use the testing on local hires not US nationals to confirmexpand on information gained in the interviewing process Reference checking is a very poor substitute for interviews accompanied by some objective abilities testing against standard norms The important thing is that we dont use this information as a be all and end all test of whether we take on a candidate or not The bottom line is in my professional opinion these tests are an important part of a high quality recruiting effort and have been demonstrated as such in Australia on several occasions unless there are significant legal impediments I want to proceed with them Thanks From John NRON on CDT To Phillip SYDNEY TaylorENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT PaulTYO akerNetcom

try to avoid any type of personalitypsych testing because of issues relating to the Americans with Disabilities Act which prohibits preemployment medical testing It does apply to US citizens working for Enron in foreign locations ie extraterritorially Before we go forward and do this type of testing it is useful to ascertain the purposegoal of the tests Why do they want this information Is there another less intrusive way to obtain that information eg references from prior employers etc As noted below there may be Japanese laboremployment law issues that address this type of activity as well

place between ENA and Enron Expat Services In general the contract is between ENA and the employee if the person is an expat The assignment letter covers the employees transfer to Expat Services We havent usually amendedassigned the agreement over to Expat Services because the payrollbenefits etc are through ENA If there are changes to his ENA agreement it is very easy for me to do them and I am happy to handle it If Mr Slovenski is a VP level or above employee I simply cannot remember right now then Executive Compensation needs to be involved I hope this answers your questions I have copied Sharon Butcher on this email because she has been involved with assignmentsexpats for several years If you have further questions please reply to both of us so that we can be aware of questions Thanks a lot Michelle Michelle Cash Enron North America Corp Smith Street EB Houston Texas This message may contain confidential information that is protected by the attorneyclient andor work product privileges Matthias Lee AM To Michelle CT cc Lilian CT Angeline CT Michelle CT Kimberly CT John L CT John CT Subject Re URGENT Employment Contract Rich Slovenski Michelle Subject to any views Michelle Cash has I would be happy to assist by drafting the agreed amendments to the Richs Contract I understand from Lilian that changes would only be to the Annex and would not affect the main body of the Contract I can work with Lilian on this once she is able to finalise the agreed amendments with John Nowlan I note your advice that ENA is the correct employing entity and the intended arrangement is a secondment from Enron Expat Services to ENA However your suggestion for a clause in the Contract to reference the secondment would not be sufficient to put the arrangement in place Rather there should be an agreement between Enron Expat Services and ENA I believe such an agreement is likely to be in place as Rich is not the first expat here in Singapore from ENA John Chismar and John Thomas who are here precede him Because I do not have the background to the relevant intercompany arrangement between ENA and Enron Expat Services I would suggest you discuss with Michelle Cash on to clarify this issue and perhaps make the necessary amendments to the letter of offer which presently provides that Enron Expat Services is the employer and that Rich will be expected to provide services for ENA instead of secondment from ENA to Enron Expat Services Regards Matt Michelle Hargrave PM To Lilian CT cc Matthias CT Kimberly CT John L CT John CT Tim Poullain CT Angeline CT Michelle CT Alan CT Subject Re URGENT Employment Contract Rich Slovensky Lillian We were discussing this with our International HR Rep and we feel that since the offer letter indicates Enron Expat Services as the employe the employment agreement should reflect employment by ENA and we need to add a clause secunding Mr Slovinski to Enron Expat Service PLEASE have Matthias make the amendments so we can get this in place as soon as possible I am sure that as long as Legal in Singapore makes the necessary changes it will be fine The important thing is to get Rich to sign the contract You did receive the employment agreements we fedexd you on June th didnt you Make the necessary changes and send a copy to us This was our first Expat and it has been a real learning experience Regards Michelle Lilian Low PM To Michelle CT cc Matthias CT Kimberly CT John L CT John CT Tim Poullain CT Angeline CT Michelle CT Alan CT Subject Re URGENT Employment Contract Rich Slovensky Michelle Per my email to you and Kim copied John Nowlan and John Chismar dated June there were some amendments to his package which was only approved that day I do not have the soft copy of the executables to make the changes nor am I sure if I m allowed to make amendments to them without legal reviewing them Since Legal Singapore is aware of the situation and if it is agreeable we can make amendments to the existing hard copies and have Matthias review them This should expedite this However we still need to know who would be the employers of Rich ENA or Expat services Lilian Michelle Hargrave To Matthias CT cc Kimberly CT John L CT John CT Lilian CT Tim Poullain CT Angeline CT Michelle CT Alan CT Subject Re URGENT Employment Contract Rich Slovensky Matthias the executables were FedExd to Lillian on June th We have just been waiting for Rich to sign them and return them Would you have any idea as to why he has not signed yet As for it being Eron Expat or Enron North America I will let Michelle Cash in our legal dept respond to that Michelle can you respond on whether or not it matters as to Enron Expat or Enron North America and which is correct Regards Michelle Matthias Lee PM To Michelle CT Kimberly CT cc John L CT John CT Lilian CT Tim Poullain CT Angeline CT Michelle CT Alan CT Subject URGENT Employment Contract Rich Slovensky Michelle Kimberly Please allow me to introduce myself I am Legal Counsel for ECT Singapore It has just been brought to my attention by our HR Specialist Lilian Low that the employment contract for our new trader Rich Slovensky has not been executed You would appreciate that that gives us a slew of control compliance and legal issues Apart from confidentiality issues Rich does not presently have authority to bind ECT Singapore in contracts Please let me have your very urgent advice whether we can expect Richs employment contract to be in place immediately to regularise the situation or whether we have to implement measures to stop Richs trading activity Additionally I noticed that the cover letter offering employment to Rich refers to employment with Enron Expat Services but the employment contract states that ENA is the employer Please clarify or rectify as appropriate Regards Matt Lee

another PRC process it has become exceedingly obvious that there are several issues that need improvement in the process With all our discussions about Communication within Enron I am now communicating to your level issues that I have communicated in years past to other parties without change Enron needs to lay out the groundrules in total that will pertain to the upcoming review period and communicate them in advance of the review period not during the PRC process to be applied after the performance has already occurred and upon which each employee cannot change their behavior for such review period This is only fair to our employees so that they know the criteria upon which they will be evaluated in advance The PRC system needs to be changed whereby any and all people that are willing to provide input on performance of any individual can be done without a bunch of red tape There is this idea that unsolicited input works within the system but it requires too much effort to get throught the hurdles and it still requires that the supervisor approve such input There needs to be an unobstructed communication line for this input The theory of upward feedback should also be questioned I have never been asked to provide input to my direct boss President of Houston Pipe Line in all the years that I have worked for that position Are Managing Directors exempt from this process This issue is also addressed in below in a different manner How can appropriate feedback be given if those that work directly with individuals are not given the opportunity to communicate There is still way too much preferrential selection of reviewers in the process There should be set out for each employee a listing of absolute minimum reviewers certain people that must be solicited depending upon the job function I have seen too many circumstances where the obvious people to provide input were not even solicited There was one individual that partially worked directly for another during this past review period and was not even asked for input What constitutes an average employee and what that category is within our PRC definitions is still being debated It has been described by several HR representatives that it is eitherand both Strong or Satisfactory Neither one of the definitions describes such performance as simply doing the job Because of such confusion the reviewers when they provide input do not effectively and precisely rate the employee What we end up with in the PRC is an overinflated representation of each employee and the committee has to pull the entire group back a notch With better definitions and communication to our employees on how to interpret the definitions it will give us a better process and set the standards in
