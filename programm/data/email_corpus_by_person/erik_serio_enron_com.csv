<25906304.1075852431276.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,erik.serio@enron.com,2001-08-27 09:26:40,From the Jim Rome Show talking about A M They wont shut up They have to go on about spirit and old army and r ed ass and how bonfire represents the burning sensation they have in their urine to beat UT and blah blah blah Shut up You start to get the feelin g the entire school was built to spite UT Forget the fact that when the Texas Legislature back in the s passe d legislation to start a state university they also decided to have a subsi diary branch of the main school University of Texas that would teach agri culture and mechanics Aggies love to say their school is older from where they get that I dont nowthe fact is the State intended AM to be a branch of UT They are like the afterbirth from the original creation Lik e Danny Devito in Twins So they apparently have this complex so much so that they must devote their entire school to trying to prove to UT that they are just as good Al l the while nobody at UT denies that AM is a good school yet they wont shut up So they write a fight songaboutTexas and how they want to beat them They have a Fish Camp for freshman where they tell them how bad Texas is and how good AM and all its traditions are It is the worlds largest known case of penis envy and it is manifested in everything AM d oes The people at AM Now we all have friends who went to AM or are at AM There are some nice people there Howeverthere is the Corp East Texas answer to dreams of ROTC kids everywhere For every boy scout who never l earned to stop playing with his GI Joe Toys there is the Corp Now forget the fact that AM will actually let people with subpar grades enroll if t hey agree to join the Corp Forget the fact that the Corps looked like a Ge stapo hate rally while beating down students on Kyle Field in Forget the fact that along with the numerous hazing charges that have been filed a gainst them and swept under the rug over the years they just this past mo nth have had one Corps member bring charges against another Corps member wh o apparently had been propositioning others for a little actual sodomy Not only could I go on with more instances of idiocracy by these Khakicladsh avenheadeddorks I am sure each of you have your own stories The point i s We all respect West Point Annapolis The Air Force Academy however no body respects the Corp I imagine they are kind of the laughing stock of th e military world Just because you dress like the Army and try and act lik e the Army does not make you the Army People at AM dont even respect th ese clowns It is not cool to shave your head and dress up Halloween is on ly supposed to be one day of the year If you want to carry guns and beat u p civilians move to Israel It is even less cool to slobber on somebodys daughter on national telev ision and call it a tradition Dry humping year old girls in the stands at football games is not cool Not only is it not cool it should be agains t the law I know that in College Station students are just prone to mount each other on the campus lawn or in the middle of class or anytime anyth ing good happens you can just grab the girl sitting next to you and start s ucking on her face But everywhere else in the world it is looked down upo n Especially if you are doing it on my TV That is why we have moved the g ame from Thanksgiving Because people across the nation were gagging on the ir turkey when in the middle of watching a football game some boy scout is tongue thrashing some overweight coed during somebodys Thanksgiving dinn er We do not need to see burly women engaged in a suckfest every time your woeful offense manages to put points on the board Some of these girls are in desperate need of a trip to the Clinique counter Screw that forget ma keup it is too late for that just give them a veil tu is not funny It is NOT insulting It is dumb Just imagine if fo lks from Texas kept talking about MA and giggling That would not be funny In fact it would be retarded Thats why UT fans dont do it Please lea rn You want to lose the image of country bumpkins of a people fond of shee p of people that arent stupid Then quit building things that fall down Quit chasing cheerleaders around with swords on national TV Quit whooping in church Quit whooping period Quit putting up scoreboards for the enjoym ent of dead mammals Quit spending your Friday nights practicing how to yel l Quit telling rape jokes to reporters when youre running for Governor W hen you are filling out season ticket renewals and the form asks for your phone H W quit putting Height Weight Just colle ctively stop making asses of yourselves Go to East Texas tour every smal l town and ask every red neck with a th grade education why they cheer fo r AM and wear maroon That is your fan base This is why you are perceived by the educated masses as stupid Nobody cares if you think your band is better They might be louder the y might march in neat little zig zags but they have no musical ability Th e point is nobody cares who wins halftime Quit getting geeked up about ma rching bands I find it hard to believe you stood through your high school bands entire halftime performance And why Cause nobody cared then and no body cares now Plus you can hear them fine sitting down even if you do ca re Why is it cool all of a sudden now that youre in college Men should never let out high pitched whooping sounds Perhaps the only justifiable situation in which this can be tolerated is perhaps during an a nal probe Oh waitI understand now Dogs are not ladies They dont look or smell like ladies Dogs eat the ir own feces and should be treated accordingly Finally College Station is an armpit of a town Quit pretending that it is a great college town It is a town and there is a college there That should be the end of this comparison If you feel that life doesnt get an y better than the Dixie Chicken and enjoy being stuck in a never ending D ukes of Hazard episode then move there More importantly dont move to A ustinthey are trying to create an educated technological and open mi nded population base Austin is and will continue to be the birthplace an d final resting place of all that is cool As my friend Stephen Johnson onc e said If the world were ever to get an enema College Station is where y ou would connect the hose If you go to school at AM please dont be an Aggie
