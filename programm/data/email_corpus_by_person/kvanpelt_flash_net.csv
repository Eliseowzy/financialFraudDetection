American heroism SOMETHING FOR ALL OF US TO THINK ABOUTAND BE THANKFUL THAT A WAR SUCH AS THIS WILL HOPEFULLY NEVER HAPPEN AGAINJHK The Boys of Iwo Jima Each year I am hired to go to Washington DC with the eight grade class from Clinton WI where I grew up to videotape their trip I greatly enjoy visiting our nations capitol and each year I take some special memories back with me This falls trip was especially memorable On the last night of our trip we stopped at the Iwo Jima memorial This memorial is the largest bronze statue in the world and depicts one of the most famous photographs in history that of the six brave soldiers raising the American Flag at the top of a rocky hill on the Island of Iwo Jima Japan during WWII Over one hundred students and chaperones piled off the buses and headed towards the memorial I noticed a solitary figure at the base of the statue and as I got closer he asked Where are you guys from I told him that we were from Wisconsin Hey Im a cheesehead too Come gather around Cheeseheads and I will tell you a story James Bradley just happened to be in Washington DC to speak at the memorial the following day He was there that night to say good night to his dad who has since passed away He was just about to leave when he saw the buses pull up I videotaped him as he spoke to us and received his permission to share what he said from my videotape It is one thing to tour the incredible monuments filled with history in Washington DC But it is quite another to get the kind of insight we received that night When all had gathered around he reverently began to speak Here are his words that night My name is James Bradley and Im from Antigo Wisconsin My dad is on that statue and I just wrote a book called Flags of Our Fathers which is on the New York Times Best Seller list right now It is the story of the six boys you see behind me Six boys raised the flag The first guy putting the pole in the ground is Harlon Block Harlon was an allstate football player He enlisted in the Marine Corps with all the senior members of his football team They were off to play another type of game A game called War But it didnt turn out to be a game Harlon at the age of died with his intestines in his hands I dont say that to gross you out I say that because there are generals who stand in front of this statue and talk about the glory of war You guys need to know that most of the boys in Iwo Jima were and years old He pointed to the statue You see this next guy Thats Rene Gagnon from new Hampshire If you took Renes helmet off at the moment this photo was taken and looked in the webbing of that helmet you would find a photograph A photograph of his girlfriend Rene put that in their for protection because he was scared He was years old Boys won the battle of Iwo Jima Boys Not old men The next guy here the third guy in this tableau was Sergeant Mike Strank Mike is my hero He was the hero of all these guys They called him the old man because he was so old He was already When Mike would motivate his boys in training camp he didnt say Lets go kill some Japanese or Lets die for our country He knew he was talking to little boys Instead he would say You do what I say and Ill get you home to your mothers The last guy on this side of the statue is Ira Hayes a Pema Indian from Arizona Ira Hayes walked off Iwo Jima He went into the White House with my dad President Truman told him Youre a hero He told reporters How can I feel like a hero when of my buddies hit the island with me and only of us walked off alive So you take your class at school of you spending a year together having fun doing everything together Then all of you hit the beach but only of your classmates walk off alive That was Ira Hayes He had images of horror in his mind Ira Hayes died dead drunk face down at the age of Ten years after this picture was taken The next guy going around the statue is Franklin Sousley from Hilltop Kentucky A funlovin hillbilly boy His best friend who is now told me Yeah you know we took two cows up on the porch of the Hilltop General Store Then we strung wire across the stairs so the cows couldnt get down Then we fed them Epson salts Those cows crapped all night Yes he was a funlovin hillbilly boy Franklin died on Iwo Jima at the age of When the telegram came to tell his mother that he was dead it went to the Hilltop General Store A barefoot boy ran that telegram up to his mothers farm The neighbors could hear her scream all night and into the morning The neighbors lived a quarter of a mile away The next guy as we continue to go around the statue is my dad John Bradley from Antigo Wisconsin where I was raised My dad lived until but he would never give interviews When Walter Kronkites producers or the New York Times would call we were trained as little kids to say No Im sorry sir my dads not here He is in Canada fishing No there is no phone there sir No we dont know when he is coming back My dad never fished or even went to Canada Usually he was sitting there right at the table eating his Campbells soup But we had to tell the press that he was out fishing He didnt want to talk to the press You see my dad didnt see himself as a hero Everyone thinks these guys are heroes cause they are in a photo and a monument My dad knew better He was a medic John Bradley from Wisconsin was a caregiver In Iwo Jima he probably held over boys as they died And when boys died in Iwo Jima they writhed and screamed in pain When I was a little boy my third grade teacher told me that my dad was a hero When I went home and told my dad that he looked at me and said I want you always to remember that the heroes of Iwo Jima are the guys who did not come back DID not come back So thats the story about six nice young boys Three died on Iwo Jima and three came back as national heroes Overall boys died on Iwo Jima in the worst battle in the history of the Marine Corps My voice is giving out so I will end here Thank you for your time Suddenly the monument wasnt just a big old piece of metal with a flag sticking out of the top It came to life before our eyes with the heartfelt words of son who did indeed
