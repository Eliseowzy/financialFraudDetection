at power deregulation pace By Chris Baltimore Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited WASHINGTON Oct Reuters Nearly years after Congress passed the Energy Policy Act in to promote competition in the nations billion wholesale power market Enron Corp is growing impatient From the US Supreme Court to Congress and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the Houstonbased energy and commodities trading giant has spread its openmarket gospel Five years ago we clearly thought we would be much farther along than we are now Rick Shapiro Enrons managing director of government affairs told Reuters in an interview on Friday Finishing the job of making wholesale markets work across the US is our number one objective Shapiro said Enron has a large stake in the regulatory debate With wideranging commodity positions from lumber to pulp to bandwidth oil and natural gas its strategy hinges on the ability to transfer those products from buyer to seller more cheaply and quickly than its competitors For the power market that means Enron needs easy access to electric transmission lines the interstate highway system that allows it to wheel supplies between regions and capitalize on shortterm price imbalances UTILITIES BLOCK COMPETITION Enrons big problem Traditional utilities own transmission lines and have shaped the rules to block new entrants and favor their own generation Shapiro said Vertically integrated monopolies have been very effective in delaying wholesale competition across the board he said In its pleas to Supreme Court justices and regulators Enron has tried to empower federal regulators to force utilities to open their wires to competition The Supreme Court last week heard oral arguments in a case that could be a watershed for the US power industry and decide whether FERC has the right to drive competition on state transmission networks In a classic battle of state versus federal jurisdictional turf Enron wants the court to give FERC more authority to compel states to open their transmission grids to competitors Meanwhile New York has brought a companion case that says FERC has gone too far and the court should give control of transmission wires back to the states This is an example of an agency that has overstepped its bounds Lawrence Malone general counsel for the New York State Public Service Commission said at the oral argument New York wants the court to revoke FERCs authority to regulate retail sales contending electricity involved in such sales stays within state boundaries and is not subject to federal legislation I think a victory for New York would be absolutely disastrous for consumers across the country Shapiro said FERC has jurisdiction All they need to do is exercise it Shapiro said echoing Enron lawyers case to Supreme Court justices that existing laws give FERC the power to do Enrons will Enron does not see a recent congressional push for energy legislation as key to its plans Shapiro said FERC is doing its job on the electricity front Im not sure that legislation is required on that front FERC SHOWS PROMISING SIGNS With new Chairman Pat Wood at the helm FERC is moving in the right direction to drive competition Shapiro said Its early in his tenure Shapiro said of Wood Many of the signs are promising Wood has made socalled regional transmission organizations a high priority and set aggressive agency rules to drive utilities to join them RTOs establish common rules that allow utilities to smoothly trade bulk electricity across the borders of their own local transmission systems Enron sees RTOs as a positive step toward competition In what he called a carrots and sticks approach Wood signaled in late September that utilities must either join RTOs or face losing the right to sell power in wholesale markets FERC will hold a weeklong meeting on RTOs beginning Monday Enron is skeptical that carrots are useful and is a bigger fan of sticks Shapiro said Utilities have gotten quite fat over the last nine or years Shapiro said and will shrug off FERCs incentives Im not sure there are a sufficient number of carrots in the world right now to incentivize these companies Shapiro said
