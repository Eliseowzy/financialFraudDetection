Income Net Revenues Per Shar e Net Income Basic Diluted Average Common Shares Outstanding Basic Diluted Return on Ave rage Equity NEW YORK Oct PRNewsw ire via COMTEX American Express Company NYSE AXP today reported thir d quarter net income of million down percent from million in the same period a year ago Diluted earnings per share were down p ercent from a year ago Net revenues on a managed basis totaled billio n down one percent from billion a year ago The companys return on e quity was percent Results for the third quarter were negatively aff ected by two significant items a previously announced restructuring charge of million pretax million aftertax and the impacts from the September th terrorist attacks The September th events resulted in c ertain onetime costs and business interruption losses including provisio ns related to credit exposures to travel industry service establishments i nsurance claims and waived finance charges and late fees The combination of these items totaled approximately million pretax million after tax The company also incurred costs of approximately million since September th which are expected to be covered by insurance Consequentl y these costs did not impact the quarterly results These include the cost of duplicate facilities and equipment associated with the relocation of th e companys offices in lower Manhattan and certain other business recovery expenses Costs associated with the damage to the companys offices extra operating expenses and business interruption losses are still being evaluat ed The company expects that a substantial portion ofgh its Ists and losses will be covered by insurance The third quarter restructuring charge inc ludes severance costs for the elimination of approximately jobs and a sset impairment and other costs all relating to the consolidation and reor ganization of certain business units the scale back of corporate lending i n certain regions the migration of certain processes to lower cost locatio ns the outsourcing of certain activities and the transition of certain pr ocessing and service functions to the Internet These initiatives are expec ted to produce expense savings of approximately million in A por tion of these savings is expected to flow through to earnings in the form o f improved operating expense margins and the rest is expected to be reinves ted back into highgrowth areas of the business In addition to the activ ities related to the restructuring charge the company made strong progress on its global reengineering efforts initiated in the first half of the yea r and as of September had realized savings in excess of million Net income for the third quarter adjusted for the restructuring and one time costs related to September th was approximately million down percent On a similar basis earnings per share were down perce nt The companys adjusted return on equity was percent While we w ere on target to meet prior consensus for third quarter earnings the terro rist attacks obviously had a significant impact on the overall economy and we saw clear evidence of that as consumer spending business travel and inv estment activity slowed after September th said Kenneth I Chenault ch airman and chief executive officer American Express Company In light of the weak economy and financial markets we are moving aggressively to lower our operating expenses The progress we are making on our reengineering in itiatives has freed up substantial resources for investment in our business es with the strongest growth potential This along with the anticipated be nefit of lower interest rates and the strategies in place to grow our franc hise positions us well to benefit when we see even a modest improvement in the economy Travel Related Services TRS reported quarterly net incom e of million down percent from million in the third quarter a year ago Included in third quarter results are million pretax million aftertax of the restructuring charge noted earlier Also include d in the results are million pretax million aftertax of onetim e costs and waived fees directly related to the September th terrorist at tacks Excluding these costs and the restructuring charge TRS net income would have been million down percent from the third quarter last y ear TRS net revenues rose two percent as growth in loans and fee reven ues were partly offset by a three percent decline in billed business and a percent fall in travel sales These declines reflect a substantial decre ase in corporate travel and entertainment spending and consumer travel sinc e September th Prior to September billed business growth for the quarte r was about two percent as higher consumer and small business spending offs et a decline in corporate travel and entertainment spending Net finance ch arge revenues were higher due to balance growth and wider net interest yie lds This increase reflects a smaller percentage of loan balances on introd uctory rates and the benefit of declining interest rates during the quarter The provision for losses on the lending portfolios grew as a result of higher volumes and an increase in US lending writeoff rates and delinque ncies Marketing and promotion expenses were lower as TRS scaled back certa in marketing efforts in light of the weaker business environment Operating expenses rose reflecting increased Cardmember loyalty programs and busine ss volumes These expenses were partly offset by the benefits of reengineer ing and costcontrol efforts The above discussion presents TRS results on a managed basis as if there had been no securitization transactions wh ich conforms to industry practice The attached financials present TRS resu lts on both a managed and reported basis Net income is the same in both fo rmats On a reported basis TRS results included securitization gains of million pretax million aftertax and million pretax m illion aftertax in the third quarters of and

of the restructuring charge note d earlier and million pretax million aftertax of insurance claim s directly related to September th Excluding these items AEFAs net inc ome would have been million down percent from last year AEFA re sults reflect continued weakness in equity markets and narrower spreads on the investment portfolio The weakened equity markets led to significantly lower asset levels and lower sales of investment products As a result man agement and distribution fees fell percent Operating expenses exclud ing the abovementioned charges decreased four percent from a year ago due primarily to lower sales commissions and continued reengineering and cost control initiatives As of September th approximately percent of the companys billion investment portfolio consisted of highyield securit ies down from percent a year ago and percent last quarter The reduct ion reflects the activities to date to lower the risk profile of the portfo lio and concentrate on stronger
