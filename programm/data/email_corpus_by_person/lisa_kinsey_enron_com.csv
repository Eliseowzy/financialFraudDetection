having Clarissa work the issues worked quite nicely Who ever you choo se we would need about of their time for now Later on with coordina tion efforts and testing it may go up to I dont see that happening for a while though The sooner we get someone to devote to this the better off we will be I expect these changes that well be looking into should improve performance quite a bit That being said weve identified three items that would speed up processin g the retrieval of Path Manager Currently the Path Manager attempts to reuse Path Ids I cant think of any reason why we need to perform this extra step It runs through th is processing on the application and generally doesnt find a match I kno w Patti has mentioned this several times and I cant think of a valid reaso n for performing this work I talked with Dave Nommensen and according to him what used to happen is that sometimes schedulers would get duplicate paths out there which is why they put this code in place From a schedul ing perspective my understanding of what your main concern is to just main tain your position and be able to change it If you were overpathed youd see it in the Path Manager either way Pinion Richard To restate the question for clarity in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply mar ket and a service adds any updownstream contract information andor Duns or DRN override and then saves it Unify looks for an old path with those exact variables and if it finds it reuses it and if it does not find an ex act match creates a new path and path id I had been told that to do away with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since any path once nominated on could not be deleted Has this changed At o ne time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path activity number match for nominations Texas Eastern was the only pipeline that ne eded the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they wer e used I spoke with Chris Ordway and the new LINK system no longer needs this to occur Transco uses activity numbers but uses the Activity number cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected Therefore if it does not create a space or memory problem for Unify I dont think that this constant old path look up is needed Kinsey Lisa Get rid of this The scheduling position window does anyone use this If not well r emove the code logic that populates this window I have never seen a sched uler use this Please verify Pinion Richard Originally such a window was in use by everyone in the legacy system Autonoms so it was duplicate d in Unify by request It is not used in Unify now because of the other so phisticated tools Unify provides which obviate its use The only value wo uld be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are o ther ways to determine those problems As voted on in a previous meeting o f the managers Lose it Kinsey Lisa Why is this still here On the inventory pool list does anyone need to see the Contarct Refere nces List Again this code is called every retrieval time and doesnt app ear to be used from my observations If they do need this information we could provide it but if not Id prefer to remove the functionality Pin ion Richard This function is still very much in use by those with poin t based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pat hed through the same contract imbalance pool Keep it Kinsey Lisa Ye s We use this functionality a lot when pathing pools When pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths whats the aver age number of paths they create at one time What about updates I know t hat ANR and NIGAS are big users of this feature since they have small packa ges of gas that they are limited in size to Does the system seem faster w hen you update one record at a time or chunks of records My real question is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both Updates and Inserts By update I mean going to the path list and changing an upstre am downstream contract or a PSNA which in turn forces a new path to be cr eated Pinion Richard This one to many or many to one pathing goes on every day on every pipeline There is no average They typically updat e a path with updownstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time how ever I hope this answers your question I see no change to this process at this time Kinsey Lisa On some pipes this function is used more than others When it is used we try and do as many paths as possible At this time I do not see a need to change this process On brokered paths do you want to utilize the same logic we have for Se rvice In other words when updating Brokered arrangements we dont incor porate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangm ent link and hence sending it to be renominated Why do we do this for ser vice Is it because we have to renominate it I assume thats what its f or since we dont send brokered paths to the pipe Anyway with the Nomlog ic implmentation two way interface we were planning on having it behave the same way as service We need this verified Pinion Richard We do nt perform the same logic for Brokered paths because these are not nominat ed to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pi peline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path I dont see a need to change the way Brokered paths are behaving at this time Kinsey Lisa Agree with Richard

RE Long running transaction information Donna As far as the Nigas meltdown on creating nominations could we make an option on the create screen to choose a specific meter to create noms For example Nominations on Gas Exchange Nicors system are all pooled by meter ie NGPL Alliance NBPL Every deal for every meter is pathed into or out of the POOLNICOR When we create nominations it creates a file that shows each meter as a separate pool and creates a nom for each pool and we transmit that flat file to Nigas If on the create screen we had an option to create ALL pools or specific pools that might help getting the nominations across a little faster They may finish up on one meter faster than they do on others Also it would help when we have to resubmit because typically it is only one meter we are resubmitting and as it is now we have to create noms for all meters again Thanks Cora Original Message From Greif Donna Sent Thursday May PM To Pena Matt Nguyen Ben Mallary William Ripley

ImportanceHigh All Were currently identifying processes that are inefficient and could possib ly benefit from being rewritten or not even performed Going foward I wou ld like Bob to appoint a lead business person to whom we could ask question s and or suggest ideas to so that they could in turn validate this informat ion with the desk managersschedulers We had this approach with Nomlogic and having Clarissa work the issues worked quite nicely Who ever you choo se we would need about of their time for now Later on with coordina tion efforts and testing it may go up to I dont see that happening for a while though The sooner we get someone to devote to this the better off we will be I expect these changes that well be looking into should improve performance quite a bit That being said weve identified three items that would speed up processin g the retrieval of Path Manager Currently the Path Manager attempts to reuse Path Ids I cant think of any reason why we need to perform this extra step It runs through th is processing on the application and generally doesnt find a match I kno w Patti has mentioned this several times and I cant think of a valid reaso n for performing this work I talked with Dave Nommensen and according to him what used to happen is that sometimes schedulers would get duplicate paths out there which is why they put this code in place From a schedul ing perspective my understanding of what your main concern is to just main tain your position and be able to change it If you were overpathed youd see it in the Path Manager either way Pinion Richard To restate the question for clarity in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply mar ket and a service adds any updownstream contract information andor Duns or DRN override and then saves it Unify looks for an old path with those exact variables and if it finds it reuses it and if it does not find an ex act match creates a new path and path id I had been told that to do away with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since any path once nominated on could not be deleted Has this changed At o ne time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path activity number match for nominations Texas Eastern was the only pipeline that ne eded the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they wer e used I spoke with Chris Ordway and the new LINK system no longer needs this to occur Transco uses activity numbers but uses the Activity number cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected Therefore if it does not create a space or memory problem for Unify I dont think that this constant old path look up is needed Kinsey Lisa Get rid of this The scheduling position window does anyone use this If not well r emove the code logic that populates this window I have never seen a sched uler use this Please verify Pinion Richard Originally such a window was in use by everyone in the legacy system Autonoms so it was duplicate d in Unify by request It is not used in Unify now because of the other so phisticated tools Unify provides which obviate its use The only value wo uld be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are o ther ways to determine those problems As voted on in a previous meeting o f the managers Lose it Kinsey Lisa Why is this still here On the inventory pool list does anyone need to see the Contarct Refere nces List Again this code is called every retrieval time and doesnt app ear to be used from my observations If they do need this information we could provide it but if not Id prefer to remove the functionality Pin ion Richard This function is still very much in use by those with poin t based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pat hed through the same contract imbalance pool Keep it Kinsey Lisa Ye s We use this functionality a lot when pathing pools When pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths whats the aver age number of paths they create at one time What about updates I know t hat ANR and NIGAS are big users of this feature since they have small packa ges of gas that they are limited in size to Does the system seem faster w hen you update one record at a time or chunks of records My real question is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both Updates and Inserts By update I mean going to the path list and changing an upstre am downstream contract or a PSNA which in turn forces a new path to be cr eated Pinion Richard This one to many or many to one pathing goes on every day on every pipeline There is no average They typically updat e a path with updownstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time how ever I hope this answers your question I see no change to this process at this time Kinsey Lisa On some pipes this function is used more than others When it is used we try and do as many paths as possible At this time I do not see a need to change this process On brokered paths do you want to utilize the same logic we have for Se rvice In other words when updating Brokered arrangements we dont incor porate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangm ent link and hence sending it to be renominated Why do we do this for ser vice Is it because we have to renominate it I assume thats what its f or since we dont send brokered paths to the pipe Anyway with the Nomlog ic implmentation two way interface we were planning on having it behave the same way as service We need this verified Pinion Richard We do nt perform the same logic for Brokered paths because these are not nominat ed to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pi peline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path I dont see a need to change the way Brokered paths are behaving at this time Kinsey Lisa Agree with Richard
