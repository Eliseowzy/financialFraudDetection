December GMT Subject This is long but its damn funny Just keep reading Id love to know who wrote it Goose did you pen this A chronology of events for Saturday December and the early morning hours of Sunday December Arise play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at fullfreaking blast Get in car drive to New Braunfels Tee off me and a buddy were the FIRST teetime of the morning Turn crack open first beer Crack open second beer Crack openyou get the idea Finish holes as well as beers sign scorecard for smoooooth Headed for San Antonio Buy three packs for pre and postgame festivities We decide we dont have enough booze so we doubleback to a liquor store and buy the good ol ml plastic bottle Traveler Jim Beam Arrive at the tailgate spot Awesome day Not a single cloud in the sky About degrees I decide that were going to kick the shit out of Nebraska I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome Were on the second floor of a twostory parking garage on the corner a couple hundred of us Were hooting and hollering like wildmen The band doubles back to the street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of Texas AWESOME MOMENT In the postserenade serendipity grown men are bumping chests with one another each and every one of them now secure and certain of the fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome Again we hoot and holler like wildmen Again the band doubles back and stops right below us to serenade us this time however with the Nebraska fight songs Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve we remain convinced that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska I begin the walk to the Alamodome somehow managing to stuff the Traveler and cans of beer into my pants I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans They are taunting me I am taunting back still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play what I now call and will forever be remembered as CellPhone Flop Out Remember flop out for a dollar The rules are similar I tell this Nebraska jackass that if hes so confident in his team he should flop out his cell phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta Bowl And then I spoke these memorable words And not those damn refundable tickets either You request those nonrefundable nontransferrable sonsofbitches He backs down He is unworthy I call Southwest Airlines and buy two tickets to Phoenix nonrefundable and nontransferrable Price He is humbled He lowers his head in shame I raise my cell phone in triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans I am KING and these are my subjects I distribute the beers in my pants to the cheering masses I RULE the pregame kingdom Kickoff Brimming with confidence I open the Traveler and pour my first stiffy I notice something troubling Nebraska is big Nebraska is fast Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas The first quarter mercifully ends yards total offense for Texas Zero first downs for Texas Im still talking shit I pour another stiffy from the Traveler Four minutes to go in the first half the Traveler is a dead soldier I buy my first beer from the Alamodome merchants While I am standing in line a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the end zone Safety Halftime score Nebraska Texas I wish I had another Traveler While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime I attempt to revive the classic Briceism from the South Bend bathroom Hey buddy niiiiiiiiice cock He is unamused I buy my nd and rd beer from the Alamodome merchants I share my beer with two high school girls sitting behind me Surprisingly they are equipped with a flask full of vodka I send them off to purchase Sprites so that we may consume their vodka I have not lost faith Nebraska is a bunch of pussies No more vodka The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives I purchase two more beers from the Alamodome merchants Score is Nebraska Texas I am beginning to lose faith This normally would trouble me but I am too drunk to see the football field I call Southwest Airlines Im sorry sir Those tickets have been confirmed and are nonrefundable and nontransferrable I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter As it turns out the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when there is less than minutes on the game clock I am enraged by this policy I ask loudly Why the fuck didnt you announce last call over the fucking PA system Back in my seats I am slumped in my chair in defeat All of a sudden the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts Whazzis I mutter awaking from my coma Iz we winnig Did wez scort Alas the answer is no we were not winning and we did not score The largest by far cheer of the day from the Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters S K and A in the Nebraska spelled out in their end zone I cheer wildly I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it I am thirsty Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck I would taunt them with some offcolor remarks about their parentage but I am too drunk to form complete sentences With my last cognitive thought of the evening I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in October they would be playing Florida State for the national championship Back in the car On the way back to Austin for the TexasArizona tip off We can still salvage the day I crack open a beer It is warm I dont care We have stopped for gas I am hungry I go inside the store I walk past the beer frig I notice a Zima Ive never had a Zima I wonder if its any good I pull a Zima from the frig I twist the top off and drink the Zima in three swallows Zima sucks I replace the empty bottle in the frig There is a Blimpie Subs in the store I walk to where the ingredients are where the person usually makes the sub There is no one there I lean over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives I eat them I am still hungry I lean further over the counter and grab approximately two pounds of Pastrami I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami The patrons in the store fear me I dont care We are in South Austin I have been drinking warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour My truckmate is tired of my singing He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good songs besides Youre Going to Miss Me When Im Gone and Neon Moon and that maybe listening to only those two songs ten times each was a bit excessive Perhaps he suggests I could just let the CD play on its own I tell him to fuck off and restart Neon Moon We arrive at the Erwin Center My truckmate against my loud and profane protestations parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage I tell him hes an idiot I tell him we will never get out I tell him we may as well pitch a fucking tent here He ignores me I think hes still pissed about the Brooks and Dunn tunes I whistle Neon Moon loudly I am rallying I have warm beers stuffed in my pants Were going to kick the shit out of Arizona Halftime score Texas Arizona I am pleased I go to the bathroom to pee for the th time today I giggle to myself because of the new opportunity to do the bathroom Brice There are no Arizona fans in the bathroom I am disappointed I tell myself out loud that I have a Niiiiiice cock No one is amused but me I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can Needless to say they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center much less Bud Light out of a can I am stopped by an usher Where did you get that sir I tell him no shit Oh the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little plastic footballs Would you mind throwing this away for me I take the last swig and hand it to him He is confused I pretend Im going to the bathroom but I run away giggling instead I duck into some entrance to avoid the usher who is now pursuing me I sneak into a large group of people and sit down The usher walks by harmlessly I am giggling like a little girl I crack open another can of Bud Light I am lost In my haste to avoid the usher I have lost my bearings I have no ticket stub I cannot find my seats Texas is losing Texas is being screwed by the refs I am enraged I have cleared out the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the surrounding chairs with it A concerned fan asks if Im OK and perhaps I shouldnt take it so seriously I tell him to fuck off After the fourth consecutive worst fucking call I have EVER seen I attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects However on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid leaving a onequarter inch gash over my eye I am now bleeding into my left eye and all over my shirt Perhaps I think to myself Im taking this a bit seriously I am standing in the bathroom peeing Im so drunk I am swaying and grunting I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye My pants are bloody I have my formerly white shirt wrapped around my waist I look like I should be in an episode of Cops Texas has lost I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make my way for the exits I am stopped every seconds by a good samaritancopsecurity guard to ask me why I am covered in blood but I merely grunt incoherently and keep moving With my one good eye I have located the parking garage I walk up six flights of stairs promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the face for making me walk up six flights of stairs find the truck and collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck I look around and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving I take a nap I awake from my nap I see my friend in the drivers seat I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving I am too tired to punch my friend I call my friend a Stupid cocksucker I lift my head

of beer I jump from the truck and go from vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers I am happy I return to my vehicle We have emerged from the parking facility We make our way to my apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him We are all going to die tonight We have finished threequarters of the bottle of Glenlivet We decide it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsthers Ed has to pee He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length mirror at the end of the hall smashing it into hundreds of pieces We giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsthers The PollyEsthers doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter his club Fellas he says in between his fits of spastic laughter Ive been working this door for almost a year Ive been working doors in this town for almost years And I can honestly say that I aint never seen three drunker mother fuckers
