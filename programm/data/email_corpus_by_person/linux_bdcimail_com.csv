desktop Dear Wincenty Kaminski Todays focus Will Linux be a hit or miss on the corporate desktop By Phil Hochmuth So far this year the buzz about Linux in enterprise networks has focused on servers and embedded systems with the growth of Linux severs being most heralded According to IDC a research firm based in Framingham Mass Linux was the fastestgrowing server operating system last year with a growth rate over the year before Linux was the second mostshipped operating system in after Windows NT capturing of new licenses shipped As for the embedded market Linux has emerged as an ideal platform for network appliances because the system can be modified to handle specialized dedicated tasks very well Companies such as Cobalt Networks Picazo and Progressive Systems have announced Linuxbased appliances ranging from Web servers to PBXs to firewalls But what of the open source hackers dream of Linux on every desktop Sure Linux on the desktop has become more accessible than ever with colorful shrinkwrapped boxes of Caldera Red Hat and Corel Linux now available at places like CompUSA However analysts have said that Linuxs growth in the enterprise will be limited to the macro and micro areas of network servers and embedded operating systems According to IDC Linux currently runs on only of US desktops The hold Microsoft Windows has on the desktop market will remain strong analysts say despite such factors as Microsofts antitrust problems and the surging popularity of Linux Even some Linux executives are skeptical of their products desktop future Recently SuSE CEO Roland Dyroff downplayed Linuxs future on desktops Dyroff said given the lack of applications available we really cant claim it as being competitive on the desktop yet A recent survey by Surveycom gives more hope for Linux desktops According to the survey of enterprise network managers open source operating systems are used on of desktops with the number jumping to a surprising of enterprise desktops by Despite the mix of numbers being thrown around two important factors that will determine the success of Linux as an enterprise client desktop are a standardized easytouse graphical user interface GUI and available applications One company that is working to make Linux more user friendly is Palo Altobased Eazel which is designing a nextgeneration file management system and user interface to run on top of the Linux kernel According to Eazels Web site the companys goal is to bring Linux to the mass es and do it in a way that appeals to todays Linux users and to mere mortals The company was founded by a group of former Apple executives and is allied with the Gnome project which has been doing extensive Linux desktop environment development for several years Eazel is due to have a product out by the middle of this year With an intuitive iconbased file management environment Eazel is hoping its user interface will be an improvement over the two current Linux GUIs Gnome and KDE and will help standardized the look and feel of Linux for regular users For enterprise mangers who have already embraced Linux on the server side this development will be worth keeping an eye on On the applications side several office productivity suites have been available for some time such as Suns StarOffice suite and KOffice for the KDE desktop Corel has also ported its office products such as WordPerfect over to Linux to complement its own distribution of the operating system While there have been recent rumors started by Linux Care Vice President Arthur Tyde that Microsoft is working on a port of MS Office to Linux Microsoft officials deny this While Linux may never supplant Windows as the industrystandard desktop there should be plenty of opportunity for Linux PCs in

year with a growth rate over the year before Linux was the second mostshipped operating system in after Windows NT capturing of new licenses shipped As for the embedded market Linux has emerged as an ideal platform for network appliances because the system can be modified to handle specialized dedicated tasks very well Companies such as Cobalt Networks Picazo and Progressive Systems have announced Linuxbased appliances ranging from Web servers to PBXs to firewalls But what of the open source hackers dream of Linux on every desktop Sure Linux on the desktop has become more accessible than ever with colorful shrinkwrapped boxes of Caldera Red Hat and Corel Linux now available at places like CompUSA However analysts have said that Linuxs growth in the enterprise will be limited to the macro

analysts say despite such factors as Microsofts antitrust problems and the surging popularity of Linux Even some Linux executives are skeptical of their products desktop future Recently SuSE CEO Roland Dyroff downplayed Linuxs future on desktops Dyroff said given the lack of applications available we really cant claim it as being competitive on the desktop yet A recent survey by Surveycom
