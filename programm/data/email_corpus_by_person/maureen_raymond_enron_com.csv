Pushkar Stuart III William Port David Go rte David Zipter Rudi Buy Rick Kaminski Vince J CcRaymond Maureen SubjectENA Research Argentina default and devaluation risk rises Bra zil feels the effects of the contagion Date July From Maureen RaymondCastaneda Gwyn Koepke We believe that the risk of an Argentine debt default has increased and pes o devaluation risk has also risen substantially in the last several days Due to recent economic and fiscal developments in Argentina we believe Argentina lacks the fiscal and monetary maneuverability to lift itself out of a year recession exacerbated by a global slowdown and a strong peso Argentinas fiscal position has weakened substantially due to economic we akness that limits government revenue receipts needed to balance the fiscal deficit and pay off the countrys debt service A loss of investor confid ence has caused spreads to widen despite Argentinas need to rollover about bn of shortterm Letes Argentine government debt by the end of the yea r Yields paid at this weeks Treasury auction are at levels that are not sustainable over the mediumterm Threemonth Treasury yields are versus paid at auction on June and on June In addition to suffering from widening yields Argentina was forced to shorten the teno r of debt from a mix of month and year bonds issued previously to only month securities at this weeks auction due to increased risk aversion to longerterm government paper by local investors pension funds and banks The sharp increase in Letes yields and the inability to issue longer mat urities is highly indicative of the difficulty the Argentine government wi ll have in rolling over bn in shortterm paper over the remainder of the year at sustainable rates which further weakens its fiscal position due to higher interest payments The recession has been exacerbated by the strong peso caused by the persist ently strong US dollar which has hurt Argentinas export competitiveness e specially visavis the Brazilian real that has depreciated about relat ive to the USD since the beginning of the year As a result to these facto rs we believe the risks of Argentine debt default and peso devaluation are mounting Argentina is increasingly vulnerable to a run on the banking system Argen tines are switching from peso to dollar deposits Argentinas limited fore x reserves constrain the central banks ability to support the peso if pri vate sector deposits are withdrawn or converted into US dollars Private sector deposits of bn are pesodenominated or bn and are f oreign currencydenominated deposits which dwarf Argentinas official fore x reserves of bn Total private sector deposits fell about bn from bn to bn between February and endApril this year before stabiliz ing at bn as of July th Political uncertainty is very high and throws into serious doubt Economic M inister Cavallos ability to win opposition support for a new fiscal auster ity program announced late yesterday Cavallo needs to win approval for hi s fiscal agenda not only at the national level but also at the provincial level which will not be easy considering the year contraction Failure to gain this support to cutback spending will worsen Argentinas fiscal woe s and cause a further deterioration of investor confidence These external and internal pressures leave the exchange rate vulnerable to speculative attack and threaten the to dollar peg especially in light of the countrys limited foreign exchange reserves Today Argentinas month NDF traded at P implying risk of a devaluation while yester day the month NDF traded at P implying an increased probability of devaluation since yesterday Also today the year NDF traded at i mplying a devaluation As a result of these above internal and externa l pressures we believe the risk of peso devaluation has increased substant ially The danger of a steep devaluation is that private sector firms that hold do llardenominated debt and are long pesos and short dollars will suffer from sharply higher debt payments This could cripple an already tenuous econo mic situation by causing a further deterioration in government revenue thro ugh lower tax receipts Developments in Argentina impact Brazil through main channels Currency Volatility Contagion from Argentina has lead to a substantially w eaker Brazilian real Triggered by a general sell off of Argentine stocks bonds
