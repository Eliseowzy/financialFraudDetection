company now has just short of billion in debt and billion in cash including the billion line of credit the company drew down this summer In this the last year of the network buildout it will spend another billion on capex in the fourth quarter plus make interest payments of approximately million Assuming the worst possible case zero EBITDA in the fourth quarter and no IRU swaps at all to lay off some of the capex GX would end the year with billion in cash With completion of the network next years capex budget drops some percent to only billion which is approximately equal to cash on hand at the beginning of the year in this worst case scenario But unlike this years capex budget much of next years is variable consisting of the labor and equipment needed to light up lambda capacity for immediate sale or to provide Internet services No sales no capex or at least a lot less In addition the company needs to come up with million in interest payments How daunting is this Last year recurring adjusted EBITDA was billion In the first half of alone GX sold billion in IRUs at margins around percent Even in the disastrous third quarter GX sold million in IRUs Next year it could make its interest payments and get through the year even if the entire business IRUs and all should shrink by percent in the face of still booming Internet traffic Forbes and the market are assuming World War III But with World War III Global Crossing could cut out half its capex and pile up cash by selling assets Planned asset sales including IPC and Global Marine the undersea cable laying group for which there are already buyers lining up should produce somewhere between million and billion leaving GXs cash position at the beginning of better than Ultimately for GX to succeed IRU sales must come back and the global Internet services business must take off with GX winning contracts from Forbes customers as the primary or secondary carrier not just a few goodwill gambits tossed to the new kid on the block Grim as it seems now the IRU sales side is the most likely place for good news next year in part because the Internet business while growing percent a year is still relatively small Expecting total traffic growth of percent this year the worlds carriers built their inventories accordingly a year or more ago The recession intervened overall traffic growth was closer to percent inventories clogged carriers did everything possible to cut costs and IRU sales fell off a cliff Today however most major carriers are running their networks at percent of capacity or more This rate is much too high for comfort for the bursty Internet data that is the target of Global Crossings IP network The Internet today is around percent of the total growing four times faster than the rest of the business But in the telopolies the bandwidth buyers are still playing chicken looking for bargains from next generation carrier sellers desperate for revenue Sellers including GX last quarter have begun to say no Even with modest percent a year traffic growth the sellers that survive must eventually have their way almost certainly before the end of next year From the Gilder Technology Report

York Times columnist Paul Krugman Excess capacity too much capital is a drag on investment and hence a drag on the economy as a whole Business investment will rebound he casually assumes but to solve the investment problem in the meantime we should promote spending Leo Hindery Jr the former CEO of Global Crossing an international fiber optic network agrees The problem with overcapacity is it doesnt just ravage profit and loss statements but it ravages banks and employment he told Bloomberg Tax cuts that make me more wealthy are absurdSo Im more interested in consumption rising almost everywhere Why do we hear this common refrain from friends on both the left and the right from politicians businessmen and even most economists It seems Alan Greenspans irrational exuberance stuck in our brains and was never purged by the evidence of real productivity gains and wealth creation in the late s Now with the economy more than a year into a slowdown Washington and Wall Street have seized on the agile chairmans permission to blame business first The problem with Paul and Leos take is scarcely anything but investment and entrepreneurship matter to future growth Find out how read

beings had been burned at stakes monarchs had been dethroned and countries torn apart because imperfection wasnt enough From the Inquisition to the Reformation religious fanatics had demanded that the state enforce holiness truth and virtue Those who resisted were exterminated Moreover the power and status of rulers derived from their own perfection Kings and queens commanded artists to portray them as demigods Dissenters were not merely troublemakers they were direct threats to the perfect order of the modern state This was a political order in which everything had to be perfectly arranged

and subscribers Issue January HEADLINES The Week Bull or Bear in Friday Feature hangs on these Friday Bonus Internet Traffic Still Tripling Storewidth Update Poll Question Bull or Bear in Readings Subscribe Unsubscribe Information THE WEEK Bull or Bear in By Jude Wanniski When I advised against holding equities early in with the Dow Jones Industrial Average at or so my bearishness pivoted on the monetary deflation I knew almost certainly the incoming George W Bush administration would not address The economic players assembled by the President had very definite ideas on what they planned to do but ending the monetary deflation could not have been in their plans They did not even know of its existence My moderate bullishness for as a whole is based solely on my belief that the administration has been impressed that neither their demandside tax cuts putting money into peoples pockets nor Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspans eleven cuts in overnight interest rates seems to be working as intended In addition I strongly suspect there are now enough people who never did have great faith in that program in a position to surface with fresh ideas If the economy is to emerge from recession fresh ideas will be needed All the happy talk we hear about the economic rebound that lies ahead in the first or second or third quarter comes from many of the same people who a year ago believed the tax cuts and rate cuts would have the stock market and economy booming by now If they do not understand the mechanics of a monetary deflation their opinions will not be terribly useful Their fresh ideas will be no better than those that failed if they do not see that the dollar has become too strong relative to gold and commodities and must be devalued by roughly Investors are not really interested in whether the economy comes out of recession or not They want to know if the value of financial assets will rise or fall and then make their investments accordingly It is possible for the stock market to decline even as the real economy increases in the production of goods and services In other words the statistics about Gross Domestic Product that govern the definition of recession may very well rise at some point in but without creating any excitement on Wall Street Remember one of the biggest years for GDP in the last century was a really dreadful year but statistically a smidgeon better than Think of it this way If economic output falls in one calendar year and then grows in the following year there is not much reason for celebrating If your wage falls from per week to per week you will not really be that happy if in the following year it rises to The numbers we are looking at are not as bad as that but if policymakers do not deal with the monetary deflation sooner rather than later the DJIAs valiant struggle to stay above will be fruitless If the dollargold price hangs around exactly where it was before the Fed began reeling off those eleven cuts in the fed funds rate the DJIA will have to give up a thousand points during the year Early in with gold at we reckoned the DJIA would find itself around by the end of March It got to that level earlier in September but only because of the increased risks associated with the terrorist attacks We did become bullish that the DJIA would rebound as those risks dissolved but noted we would still confront the deflation limiting any upside Our primary job is to get the direction of the markets right not to pinpoint the various equity indices But we certainly would not be surprised to see

in the spirit of we cant get better until we know whats wrong with us let us lay the patient out on the table and behold the odd even contradictory symptoms of malaise The US appears to be awash in liquidity At years end its people and institutions held a record trillion in cash and money market funds Yet the economy is hip deep in its worst downturn since Capital spending and investment have slowed to a trickle yet consumer spending remains oddly robust The Federal Reserve in spiked the money supply by Yet the dollar has remained curiously strong against other currencies and practically every commodity What the heck is going on Is our economic sickness a result of contraction or deflation Huge question The answer policymakers decide upon may determine the outcome of Experts can argue the facts either way and they have Most supplysiders such as Steve Forbes George Gilder Jude Wanniski David Malpass and Brian Wesbury as well as a few exotics such as Paul Krugman have made the case for deflation Others including Milton Friedman James Grant and the Bush Administration say the slowdown is owed to a good oldfashioned contraction resulting from loose money and overexpansion during the champagne years Whether the US economy is afflicted principally by a contraction or deflation is literally a trilliondollar question If its contraction the economy will recover on its own without further Fed intervention In fact it may have begun to do so already But if the problem is deflation as I suspect it is look out We are in for a longer siege for as long as it takes the Fed to counter

Readings Subscribe Unsubscribe Information THE WEEK A Corporate Crime Wave By George Gilder The Wall Street Journal January Crime may have declined in the streets but by the recent inflammation of the pundits you would think there has been an outbreak of corporate criminality The Internet communications and stockmarket booms of the s it seems were based on a pervasive series of felonious acts A wide array of businesses from Global Crossing to Loral from General Electric to Enron artfully inflated the worth of their shares through the creation of Potemkin businesses If you believe the news coverage corporate leaders are racing to despoil mulct defraud poison pillage and ruin their own businesses their nations soils and waters their retirement funds and the world economy This flood of factitious crimes this parade of snaffled fat cats and scapegoats happens every recession Rather than ruing economic reverses as effects of public policy errors and miscalculations public officials turn the tables and treat bankruptcy and crash as culpable schemes of particular whitecollar criminals Some of these alleged crime lords are familiar Gary Winnick was party to a previous potlatch at Drexel Burnham where he played a key role in financing the communications infrastructure through MCI Telecommunications Inc Turner broadcasting and McCaw Cellular Then he and his associates were alleged to have ravaged savings and loans by inducing some of them to buy those companies highyield securities before a government ban briefly destroyed their value Finally Mr Winnick boldly launched the worldwide fiberoptic networks of Global Crossing with it is implied the intention of bilking investors and crashing bandwidth prices in what Fortune calls perhaps the greatest executive ripoff in

for Economic Divination It was a rough year to be an economic forecaster Few economists anticipated a fullfledged recession Fewer still expected the aggressive response of the Federal Reserve that sent shortterm interest rates to their lowest level in years Then the Sept terror attacks occurred forcing everyone to revise their forecasts all over again But for a small group of bearish economists everything seems to have gone as expected leading them to the top spots in The Wall Street Journals economicforecasting survey for Atop the pack was Brian Wesbury chief economist at Griffin Kubik Stephens Thompson a Chicago investment bank that specializes in fixedincome securities Long before the National Bureau of Economic Research finally declared last month that the US had fallen into recession in March Mr Wesbury had factored recession into his forecasts He called for meager economic growth in the first half of and then a contraction by the third quarter As it turns out he was right on What the Journal forgot to mention of course is Brians other perch chief economist of The American Spectator Brians columns are everything we want from the otherwise dismal science sharp solidly backed and infused with the deeper wisdom of the supply side Brian brings political wits as well he was chief economist for the Joint Economic Committee of Congress during the epic budget battles with the Clinton White House And now hes got a years worth of bragging rights By the way last years rampage notwithstanding Brian for the longterm is among the biggest bulls around which is another reason we like him In the Journals survey hes one of only five economists out of fifty polled to peg the potential longterm US productivity growth at greater than three percent PS The

Broadband Readings Conference Calendar Subscribe Unsubscribe Information THE WEEK The Evolution of Digital Design Why are PLD companies like Altera ALTR and Xilinx XLNX on our list while ASIC companies like LSI Logic LSI are not In electronic design applicationspecific integrated circuits ASICs connote high performance high density and low cost for highvolume uses Think DVD player Programmable logic devices PLDs connote flexibility low performance and high cost for prototyping Think latest Cisco CSCO router Continuous improvements in PLDs raise their performance and lower their cost increasing the uses for which PLDs and ASICs compete ASIC vendors are adding programmable logic to their chips The PLD vendors are adding hard macros Are these businesses converging Or are companies like Altera and LSI Logic practicing diworsification Altera a PLD company is making chips that cant be changed and LSI Logic an ASIC company is making chips that can be changed What strategy will dominate Well develop the insight to answer these questions by tracing the evolution of digital design from the introduction of integrated circuit building blocks IC macros Each technology wave changes the designers job As Moores law drives more transistors onto the chip the design process changes The productivity and the skills of the designers change The level of abstraction for the engineer changes By level of abstraction I mean the units that are the building blocks for the translation of the written specification into the physical hardware In the early days of digital design the level of abstraction was the inverter and the AND gate Working with inverters and AND gates was simpler and quicker than designing with individual transistors resistors capacitors and other discrete components As I trace the evolution of digital design Ill point out changes in the design process designer productivity engineering skills level of abstraction verification and debug methods and changes in the flexibility and capability of the end systems That was the lead for the newest Dynamic Silicon report written by Nick Tredennick and Brion Shimamoto Posted this week for subscribers

from upgrading to broadband In times of national emergency as with the horror of the terror assault on New York and Washington communications capacity is rapidly overloaded The vast potential of broadband optics is the best way to obviate the need for such rationing Just a few tidbits from the new report Broadband or Bust Networking Society to Accelerate Economic Growth written by George
