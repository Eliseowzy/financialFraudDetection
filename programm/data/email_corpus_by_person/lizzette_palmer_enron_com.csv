Jon London Subject FW Data privacy policy and intragroup agreement Jon Please see the note below which is the result of a brief hour review by CC Somewhat predictably the main conclusion of the review is that becau se we havent followed the model contract relating to data transfers publis hed by the EC we may not have adequately safeguarded employees position s especially since we missed bits out changed the emphasis from time to ti me and accorded ourselves rights not otherwise envisaged by the master cont ract Fundamantal points seem to be we give no rights to employees to sue under the contract we seem to be confused as to whether we are getting consent from employees or relying on the model contract as we seem to be suggesting that we will d o both we dont make it clear what we are doing with other data other than employ ee date and dont deal with sensitive data we impose a burden on Corp to comply with the contract and the laws of the exporter whch is a double whammy we dont expressly deal with international transfers we have missed a whole host of provisions out from the Model Contract we can change the uses for which employee data is used How do you want to take this forward Sarah Original Message From Lawrence liffordChancecom mailtoLawrence liffordChancecom Sent September To Gregory Sarah Subject Data privacy policy and intragroup agreement Dear Sarah Further to our correspondence earlier this week you asked me to look at th e documentation that you sent me from a data privacy perspective As reque sted I set out below what I believe are the significant issues in relation to the relevant documents Preface to policy In relation to the Prefatory Statement To Employee Data Protection P olicy I note that this prefatory statement and the associated policy relat e only to employee data and it is therefore unclear what steps Enron is tak ing in respect of other data The last paragraph on the first page of the prefatory statement state s that we are implementing the Employee Data Protection Policy attached to this Preface in an effort to assure employees and the appropriate regulato ry agencies that we have in place data protections that are comparable to t hose mandated by the Directive and other similar data protection laws En rons obligation is to ensure that it complies with applicable data protect ion laws To the extent that the policy only relates to employee data it w ill not satisfy regulatory authorities or others that Enron is complying wi th data protection laws in respect of any other data Policy In relation to the policy itself this does not identify or require e mployees to comply in a comprehensive way with the various data protection principles under the UK Act or the Directive Where principles are reflect ed the relevant provisions are on occasion slightly misleading For examp le the policy says that data is kept as long as necessary The relevant data protection principle is that data should not be kept for longer than is necessary a difference in emphasis It seems to me that the policy i s seeking largely to fulfil the requirement that individuals employees in this case are properly informed of the processing of their data This req uires Enron to inform individuals of the data controller or its representa tive the purposes of processing and any other information to enable the p rocessing to be fair In this regard section identifies the purposes of processing employee data Have checks been made to ensure this is an accu rate and reasonably comprehensive description of the purposes for which emp loyee data are processed Section of the policy states that Enron companies do not access sen sitive data in making employment decisions described in i and ii of s ection To what extent is any sensitive employee data processed by Enron and to what extent have any notices or consents been given or obtained in relation to such data In relation to the consent sought in section this does not clearly seek consent to international transfers of data The policy also seeks to deem consent stating that by continuing as an employee of an Enron Company the employee agrees to the use of his or her data as described in the pol icy It is unclear whether such a deemed consent would be effective To w hat extent is it possible to seek employees actual consent eg as part o f an annual agreement by employees to abide by applicable group codes of co nduct guidelines or policies In relation to section this provides that Enron may expand the use s to which employee data is put as described in this policy Unless employ ees are properly informed of or aware of any such changes it is unlikely t hat any such changes will be lawful In relation to section this states that we have not established g eneral guidelines for the use disclosure and retention of personal data O bviously the purposes for which we will process personal data the type of personal data in question and relevant regulatory requirements will guide us in such matters It is unclear what the purpose of this wording is bea ring in mind that it would not offer any comfort to regulators that applica ble data protection laws are being complied with From an employees persp ective it is not very informative In the second paragraph in section the policy provides that each i ndividual who is retained by an Enron Company is responsible for ensuring t hat he or she takes into account the principles established by this policy As mentioned above the policy does not clearly address all relevant princ iples identified in the Directive Master Agreement The master data protection agreement only relates to intragroup tran sfers of employee data What is happening in relation to transfers of othe r data To the extent that consents by employees to processing and internatio nal transfer of their data have been or can be obtained eg through emplo yees agreeing to a policy that addresses this issue and then this document would not be necessary as relevant conditions permitting international tra nsfers would have been satisfied To what extent can employees consents b e obtained to international transfers The provisions in this document appear to be based on the European EU model contract However they do not cover all the relevant provisions of the model contract and to the extent that relevant provisions are covered they tend to be paraphrased in slightly inconsistent ways As a result t he question is to what extent can this document be relied on to ensure ade quate safeguards The EU decision adopting to the model contract states t hat the scope of this Decision is limited to establishing that the clauses in the Annex may be used by a controller established in the Community in o rder to adduce adequate safeguards within the meaning of article ii of Directive EC The Decision does not state that similar terms adopt ed by particular entities will also offer adequate safeguards The more th at the Master Agreement differs from the EU model contract the less certai nly an entity can have that there are adequate safeguards in place Although many provisions in the model contract have been paraphrased in the Master Agreement I could not find provisions in the Master Agreemen t corresponding with a number of provisions in the model contract for exam ple clauses b e and of the model contract an d the detailed description of the processing in Appendix of the model co ntract In relation to Appendix it is unclear where the following are r eflected Appendix paragraph the various information requirements i n paragraph a and paragraphs and of Appendix In relation to the Data Importer is Enron Corp the only relevant data importer of employee data from Europe In relation to the definitions in the master data protection agreemen t it is unclear why this does not use the same definition as the model con tract For example the definition of data processor identifies relevan t entities that are not a member of the corporate group Why are Enron C orporate Group membersexcluded from the definition of data processors The master data protection agreement does not address the question of sensitive data and no definition of sensitive data is included Are any s ensitive data transferred In relation to section e this lists again the various purposes of processing employee data The description of relevant processing should p resumably track the description in the policy to which Enron Group companie s are bound It is therefore unclear why it is necessary to list again the various purposes of employee processing rather than simply crossreferring to the policy Paragraph f states that data exporter will be responsible for obta ining any necessary consents from the data subjects with respect of the pro cessing of personal data To the extent that consents are obtained they sh ould also cover international transfers of data To the extent that approp riate consents to the international transfer of data is obtained then this agreement is unnecessary Again therefore the question is to what extent c onsents to international transfer of data by employees can be or will be ob tained Clause g provides that the purposes for which data may be processe d can be expanded and that the data importer will endeavour to inform the d ata exporter of additional purposes of using such data This does not conf orm with the strict purpose limitation in paragraph of appendix of th e model contract Whereas clause b of the model contract entitles importers to eithe r abide by the principles identified in the model contract or the laws of t he data exporter which need to be annexed to the contract the master agr eement addresses both these requirements see in particular paragraph b As a result to this extent it imposes a potentially higher standard tha n that required by the model contract How does Enron Corp propose to comp ly with the laws of multiple countries as per clause b Clause b provides that the data processor will observe the obliga tions of a data controller this might mean for example that a data proce ssor needs to register for data protection purposes with applicable data pr otection regulators What legal obligation is this clause seeking to addre ss The above comments are based on the UK Act however it is likely that simila r obligations will apply in other jurisdictions In light of the above the key issues are as follows To what extent is it possible to obtain consents from employees to in ternational transfers To the extent this is possible then it is likely th at an intragroup agreement will not be necessary To the extent that such an agreement is necessary we would normally suggest that this is done substantially on the terms of the model contract To the extent that the relevant terms differ from the model contract then there is a risk that the relevant provisions do not offer adequate safegu ards as provided by the Commission decision If however Enron proposes t o make transfers under the terms of the master agreement then I would sugge st the master agreement should be reviewed in detail so as to ensure that t o the fullest extent possible it accurately reflects all the relevant prov isions of the model contract more closely in particular in relation to rig hts of relevant data subjects to enforce the contract as a party to it Please do not hesitate to contact me if you would like to discuss this furt her Yours sincerely Lawrence Milner This message and any attachment are confidential and may be
