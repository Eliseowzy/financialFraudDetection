near Port Huron on oil since last December Fears of winter shortages drove natural gas futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange to a record per million British thermal units in late December more than quadruple the yearearlier price This year prices have fallen below partly because last years rally caused so many generators and industrial customers to seek alternate fuels such as oil Saving Money Fuel can account for more than percent of a power plants operating costs according to some estimates Mild weather across the US this spring has reduced demand for gas to heat homes and power air

as Prices Fall Outlook New York Power Plants Returning to Natural Gas as Prices Fall Outlook Palatka Florida June Bloomberg Natural gas is burning again at Florida Power Light Cos Putnam power plant in Palatka Last winter Floridas largest utility reconfigured the plant to run on fuel oil instead of natural gas a cleanerburning fuel that for years had been comparatively cheap Last month as gas prices plunged to a month low the plant switched back to gas Florida Power Light wasnt the only one Many electric utilities in the US are able to burn both fuels and several are making the switch to gas which is now cheaper than oil in some regions Companies such as Detroit Edison Co had been burning oil since the winter It wasnt really until the early May timeframe when gas and oil prices crossed paths and gas became cheaper that the switch was made said Gary Lapplander the companys manager of fuel supply Michigans largest electric utility had been running its megawatt Greenwood plant near Port Huron on oil since last December Fears of winter shortages drove natural gas futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange to a record per million British thermal units in late December more than quadruple the yearearlier price This year prices have fallen below partly because last years rally caused so many generators and industrial customers to seek alternate fuels such as oil Saving Money Fuel can account for more than percent of a power plants operating costs according to some estimates Mild weather across the US this spring has reduced demand for gas to heat homes and power air conditioners while record drilling in the past year has led to higher gas flows from US wells Since late March utilities have been pumping gas into underground storage at almost three times last years rate according to American Gas Association figures Fuel oil has a much different story Prices for No residual fuel oil the grade most commonly burned in power plants are linked to crude oil prices which have climbed percent this year The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has cut crude oil production twice this year after raising it four times in And refiners have been sopping up supplies in recent months to make gasoline for the summer driving season Natural gas prices at Chicagos distribution hub fell below fuel oil prices during the week ended May the first time it was cheaper in almost seven months according to Bloomberg figures Fuel oil prices in Chicago are little changed this year Its really a factor of economics said Carol Clawson a spokeswoman for Juno Beach Floridabased FPL Group Inc parent of Florida Power Light which can switch about a quarter of its power plants between gas and oil on a few hours notice We are detecting gas prices coming down and as that occurs we are going back to gas Fear of a Rally To be sure some powerplant operators may be wary of switching back to gas because of the chances for a rally this summer said Tim Evans senior energy analyst at IFR Pegasus in New York As hot weather arrives homeowners and businesses will turn up their air conditioners pushing electricity use higher and lifting gas demand Natural gas futures last summer rose percent Adding to that demand gasfired power plants with about megawatts of capacity are expected to start up this summer according to a US Energy Department report published last month Last year about megawatts of new gas plants started up boosting total US gas demand by billion cubic feet or percent A megawatt is enough to light homes Other variables in the gas market include the extent of any heat waves this summer and whether hurricanes will enter the Gulf of Mexico disrupting operations at offshore rigs that account for a quarter of US production People dont fully trust gas Evans said Theyre wondering if its going to remain the cheaper fuel or if its just going to turn around and do to them what it did last winter Still Cheaper Oil is still cheaper than gas in some regions In the New York City area where utilities dont have to pay as much to get oil delivered from tanker terminals in New York harbor heavy fuel oil costs per million Btu compared with for natural gas according to Bloomberg figures Even so the drop in gas prices has prompted Brooklyn New Yorkbased Keyspan Energy Corp to increase gass share of its total power generation to about percent said company spokesman David Manning Thats up from about percent at one point last December Normally almost all of the companys plants would be burning gas at this time of year Manning said Keyspan produces power for about million customers on Long Island Were right on the cusp of gas prices falling low enough to switch the remainder of the companys generation away from oil he said We would anticipate we will be running on gas even more this summer unless something dramatic happens with the weather Bradley Keoun in the New York newsroom or at wb Story illustration For a table comparing
