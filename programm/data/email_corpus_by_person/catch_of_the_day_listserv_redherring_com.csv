normal global search engines from Google to Inktomi crawl everything and anything Because a complete tour of the Web can take weeks these engines can miss current articles The clever part of Moreovers model is that the company is not strictly speaking in the search engine business Instead of running machines that answer queries directly it exports its index to its partners new sites and
