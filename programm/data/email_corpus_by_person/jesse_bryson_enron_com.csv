Industry Report UCS Report Highlights Importance of RPS Grants Contracts Report DOE Awards Funds for Bioenergy Development Editorials Reviews Asides BEF Grant Brings Solar Energy to Orcas Island TODAYS NEWS INDUSTRY REPORT UCS Report Highlights Importance of RPS The Union of Concerned Scientists UCS recently released a report showing how a diversified electricity mix including percent renewable energy could save California consumers up to billion and alleviate the disruptions in energy supply that have plagued Californians during the summer months The report titled Powering Ahead analyzes the economic impacts of the renewable portfolio standard RPS in California Over percent of Californias current contracts for future energy production are committed to natural gas Although the California state assembly was expected to consider RPS legislation this past week action has been postponed until the weekend when the legislators are scheduled to complete this years work California has experienced firsthand the dangers of a market dominated by volatile fossil fuels said UCS senior analyst and report author Deborah Donovan Now we have the hard numbers to prove renewable energy is beneficial for Californias economic health The state of Texas has implemented the most successful RPS to date where requirements for new renewable generation capacity have been set high enough to create a strong market for renewable project development Natural gas prices in California have been extremely volatile with price hikes to times the historical average last year However in California the Department of Water Resources which buys power for the state uses a formula that makes it difficult for wind power to participate in the market and that has stunted investment in new wind power projects UCS said that RPS are designed to help alleviate some of the burden created by statebystate legislation which creates hurdles for the widespread adoption of renewable energies Additionally RPS provides for the preservation of state jurisdiction over energy while making it easier for renewable energy technologies to penetrate the market WIND ENERGY WEEKLY GRANTS CONTRACTS REPORT DOE Awards Funds for Bioenergy Development The Department of Energy DOE recently announced that it will invest million over the next three to five years in projects intended to develop process technology to create various products using plant matter and other natural waste materials Funds will also be used to establish university education and training programs in the area of bioproducts Producing marketable industrial products out of plants saves energy saves nonrenewable resources and creates jobs said DOE secretary Spencer Abraham The bioenergy and bioproducts fields hold tremendous potential for environmentally desirable manufacturing and the creation of new jobs in the farm belt DOE said it will provide million for a project to develop the collection commercial processing and utilization of corn stover Partners in the project include Biomass AgriProducts Iowa State University Midwest Labs and Cargill Dow Private funding for the project will be million The agency noted that three education grants were awarded to establish multidisciplinary education and training for graduate students in the area of bioproducts technologies The grants will help fund the establishment of crosscutting multidisciplinary academic and research programs and provide stipends for deserving graduate students DOE will also provide million for a project focused on biomass biorefinery for production of polymers and fuel Partners in the project include Metabolix Inc the University of Tennessee the University of Central Florida and the University of Massachusetts Contact Chris Kielich DOE phone DOE RELEASE EDITORIALS REVIEWS ASIDES BEF Grant Brings Solar Energy to Orcas Island The Bonneville Environmental Foundation BEF recently announced that it has provided a grant to help add four new solar sites to the Orcas Power and Light Cooperative OPALCO Green Power program headquartered in Friday Harbor WA The provided by BEF enabled OPALCO to install solar panels at the Windermere Real Estate Building in Eastsound WA the Lopez Island Community Center the Westsound Marina and the OPALCO office This combination of utilityowned and privatelyowned sites will contribute an estimated kilowatt hours kWh of electricity a year into the electricity grid producing energy that is natural and pollutionfree while helping the islands served by OPALCO to become more self sufficient The regional interest in solar energy has quickened considerably since BEF opened its doors in said BEF president Angus Duncan OPALCO members have been among the first to show a high level of interest in power that is nonpolluting BEF said it is funding watershed projects that use solar power to pump water for cattle and irrigation while protecting streams The group was founded in to fund new
