Fred CT cc Rusty NRON Kathleen nron Lisa nronXGate Roseann nronXGate Subject Ft Pierce Attached Files I sent you and Kathleen the memo I sent to Rusty about confidentiality provisions in the FPUAFPRP project documents In regard to disclosure on Deal Bench I think you need to consider carefully the confidentiality restrictions in place under binding agreements that restrict ENAs ability to disclose contracts and other information and the need to keep certain of the attachments to the EMail that Rusty sent you confidential There are binding confidentiality provisions in place with almost every counterparty to the executed and proposed to be executed Fort Pierce project documents some with exceptions that would permit disclosure to potential assigneestransferees some without such exceptions A systematic review of the confidentiality provisions in force to ascertain the scope of the confidentiality restrictions needs to be completed before Deal Bench disclosure and to my knowledge that has not taken place Also be advised that the Fort Pierce Development Agreements are not negotiated to finality or signed and I am concerned that such disclosure at this time if FPUA learned of it could result in the deal never being signed andor a potential purchaser being misled about the terms of the FPUAFPRP transaction Apart from the foregoing considerations I have asked that the opinions and certificates attached to the EMail Rusty forwarded to you be kept strictly confidential They will change and there are matters in the certificates that we dont want advertised to FPUA on Deal Bench or otherwise Finally I am not aware of the scope of ENAs confidentiality obligations in cases when it is negotiating documents in its capacity as agent for ENext Generation LLC By copy hereof Im requesting Lisa Bills and Rose Engeldorf advise us if there are such restrictions that would limit disclosure to potential purchasers independent of the other confidentiality restrictions referred to above In short before any documents are disclosed to third parties via Deal Bench these matters need to be resolved and I frankly am too busy right now trying to get the deal with FPUA signed to make the review my priority Perhaps we should start by having Kathleen take a look at the provisions in the various executed FPRP documents to catalog the various restrictions applicable to the proposed

Fred CT cc Rusty NRON Kathleen nron Lisa nronXGate Roseann nronXGate Subject Ft Pierce Attached Files I sent you and Kathleen the memo I sent to Rusty about confidentiality provisions in the FPUAFPRP project documents In regard to disclosure on Deal Bench I think you need to consider carefully the confidentiality restrictions in place under binding agreements that restrict ENAs ability to disclose contracts and other information and the need to keep certain of the attachments to the EMail that Rusty sent you confidential There are binding confidentiality provisions in place with almost every counterparty to the executed and proposed to be executed Fort Pierce project documents some with exceptions that would permit disclosure to potential assigneestransferees some without such exceptions A systematic review of the confidentiality provisions in force to ascertain the scope of the confidentiality restrictions needs to be completed before Deal Bench disclosure and to my knowledge that has not taken place Also be advised that the Fort Pierce Development Agreements are not negotiated to finality or signed and I am concerned that such disclosure at this time if FPUA learned of it could result in the deal never being signed andor a potential purchaser being misled about the terms of the FPUAFPRP transaction Apart from the foregoing considerations I have asked that the opinions and certificates attached to the EMail Rusty forwarded to you be kept strictly confidential They will change and there are matters in the certificates that we dont want advertised to FPUA on Deal Bench or otherwise Finally I am not aware of the scope of ENAs confidentiality obligations in cases when it is negotiating documents in its capacity as agent for ENext Generation LLC By copy hereof Im requesting Lisa Bills and Rose Engeldorf advise us if there are such restrictions that would limit disclosure to potential purchasers independent of the other confidentiality restrictions referred to above In short before any documents are disclosed to third parties via Deal Bench these matters need to be resolved and I frankly am too busy right now trying to get the deal with FPUA signed to make the review my priority Perhaps we should start by having Kathleen take a look at the provisions in the various executed FPRP documents to catalog the various restrictions applicable to the proposed Deal Bench disclosure Forwarded by Barton ClarkHOUECT on PM Rusty NRON PM To Fred CT cc Ben CT Barton CT Ron CT Subject Ft Pierce Attached Files Attached below are the latest docs on Fort Pierce

December PM To Lindberg Susan Cc Grube Raimund Carnahan Kathleen Tweed Sheila Subject FPL letter of re new GIS Procedures I understand you are working with Raimund Grube on a response to FPL re the abovereferenced letter By that letter FPL attempts to graft onto the current GIS procedures the requirement that a customer demonstrate within days of customers receipt of a facilities study that customer has obtained any necessary local county andor state zoning permit that allows for construction of the facility specified in customers request for a facilities study or lose its queue position My records show we have received Facilities Studies for the Midway Deerfield and Corbett projects but it is unclear whether we have received a Facilities Study for the Pompano project no Endeavor files the entitiy that made the Pompano study requests etc Based on FPLs correspondence accompanying the Feasibility Study for the Fort Pierce project dated I believe we concurred with FPLs assessment that neither a Facilities Study nor Interconnection Agreement is needed for that project Raimund has advised we intend to challenge any attempt by FPL to graft onto the GIS procedures the new requirement referred to above to the extent the requirement is sought to be applied to Facilities Studies arising out of Interconnection Study Agreements entered into prior to the date of FPLs notification of the new requirements It strikes me that if that general argument is not successful that we still have good fallback arguments in those cases where we already have received facilities studies that such a requirement cannot be retroactively applied in those cases My concern about the new FPL requirement is that FPL may be more likely to be successful in applying it in cases where we have not yet received facilities studies Pompano Please advise me and Raimund when and how you intend to respond to FPL and from time to time whether you think we need to take any action regarding the zoning requirements for any of the projects in light of the expected outcome of your objections to the new FPL requirements Also please advise if you need any information about the prosecution of the zoning requirements in these cases to bolster your arguments to FPL or FERC about the unfairness of the new requirement it may take some time to pull the info together FYI if it is useful to your analysis my records show the following FPL agreementsstudies for each of the Midway Deerfield Pompano and Corbett projects and the zoning status for each as I understand it Whether or not essential to your analysis and response to FPL by copy hereof Im requesting Raimund correct or supplement my understandings to the extent he is able so we can be aware of pending interconnection and zoning related requirements for the Florida projects to which the FPL letter relate MIDWAY Interconnection Study Agreement dated between Midway Development Company and FPL and as amended and and related Feasibility Study CTs comprising MW received have study but not transmittal letter confirming date of its receipt and revision thereof received I have neither revised feasibility study nor transmittal letter The amendments extend the date for executing a definitive Interconnection and Operation Agreement for the project to days after Midways receipt of the official draft of the IOA I am unaware whether such draft has been received or the day period has commenced Interconnection Study Agreement dated between Midway Development Company and FPL requesting interconnection of a third project to FPL related to either Midway Power Project Feasibility Study queue spots and one CT comprising MW received on or about April or Midway Power Project Feasibility Study queue spots and one steam turbine generator MW received on or about April Interconnection Study Agreement dated between Midway Development Company and FPL requesting interconnection of a second project to FPL related to either the Midway or Midway Power Project Feasibility Studies referred to above First Midway Facilities Study and Preliminary Revised First Midway Facilities Study my index indicates we have these but they were removed from Deal Bench and I dont have copies and cant ascertain date of their receipt which I assume relate to either the First Midway Midway or Midway Study Agreements and Feasibility Studies referred to above It is unclear if we are awaiting additional Facilities Studies under the other requests referred to above Status of LocalCountyState Zoning Requirements Per the Deal Bench information memo prepared for the Midway project the St Lucie Planning and Zoning Commission recommended approval of the rezoning and site plan on and the St Lucie Board of County Commissioners approved rezoning and the final site plan on The approvals are conditioned upon Midway Development Company commencing construction by I recollect that there may be another condition relating to building permits and construciton of a turn off from a county road to the site that Greg Krause was trying to get resolved immediately prior to Enrons bankruptcy filing that could require earlier action to maintain the zoning and site plan

Fred CT cc Rusty NRON Kathleen nron Lisa nronXGate Roseann nronXGate Subject Ft Pierce Attached Files I sent you and Kathleen the memo I sent to Rusty about confidentiality provisions in the FPUAFPRP project documents In regard to disclosure on Deal Bench I think you need to consider carefully the confidentiality restrictions in place under binding agreements that restrict ENAs ability to disclose contracts and other information and the need to keep certain of the attachments to the EMail that Rusty sent you confidential There are binding confidentiality provisions in place with almost every counterparty to the executed and proposed to be executed Fort Pierce project documents some with exceptions that would permit disclosure to potential assigneestransferees some without such exceptions A systematic review of the confidentiality provisions in force to ascertain the scope of the confidentiality restrictions needs to be completed before Deal Bench disclosure and to my knowledge that has not taken place Also be advised that the Fort Pierce Development Agreements are not negotiated to finality or signed and I am concerned that such disclosure at this time if FPUA learned of it could result in the deal never being signed andor a potential purchaser being misled about the terms of the FPUAFPRP transaction Apart from the foregoing considerations I have asked that the opinions and certificates attached to the EMail Rusty forwarded to you be kept strictly confidential They will change and there are matters in the certificates that we dont want advertised to FPUA on Deal Bench or otherwise Finally I am not aware of the scope of ENAs confidentiality obligations in cases when it is negotiating documents in its capacity as agent for ENext Generation LLC By copy hereof Im requesting Lisa Bills and Rose Engeldorf advise us if there are such restrictions that would limit disclosure to potential purchasers independent of the other confidentiality restrictions referred to above In short before any documents are disclosed to third parties via Deal Bench these matters need to be resolved and I frankly am too busy right now trying to get the deal with FPUA signed to make the review my priority Perhaps we should start by having Kathleen take a look at the provisions in the various executed FPRP documents to catalog the various restrictions applicable to the proposed Deal Bench disclosure Forwarded by Barton ClarkHOUECT on PM Rusty NRON PM To Fred CT cc Ben CT Barton CT Ron CT Subject Ft Pierce Attached Files Attached below are the latest docs on Fort Pierce
