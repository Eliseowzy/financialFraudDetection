Underwriting Group Cindy Jerry said that Stan has reviewed this information and is comfortable with it so there is no need to contact him for a response Thanks Cindy Dee Original Message From Stark Cindy On Behalf Of Horton Stanley Sent Thursday April PM To Peters Jerry Subject Re NBP Underwriting Group Importance High Jerry Stan is in California at the KEYEX meeting today and tomorrow What do y ou suggest Cindy From Jerry nronXgate on AM To Stanley nron Ben CT Kelly H CT Mark NRON cc Rod nronXgate Bill nronXgate Subject NBP Underwriting Group Attached is a short memo on our selection rationale for the underwriting group for a planned midMay equity offering of about million for Northern Border Partners Some of these firms may be contacting you s o this should be helpful in fielding those calls With this group we are attempting to balance our placement into firms that have substantial NBP holdings UBS Warburg AGE and diversify and expand holdings in other majo r systems SSB Banc of America First Union Please note that for the firm s not selected ie Lehman Goldman and Merrill part of our rationale was t o hold these systems for a potential offering later in that could be accomplished on a solemanaged basis for up to about million Kelly As Ben requested the underwriting fees are expected to be about and the breakdown by firm will be provided when we have determined th e allocations Let me know ASAP if you have any questions or concerns as we will begin discussions with these firms tomorrow Original Message From Jesse John Sent Thursday April AM To Peters Jerry Subject NBP Underwriting Group Importance High The following provides the rationale supporting the recommended underwriter group for Northern Border Partners upcoming equity offering Please no te that underlying the entire selection process is the fact that MLP units are a specialized product sold to a more limited group of investors visvis common stock Thus sheer underwriting bulk or equity league table positio n of a given firm does not necessarily indicate the expected performance of such firm in an NBP offering Lead Manager Salomon Smith Barney SSB controls an impressive retail distribution system that has a strong appetite of MLP offerings The visibility of NBP within their system has increased recently as their MLP analyst has raised his rating on NBP to Outperform SSB has served as a comanager in past NBP offerings and has performed well Furthermore due to their comparatively small allocations in these deals as a comanager we are confident that their system has significant untapped demand for NBP units Joint Lead Manager UBS Warburg fka PaineWebber UBS has served a lead manager for the last two NBP offerings that were conducted via the rapid placement limited marketing process so they are very familiar with NBP and provide very good analyst coverage While we ar e still confident that UBS will perform well and place a large number of unit s their allocations as lead manager in our past deals probably soaked up a great deal of demand for NBP units within their system Therefore rather than placing UBS in a situation where they would have to stretch to put awa y a lead manager allocation it was deemed prudent to slot them in the joint lead role CoManagers Dain Rauscher and AG Edwards Both firms have a strong midmarket presence and have demonstrated their ability to place a significant number of NBP units in past offerings Thes e firms have not participated in an NBP deal since so this offering should generate strong demand Also Dain Rauscher was recently acquired b y Royal Bank of Canada which provides commercial bank lending to NBP and NBP L so NBP will be able to leverage DRs participation in future debt transactions Bank of America and First Union Bank of America has been a significant provider of commercial banking services to NBP and NBPL over many years while First Union recently became an NBP lender in the March transaction Both have retail distribution systems available which currently hold a limited number of NBP units Both have participated in past MLP offerings with Bank of America serving as a joint lead for highly successful Williams MLP IPO Other institutions considered but not selected Goldman Sachs Lehman Brothers Both firms support the MLP product reasonably well and have demonstrated adequate coverage of NBP Their systems are geared towards institutional sales and high networth clients so their breadth of distribution for MLP units is more limited as compared to SSB or UBS Merrill Lynch Historically this firm has not supported the MLP product despite its natural appeal to Merrills average customer Admittedly t heir new analyst has taken a more positive approach but Merrill has not participated in any meaningful way in several of the recent MLP offerings MSDW NBP receives no coverage on the investment banking side and their analyst has a Hold rating on the units

Underwriting Group Cindy Jerry said that Stan has reviewed this information and is comfortable with it so there is no need to contact him for a response Thanks Cindy Dee Original Message From Stark Cindy On Behalf Of Horton Stanley Sent Thursday April PM To Peters Jerry Subject Re NBP Underwriting Group Importance High Jerry Stan is in California at the KEYEX meeting today and tomorrow What do y ou suggest Cindy From Jerry nronXgate on AM To Stanley nron Ben CT Kelly H CT Mark NRON cc Rod nronXgate Bill nronXgate Subject NBP Underwriting Group Attached is a short memo on our selection rationale for the underwriting group for a planned midMay equity offering of about million for Northern Border Partners Some of these firms may be contacting you s o this should be helpful in fielding those calls With this group we are attempting to balance our placement into firms that have substantial NBP holdings UBS Warburg AGE and diversify and expand holdings in other majo r systems SSB Banc of America First Union Please note that for the firm s not selected ie Lehman Goldman and Merrill part of our rationale was t o hold these systems for a potential offering later in that could be accomplished on a solemanaged basis for up to about million Kelly As Ben requested the underwriting fees are expected to be about and the breakdown by firm will be provided when we have determined th e allocations Let me know ASAP if you have any questions or concerns as we will begin discussions with these firms tomorrow Original Message From Jesse John Sent Thursday April AM To Peters Jerry Subject NBP Underwriting Group Importance High The following provides the rationale supporting the recommended underwriter group for Northern Border Partners upcoming equity offering Please no te that underlying the entire selection process is the fact that MLP units are a specialized product sold to a more limited group of investors visvis common stock Thus sheer underwriting bulk or equity league table positio n of a given firm does not necessarily indicate the expected performance of such firm in an NBP offering Lead Manager Salomon Smith Barney SSB controls an impressive retail distribution system that has a strong appetite of MLP offerings The visibility of NBP within their system has increased recently as their MLP analyst has raised his rating on NBP to Outperform SSB has served as a comanager in past NBP offerings and has performed well Furthermore due to their comparatively small allocations in these deals as a comanager we are confident that their system has significant untapped demand for NBP units Joint Lead Manager UBS Warburg fka PaineWebber UBS has served a lead manager for the last two NBP offerings that were conducted via the rapid placement limited marketing process so they are very familiar with NBP and provide very good analyst coverage While we ar e still confident that UBS will perform well and place a large number of unit s their allocations as lead manager in our past deals probably soaked up a great deal of demand for NBP units within their system Therefore rather than placing UBS in a situation where they would have to stretch to put awa y a lead manager allocation it was deemed prudent to slot them in the joint lead role CoManagers Dain Rauscher and AG Edwards Both firms have a strong midmarket presence and have demonstrated their ability to place a significant number of NBP units in past offerings Thes e firms have not participated in an NBP deal since so this offering should generate strong demand Also Dain Rauscher was recently acquired b y Royal Bank of Canada which provides commercial bank lending to NBP and NBP L so NBP will be able to leverage DRs participation in future debt transactions Bank of America and First Union Bank of America has been a significant provider of commercial banking services to NBP and NBPL over many years while First Union recently became an NBP lender in the March transaction Both have retail distribution systems available which currently hold a limited number of NBP units Both have participated in past MLP offerings with Bank of America serving as a joint lead for highly successful Williams MLP IPO Other institutions considered but not selected Goldman Sachs Lehman Brothers Both firms support the MLP product reasonably well and have demonstrated adequate coverage of NBP Their systems are geared towards institutional sales and high networth clients so their breadth of distribution for MLP units is more limited as compared to SSB or UBS Merrill Lynch Historically this firm has not supported the MLP product despite its natural appeal to Merrills average customer Admittedly t heir new analyst has taken a more positive approach but Merrill has not participated in any meaningful way in several of the recent MLP offerings MSDW NBP receives no coverage on the investment banking side and their analyst has a Hold rating on the units

Underwriting Group Cindy Jerry said that Stan has reviewed this information and is comfortable with it so there is no need to contact him for a response Thanks Cindy Dee Original Message From Stark

ou suggest Cindy From Jerry nronXgate on AM To Stanley nron Ben CT Kelly H CT Mark NRON cc Rod nronXgate Bill nronXgate Subject NBP Underwriting Group Attached is a short memo on our selection rationale for the underwriting group for a planned midMay equity offering of about million for Northern Border Partners Some of these firms may be contacting you s o this should be helpful in fielding those calls With this group we are attempting to balance our placement into firms that have substantial NBP holdings UBS Warburg AGE and diversify and expand holdings in other majo r systems SSB Banc of America First Union Please note that for the firm s not selected ie Lehman Goldman and Merrill part of our rationale was t o hold these systems for a potential offering later in that could be accomplished on a solemanaged basis for up to about million Kelly As Ben requested the underwriting fees are expected to be about and the breakdown by firm will be provided when we have determined th e allocations Let me know ASAP if you have any questions or concerns as we will begin discussions with these firms tomorrow Original Message From Jesse John Sent Thursday April AM To Peters Jerry Subject NBP Underwriting Group Importance High The following provides the rationale supporting the recommended underwriter group for Northern Border Partners upcoming equity offering Please no te that underlying the entire selection process is the fact that MLP units are a specialized product sold to a more limited group of investors visvis common stock Thus sheer underwriting bulk or equity league table positio n of a given firm does not necessarily indicate the expected performance of such firm in an NBP offering Lead Manager Salomon Smith Barney SSB controls an impressive retail distribution system that has a strong appetite of MLP offerings The visibility of NBP within their system has increased recently as their MLP analyst has raised his rating on NBP to Outperform SSB has served as a comanager in past NBP offerings and has performed well Furthermore due to their comparatively small allocations in these deals as a comanager we are confident that their system has significant untapped demand for NBP units Joint Lead Manager UBS Warburg fka PaineWebber UBS has served a lead manager for the last two NBP offerings that were conducted via the rapid placement limited marketing process so they are very familiar with NBP and provide very good analyst coverage While we ar e still confident that UBS will perform well and place a large number of unit s their allocations as lead manager in our past deals probably soaked up a great deal of demand for NBP units within their system Therefore rather than placing UBS in a situation where they would have to stretch to put awa y a lead manager allocation it was deemed prudent to slot them in the joint lead role CoManagers Dain Rauscher and AG Edwards Both firms have a strong midmarket presence and have demonstrated their ability to place a significant number of NBP units in past offerings Thes e firms have not participated in an NBP deal since so this offering should generate strong demand Also Dain Rauscher was recently acquired b y Royal Bank of Canada which provides commercial bank lending to NBP and NBP L so NBP will be able to leverage DRs participation in future debt transactions Bank of America and First Union Bank of America has been a significant provider of commercial banking services to NBP and NBPL over many years while First Union recently became an NBP lender in the March transaction Both have retail distribution systems available which currently hold a limited number of NBP units Both have participated in past MLP offerings with Bank of America serving as a joint lead for highly successful Williams MLP IPO Other institutions considered but not selected Goldman Sachs Lehman Brothers Both firms support the MLP product reasonably well and have demonstrated adequate coverage of NBP Their systems are geared towards institutional sales and high networth clients so their breadth of distribution for MLP units is more limited as compared to SSB or UBS Merrill Lynch Historically this firm has not supported the MLP product despite its natural appeal to Merrills average customer Admittedly t heir new analyst has taken a more positive approach but Merrill has not participated in any meaningful way in several of the recent MLP offerings MSDW NBP receives no coverage on the investment banking side and their analyst has a Hold rating on the units
