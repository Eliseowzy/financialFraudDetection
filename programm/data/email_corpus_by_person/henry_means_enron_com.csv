boycott help lower Californias electricity bill By MICHAEL LIEDTKE AP Business Writer Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved SAN FRANCISCO AP Theres a limit to how much people will pay for most things in life If the cost scares off enough buyers prices eventually fall So what would happen if this textbook example from Economics were applied to Californias electricity crisis What if the state officials struggling to maintain energy supplies simply refused to buy power above a certain price and accepted more blackouts this summer The question would have been absurd just a few months ago and even now the notion seems surreal given the possible consequences Inviting even more blackouts inevitably would hurt businesses and frustrate consumers threatening to further depress Californias already slumping economy the sixth largest in the world But desperate times require drastic measures according to the economists lawmakers and activists who believe the state will be better off sitting in the dark than buying electricity at any price during a summer shortage likely to produce recurring blackouts anyway Its better to use blackouts and break the wholesale energy cartel than simply to suffer them said Michael Shames executive director of the Utility Consumer Action Network a San Diego watchdog group Refusing to buy enough power to keep the lights on would be like playing with fire counters Wells Fargo Co chief economist Sung Won Sohn Blackouts arent a just matter of inconvenience or being too hot or cold They cost businesses a lot of money Buying electricity at the last minute to meet the states power needs already has cost the California government billion in the past months The state energy bill for could reach billion in money otherwise spent on education public safety and health care Shames said Faced with the prospect of a significant budget deficit some lawmakers think its time for California to take a stand against the power wholesalers many of whom are based outside the state This Tuesday the state Senate Energy Committee will consider authorizing the state to refuse to buy power above certain prices Current law requires state electricity managers to avoid blackouts by buying all available power at any cost We have been over a barrel in so many ways said Sen Dede Alpert DCoronado who sponsored SBx Maybe theres a point in the market where we just say no and go with the planned blackout strategy instead Economists give the bill little chance of succeeding Its never going to happen Its not a viable option said University of California at Berkeley Professor Severin Borenstein one of the energy experts who have studied the idea The business lost during blackouts would mean more layoffs in a state already skittish over the technology downturn and the looming Hollywood writers strike economists say Other ripple effects include diminished gasoline supplies leading to even higher prices at the pump and distribution headaches that could leave store shelves bare And some consumers the elderly and the infirm for example need power at any price Without electricity Manteca resident Betty Jarzemkoski said she wouldnt be able to help her ailing husband to get out of his motorized bed at home It would be a real hardship for us said Jarzemkoski Im on a fixed income so I hope they can figure out something to bring down prices But we need power Despite such concerns the concept of a buyers boycott hasnt been flatly ruled out at least publicly by Gov Gray Davis as he struggles to reduce the states staggering electricity bill The state is spending as much as million per day to meet Californias electricity needs and the bleeding is sure to get worse When the summer heat increases demand and tightens supplies California might spend more than billion each week state officials estimate Extended blackouts pose an even greater cost economists say When Northern California suffered rolling blackouts for several hours Jan the economic losses totaled billion mostly from lost profits and wages estimated the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp Multiply that over several weeks across the entire state and it becomes apparent why it makes more sense for California to continue buying power at inflated prices even if leaves the state with deep debts and a ruined credit rating economists argue As it is California probably wont be able to round up enough power at any price on some days this summer making some blackouts a virtual certainty The blackouts will reduce the states economic output by billion to billion according to a study released last month by the Bay Area Economic Forum The resolve of the states politicians and ratepayers would be sorely tested for a boycott to succeed much in the way that labor strikes boil down to whether workers or management can withstand more financial pain Politicians arent going to willingly turn out the lights because politicians want to get reelected said Borenstein director of the University of Californias energy institute As soon as people start losing their jobs because the power is off the public will get tired of the blackouts real quick Still Californians might tolerate an increase in blackouts if they understand why the state chose to pursue such a drastic course said Stanford economics Professor Frank Wolak who heads the Independent System Operators market surveillance committee This isnt something you could do without an enormous public relations campaign he said The campaign would have to explain that the state had no other choice but to do this because federal power regulators arent doing their job and enforcing the law against unjust and unreasonable prices The largest outofstate generators are in such robust financial shape that it might take weeks before they would feel such pain from a California boycott that they would be forced to lower prices After making record profits

Limited BOMBAY May Reuters Indian lenders to US energy group Enron Corps gasfired power plant south of Bombay have appealed to the Indian government to help end the companys row with a stateowned electricity board over pricing and upaid bills The board of Enrons Indian unit Dabhol Power Co DPC has authorised management to stop selling power to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB if a bitter dispute over pricing and unpaid bills cannot be resolved In the past half year the MSEB has defaulted on bills for electricity supplied by Dabhol which operates the worlds largest gasfired plant on the west coast of India kilometres miles south of Bombay Indian financial institutions which contributed billion towards the project in loans are pressing the government to help end the crisis a source told Reuters We have asked the government for help We are awaiting their reply the source who is employed with a large financial institution said The domestic lenders to the project are Industrial Development Bank of India ICICI Ltd Industrial Finance Corporation of India Canara Bank and State Bank of India The Dabhol Power Company DPC owned percent by Enron last month took the major step of bailing out of the billion power project citing nonpayment of bills by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB The DPC boards move sparked widespread fears that Indias image as a safe destination for foreign direct investment would be damaged POWER STRUGGLE MSEB which is a stateowned utility has been a regular defaulter on payments to DPC saying that it finds the power too costly It has also backed out on its commitment to buy more power to be produced by the projects second phase which is to begin operations later this year Last month MSEB said it had paid Dabhol Power billion rupees million for electricity it bought in March But the payment only partially resolves the total overdue amount of billion rupees million which Enron has been unable to collect even after invoking guarantees issued by the government of Maharashtra Indias most industrialised state and the federal government The state utility still owes Enron payments for power purchases in December and January The Indian government has maintained that the contract must be renegotiated and has set up a committee to do so We are concerned and would like the renegotiations to happen fast the source added The dispute has raised fears that Enron could pull the plug on the project cease providing power to the local state electricity board and perhaps even sell the plant The plant is good

The Democratic National Committee issued the following today Dick Cheney began dropping hints this week as to what the Bush energy policy will look like and it is long on oil and short on conservation But something was missing from the coverage of Cheneys announcement not just who benefits from the Bush plan but whos writing it as well Photo cgibinprnhDCF Its hard to understate the influence big donors and highranking executives have with the Bush Administration Take Tom Kuhn for example one of the energy executives who came calling when Bush was thinking about actually following through on his pledge to limit carbon dioxide levels Kuhn a top Bush fundraiser also served on Bushs Energy Department transition advisory team and still enjoys access to the highest reaches of the Bush White House Not surprisingly then the Big Oil Bush Administrations energy policy could not make Bushs huge donors and the special interests in the energy business any happier Since the energy industrys problems are Bushs problems the first things on Bushs hit list are the environmental regulations that keep Big Energy in check and our country clean With an energy executive running around the West

trading wholesale electricity on the FrenchItalian border and was set to enter the German power market We have done some wholesale trading on the ItalyFrance border moving power from France to Italy and we are very close to doing some in Germany said director of trading Tony West in an interview with Reuters This year we will significantly increase our trading in mainland Europe we are discussing relationships with counterparties at the moment he added Innogy is building a European power trading team at its headquarters in Swindon southern England from where it already trades the UK gas and power markets FRANCE COULD BE KEY MARKET West said the company initially had expected the main focus of its European trading strategy to be Germany and the north west of the continent But the early signs were that France would also play a key role particularly as Innogy had gained access to capacity in the UKFrance undersea interconnector cable France has taken me by surprise It might be more important than we anticipated although there are clearly still issues about the speed of liberalisation said West A core of about eight companies regularly trade power in France including TXU Europe Enron and a trading alliance between Endesa and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter according to traders West said Innogy had so far concentrated on buying power in France not always from French companies and taking it to Italy via the cross border interconnector between the two countries Innogy had bought some of the megawatts available on the interconnector through recent auctions he said Its easy to trade through France the cost of taking power through to the border is minuscule although buying power in France and then selling it in France is a lot more difficult said West He said Innogy had signed grid balancing agreements with French transmission grid operator RTE Andy Duff managing director of generation and trading added France could become become important for Innogy on a retail level as well as a trading level depending on how effectively the UKFrance interconnector could be used The European market will be driven by the operation of interconnectors and transmission services as well as exchanges said Duff Innogy may look to trade on Germanys two power exchanges as well as that countrys burgeoning overthecounter market The company is in the process of signing standard trading agreements for Germany based on the terms devised by the industry group the European Federation of Energy Traders EFET FOCUS ON TRADING NOT ASSETS Duff said Innogys strategy in Europe was to focus on trading but not the acquisition of physical assets We are not going to lead with assets in Europe We will focus on trading servicestype arrangements extracting value from other companies assets Thats the main thrust of the business he said West said Innogys trading in mainland Europe would expand into natural gas as opportunities emerged The company already trades around the UKBelgium

debt down from a record in March Contracts that pay out if the company goes bankrupt have also fallen in the past month according to Enron Corp which trades the derivatives Bond yields and bankruptcy derivatives have also declined for Deutsche Telekom and Royal KPN NV after the companies said they would sell assets to pay down debt that has pushed their credit ratings to record lows and weighed on their shares Phone companies sold billion of bonds last year to finance licenses and equipment for new mobile services British Telecom said yesterday it will sell its stakes in Japan Telecom Co and Spains Airtel SA to Vodafone Group for billion pounds British Telecom may also sell as much as billion pounds of shares to existing investors in a socalled rights offer according to Legal General Group Plc one of the companys shareholders Deutsche Telekom will sell assets such as cable television and a stake in Global One and Wind SpA Chief Financial Officer KarlGerhard Eick said last week KPN the biggest Dutch phone company said on March it plans to raise at least billion euros from asset sales to lower debt Those plans have helped shift investors perceptions of the companies creditworthiness money managers said Drastic Measures At the beginning of the year the market was assuming telecoms companies would be downgraded from singleA to triple B said Peter Harvey who helps run about billion at FC Management Drastic measures such as deeplydiscounted rights issues led investors to believe they will maintain their singleA status The gap or spread between British Telecoms sterling denominated bonds maturing in and UK fiveyear government bonds has narrowed basis points to basis points in the past month Spreads between Deutsche Telekoms percent five year euro bonds and German government debt narrowed basis points to in April Bankruptcy Swaps Fall Those shifts in sentiment are also reflected in Enrons bankruptcy swaps where prices have fallen in the past month said Simon Brooks a trader at Enron Enron prices the swaps using indexes that measure the probability of bankruptcy and the likely recovery rate in that event The price is expressed as a percentage above a benchmark interest rate such as the London interbank offered rate or Libor British Telecom bankruptcy swaps have declined to basis points from on April Enron said Bankruptcy swaps on Deutsche Telekom dropped to from while KPNs fell to from Over the same period France Telecom SAs declined to from and Telecom Italia SpAs fell to from British Telecoms bond yields may fall further relative to government debt analysts said They still offer higher yields than those of rival Vodafone Group Plc which has the same ratings though with a stable outlook While both companies have fiveyear eurodenominated bonds British Telecoms offer basis points more yield The rivals also both have bonds maturing in and Vodafones yield about basis points fewer If BT retains their rating their spreads should be probably to basis points narrower said Brian Venables head of credit strategy at WestLB Even though it has performed extremely well this year there is much greater potential for BTs debt Debt Reduction Target Both Moodys Investors Service which rates British Telecom A and Standard Poors which rates it A have those ratings on watch for further cuts after trimming them four rungs last year The companys asset sales to Vodafone are definitely positive in terms of the rating assessment said Aidan Fisher who rates British Telecom for Moodys In combination with the proceeds of a rights sale that would meet the target they set themselves this year thats quite a lot to achieve in a month period British Telecom has said it wants to slash its billion pounds of debt by a third and fend off further rating cuts Before companies such as British Telecom clarified their debtreduction plans the world and his wife were underweight telecom bonds in March said Harvey at FC The investment

analysis on Bloomberg BRITEL Corp GO for BTs bonds DT Corp GO for Deutsche Telekoms bonds UKCorporates warm to charms of credit derivatives By Tom Bergin Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited LONDON May Reuters European corporates are beginning to turn to credit derivatives among the more esoteric and complex of financial instruments to hedge the risk their debtors wont pay up market participants said on Thursday Credit derivatives are insurancelike tools that allow users to hedge the risk of default on a debt They are mainly used by banks hedge funds and insurance companies to hedge or gain exposure to the risk of a bond issuer defaulting Dealers said an environment of deteriorating credit quality and a growing awareness among corporates that credit derivatives offer certain advantages over established hedging tools was behind the increasing use of the instruments The market remains small with only around a dozen nonfinancial European corporates regularly using credit derivatives to manage their credit portfolio at present But market professionals predict they will one day become as commonplace in the corporate world as other hedging tools such as interest rate swaps and currency options We see corporate use as a big growth area for credit derivatives maybe the biggest says Bryan Seyfried vicepresident of Enron Credit in London Enron Credit grew out of the efforts of energy company Enron Corp to hedge its own credit risk portfolio and now specialises in marketing credit risk management solutions to other nonfinancial corporates Ralf Lierow director of credit derivatives at Siemens Financial Services in Munich said the ability to buy and sell in a liquid market means credit derivatives offer a flexibility that established tools like credit insurance and forfaiting guarantees lack Credit derivatives were are often cheaper than the alternatives too he added This is not a trading book thing For us the credit default swap is another tool for credit risk management Lierow said HELPS OPERATIONAL UNITS DO MORE BUSINESS Siemens Financial Services acts as the centralised risk portfolio management operation for companies within the Siemens electronics and industrial group It first started using credit derivatives in July Large companies like Siemens can have hundreds of millions of dollars in receivables on their books at any time The efficiency with which these companies manage the credit risk on their receivables has an impact on their day to day business The advantage for the operative area is that they can offload more receivables and do more business Lierow said Siemens uses credit default swaps the most liquid type of credit derivatives to hedge its portfolio of debtors on a constant basis As the balance of cash owed by each name fluctuates over time the company tries to match this with default swap positions Hence if a customer fails to pay Siemens can recoup the debt from the default swap seller Other companies use credit derivatives less frequently There are occasional corporate users that have secured oneoff requirements for balancesheet management aims or to strip out the credit risk of a commercial transaction said Walter Gontarek head of global credit products at RBC Dominion Securities By hedging a country or company risk which a corporate may not be comfortable in carrying a credit derivative can facilitate a project that may otherwise be unfeasible dealers said NOT PUT OFF BY BAD PRESS Corporates adoption of credit derivatives is in spite of the negative publicity the instruments have received in recent years A number of disputes over whether protection buyers could force banks to pay up on contracts have ended up in court However traders insist that subsequent work done on contract documentation minimises the risk of such disputes in future Nonetheless a very practical concern for corporates remains in that credit derivatives documentation was designed by bankers with sovereign and corporate bonds in mind The International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA standard documentation for credit default swaps allows for a payout in relation to defaults on bond payments but not on a private debtors failure to pay We use the ISDA framework but we need it redrafted in specific ways to fit our needs You cannot take a standard contract and trade on it if you want to hedge trade receivables Lierow said These amendments add to the cost of the credit derivative Another problem that corporates face is the complexity of credit derivatives There is little experience of the instruments which are barely a decade old in the corporate world Siemens had to get its expertise from the financial markets hiring Lierow from Bankgesellschaft Berlin Clive Banks UK head of derivatives sales to buyside clients at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney said much of the effort in marketing credit derivatives to corporates involves educating them about the products and the risks involved Its about explaining credit risk management and what kind of volatility and cost having credit risk introduces he said OUTLOOK PROMISING Yet some corporates are beginning to take full advantage of their new tool Lierow said that Siemens which currently only buys credit protection planned to start acting as a default swaps seller in the coming months He said selling would facilitate better matching of protection levels to actual exposures and would enable diversification of risk away from industry sectors where the companys activities are concentrated You could improve the portfolio mix by buying protection on automotives and selling protection on pharmaceuticals he said Allegheny Energy buys three power plants Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press

Northern Border Rtg Outlook To Stable From Negative Business Wire Copyright c Business Wire NEW YORKBUSINESS WIREMay Fitch has affirmed its BBB senior debt rating for Northern Border Partners LP NBP and its A senior debt rating for its regulated pipeline affiliate Northern Border Pipeline Co NBPL The Rating Outlook for both companies is changed to Stable from Negative The rating action was taken after a review of NBPs recent acquisitions and longterm business plan A combination of debt and equity at NBP was used to fund the recent acquisitions of Bear Paw LLC Midwestern Gas Transmission Company and Dynegy Canada midstream assets An additional million of equity is expected to be sold in the coming months to pay down shortterm debt and complete the permanent financing The improvement in Rating Outlook primarily reflects NBPs demonstrated commitment to undertake conservative longterm financing and operating strategies Future acquisitions at the partnership level are expected to be

Enron to meet govt panel over Indian project Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited NEW DELHI May Reuters The Indian unit of Enron Corp said on Thursday that its officials would meet members of a government panel formed to renegotiate a troubled billion power project in western India But the willingness to meet the panel next week should not be construed as an offer to renegotiate the contract Dabhol Power Company DPC said in a statement As a matter of courtesy we have agreed to meet with them next week the DPC statement said Since the purpose of our meeting is to hear out the committee and understand their thoughts we will not present any proposal DPC said it had constantly maintained that it was open to maintaining a dialogue towards resolving issues But This meeting should in no manner be construed as an open offer from DPC to renegotiate the terms of the contract it added DPC and the government of the western state of Maharashtra have been locked in a payment battle for months with the states electricity board balking at paying Enron what it considers too high a rate for electricity At present Maharashtras State Electricity Board MSEB owes the DPC of which Enron is a percent stakeholder some million for power The Maharashtra government last week announced the formation of a panel of experts to renegotiate its contract with DPC and lower the cost of power sold to MSEB LARGEST FOREIGN INVESTMENT The Dabhol project the single largest foreign investment in India consists of two phases the alreadybuilt megawatt power plant and a MW plant that is expected to be finished this year Last week Dabhols board authorised the plants managing director to issue a preliminary notice of termination of service to MSEB The notice which has not been issued would be the first step for Enron to pull out of the project Earlier a source familiar with the project told Reuters that Indian lenders who have provided millions of dollars to Houstonbased Enron to build DPC are lobbying with the government to act quickly and end the crisis We have asked the government for help We are awaiting their reply the source who is employed with a large financial institution said The domestic lenders to the project are Industrial Development Bank of India ICICI Ltd Industrial Finance Corporation of India Canara Bank and State Bank of India If Enron pulls out of the project the source said the lenders would have no choice but to seek an alternative buyer The plant is good Maharashtra needs power and I am sure buyers can be found the source added India

investment missteps and unexpected disasters UK verticallyintegrated utility Scottish Power SPI is hoping a new strategy to streamline its businesses will signal a more focused period for the company But its got its work cut out While investors were cheered by news that its US Utahbased Hunter power plant is back online after a sixmonth outage that cost the company an estimated million uncertainty over its plans for its Southern Water unit and apparent ongoing commitment to lossmaking telecoms venture Thus are seen as muddling group focus It all adds up the lack of coherent strategy quite substantial downgrades and a whole host of noncore businesses that they dont have any natural management flair or expertise in said Brian Gallagher a senior fund manager at Londonbased Gartmore Investment Management which has GBP million of Scottish Power shares in its Global Utilities Fund We have a reasonably low opinion of the company The company said Thursday that its pretax profit before goodwill amortization and exceptional items for the fiscal year ending March fell to GBP million from GBP million a year ago Adjusted earnings per share declined to pence in the fiscal year from pence in The company acknowledged profits have been hit hard by the Hunter outage competition on wholesale and retail markets in the UK and strict price controls on its regulated infrastructure businesses Although the companys shares were trading at pence after the release of Thursdays earnings results up from pence Wednesday they are down more than from pence a year ago Executives say they are restructuring the business into three targeted divisions to capitalize on its traditional strengths in generation and power supply and infrastructure and to expand its overseas activities Weve now got a trading and commercial link between generation and supply and the first thing we are doing is putting emphasis on thaton growing earnings across that value chain Scottish Power Chief Executive Ian Russell told journalists in a conference call Thursday In the US we are focused on cost cutting and on acquiring new businesses Scottish Powers move away from a full multiutility profile begun last year with its partial disposal of Thus and its withdrawal from an Internet banking venture with the Royal Bank of Scotland toward a more narrowly focused energy business mimics a trend across the industry toward greater specialization The company is also considering selling Southern Water which would allow it to focus even more closely on its power business Yet analysts and investors say they are looking for more details of the companys overall growth strategy from Russell who took over as chief executive last month and other managers The toll from months of drift is evident they said Sales Of Southern Water Thus Seen Indeed despite its efforts to chart a new road Scottish Power appears to be reluctant to acknowledge the failure of some of its noncore ventures Russell said his company remains supportive of Thus which reported a fiscal year loss of GBP million this week and has no plans to exit its remaining stake in the company Similarly he said Scottish Power hasnt yet made a final decision to dispose of Southern Water which has cut costs under its Scottish parent but is increasingly unable to cover its capital expenditure although he said the company had received a number of offers from potential buyers Although he declined to identify any of the bidders Italian energy company Enel SpA ENI has confirmed its interest Industry sources said a prompt sale of the water unit looks likely with some bids already exceeding the GBP billion at which many analysts value the companys combined assets and debt Its unclear they said how Southern Water or Thus would fit into Scottish Powers new image Scottish Power sees itself as an international energy company a source familiar with the company said In a years time he added it would be unlikely that Southern Water and Thus would be part of the company Revenues from the sale of the water unit would also help Scottish Power pursue its US expansion without adding to its gearing levels analysts and investors said Russell declined to comment on reports Scottish Power is considering buying Enron Corps Oregonbased unit Portland General but admitted the company would be a logical geographical fit with Pacificorp Analysts said Scottish Powers plans for US growth is likely to be a key part of its energy strategy We like their US strategy where theyve leveraged expertise gained in the highly competitive UK market said Gareth LewisDavies head of utilities research at Lehman Brothers in London Closer to home competition and the trend toward increased specialization in the power industry may force Scottish Power to determine whether its business strength lies in asset management or retail and generation Strategic decisions need to be made and Im not sure if they are going to make them in the near term or not said Andrew Wright UK utilities analyst at UBS Warburg in London They are pretty much involved across the value chain and I think it remains to be seen which part of the value chain they

Missing link by Claire Poole The Daily Deal Copyright c The Deal LLC Buying Illinova gave Dynegy a key piece in a puzzle for trading energy anywhere anytime When Chuck Watson decided to take his company beyond natural gas trading he changed its name to Dynegy Inc and took as its logo a tangram a sevenpiece puzzle that can be assembled in thousands of ways Buying utility Illinova Corp in February gave him a piece for delivering such flexibility The Illinova acquisition was probably the most welltimed and best conceived buy of the year raves Jeremy Butler an analyst at Value Line Publishing Inc ReportCard DYNEGY ILLINOVA Stock Price A Profitability B Strategy A Braintrust B Culture B Competitive Position A Overall A Why Besides providing electricity to customers in a squaremile area in Illinois Decatur Illbased Illinova also had recently received regulatory approval to transfer its coal and gasfired generating plants megawatts in all to an unregulated subsidiary as part of the states deregulation of its electricity industry Thanks to soaring energy prices as well as to million to million in overall earnings estimated or achieved from optimizing Illinovas generation assets and improving its operating efficiencies Dynegy is seeing the effects of the deal on its bottom line Illinova has been extremely accretive to earnings said M Carol Coale an analyst at Prudential Securities in Houston Last year in fact Dynegys revenues nearly doubled to billion while its net earnings almost tripled to million or per diluted share as a result of the billion Illinova deal In the first quarter Dynegys net earnings jumped Investors have been amply rewarded Dynegys stock took off last year jumping to per share making it the second best performing stock in the Standard Poors Since the Illinova deal was announced June Dynegys stock has skyrocketed an astounding from to One of those happy investors is San Franciscobased oil and gas giant Chevron Corp which owns about of Dynegy For Watson who formed Dynegy in the late s out of Houston energy company NGS Corp where he was CEO and chairman the success of the Illinova deal underscores his quest to take power and trade it anywhere he wants anytime he wants at any price he wants Thats why he dubbed the company Dynegy a hybrid name taken by combining dynamic with energy If energy prices stay high and Dynegys traders continue to make winning bets analysts expect the companys net earnings per share to increase another this year to million or per share But Dynegy hasnt been immune to the power crisis afflicting California where it coowns four power plants with NRG Energy Inc of Minneapolis that generate megawatts of capacity Indeed since the crisis began Dynegys been defending itself against allegations that its overcharging for power The California situation has hurt Dynegy in other ways too On April for example its stock fell to after utility Pacific Gas Electric Co a unit of PGE Corp filed for bankruptcy Dynegy provides power to the California market as a wholesaler but not to PGE directly Dynegy has also been quibbling recently with another teetering California utility Sempra Energys San Diego Gas Electric which claimed April that Dynegy ordered it to shutter some of the facilities the utility sold it in but that it still operates because it doesnt think it will get paid Dynegy denied the charge Dynegy did not instruct SDGE to shut down generating units nor did we suggest that we would not make power available to creditworthy buyers Stephen W Bergstrom Dynegys president and COO wrote in a letter to SDGE Chairman and CEO Stephen Baum Dynegy has tried to downplay its exposure to the states power woes Its repeatedly pointed out to the press that its stake in the four power plants in California only represents of its total generating portfolio of megawatts or about Analysts however estimate Dynegys exposure in California could give its earnings a haircut of as much as this year Even so Dynegys stock has recovered to a recent Illinova has created some volatility to Dynegys stock because of the addition of power generation to its business Prudentials Coale said But overall its been a great deal While keeping most of Illinova management in place Dynegy made the companys chairman president and CEO Charles Bayless a nonexecutive director of the combined entity Dynegys also marketing and trading all of Illinovas megawatts of output Theyve streamlined power generation and traded around the assets while keeping the distribution business in a sweet spot said John Olson an analyst at Sanders Morris Harris in Houston Illinova meanwhile solved a big investorrelated problem for Dynegy Before the merger only of Dynegys shares were available to the public As part of the deal Watson convinced two of Dynegys strategic partners British Gas plc and Nova Chemicals to sell their combined stake for approximately million in cash and shares of a new convertible preferred stock It also issued million shares after the deal closed Those moves increased Dynegys float to more than of the shares outstanding which led money managers to flood in The companys market capitalization has since tripled to billion Operationally in its effort to focus on power generation trading and marketing Dynegy has been dumping some of its midstream assets such as processing plants and pipelines particularly in the midContinent region The idea now is to increase Dynegys socalled merchant power capacity or the electricity it sells wholesale to anyone who needs it to megawatts by through acquisitions new construction and asset management agreements As a result Watson has become what some are calling an acquisitions hound Hes already acquired some facilities On Jan Dynegy completed the purchase of two power plants in the Hudson River Valley the megawatt Roseton power plant in Newburgh NY and the megawatt Danskammer plant nearby from various area utilities for million Banc of America Securities llc advised Dynegy on both purchases Dynegy has had trouble picking up other power plants however Witness the deal it announced Nov to acquire megawatts worth of electricitygenerating assets in Nevada from Renobased Sierra Pacific Resources for million The deal got scotched April when Nevada regulators spooked by its nextdoor neighbors power crisis repealed the states electricity deregulation plan and put a moratorium on all power plant sales in the state Dynegy estimated the acquisition would have added cents per share to earnings Still since the Illinova merger the total generating capacity built or acquired by Dynegy now exceeds the total capacity added through the merger That includes megawatts of new natural gasfired generation facilities in Georgia Kentucky and Louisiana that are expected to begin commercial operation by June just in time for summer Like its crosstown rival Enron Corp Dynegy has also expanded via acquisitions into broadband telecommunications Dynegy also competes with Houstonbased Reliant Energy and Charlotte NCbased Duke Energy Both Enron and Dynegy see a big opportunity in broadband given that there are few other suppliers and that managing its movement is akin to whats involved with natural gas or electricity In August Dynegy announced it was acquiring Aurora Colobased Extant Inc a privately held developer of telecom solutions for million in cash and stock It completed the deal in September Then in November Dynegy announced it was acquiring privately held Iaxis Ltd a Londonbased telecom that owned and operated an mile fiberoptic network throughout Europe for almost million Dynegy completed the deal in March Dynegy is now developing a mile fiberoptic cable network in the US that it will link to Iaxis network in Europe It hopes its broadband unit which lost million in the first quarter will be profitable by the second half of Still Dynegy has differentiated itself as the antiEnron because among other things it continues to buy power plants rather than sell them Enron meanwhile has been trying to dump its hard assets such as Portland General Electric in Portland Ore Enron CEO Jeff Skilling a polished former McKinsey Co consultant just wants to be a gobetween and not just in energy but in broadband pulp and paper and metals while Dynegys Watson a scrappy former commodities

Asian Wall Street Journal Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Indias electricity shortage cant be solved without a new approach Indias power problem is back on the front burner because global generating giant Enron is threatening to turn off the lights at its Dhabol plant and walk away from a contract with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board In an effort to collect million owed for electricity already supplied the American company has invoked central government guarantees and declared a political force majeure but without much success So technically India is facing a sovereign default after which Enron would spend years battling through the courts to get compensation for the billion project Of course everyone knows thats not going to happen After more brinksmanship from both sides in the coming days they will have to sit down and negotiate a settlement Some of the problems with Enron are unique to that particular arrangement but in its basic outline the saga epitomizes a flawed attempt to deal with Indias power problem narrowly defined a shortage of generating capacity The country suffers constant blackouts due to a supply shortage of about and even more during times of peak demand In the early s the central government sought to solve this shortfall by opening the doors to private investors like Enron But this proved to be a mistake because power distribution is controlled by the state governments they run it as a system of wealth redistribution rather than a business California recently made the earthshattering discovery that a lack of market pricing at the consumer level leads to disaster But Indias state electricity boards or SEBs proved that long ago they have long been bankrupt and often default on payments to private generators As a result most of the big names in power have now pulled out of India Yes the country does need to worry about generating capacity Its estimated that in the next years demand will more than double with an additional megawatts needed but only half of that is likely to be built That could increase the shortfall during peak demand to a frightening prospect But the first order of business is to reform distribution There is a debate now about how to give state governments the right incentives to reform their SEBs These owe almost billion to central governmentowned generators and mines from whom they buy much of their power and coal In the recently passed budget New Delhi included a provision to forgive this debt as long as the state governments commit to either privatizing their SEBs or putting a floor on electricity prices Electricity meters would actually be installed to measure power usage but subsidies would still be allowed many customers wouldnt pay enough to cover the true cost of that power Still this would be big progress by Indian standards if it happened Many farmers currently get their power for free and over of power generated is stolen something the SEBs euphemistically call transmission and distribution losses As a result the electricity boards average a return on investment of negative However New Delhi is offering quite a big carrot and not much stick After a March meeting between the prime minister and state leaders Rajnath Singh the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh said quite clearly that he wouldnt hike energy charges for farmers The reason is obvious he faces elections next year and free power has become an entitlement that no politician lightly takes away Chief ministers will likely sign on to New Delhis plan in order to get debt relief but will backslide on implementation The only thing that will make the states serious about reform is a hard budget constraint which is the opposite of what the government is offering One way to provide it would be to hand over the centrally owned power generators and mines to the states They would then have to figure out how to keep the system running If they still chose not to charge for electricity they would have to find the money for power generation from other parts of their budgets Another reform some have suggested is to pass a national law which legalizes private power producers Some states allow companies to have their own captive power plants to maintain supply when the public grid fails But these are typically not permitted to sell their power outside of the parent company If larger plants that could supply several industrial firms were legalized the states would come under greater pressure to reform The private power suppliers could cherrypick the best customers those willing to pay for reliable power leaving the state to subsidize the freeloaders This would also have the benefit of quickly boosting the countrys power supply since captive plants already have about megawatts of unused capacity New Delhi is still trying to reform the countrys power market by fiat This means years of political wrangling while a growing economy is strangled by a shortage of electricity Instead the wouldbe reformers could let the power of the invisible hand push the state governments in the right direction INDIA Foreign funds plough money into Indian shares By Anurag Sood Reuters English

percent the IMF estimates percent the Asian Development Bank percent and the Indian central bank percent Ajit Ranade economist at ABN AMRO Bank says Indias large domestic economy resilient to the global slowdown could pull more funds into the country But a blizzard of stock market scandals which revealed share price manipulation has unnerved some foreign investors Weak regulation is a part of an emerging market risk but that does not rule out caution said an India strategist at a foreign brokerage Analysts say foreign fund flows are unlikely to be influenced much by events such as the Enron controversy where the US energy giant is threatening to pull out of its billion power project in the western Indian state of Maharashtra Enron is Indias single biggest foreign direct investor They say factors that influence foreign portfolio investments are different from the considerations that drive longer term direct investments The Indian governments decision to hike foreign funds

the coalition or supportive of the Democratic Front Government today thrashed its effort to renegotiate the power purchase agreement PPA with the Enron sponsored Dabhol Power Company The least cost option was to initiate a judicial probe into the deal which was replete with fraud and seek the scrapping of the project they said This view was made public after the parties Peasants and Workers Party the CPIM the Janata Dal Secular the Samajwadi Party and others met here and decided to press the demand at a meeting of the coordination committee of all parties including the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party on May Its scheduled meeting for today was put off as the Chief Minister Mr Vilasrao Deshmukh was away electioneering in the South These parties worried about the huge unpayable DPC bills had been demanding a probe under the Inquiries Commissions Act but today upped the ante saying we are convinced of fraud in the agreement with DPC The renegotiation Mr N D Patil who leads the Left grouping and heads the allparty coordination panel said is not what we want we dont want it at all He and Mr Prabhakar Sanzgiri CPIM said we no longer suspect it We are convinced of malfeasance Along with Mr Pradhyumna Kaul of the AntiEnron Campaign they told a press conference that the moment fraud was proved the PPA could be annulled and the huge liquidation penalties can be avoided The demand was to scrap the mw phase II take over the mw Phase I and initiate a probe The Godbole Committee report has provided enough grounds though Phase I was a reality and Phase II only an eventuality Even a small criminal probe would put any arbitration decision sought by the DPC on hold The lobby pressing for scrapping the PPA said an FIR against the Maharashtra State Electricity Board under the provisions of Section of the Electricity Supply Act would suffice as there were enough grounds to prove that the entity or persons concerned had played games at one time or the other It cited bloated projections of energy demand in Maharashtra provided by the MSEB to DPC to justify the work on the Phase II which is now under stress following lenders reluctance to provide funds till the issue is sorted out When asked why Mr Deshmukh preferred renegotiation and trimming of power tariff to a probe Mr Patil said that is his view For their part the parties would press for change

renegotiate the power tariff with the US company Mr Deshmukhs observations assume significance in the context of the running controversy regarding the Kannur Power Project which had been denied permission by the LDF Government Mr Deshmukh said that Enron had written to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board that it was ready to renegotiate the power tariff provided the Government of India made a formal request He said the renegotiation would start as soon as the Union Government handed over the formal letter asking for a renegotiation Mr Deshmukh pointed out that the basic issue in Enrons Dabhol project was related to the power tariff The foreign exchange rate was fixed at Rs a dollar at the start of the project But now it had gone up to Rs a dollar thereby pushing the cost of power up He indicated that the renegotiations would focus on this aspect as well The Maharashtra Government had proposed renegotiation on the basis of the Godbole Commission recommendation He was confident that the Enron would agree to renegotiate the tariff in the interests of the Maharashtra Government and its own interests In reply to a question Mr Deshmukh said the Enron project had been a major drain on his States finances but it had overcome all problems by handling them very carefully He said the Maharashtra Government would extend all support to the UDF if it were to come to power to process the various parameters relating to the Kannur project so that it did not commit the same kind of mistake as Maharashtra did He however made it clear that his Government welcomed foreign direct investments but not at the cost of the States interests Mr Deshmukh attacked the Centre for not using the various options available under the WTO agreement to come out with a balanced importexport policy Asked for his comments on Mr Sharad Pawars statement that the NCP was considering joining the Peoples Front Mr Deshmukh made it very clear that his partys alliance with the NCP was confined to Maharashtra alone The alliance with the NCP is a post election affair as part of the attempts to unite all secular forces The Congress had fought the NCP and several other parties which are now part of the Congressled Government But the alliance had been formed in order to keep the BJPShiv Sena combine out he said Asked how his party could accept the NCP which had an alliance going with the BJP in Meghalaya Mr Deshmukh said the Congress NCP ties were confined to Maharashtra If the NCP creates any problems in Maharashtra the alliance would end he said Mr Deshmukh attacked the CPIMled LDF for its five year misrule which had left the State virtually bankrupt The credibility of the LDF is so low that the people would not vote for it The CPIMled Left parties would be defeated

of action on its LNG shipping deal for the Dabhol Power Company DPC The controversy surrounding the Enronpromoted DPC and the apprehension raised by the lenders to the LNG shipping project has made the three shipping promoters of Greenfield Shipping Company take stock of the situation A final view on the LNG shipping deal will depend on what Enron decides on the power project per se and not just the second phase of the project which is being planned as a LNG driven plant Even the first phase is expected to switchover to LNG in a couple of years sources tracking the sequence of events told Business Line The promoters have already paid per cent of the vessel building cost to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Japan where the cubic metre capacity vessel is being constructed at a total cost of million According to the delivery schedule the LNG vessel named Laxmi is expected to be completed and delivered by October end this year A consortium of global banks led by ANZ Investment Bank has taken a high exposure on the LNG shipping project The Greenfield Shipping Company had struck a year loan with the lenders worth million at basis points over libor SCI has a per cent equity stake in the project while Mitsui OSKLines hold per cent and Atlantic Commercial Inc per cent The LNG shipping deal for Dabhol was the first LNG shipping contract in the country involving an Indian shipping line Greenfield Shipping Company had entered into a time charter agreement with DPC to transport LNG from West Asia to its power plant in Maharashtra at a timecharter hire rate of per day for years Unlike in the case of other ships LNG ships do not have a secondary market since these are acquired against specific longterm contracts In case of any eventuality Greenfield Shipping Company would find it difficult to divert the vessel elsewhere as globally spot trade in LNG is almost nil Fortunately for the Greenfield Shipping Company the prices for new LNG buildings have started firming up after travelling through a downward trend till recently Mitsui OSKLinesNYKK LineKKK LineSCI consortium which recently bagged the shipping contract from Petronet LNG Ltd also has placed an order with

the tariff in its own interest as well as that of the State Government Our Bureau Let Enron Exit ADITYA CHATTERJEE POOJA KOTHARI The Times of India Copyright C The Times of India Source World Reporter TM FOR years Enron tried to woo Indian policymakers who couldnt seem to decide whether the Dabhol project was a good idea or not Today the boot is on the other foot and it seems to be pinching Enrons management is keen to stop investing in huge capitalintensive plants around the world In keeping with this strategy and no doubt exhausted by its ceaseless crisis management in India Enron is mulling a pullout But both the Centre and Maharashtra government want to renegotiate the power purchase agreement and have entrusted this responsibility to the Madhav Godbole panel Is Enron really as indispensable as the authorities seem to think it is Financially no Indeed if the only way to continue the project is on the present terms then it makes better sense to simply scrap it After all its better to amputate a gangrenous limb than to let the problem spread further A little arithmetic will make this amply clear If the Dabhol Power Company DPC does scrap its agreement with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board the Centre will have to cough up a sum of Rs crore a penalty amount of Rs crore for one years electricity bill and million as termination fees which works out to Rs crore at an assumed exchange rate of rupees to one dollar This is a onetime payment and the figure of Rs crore is corroborated by a recent statement by Union power secretary A K Basu Now if India were to continue with the present arrangement it would end up paying at least Rs crore per year for the next years to DPC On the other hand what would happen if the project were scrapped Well very simplistically India would save Rs crore Rs crore multiplied by years But things arent quite that simple because that money could earn interest while inflation would mean that Rs crore after years would not have the same value it would have today To get around this problem financial experts use a concept called net present value which discounts future earning streams as well as inflation to evaluate the attractiveness of a project If we use a discount rate of per cent then the value of the amount India would save by scrapping the Dabhol project works out to Rs crore over three times the amount India would have to pay today if the agreement with DPC is terminated Indian financial institutions FIs and banks which have lent money to DPC are actively lobbying to prevent such an eventuality But how badly would they be hit Well FIs led by Industrial Development Bank of India have provided loans of million and million in two phases This brings their total exposure to million Rs crore at an exchange rate of Besides State Bank of India also underwrote the maximum portion of a million crossborder loan and has an exposure of about million Rs crore Thus the cumulative exposure of Indian banks and FIs in DPC works out to around Rs crore However since only per cent of this amount has been disbursed so far the net exposure of Indian lenders amounts to Rs crore Since the Indian lenders are not covered by any counterguarantee their bottomline would be hit if Enron backs out The government being a majority stakeholder in most of these institutions would also be affected But even if all these loans are taken into account and added to the onetime payment of Rs crore the total cost to the government would be Rs crore still lower than Rs crore Thus the termination option will prove less costly for the nation than proceeding on the present terms What will happen to the assets and the plant did we hear you ask Well the government can sell it to private players and renegotiate the cost factor with them this time hopefully after doing a costbenefit analysis A sale of assets would also lessen the load on the government Who knows the government may actually manage to sell the ownership of DPC at a premium to another private sector player Of course fears have been raised that cancelling the project might cost us foreign direct investment since Enron is the biggest investor in India so far After all Brazil raised billion and China billion last year in comparison with Indias measly billion But theres another way of looking at the problem what does India really have to lose In short its a case of losing what you dont even have in the first place Many developing nations which were pushed into signing expensive power projects by multinationals have successfully renegotiated their contracts with no serious financial consequences Many nations simply did not have the money to pay for the inflated bills some refused to pay even after losing international arbitration awards while others like Costa Rica declared that the contracts signed with independent power producers like Enron have no legal status or are bad in law In July the Hungarian parliament declared that a PPA signed with multinational RWE was unconstitutional and void In August the Croatian government tore up a PPA signed between Enron and a previous government The contract was considered to be unaffordable and was allegedly signed in suspicious circumstances Enron subsequently abandoned the original agreement In September the Philippines took a decision to not renew financially crippling contracts with IPPs Controversy has accompanied the Dabhol project from the start In August the finance ministry had written to the power ministry that the size of the potential liability for a megawatt plant was around Rs crore per year The department of economic affairs had also warned that the risk of counterguarantees being invoked was not unreal given that state electricity bills had been defaulting in payments Caution was thrown to the winds then The least India can do now is ask for a renegotiation But does the Indian government have the courage to go eyeballtoeyeball with Enron and not blink first Scrapping the power purchase agreement involves a onetime payment of Rs crore However India would save over Rs crore by doing so There would be a net saving even after writing off FI loans to Dabhol Power Company IDBI whose life is it anyway Tamal Bandyopadhyay Business Standard Copyright c Business Standard On April a terse oneline announcement by the finance ministry gave the acting chairman and managing director of Industrial Development Bank of India IDBI S K Chakrabarti a threemonth extension The government was generous enough not to keep the CMD as well as the institution waiting till late evening which it normally does for the fax message from North Block But the acting IDBI chief may be asked to step down even in three weeks if the government is able to identify his successor He has been reappointed for a period of three months or till a regular CMD takes charge whichever is earlier Could there have been a better way to insult the countrys largest financial institution and its chief First the government planned to merge the Industrial Finance Corporation of India IFCI which is on the brink of collapse under the burden of ballooning nonperforming assets with IDBI to make them sink together Unable to push through the proposal in the face of stiff resistance put up by IDBI the government now appears to be keen on leading the countrys premier financial institution to its grave alone This not by giving an extension to the existing acting chief but by failing to identify his successor and thereby continuing the uncertainty at the top Nothing can move in an organisation when the CEO himself does not know how long he will survive Indias financial institutions have been repositioning themselves by going shortterm both on the assets as well as the liabilities sides But for that transformation to take effect they need leaders with a longterm tenure at the helm To understand this lets look at whats happening at ICICI another financial institution in the country that is breathing down on IDBIs neck and threatening to overtake it K V Kamath CEO and managing director of ICICI got a second fiveyear term seven days ahead of the expiry of his first term on March Once his second term is complete Kamath will have ended up running the show at ICICI for a decade ICICI does not only give its chief a long term to steer the ship but also grooms talent to take over the institution in due course Kamath was groomed by his predecessor N Vaghul In turn he is now grooming Nachiket Mor to succeed him Mor a former senior general manager of ICICI has recently been shifted to ICICI Bank as an executive director in charge of wholesale banking He is likely to be made the managing director of the bank when the present incumbent H N Sinor steps down next year Eventually he will take over the mantle from Kamath in by which time his stint at the bank will have given him enough operational experience in addition to his treasury management and other skills Given the circumstances IDBI is fighting a losing battle It will not be surprising if it goes the IFCI way with an uncertain leadership unable to steer a demoralised overstaffed ship becalmed by the apathetic bureaucracy of the North Block This is despite its tremendous brand value in project financing and widespread corporate relationships Carved out of the Reserve Bank of India by an Act of Parliament in IDBI has business relations with virtually every corporate house in India But that is not helping it tide over the crisis because the key to any financial intermediarys success at this juncture is how it handles its resources both currency as well as human In an ideal situation the cost of funds should be lower while the cost of human resources should be marketdriven In IDBIs case it is the reverse its cost of funds is on the higher side in the absence of aggressive treasury operations and it is not allowed to pay marketdriven salary to its employees The net result There has been an exodus of talent from IDBI and the institution is struggling to stay afloat just when recession has prompted corporations to cut back on their borrowings IDBIs sanctions and disbursements have been falling and nonperforming assets increasing It is sitting on piles of cash but finding deployment avenues hard to come by Two former chiefs of IDBI S H Khan and G P Gupta spent a large chunk of their tenure and energy pleading with the finance ministry to delink IDBIs salary structure from that of the Reserve Bank of India but without success Small wonder that Chakrabarti who became acting chairman on February for a threemonth term has singled out the low morale of the staff as his prime concern He wants to address this on a war footing The Centre has now successfully demoralised him by offering him another uncertain term Former finance minister Manmohan Singh accepted Khans argument on marketdriven package he reportedly wanted a pay scale for his employees that was higher ICICIs but could not do anything about it P Chidambaram repeated Singhs failure on this front and Yashwant Sinha too thinks the proposal is not worth considering because it will have a ripple effect in the industry For instance RBI employees will immediately demand their pound of flesh The finance ministry refuses to see the point that the countrys central bank is not a commercial organisation and does not have to compete with ICICI When three successive finance ministers failed to address IDBIs problems the institution went for soft options It ended up appointing three consultants for restructuring in six years First Booz Allen Hamilton in followed by M B Athreya in and finally Boston Consulting Group The third consultant BCG is yet to submit its report While Booz Allen Hamilton charted out the roadmap for diversification and suggested that the institution spread its wings overseas and tap new business opportunities the Athreya panel said it must convert itself into a bank and the governments stake should come down without delay Over the last few years the institution has been planning its conversion into a bank and blaming the economy for its indifferent performance even as ICICI has been going full steam with new initiatives ICICI Bank is also exploiting synergies with its parent to the hilt while IDBI Bank seems to be embarrassed about ackowledging its pedigree Its not that everything is great at ICICI Over the past few years the institution has lost some senior executives ISec managing director Kishore Chaukar left to join the Tata group ICICI senior general managers Anando Mukherji joined Enron and N J Subaiah took charge at Centurion Bank which he subsequently left The industry suspects the quality of ICICIs assets and is not comfortable with the scorching pace of growth Even the wellpaid ICICI executive cadres find the pace of work is too much to handle and complain of fatigue In private they hate the mad rush for excellence And yet there is a method in ICICIs madness It has trimmed the flab with two successive voluntary retirement schemes branched out into consumer loans in a big way and transformed treasury operations into an art The finance ministry would do well to explore the possibility of divesting the governments stake in IDBI to ICICI Instead of pumping in Rs crore as recapitalisation funds into IFCI it can simply let it die and sell its assets to other banks and financial institutions IDBIs bulk and the brand name in project financing would combine well with ICICIs growing retail presence and unbridled aggression The combination would be formidable enough to give the State Bank of India a run for its money Of course a whole lot of issues need to settled before the process takes off like trimming the flab in IDBI and delinking it from the RBI pay structure et al IDBI merging with ICICI may sound like an absurd dream but it is certainly a better option than merging IFCI with IDBI If Reliance is willing to bid for staterun oil majors HPCL and

direction now it has abandoned plans to become a multiutility The group no longer believes adequate returns can be earned from developing a growing range of products to sell to its more than m customers The investment required to develop national brands win new customers and retain old ones is too high in an increasingly competitive UK retail sector it says Mr Russell who as Scottish Powers former finance director was closely associated with the previous policy has already withdrawn from joint ventures with Royal Bank of Scotland to provide financial services and with Thus to provide

electricity and gas to Southern Water customers let alone other products has been disappointing it admits The group plans to concentrate on developing its energy interests in the UK and US But these also have their difficulties Some of the biggest problems involve PacifiCorp bought months ago in a deal worth about obn including debt The price is looking more expensive following big rises in US electricity wholesale prices PacifiCorp has not been as badly affected as some US electricity groups But it has faced problems because of a power station breakdown in Utah that forced it to buy higher priced electricity from other generators to meet customer demand The failure of a MW generating unit at its Hunter power plant in November has cost the group m om a day since One piece of good news for shareholders today will be the timing of its return to service this month Another positive note is that PacifiCorp is negotiating higher retail prices with US state regulators to offset increased generation charges It also has about MW of its own new power plant due to start production this year In the UK the group is facing increased competition for retail electricity and gas sales particularly in the household market It has also had to absorb big price cuts imposed on its power distribution side by Ofgem the industry regulator The shares which fell p on Wednesday to p have fallen by more than per cent against the FTSE All Share Index since December when the PacifiCorp offer was announced So where does the group go from here It made its reputation in the s as a shrewd acquirer of UK utilities Southern Water for obn and Manweb the northwest of England electricity supplier for obn Effective cost cutting increased value particularly at Manweb The group was also one of the first electricity companies to string telecommunication lines along its electricity pylons The sale of a per cent stake in Thus which operates the telecoms network raised obn in Financing further UK and US acquisitions will be challenging Thus shares have fallen from p a year ago to p on Wednesday night Scottish Power has net debt of some obn with interest thinly covered three times by earnings before tax and interest It has been talking with Enron about buying Portland General its Oregonbased electricity utility The group might need to sell Southern to cover the purchase price of about bn including debt Buying in the UK may be even harder Scottish Power has been outbid recently for regional electricity suppliers by the deeper pockets of large continental European utilities What Scottish Powers shareholders will want to know is where growth will come from and how the group will pay for it USA UPDATE Calpine Kinder Morgan plan NMCalif natgas line Reuters English News

I refer of course to Californias energy market or as the power generators call it Who Wants to be a MultiBillionaire Its becoming clear that this game is fixed Regis is giving all of the questions What color is the sky to contestants like Enron and Reliant PGE and Southern California Edison Meanwhile we consumers are hit with How many kwh did the BPA generate in the month of May Sorry youre out of lifelines How are consumers supposed to compete in this game Even our legislators who belong to the same party as Gov Gray The Negotiator Davis dont know whats going on Its like trying to play poker while everybody else is holding the cards said Assemblywoman Pat Wiggins But while we may not be holding the cards well for sure be left holding the bag when this thing plays out So who do we blame State Sen Wes Chesbro has an idea In the long term the gougers need to be held accountable he said in a Monday article Ah yes The gougers Those outrageous outofstate dirty dealing pricefixing electricityrate gougers who have driven PGE right into bankruptcy and threaten to do the same to Southern California Edison Lets get em But hold on a minute It turns out that some of those gougers that caused PGE and Edison all that trouble are just PGE and Edison wearing different hats Both utilities produce power and sell it on the same market as the gougers Then they buy it back Also out there with the Enrons and Reliant Energies of the world the other power generators that sell electricity to the utilities is a company called National Energy Group It has power plants in states and controls a natural gas pipeline to Northern California And its owned by PGE Corp the parent company of PGE Co Try to keep up with me here PGE Co is the company that has been so devastated by Californias energy deregulation debacle Its the company to which you are writing monthly checks that are beginning to resemble your mortgage payment It is the company that for decades was guaranteed a profit by the rates set by the states Public Utilities Commission It is the company that said it lost billions before it declared bankruptcy last month Poor PGE Co PGE Corp on the other hand is squatting in tall cotton as my daddy used to say The Corp received more than billion from the Co from according to a PUC audit But the Corp says it wouldnt be fair if it had to put any of that money back into the Co its ailing subsidiary It wants the people whose utility bills created that profit to pay higher bills now to bail out the Co so the Corp can avoid bankruptcy of its own Who is being unfair Meanwhile Southern California Edison also has been shipping its profits also more than billion at last report to its parent company while looking to the state for a bailout Now Gov Gray The Generator Davis wants the taxpayers of this state to pay billion to Southern California Edison for that utilitys transmission system But as far as I can tell Edisons rate payers already paid to build maintain and operate that system with rates set by the PUC that guaranteed that company a profit Now were being asked to buy what those ratepayers built I know that PGEs and Edisons accountants and public relations people would argue that Im all wrong here And to tell the truth when I try to follow the money through a maze of stranded costs and contract power and uncollected power purchase costs and rate reduction bond credits and the like my eyes start to blur But theres nothing wrong with my sense of smell so I can tell you for sure this whole thing stinks What can we do Turn off the lights and scream Call Coursey at or email LNG carriage to be preserve of Indiaflag ships Lloyds List International Copyright C LLoyds List Source World Reporter TM In an attempt to cash in on the liquefied natural gas revolution Indias shipping ministry is pushing through a proposal to restrict the transportation of the gas only to companies registered in India and vessels carrying the Indian flag It would seem that the logic primarily is to ensure that Indian shipping does not get left behind in the LNG transportation race Until now the ministry has managed to get LNG ferried by energy companies on fob basis We hope that this new proposal would give further impetus to Indian bottoms says shipping secretary Michael Pinto We will do all we can to get approval from the committee of secretaries and the Cabinet Since some of the shipping contracts have already been finalised this proposal would only be made applicable to future contracts However shipping experts are extremely doubtful whether the proposal can be implemented The leading Indian shipping companies have neither the funds nor the expertise of carrying LNG and would need the assistance of foreign companies to make the ventures a success A foreign LNG carrier is not going to settle for a minority stake unless the Indian shipper is able to put up his share of the equity which would be quite a handful says Sudhir J Mulji executive vicechairman of Great Eastern Shipping Company and current president of the Indian National Shipowners Association The proposal really does not seem to be feasible For the moment just two major contracts have been signed both involving the stateowned Shipping Corporation of India SCI The first one involves SCI American power major Enron and Mitsui of Japan for the carriage of m tonnes of LNG per annum for Enrons MW mega power project at Dabhol near Ratnagiri in southern Maharashtra SCI had entered into this memorandum of understanding with MOL formerly Mitsui OSK Lines and Atlantic Commercial Finance which is an Enron affiliate However it is only a partner in the consortium with Enron holding a stake and Mitsui OSK the balance The gas will be ferried by the LNG Lakshmi brandnew cu m capacity vessel being constructed in Japan at the Mitsui Shipyard The contract is valid for years from the date of starting However the consortium is registered in the Cayman Islands which is a tax haven and the LNG vessel will carry the flag of Malta SCI has also secured the contract for carrying m tonnes per annum of LNG for the governmentowned pipeline company Petronet LNG The gas is to be ferried from RasGas of Qatar to the companys upcoming LNG terminal at Dahej in Gujarat A similar Petronet terminal but half the size of Dahej is coming up in Kochi Kerala state The transportation contract for this is to be decided later Two other major Indian shipowners who have taken a step towards LNG transportation are Great Eastern Shipping and Essar Shipping The former has formed a consortium with Indian Oil Corporation and Exmar while Essar has joined hands with Malaysia International Shipping Corporation MISC to form a joint venture dedicated to gas transportation The Dollars bn MISC the national shipping line of Malaysia is one of the worlds leading owners and operators of LNG tankers As a listed company on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange MISC has the stateowned petroleum and oil giant Petronas a Fortune company as its largest shareholder with a stake of Our memorandum of understanding has both companies holding an equal equity share in the joint venture said Essar Shippings chief executive Sanjay Mehta However at a later date we may both dilute our stakes equally in favour of a third strategic partner and continue to hold equal equity The final debtequity ratio for the acquisition of the LNG vessels will be decided by the management of the joint venture Shipping secretary Mr Pinto feels that there are many opportunities for Indian companies but is insistent that the tonnage be registered in India so that ancillary business activities in the sector are spurred We will try and secure tax benefits for the shipowners concerned since they badly need to gain the experience management and manpower training in a niche segment he said It would also help in Indian fleet expansion since tonnage has remained virtually stagnant for the last five yearsMichael Pinto impetus BUSINESS SCOTTISHPOWER REPORTEDLY TRYING TO PURCHASE PGE GAIL KINSEY HILL of the Oregonian Staff Portland Oregonian SUNRISE C Copyright c The Oregonian Summary Under such a deal percent

PacifiCorp also serves customers in Washington Idaho Utah Wyoming and California for total of million residential and business customers PGE serves customers primarily in the populous northern Willamette Valley Speculation about the potential hookup with PGE surfaced during the weekend in Britains Observer newspaper In the article an unidentified source described the merger as an obvious

no comment on the rumors said Mark Palmer Houstonbased Enron spokesman We dont comment on market speculation said Rachel Sherrard a spokeswoman for PacifiCorp The speculation whether of substance or whimsy has drawn the attention of state regulators and consumer advocacy groups I think it would get a great deal of scrutiny and I think there would be some serious concerns said Ron Eachus head of

Lloyds List International Copyright C LLoyds List Source World Reporter TM With the Shipping Corporation of India taking a major stake in the Petronet LNG Indias maritime industries a high profile SHIRISH NADKARNI ON the final Thursday of March there was a celebration in NeDelhi involving the four members of the consortium that had bagged the Dollars m liquefied natural gas transportation contract of Petronet LNG It is the Japanese custom to celebrate an event like this and only the consortium members and their officials were invited to the function says KM Joseph director bulk carriers and tankers with the Shipping Corporation of India SCI which has a equity stake in the winning partnership The other members of the consortium are Japans MOL formerly Mitsui OSK Lines NYK Line and K Line and the contract involves ferrying m tonnes per annum of LNG from the Middle East to Petronet LNGs terminal at Dahej in Gujarat Two LNG carriers will be involved in the deal each capable of carrying cu m of gas and expected to cost Dollars m each The vessels are to be constructed at Daewoo Shipbuilding Yard in South Korea This was Indias second major LNG transportation deal and SCI the public sector shipping monolith which owns roughly half of the countrys oceangoing fleet of vessels has a stake in both of them as does MOL MOL is a professionally managed company whose cultural ethos is similar to ours says the goateebearded Prabhat Kumar Srivastava SCIs chairman and managing director Our relationship is based on total transparency and trust and we therefore feel comfortable with them There may well be more such tieups in the future The earlier deal was also sealed with MOL which has a stake in a joint venture named Greenfield Shipping Company GSC with US energy major Enron holding the remaining equity The three members will have joint ownership of the cu m LNG carrier LNG Lakshmi now under construction at the Mitsui Heavy Industries shipyard in Japan When ready the vessel will ferry m tpa of LNG from RasGas of Qatar to Enrons megapower facility at Dabhol near Ratnagiri in southern Maharashtra However to return to the Petronet deal The MOLSCI consortium won the coveted contract by quoting a charter hire rate of Dollars per day which was substantially lower than the bids of the two other competing consortia MISCEssar and ExmarGreat Eastern ShippingIndian Oil Corporation The Petronet LNG deal was the most prestigious and important LNG shipping project in the country and we were very keen to secure it says Mr Srivastava So we told our Japanese partners to quote the best possible rates A stake in the consortium formed with Enron may only be sufficient to net SCI a boardroom presence in GSC but its stake in the Petronet LNG shipping venture will allow the shipping major to exercise much more power on the latter companys board There are other issues involved If we had not emerged winners in Petronets shipping deal it would have done us a lot of harm for the other LNG shipping projects that are fast coming up in the country says Mr Srivastava We have already made tremendous headway in LNG shipping by being part of the Dabhol project and we were very keen to maintain the momentum Experts rate SCI as one of the best managed public sector enterprises and the bottom line of the company reinforces this feeling For the first nine months of the financial year SCI had a sales turnover of Rsbn Dollars m which was better than the Rsbn recorded for the corresponding nine months of the previous year The net profit zoomed from Rsm during the period April to December to Rsbn for the same nine months of While the results for the financial year ended March are still being compiled SCI officials place the sales turnover at around Rsbn and the net profit at just above the Rsbn mark While the companys tankers have produced spectacular results even the lossmaking liner division is expected to turn round the corner We have removed nearly of the nonperforming assets in the division and the balance will be chopped off in the fiscal year says Sudhir S Rangnekar director liner shipping division Recently international consultants Pricewaterhouse Coopers PwC carried out a SWOT analysis for SCI They suggested a corporate transformation of the company apart from going ahead with the information technology initiatives taken earlier The company went ahead and signed a memorandum of understanding with the ministry of shipping for the financial year whereby two new criteria will be used for judging the organisations performance A new criterion corporate transformation project implementation has been introduced in the MoU reflecting the emphasis that we are placing on enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of

FERCS LATEST REFUND ORDERS Foster Electric Report c Copyright Foster Associates Inc About the same time that PGE Corp and Edison International announced combined writeoffs of nearly billion in unrecovered purchased power costs four major California energy suppliers reported increases ranging from percent to percent in firstquarter revenues Meanwhile FERC has issued new refund orders requiring many of these same generators to justify in overcharges during March PGE and Southern California Edison Cos WriteOffs After a long delay PGE and Edison during the middle of April confirmed what many knew was coming huge writeoffs for unrecovered purchased power costs during the year Edison announced that it was writing off billion in undercollected power costs for the year leaving the company with a billion loss for the year Edison chief John Bryson was hopeful nevertheless that a recent memorandum of understanding MOU his company signed with the state will allow Edison to recover some of those costs and help keep its Southern California Edison Co SoCal Edison affiliate out of bankruptcy Prompt implementation of the MOU can avoid the large costs of a SoCal Edison bankruptcy and make it possible for the company to restore its financial health and ability to maintain a reliable power grid said Bryson in a statement accompanying Edisons financial results Whether Brysons hope for quick implementation of the MOU will be realized is questionable Gov Gray Davis has been having a hard time finding the necessary legislative support for the proposal and to date has been unable even to find a legislator to sponsor a bill to implement the MOU Instead several state legislators are exploring alternatives including having the state buy SoCal Edisons transmission assets as well as the whole utility and turn it into a state power agency Edisons northern California neighbor PGE Corp reported a strong growth in revenues for led by the strong performance of its energy trading unit but that revenue growth was completely offset by the billion in losses incurred by its now bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric Co utility subsidiary While standard accounting rules required the utility to record a charge against earnings for unreimbursed wholesale and transition costs taking this charge does not diminish our conviction that the utility is entitled under law to recover these costs nor does it diminish our ongoing lawsuit in federal district court said PGE Corp chief Robert Glynn Generators FirstQuarter Revenue Reports In sharp contrast with PGEs and Edisons financial performance the parent companies of four of Californias largest generators reported large jumps in firstquarter revenues Enron Corp reported revenues of billion a whopping percent increase from a year earlier The company owns only a small amount of wind generation in California but sells power into the state through its Portland General Electric subsidiary and is an energy trader in the state Enrons commodity sales and service unit showed a percent increase in firstquarter earnings Reliant Energy Inc saw firstquarter earnings jump percent to billion The companys wholesale energy business unit produced million in operating income for the first quarter up sharply from the million loss the company reported a year earlier Reporting a slightly lower but still a substantial percent jump in firstquarter revenues was Dynegy Inc Of the companys billion in revenues for the period its marketing and trading subsidiary realized million in earnings nearly double the in earnings reported a year earlier The parent company reported a percent jump in first quarter earnings over the previous year Duke Energy Corp announced a percent boost in firstquarter revenues to billion led by a percent increase in earnings by wholesale energy unit FERCs Refund Order Similar to separate orders regarding January and February power sales in California FERC on issued a notice demanding that three generators justify in combined power sales during March FERC staff set a MWh proxy clearing price for the month and then applied it to the hours of Stage power alerts that were declared during March in California The staffs proxy prices for January and February were MWh and MWh respectively The clearing prices fluctuations can be attributed to changes in operating costs including fuel and emissions credits The latest refund order is the smallest of the three asking for cost support for just in transactions while the previous two orders cited a combined million in potential overcharges The three wholesale sellers being questioned by the current refund order Dynegy Power Marketing Inc Mirant California Mirant Delta and Mirant Portrero and Williams Energy Services Corp were named in the previous orders as well Once again Dynegy led the pack with the largest amount of potential refunds for March nearly Combined with the previous two orders the company is on the hook for more than

boycott help lower Californias electricity bill By MICHAEL LIEDTKE AP Business Writer Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved SAN FRANCISCO AP Theres a limit to how much people will pay for most things in life If the cost scares off enough buyers prices eventually fall So what would happen if this textbook example from Economics were applied to Californias electricity crisis What if the state officials struggling to maintain energy supplies simply refused to buy power above a certain price and accepted more blackouts this summer The question would have been absurd just a few months ago and even now the notion seems surreal given the possible consequences Inviting even more blackouts inevitably would hurt businesses and frustrate consumers threatening to further depress Californias already slumping economy the sixth largest in the world But desperate times require drastic measures according to the economists lawmakers and activists who believe the state will be better off sitting in the dark than buying electricity at any price during a summer shortage likely to produce recurring blackouts anyway Its better to use blackouts and break the wholesale energy cartel than simply to suffer them said Michael Shames executive director of the Utility Consumer Action Network a San Diego watchdog group Refusing to buy enough power to keep the lights on would be like playing with fire counters Wells Fargo Co chief economist Sung Won Sohn Blackouts arent a just matter of inconvenience or being too hot or cold They cost businesses a lot of money Buying electricity at the last minute to meet the states power needs already has cost the California government billion in the past months The state energy bill for could reach billion in money otherwise spent on education public safety and health care Shames said Faced with the prospect of a significant budget deficit some lawmakers think its time for California to take a stand against the power wholesalers many of whom are based outside the state This Tuesday the state Senate Energy Committee will consider authorizing the state to refuse to buy power above certain prices Current law requires state electricity managers to avoid blackouts by buying all available power at any cost We have been over a barrel in so many ways said Sen Dede Alpert DCoronado who sponsored SBx Maybe theres a point in the market where we just say no and go with the planned blackout strategy instead Economists give the bill little chance of succeeding Its never going to happen Its not a viable option said University of California at Berkeley Professor Severin Borenstein one of the energy experts who have studied the idea The business lost during blackouts would mean more layoffs in a state already skittish over the technology downturn and the looming Hollywood writers strike economists say Other ripple effects include diminished gasoline supplies leading to even higher prices at the pump and distribution headaches that could leave store shelves bare And some consumers the elderly and the infirm for example need power at any price Without electricity Manteca resident Betty Jarzemkoski said she wouldnt be able to help her ailing husband to get out of his motorized bed at home It would be a real hardship for us said Jarzemkoski Im on a fixed income so I hope they can figure out something to bring down prices But we need power Despite such concerns the concept of a buyers boycott hasnt been flatly ruled out at least publicly by Gov Gray Davis as he struggles to reduce the states staggering electricity bill The state is spending as much as million per day to meet Californias electricity needs and the bleeding is sure to get worse When the summer heat increases demand and tightens supplies California might spend more than billion each week state officials estimate Extended blackouts pose an even greater cost economists say When Northern California suffered rolling blackouts for several hours Jan the economic losses totaled billion mostly from lost profits and wages estimated the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp Multiply that over several weeks across the entire state and it becomes apparent why it makes more sense for California to continue buying power at inflated prices even if leaves the state with deep debts and a ruined credit rating economists argue As it is California probably wont be able to round up enough power at any price on some days this summer making some blackouts a virtual certainty The blackouts will reduce the states economic output by billion to billion according to a study released last month by the Bay Area Economic Forum The resolve of the states politicians and ratepayers would be sorely tested for a boycott to succeed much in the way that labor strikes boil down to whether workers or management can withstand more financial pain Politicians arent going to willingly turn out the lights because politicians want to get reelected said Borenstein director of the University of Californias energy institute As soon as people start losing their jobs because the power is off the public will get tired of the blackouts real quick Still Californians might tolerate an increase in blackouts if they understand why the state chose to pursue such a drastic course said Stanford economics Professor Frank Wolak who heads the Independent System Operators market surveillance committee This isnt something you could do without an enormous public relations campaign he said The campaign would have to explain that the state had no other choice but to do this because federal power regulators arent doing their job and enforcing the law against unjust and unreasonable prices The largest outofstate generators are in such robust financial shape that it might take weeks before they would feel such pain from a California boycott that they would be forced to lower prices After making record profits

Limited BOMBAY May Reuters Indian lenders to US energy group Enron Corps gasfired power plant south of Bombay have appealed to the Indian government to help end the companys row with a stateowned electricity board over pricing and upaid bills The board of Enrons Indian unit Dabhol Power Co DPC has authorised management to stop selling power to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB if a bitter dispute over pricing and unpaid bills cannot be resolved In the past half year the MSEB has defaulted on bills for electricity supplied by Dabhol which operates the worlds largest gasfired plant on the west coast of India kilometres miles south of Bombay Indian financial institutions which contributed billion towards the project in loans are pressing the government to help end the crisis a source told Reuters We have asked the government for help We are awaiting their reply the source who is employed with a large financial institution said The domestic lenders to the project are Industrial Development Bank of India ICICI Ltd Industrial Finance Corporation of India Canara Bank and State Bank of India The Dabhol Power Company DPC owned percent by Enron last month took the major step of bailing out of the billion power project citing nonpayment of bills by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB The DPC boards move sparked widespread fears that Indias image as a safe destination for foreign direct investment would be damaged POWER STRUGGLE MSEB which is a stateowned utility has been a regular defaulter on payments to DPC saying that it finds the power too costly It has also backed out on its commitment to buy more power to be produced by the projects second phase which is to begin operations later this year Last month MSEB said it had paid Dabhol Power billion rupees million for electricity it bought in March But the payment only partially resolves the total overdue amount of billion rupees million which Enron has been unable to collect even after invoking guarantees issued by the government of Maharashtra Indias most industrialised state and the federal government The state utility still owes Enron payments for power purchases in December and January The Indian government has maintained that the contract must be renegotiated and has set up a committee to do so We are concerned and would like the renegotiations to happen fast the source added The dispute has raised fears that Enron could pull the plug on the project cease providing power to the local state electricity board and perhaps even sell the plant The plant is good

recurring themes of Bushs first days has been the extraordinary influence the oil and gas industry has had in the new administration Oil and gas interests are some of Bushs top campaign contributors giving more than million to get Bush elected In exchange Bush has rolled back regulations issued by the Clinton administration on such things as air conditioner efficiency as well as breaking his campaign promise to regulate carbon dioxide emissions Bush has proposed drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and national monuments Bush has taken a backseat when it comes to the energy crisis California is experiencing while cutting funding for energy conservation programs He has also repaid top donors lobbyists and industry officials with key positions throughout his administration

EDT UK INTERVIEWInnogy starts trading power in mainland Europe By Stuart Penson Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited LONDON May Reuters British utility Innogy said on Thursday it had started trading wholesale electricity on the FrenchItalian border and was set to enter the German power market We have done some wholesale trading on the ItalyFrance border moving power from France to Italy and we are very close to doing some in Germany said director of trading Tony West in an interview with Reuters This year we will significantly increase our trading in mainland Europe we are discussing relationships with counterparties at the moment he added Innogy is building a European power trading team at its headquarters in Swindon southern England from where it already trades the UK gas and power markets FRANCE COULD BE KEY MARKET West said the company initially had expected the main focus of its European trading strategy to be Germany and the north west of the continent But the early signs were that France would also play a key role particularly as Innogy had gained access to capacity in the UKFrance undersea interconnector cable France has taken me by surprise It might be more important than we anticipated although there are clearly still issues about the speed of liberalisation said West A core of about eight companies regularly trade power in France including TXU Europe Enron and a trading alliance between Endesa and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter according to traders West said Innogy had so far concentrated on buying power in France not always from French companies and taking it to Italy via the cross border interconnector between the two countries Innogy had bought some of the megawatts available on the interconnector through recent auctions he said Its easy to trade through France the cost of taking power through to the border is minuscule although buying power in France and then selling it in France is a lot more difficult said West He said Innogy had signed grid balancing agreements with French transmission grid operator RTE Andy Duff managing director of generation and trading added France could become become important for Innogy on a retail level as well as a trading level depending on how effectively the UKFrance interconnector could be used The European market will be driven by the operation of interconnectors and transmission services as well as exchanges said Duff Innogy may look to trade on Germanys two power exchanges as well as that countrys burgeoning overthecounter market The company is in the process of signing standard trading agreements for Germany based on the terms devised by the industry group the European Federation of Energy Traders EFET FOCUS ON TRADING NOT ASSETS Duff said Innogys strategy in Europe was to focus on trading but not the acquisition of physical assets We are not going to lead with assets in Europe We will focus on trading servicestype arrangements extracting value from other companies assets Thats the main thrust of the business he said West said Innogys trading in mainland Europe would expand into natural gas as opportunities emerged The company already trades around the UKBelgium

improved their ability to pay back debt in recent weeks making their bonds a buy investors said Sentiment seems to be changing said Anna LeesJones who helps manage about billion pounds billion of corporate bonds at MG Investment Management Ive been building up my telecoms position all year British Telecoms year eurodenominated bonds sold in January yield about basis points more than government debt down from a record in March Contracts that pay out if the company goes bankrupt have also fallen in the past month according to Enron Corp which trades the derivatives Bond yields and bankruptcy derivatives have also declined for Deutsche Telekom and Royal KPN NV after the companies said they would sell assets to pay down debt that has pushed their credit ratings to record lows and weighed on their shares Phone companies sold billion of bonds last year to finance licenses and equipment for new mobile services British Telecom said yesterday it will sell its stakes in Japan Telecom Co and Spains Airtel SA to Vodafone Group for billion pounds British Telecom may also sell as much as billion pounds of shares to existing investors in a socalled rights offer according to Legal General Group Plc one of the companys shareholders Deutsche Telekom will sell assets such as cable television and a stake in Global One and Wind SpA Chief Financial Officer KarlGerhard Eick said last week KPN the biggest Dutch phone company said on March it plans to raise at least billion euros from asset sales to lower debt Those plans have helped shift investors perceptions of the companies creditworthiness money managers said Drastic Measures At the beginning of the year the market was assuming telecoms companies would be downgraded from singleA to triple B said Peter Harvey who helps run about billion at FC Management Drastic measures such as deeplydiscounted rights issues led investors to believe they will maintain their singleA status The gap or spread between British Telecoms sterling denominated bonds maturing in and UK fiveyear government bonds has narrowed basis points to basis points in the past month Spreads between Deutsche Telekoms percent five year euro bonds and German government debt narrowed basis points to in April Bankruptcy Swaps Fall Those shifts in sentiment are also reflected in Enrons bankruptcy swaps where prices have fallen in the past month said Simon Brooks a trader at Enron Enron prices the swaps using indexes that measure the probability of bankruptcy and the likely recovery rate in that event The price is expressed as a percentage above a benchmark interest rate such as the London interbank offered rate or Libor British Telecom bankruptcy swaps have declined to basis points from on April Enron said Bankruptcy swaps on Deutsche Telekom dropped to from while KPNs fell to from Over the same period France Telecom SAs declined to from and Telecom Italia SpAs fell to from British Telecoms bond yields may fall further relative to government debt analysts said They still offer higher yields than those of rival Vodafone Group Plc which has the same ratings though with a stable outlook While both companies have fiveyear eurodenominated bonds British Telecoms offer basis points more yield The rivals also both have bonds maturing in and Vodafones yield about basis points fewer If BT retains their rating their spreads should be probably to basis points narrower said Brian Venables head of credit strategy at WestLB Even though it has performed extremely well this year there is much greater potential for BTs debt Debt Reduction Target Both Moodys Investors Service which rates British Telecom A and Standard Poors which rates it A have those ratings on watch for further cuts after trimming them four rungs last year The companys asset sales to Vodafone are definitely positive in terms of the rating assessment said Aidan Fisher who rates British Telecom for Moodys In combination with the proceeds of a rights sale that would meet the target they set themselves this year thats quite a lot to achieve in a month period British Telecom has said it wants to slash its billion pounds of debt by a third and fend off further rating cuts Before companies such as British Telecom clarified their debtreduction plans the world and his wife were underweight telecom bonds in March said Harvey at FC The investment

analysis on Bloomberg BRITEL Corp GO for BTs bonds DT Corp GO for Deutsche Telekoms bonds UKCorporates warm to charms of credit derivatives By Tom Bergin Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited LONDON May Reuters European corporates are beginning to turn to credit derivatives among the more esoteric and complex of financial instruments to hedge the risk their debtors wont pay up market participants said on Thursday Credit derivatives are insurancelike tools that allow users to hedge the risk of default on a debt They are mainly used by banks hedge funds and insurance companies to hedge or gain exposure to the risk of a bond issuer defaulting Dealers said an environment of deteriorating credit quality and a growing awareness among corporates that credit derivatives offer certain advantages over established hedging tools was behind the increasing use of the instruments The market remains small with only around a dozen nonfinancial European corporates regularly using credit derivatives to manage their credit portfolio at present But market professionals predict they will one day become as commonplace in the corporate world as other hedging tools such as interest rate swaps and currency options We see corporate use as a big growth area for credit derivatives maybe the biggest says Bryan Seyfried vicepresident of Enron Credit in London Enron Credit grew out of the efforts of energy company Enron Corp to hedge its own credit risk portfolio and now specialises in marketing credit risk management solutions to other nonfinancial corporates Ralf Lierow director of credit derivatives at Siemens Financial Services in Munich said the ability to buy and sell in a liquid market means credit derivatives offer a flexibility that established tools like credit insurance and forfaiting guarantees lack Credit derivatives were are often cheaper than the alternatives too he added This is not a trading book thing For us the credit default swap is another tool for credit risk management Lierow said HELPS OPERATIONAL UNITS DO MORE BUSINESS Siemens Financial Services acts as the centralised risk portfolio management operation for companies within the Siemens electronics and industrial group It first started using credit derivatives in July Large companies like Siemens can have hundreds of millions of dollars in receivables on their books at any time The efficiency with which these companies manage the credit risk on their receivables has an impact on their day to day business The advantage for the operative area is that they can offload more receivables and do more business Lierow said Siemens uses credit default swaps the most liquid type of credit derivatives to hedge its portfolio of debtors on a constant basis As the balance of cash owed by each name fluctuates over time the company tries to match this with default swap positions Hence if a customer fails to pay Siemens can recoup the debt from the default swap seller Other companies use credit derivatives less frequently There are occasional corporate users that have secured oneoff requirements for balancesheet management aims or to strip out the credit risk of a commercial transaction said Walter Gontarek head of global credit products at RBC Dominion Securities By hedging a country or company risk which a corporate may not be comfortable in carrying a credit derivative can facilitate a project that may otherwise be unfeasible dealers said NOT PUT OFF BY BAD PRESS Corporates adoption of credit derivatives is in spite of the negative publicity the instruments have received in recent years A number of disputes over whether protection buyers could force banks to pay up on contracts have ended up in court However traders insist that subsequent work done on contract documentation minimises the risk of such disputes in future Nonetheless a very practical concern for corporates remains in that credit derivatives documentation was designed by bankers with sovereign and corporate bonds in mind The International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA standard documentation for credit default swaps allows for a payout in relation to defaults on bond payments but not on a private debtors failure to pay We use the ISDA framework but we need it redrafted in specific ways to fit our needs You cannot take a standard contract and trade on it if you want to hedge trade receivables Lierow said These amendments add to the cost of the credit derivative Another problem that corporates face is the complexity of credit derivatives There is little experience of the instruments which are barely a decade old in the corporate world Siemens had to get its expertise from the financial markets hiring Lierow from Bankgesellschaft Berlin Clive Banks UK head of derivatives sales to buyside clients at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney said much of the effort in marketing credit derivatives to corporates involves educating them about the products and the risks involved Its about explaining credit risk management and what kind of volatility and cost having credit risk introduces he said OUTLOOK PROMISING Yet some corporates are beginning to take full advantage of their new tool Lierow said that Siemens which currently only buys credit protection planned to start acting as a default swaps seller in the coming months He said selling would facilitate better matching of protection levels to actual exposures and would enable diversification of risk away from industry sectors where the companys activities are concentrated You could improve the portfolio mix by buying protection on automotives and selling protection on pharmaceuticals he said Allegheny Energy buys three power plants Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press

the profit margin in natural gasfired power in to a megawatthour from MWh a difference from their last forecast in February They lowered their power price index for by and for by Thursday in a published report Their forecast is based on forward markets for electricity and gas Gas prices are remaining strong for a much longer period of time while power prices drop off senior electricity industry analyst Raymond Niles said in a telephone conference with investors As a result stock prices for power producers such as AES Corp AES Mirant MIR Calpine Corp CPN and NRG Energy NRG could peak this summer in advance of strong third quarter earnings reports the Salomon report says Investors may still shy away from asset and investmentheavy power producers if realized prices begin to reflect the decreases in power prices now projected in the forward curve the report warns After this summer the stocks of energy companies that focus more on trading will regain momentum Salomon expects These energy merchant companies such as Enron Corp ENE Williams Cos WMB Duke Energy DUK and Dynegy DYN should be able to take advantage of higher trading volume and greater volatility in power markets in nonsummer months according to Salomon We expect annual trading volumes to grow industrywide between and on average during as the billion global energy commodity market continues to open the report predicts The overall electricity price trend is national according to Salomon The report titled Power Curve expects wholesale power prices to exceed last years by in the West and by on average in the eastern US including Texas But since their last forecast the analysts lowered their forward price curve for next year and beyond in of regional power pools Interestingly the exception to that is the New York Power Pool Niles told investors For the remainder of this year however Salomon still expects power producers to beat substantially last years breakthrough results About of the spike upward in western US power prices the past six months has been from something weve never seen before in this industry political and credit risk Niles said in the conference Western merchant power suppliers are benefitting from the unholy mess in California Niles said but that wont last forever Whenever the debate tapers off and we have a resolution in sight that premium will slowly drain out of the western markets and bring down profitability for the group Niles said National calls for reregulation due to the California crisis could continue to hurt stock prices for the entire sector even though reregulation wont happen Further in so far as such calls discourage investment in generating plants transmission lines and gas pipelines they could also extend the current period of extremely high

Company and Dynegy Canada midstream assets An additional million of equity is expected to be sold in the coming months to pay down shortterm debt and complete the permanent financing The improvement in Rating Outlook primarily reflects NBPs demonstrated commitment to undertake conservative longterm financing and operating strategies Future acquisitions at the partnership level are expected to be financed debtequity so as to maintain financial flexibility and a stable credit profile Moreover management has shown a strong bias to minimize commodity price risk as it expands its nonregulated gas

committee and understand their thoughts we will not present any proposal DPC said it had constantly maintained that it was open to maintaining a dialogue towards resolving issues But This meeting should in no manner be construed as an open offer from DPC to renegotiate the terms of the contract it added DPC and the government of the western state of Maharashtra have been locked in a payment battle for months with the states electricity board balking at paying Enron what it considers too high a rate for electricity At present Maharashtras State Electricity Board MSEB owes the DPC of which

investment missteps and unexpected disasters UK verticallyintegrated utility Scottish Power SPI is hoping a new strategy to streamline its businesses will signal a more focused period for the company But its got its work cut out While investors were cheered by news that its US Utahbased Hunter power plant is back online after a sixmonth outage that cost the company an estimated million uncertainty over its plans for its Southern Water unit and apparent ongoing commitment to lossmaking telecoms venture Thus are seen as muddling group focus It all adds up the lack of coherent strategy quite substantial downgrades and a whole host of noncore businesses that they dont have any natural management flair or expertise in said Brian Gallagher a senior fund manager at Londonbased Gartmore Investment Management which has GBP million of Scottish Power shares in its Global Utilities Fund We have a reasonably low opinion of the company The company said Thursday that its pretax profit before goodwill amortization and exceptional items for the fiscal year ending March fell to GBP million from GBP million a year ago Adjusted earnings per share declined to pence in the fiscal year from pence in The company acknowledged profits have been hit hard by the Hunter outage competition on wholesale and retail markets in the UK and strict price controls on its regulated infrastructure businesses Although the companys shares were trading at pence after the release of Thursdays earnings results up from pence Wednesday they are down more than from pence a year ago Executives say they are restructuring the business into three targeted divisions to capitalize on its traditional strengths in generation and power supply and infrastructure and to expand its overseas activities Weve now got a trading and commercial link between generation and supply and the first thing we are doing is putting emphasis on thaton growing earnings across that value chain Scottish Power Chief Executive Ian Russell told journalists in a conference call Thursday In the US we are focused on cost cutting and on acquiring new businesses Scottish Powers move away from a full multiutility profile begun last year with its partial disposal of Thus and its withdrawal from an Internet banking venture with the Royal Bank of Scotland toward a more narrowly focused energy business mimics a trend across the industry toward greater specialization The company is also considering selling Southern Water which would allow it to focus even more closely on its power business Yet analysts and investors say they are looking for more details of the companys overall growth strategy from Russell who took over as chief executive last month and other managers The toll from months of drift is evident they said Sales Of Southern Water Thus Seen Indeed despite its efforts to chart a new road Scottish Power appears to be reluctant to acknowledge the failure of some of its noncore ventures Russell said his company remains supportive of Thus which reported a fiscal year loss of GBP million this week and has no plans to exit its remaining stake in the company Similarly he said Scottish Power hasnt yet made a final decision to dispose of Southern Water which has cut costs under its Scottish parent but is increasingly unable to cover its capital expenditure although he said the company had received a number of offers from potential buyers Although he declined to identify any of the bidders Italian energy company Enel SpA ENI has confirmed its interest Industry sources said a prompt sale of the water unit looks likely with some bids already exceeding the GBP billion at which many analysts value the companys combined assets and debt Its unclear they said how Southern Water or Thus would fit into Scottish Powers new image Scottish Power sees itself as an international energy company a source familiar with the company said In a years time he added it would be unlikely that Southern Water and Thus would be part of the company Revenues from the sale of the water unit would also help Scottish Power pursue its US expansion without adding to its gearing levels analysts and investors said Russell declined to comment on reports Scottish Power is considering buying Enron Corps Oregonbased unit Portland General but admitted the company would be a logical geographical fit with Pacificorp Analysts said Scottish Powers plans for US growth is likely to be a key part of its energy strategy We like their US strategy where theyve leveraged expertise gained in the highly competitive UK

Missing link by Claire Poole The Daily Deal Copyright c The Deal LLC Buying Illinova gave Dynegy a key piece in a puzzle for trading energy anywhere anytime When Chuck Watson decided to take his company beyond natural gas trading he changed its name to Dynegy Inc and took as its logo a tangram a sevenpiece puzzle that can be assembled in thousands of ways Buying utility Illinova Corp in February gave him a piece for delivering such flexibility The Illinova acquisition was probably the most welltimed and best conceived buy of the year raves Jeremy Butler an analyst at Value Line Publishing Inc ReportCard DYNEGY ILLINOVA Stock Price A Profitability B Strategy A Braintrust B Culture B Competitive Position A Overall A Why Besides providing electricity to customers in a squaremile area in Illinois Decatur Illbased Illinova also had recently received regulatory approval to transfer its coal and gasfired generating plants megawatts in all to an unregulated subsidiary as part of the states deregulation of its electricity industry Thanks to soaring energy prices as well as to million to million in overall earnings estimated or achieved from optimizing Illinovas generation assets and improving its operating efficiencies Dynegy is seeing the effects of the deal on its bottom line Illinova has been extremely accretive to earnings said M Carol Coale an analyst at Prudential Securities in Houston Last year in fact Dynegys revenues nearly doubled to billion while its net earnings almost tripled to million or per diluted share as a result of the billion Illinova deal In the first quarter Dynegys net earnings jumped Investors have been amply rewarded Dynegys stock took off last year jumping to per share making it the second best performing stock in the Standard Poors Since the Illinova deal was announced June Dynegys stock has skyrocketed an astounding from to One of those happy investors is San Franciscobased oil and gas giant Chevron Corp which owns about of Dynegy For Watson who formed Dynegy in the late s out of Houston energy company NGS Corp where he was CEO and chairman the success of the Illinova deal underscores his quest to take power and trade it anywhere he wants anytime he wants at any price he wants Thats why he dubbed the company Dynegy a hybrid name taken by combining dynamic with energy If energy prices stay high and Dynegys traders continue to make winning bets analysts expect the companys net earnings per share to increase another this year to million or per share But Dynegy hasnt been immune to the power crisis afflicting California where it coowns four power plants with NRG Energy Inc of Minneapolis that generate megawatts of capacity Indeed since the crisis began Dynegys been defending itself against allegations that its overcharging for power The California situation has hurt Dynegy in other ways too On April for example its stock fell to after utility Pacific Gas Electric Co a unit of PGE Corp filed for bankruptcy Dynegy provides power to the California market as a wholesaler but not to PGE directly Dynegy has also been quibbling recently with another teetering California utility Sempra Energys San Diego Gas Electric which claimed April that Dynegy ordered it to shutter some of the facilities the utility sold it in but that it still operates because it doesnt think it will get paid Dynegy denied the charge Dynegy did not instruct SDGE to shut down generating units nor did we suggest that we would not make power available to creditworthy buyers Stephen W Bergstrom Dynegys president and COO wrote in a letter to SDGE Chairman and CEO Stephen Baum Dynegy has tried to downplay its exposure to the states power woes Its repeatedly pointed out to the press that its stake in the four power plants in California only represents of its total generating portfolio of megawatts or about Analysts however estimate Dynegys exposure in California could give its earnings a haircut of as much as this year Even so Dynegys stock has recovered to a recent Illinova has created some volatility to Dynegys stock because of the addition of power generation to its business Prudentials Coale said But overall its been a great deal While keeping most of Illinova management in place Dynegy made the companys chairman president and CEO Charles Bayless a nonexecutive director of the combined entity Dynegys also marketing and trading all of Illinovas megawatts of output Theyve streamlined power generation and traded around the assets while keeping the distribution business in a sweet spot said John Olson an analyst at Sanders Morris Harris in Houston Illinova meanwhile solved a big investorrelated problem for Dynegy Before the merger only of Dynegys shares were available to the public As part of the deal Watson convinced two of Dynegys strategic partners British Gas plc and Nova Chemicals to sell their combined stake for approximately million in cash and shares of a new convertible preferred stock It also issued million shares after the deal closed Those moves increased Dynegys float to more than of the shares outstanding which led money managers to flood in The companys market capitalization has since tripled to billion Operationally in its effort to focus on power generation trading and marketing Dynegy has been dumping some of its midstream assets such as processing plants and pipelines particularly in the midContinent region The idea now is to increase Dynegys socalled merchant power capacity or the electricity it sells wholesale to anyone who needs it to megawatts by through acquisitions new construction and asset management agreements As a result Watson has become what some are calling an acquisitions hound Hes already acquired some facilities On Jan Dynegy completed the purchase of two power plants in the Hudson River Valley the megawatt Roseton power plant in Newburgh NY and the megawatt Danskammer plant nearby from various area utilities for million Banc of America Securities llc advised Dynegy on both purchases Dynegy has had trouble picking up other power plants however Witness the deal it announced Nov to acquire megawatts worth of electricitygenerating assets in Nevada from Renobased Sierra Pacific Resources for million The deal got scotched April when Nevada regulators spooked by its nextdoor neighbors power crisis repealed the states electricity deregulation plan and put a moratorium on all power plant sales in the state Dynegy estimated the acquisition would have added cents per share to earnings Still since the Illinova merger the total generating capacity built or acquired by Dynegy now exceeds the total capacity added through the merger That includes megawatts of new natural gasfired generation facilities in Georgia Kentucky and Louisiana that are expected to begin commercial operation by June just in time for summer Like its crosstown rival Enron Corp Dynegy has also expanded via acquisitions into broadband telecommunications Dynegy also competes with Houstonbased Reliant Energy and Charlotte NCbased Duke Energy Both Enron and Dynegy see a big opportunity in broadband given that there are few other suppliers and that managing its movement is akin to whats involved with natural gas or electricity In August Dynegy announced it was acquiring Aurora Colobased Extant Inc a privately held developer of telecom solutions for million in cash and stock It completed the deal in September Then in November Dynegy announced it was acquiring privately held Iaxis Ltd a Londonbased telecom that owned and operated an mile fiberoptic network throughout Europe for almost million Dynegy completed the deal in March Dynegy is now developing a mile fiberoptic cable network in the US that it will link to Iaxis network in Europe It hopes its broadband unit which lost million in the first quarter will be profitable by the second half of Still Dynegy has differentiated itself as the antiEnron because among other things it continues to buy power plants rather than sell them Enron meanwhile has been trying to dump its hard assets such as Portland General Electric in Portland Ore Enron CEO Jeff Skilling a polished former McKinsey Co consultant just wants to be a gobetween and not just in energy but in broadband pulp and paper and metals while Dynegys Watson a scrappy former commodities

Asian Wall Street Journal Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Indias electricity shortage cant be solved without a new approach Indias power problem is back on the front burner because global generating giant Enron is threatening to turn off the lights at its Dhabol plant and walk away from a contract with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board In an effort to collect million owed for electricity already supplied the American company has invoked central government guarantees and declared a political force majeure but without much success So technically India is facing a sovereign default after which Enron would spend years battling through the courts to get compensation for the billion project Of course everyone knows thats not going to happen After more brinksmanship from both sides in the coming days they will have to sit down and negotiate a settlement Some of the problems with Enron are unique to that particular arrangement but in its basic outline the saga epitomizes a flawed attempt to deal with Indias power problem narrowly defined a shortage of generating capacity The country suffers constant blackouts due to a supply shortage of about and even more during times of peak demand In the early s the central government sought to solve this shortfall by opening the doors to private investors like Enron But this proved to be a mistake because power distribution is controlled by the state governments they run it as a system of wealth redistribution rather than a business California recently made the earthshattering discovery that a lack of market pricing at the consumer level leads to disaster But Indias state electricity boards or SEBs proved that long ago they have long been bankrupt and often default on payments to private generators As a result most of the big names in power have now pulled out of India Yes the country does need to worry about generating capacity Its estimated that in the next years demand will more than double with an additional megawatts needed but only half of that is likely to be built That could increase the shortfall during peak demand to a frightening prospect But the first order of business is to reform distribution There is a debate now about how to give state governments the right incentives to reform their SEBs These owe almost billion to central governmentowned generators and mines from whom they buy much of their power and coal In the recently passed budget New Delhi included a provision to forgive this debt as long as the state governments commit to either privatizing their SEBs or putting a floor on electricity prices Electricity meters would actually be installed to measure power usage but subsidies would still be allowed many customers wouldnt pay enough to cover the true cost of that power Still this would be big progress by Indian standards if it happened Many farmers currently get their power for free and over of power generated is stolen something the SEBs euphemistically call transmission and distribution losses As a result the electricity boards average a return on investment of negative However New Delhi is offering quite a big carrot and not much stick After a March meeting between the prime minister and state leaders Rajnath Singh the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh said quite clearly that he wouldnt hike energy charges for farmers The reason is obvious he faces elections next year and free power has become an entitlement that no politician lightly takes away Chief ministers will likely sign on to New Delhis plan in order to get debt relief but will backslide on implementation The only thing that will make the states serious about reform is a hard budget constraint which is the opposite of what the government is offering One way to provide it would be to hand over the centrally owned power generators and mines to the states They would then have to figure out how to keep the system running If they still chose not to charge for electricity they would have to find the money for power generation from other parts of their budgets Another reform some have suggested is to pass a national law which legalizes private power producers Some states allow companies to have their own captive power plants to maintain supply when the public grid fails But these are typically not permitted to sell their power outside of the parent company If larger plants that could supply several industrial firms were legalized the states would come under greater pressure to reform The private power suppliers could cherrypick the best customers those willing to pay for reliable power leaving the state to subsidize the freeloaders This would also have the benefit of quickly boosting the countrys power supply since captive plants already have about megawatts of unused capacity New Delhi is still trying to reform the countrys power market by fiat This means years of political wrangling while a growing economy is strangled by a shortage of electricity Instead the wouldbe reformers could let the power of the invisible hand push the state governments in the right direction INDIA Foreign funds plough money into Indian shares By Anurag Sood Reuters English

hunting for better returns in emerging Asia According to Lipper Asia Ltd a Reuters global funds data company investments by the biggest fund investors in Asia soared to billion in the JanuaryMarch

percent the IMF estimates percent the Asian Development Bank percent and the Indian central bank percent Ajit Ranade economist at ABN AMRO Bank says Indias large domestic economy resilient to the global slowdown could pull more funds into the country But a blizzard of stock market scandals which revealed share price manipulation has unnerved some foreign investors Weak regulation is a part of

Enron controversy where the US energy giant is threatening to pull out of its billion power project in the western Indian state of Maharashtra Enron is Indias single biggest foreign direct investor

the coalition or supportive of the Democratic Front Government today thrashed its effort to renegotiate the power purchase agreement PPA with the Enron sponsored Dabhol Power Company The least cost option was to initiate a judicial probe into the deal which was replete with fraud and seek the scrapping of the project they said This view was made public after the parties Peasants and Workers Party the CPIM the Janata Dal Secular the Samajwadi Party and others met here and decided to press the demand at a meeting of the coordination committee of all parties including the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party on May Its scheduled meeting for today was put off as the Chief Minister Mr Vilasrao Deshmukh was away electioneering in the South These parties worried about the huge unpayable DPC bills had been demanding a probe under the Inquiries Commissions Act but today upped the ante saying we are convinced of fraud in the agreement with DPC The renegotiation Mr N D Patil who leads the Left grouping and heads the allparty coordination panel said is not what we want we dont want it at all He and Mr Prabhakar Sanzgiri CPIM said we no longer suspect it We are convinced of malfeasance Along with Mr Pradhyumna Kaul of the AntiEnron Campaign they told a press conference that the moment fraud was proved the PPA could be annulled and the huge liquidation penalties can be avoided The demand was to scrap the mw phase II take over the mw Phase I and initiate a probe The Godbole Committee report has provided enough grounds though Phase I was a reality and Phase II only an eventuality Even a small criminal probe would put any arbitration decision sought by the DPC on hold The lobby pressing for scrapping the PPA said an FIR against the Maharashtra State Electricity Board under the provisions of Section of the Electricity Supply Act would suffice as there were enough grounds to prove that the entity or persons concerned had played games at one time or the other It cited bloated projections of energy demand in Maharashtra provided by the MSEB to DPC to justify the work on the Phase II which is now under stress following lenders reluctance to provide funds till the issue is sorted out When asked why Mr Deshmukh preferred renegotiation and trimming of power tariff to a probe Mr Patil said that is his view For their part the parties would press for change

refrain from committing the mistakes made by his State Addressing a press conference here today Mr Deshmukh said the Maharashtra Government was treading carefully on the Enron issue and it hoped to renegotiate the power tariff with the US company Mr Deshmukhs observations assume significance in the context of the running controversy regarding the Kannur Power Project which had been denied permission by the LDF Government Mr Deshmukh said that Enron had written to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board that it was ready to renegotiate the power tariff provided the Government of India made a formal request He said the renegotiation would start as soon as the Union Government handed over the formal letter asking for a renegotiation Mr Deshmukh pointed out that the basic issue in Enrons Dabhol project was related to the power tariff The foreign exchange rate was fixed at Rs a dollar at the start of the project But now it had gone up to Rs a dollar thereby pushing the cost of power up He indicated that the renegotiations would focus on this aspect as well The Maharashtra Government had proposed renegotiation on the basis of the Godbole Commission recommendation He was confident that the Enron would agree to renegotiate the tariff in the interests of the Maharashtra Government and its own interests In reply to a question Mr Deshmukh said the Enron project had been a major drain on his States finances but it had overcome all problems by handling them very carefully He said the Maharashtra Government would extend all support to the UDF if it were to come to power to process the various parameters relating to the Kannur project so that it did not commit the same kind of mistake as Maharashtra did He however made it clear that his Government welcomed foreign direct investments but not at the cost of the States interests Mr Deshmukh attacked the Centre for not using the various options available under the WTO agreement to come out with a balanced importexport policy Asked for his comments on Mr Sharad Pawars statement that the NCP was considering joining the Peoples Front Mr Deshmukh made it very clear that his partys alliance with the NCP was confined to Maharashtra alone The alliance with the NCP is a post election affair as part of the attempts to unite all secular forces The Congress had fought the NCP and several other parties which are now part of the Congressled Government But the alliance had been formed in order to keep the BJPShiv Sena combine out he said Asked how his party could accept the NCP which had an alliance going with the BJP in Meghalaya Mr Deshmukh said the Congress NCP ties were confined to Maharashtra If the NCP creates any problems in Maharashtra the alliance would end he said Mr Deshmukh attacked the CPIMled LDF for its five year misrule which had left the State virtually bankrupt The credibility of the LDF is so low that the people would not vote for it The CPIMled Left parties would be defeated

of action on its LNG shipping deal for the Dabhol Power Company DPC The controversy surrounding the Enronpromoted DPC and the apprehension raised by the lenders to the LNG shipping project has made the three shipping promoters of Greenfield Shipping Company take stock of the situation A final view on the LNG shipping deal will depend on what Enron decides on the power project per se and not just

the tariff in its own interest as well as that of the State Government Our Bureau Let Enron Exit ADITYA CHATTERJEE POOJA KOTHARI The Times of India Copyright C The Times of India Source World Reporter TM FOR years Enron tried to woo Indian policymakers who couldnt seem to decide whether the Dabhol project was a good idea or not Today the boot is on the other foot and it seems to be pinching Enrons management is keen to stop investing in huge capitalintensive plants around the world In keeping with this strategy and no doubt exhausted by its ceaseless crisis management in India Enron is mulling a pullout But both the Centre and Maharashtra government want to renegotiate the power purchase agreement and have entrusted this responsibility to the Madhav Godbole panel Is Enron really as indispensable as the authorities seem to think it is Financially no Indeed if the only way to continue the project is on the present terms then it makes better sense to simply scrap it After all its better to amputate a gangrenous limb than to let the problem spread further A little arithmetic will make this amply clear If the Dabhol Power Company DPC does scrap its agreement with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board the Centre will have to cough up a sum of Rs crore a penalty amount of Rs crore for one years electricity bill and million as termination fees which works out to Rs crore at an assumed exchange rate of rupees to one dollar This is a onetime payment and the figure of Rs crore is corroborated by a recent statement by Union power secretary A K Basu Now if India were to continue with the present arrangement it would end up paying at least Rs crore per year for the next years to DPC On the other hand what would happen if the project were scrapped Well very simplistically India would save Rs crore Rs crore multiplied by years But things arent quite that simple because that money could earn interest while inflation would mean that Rs crore after years would not have the same value it would have today To get around this problem financial experts use a concept called net present value which discounts future earning streams as well as inflation to evaluate the attractiveness of a project If we use a discount rate of per cent then the value of the amount India would save by scrapping the Dabhol project works out to Rs crore over three times the amount India would have to pay today if the agreement with DPC is terminated Indian financial institutions FIs and banks which have lent money to DPC are actively lobbying to prevent such an eventuality But how badly would they be hit Well FIs led by Industrial Development Bank of India have provided loans of million and million in two phases This brings their total exposure to million Rs crore at an exchange rate of Besides State Bank of India also underwrote the maximum portion of a million crossborder loan and has an exposure of about million Rs crore Thus the cumulative exposure of Indian banks and FIs in DPC works out to around Rs crore However since only per cent of this amount has been disbursed so far the net exposure of Indian lenders amounts to Rs crore Since the Indian lenders are not covered by any counterguarantee their bottomline would be hit if Enron backs out The government being a majority stakeholder in most of these institutions would also be affected But even if all these loans are taken into account and added to the onetime payment of Rs crore the total cost to the government would be Rs crore still lower than Rs crore Thus the termination option will prove less costly for the nation than proceeding on the present terms What will happen to the assets and the plant did we hear you ask Well the government can sell it to private players and renegotiate the cost factor with them this time hopefully after doing a costbenefit analysis A sale of assets would also lessen the load on the government Who knows the government may actually manage to sell the ownership of DPC at a premium to another private sector player Of course fears have been raised that cancelling the project might cost us foreign direct investment since Enron is the biggest investor in India so far After all Brazil raised billion and China billion last year in comparison with Indias measly billion But theres another way of looking at the problem what does India really have to lose In short its a case of losing what you dont even have in the first place Many developing nations which were pushed into signing expensive power projects by multinationals have successfully renegotiated their contracts with no serious financial consequences Many nations simply did not have the money to pay for the inflated bills some refused to pay even after losing international arbitration awards while others like Costa Rica declared that the contracts signed with independent power producers like Enron have no legal status or are bad in law In July the Hungarian parliament declared that a PPA signed with multinational RWE was unconstitutional and void In August the Croatian government tore up a PPA signed between Enron and a previous government The contract was considered to be unaffordable and was allegedly signed in suspicious circumstances Enron subsequently abandoned the original agreement In September the Philippines took a decision to not renew financially crippling contracts with IPPs Controversy has accompanied the Dabhol project from the start In August the finance ministry had written to the power ministry that the size of the potential liability for a megawatt plant was around Rs crore per year The department of economic affairs had also warned that the risk of counterguarantees being invoked was not unreal given that state electricity bills had been defaulting in payments Caution was thrown to the winds then The least India can do now is ask for a renegotiation But does the Indian government have the courage to go eyeballtoeyeball with Enron and not blink first Scrapping the power purchase agreement involves a onetime payment of Rs crore However India would save over Rs crore by doing so There would be a net saving even after writing off FI loans to Dabhol Power Company IDBI whose life is it anyway Tamal Bandyopadhyay Business Standard Copyright c Business Standard On April a terse oneline announcement by the finance ministry gave the acting chairman and managing director of Industrial Development Bank of India IDBI S K Chakrabarti a threemonth extension The government was generous enough not to keep the CMD as well as the institution waiting till late evening which it normally does for the fax message from North Block But the acting IDBI chief may be asked to step down even in three weeks if the government is able to identify his successor He has been reappointed for a period of three months or till a regular CMD takes charge whichever is earlier Could there have been a better way to insult the countrys largest financial institution and its chief First the government planned to merge the Industrial Finance Corporation of India IFCI which is on the brink of collapse under the burden of ballooning nonperforming assets with IDBI to make them sink together Unable to push through the proposal in the face of stiff resistance put up by IDBI the government now appears to be keen on leading the countrys premier financial institution to its grave alone This not by giving an extension to the existing acting chief but by failing to identify his successor and thereby continuing the uncertainty at the top Nothing can move in an organisation when the CEO himself does not know how long he will survive Indias financial institutions have been repositioning themselves by going shortterm both on the assets as well as the liabilities sides But for that transformation to take effect they need leaders with a longterm tenure at the helm To understand this lets look at whats happening at ICICI another financial institution in the country that is breathing down on IDBIs neck and threatening to overtake it K V Kamath CEO and managing director of ICICI got a second fiveyear term seven days ahead of the expiry of his first term on March Once his second term is complete Kamath will have ended up running the show at ICICI for a decade ICICI does not only give its chief a long term to steer the ship but also grooms talent to take over the institution in due course Kamath was groomed by his predecessor N Vaghul In turn he is now grooming Nachiket Mor to succeed him Mor a former senior general manager of ICICI has recently been shifted to ICICI Bank as an executive director in charge of wholesale banking He is likely to be made the managing director of the bank when the present incumbent H N Sinor steps down next year Eventually he will take over the mantle from Kamath in by which time his stint at the bank will have given him enough operational experience in addition to his treasury management and other skills Given the circumstances IDBI is fighting a losing battle It will not be surprising if it goes the IFCI way with an uncertain leadership unable to steer a demoralised overstaffed ship becalmed by the apathetic bureaucracy of the North Block This is despite its tremendous brand value in project financing and widespread corporate relationships Carved out of the Reserve Bank of India by an Act of Parliament in IDBI has business relations with virtually every corporate house in India But that is not helping it tide over the crisis because the key to any financial intermediarys success at this juncture is how it handles its resources both currency as well as human In an ideal situation the cost of funds should be lower while the cost of human resources should be marketdriven In IDBIs case it is the reverse its cost of funds is on the higher side in the absence of aggressive treasury operations and it is not allowed to pay marketdriven salary to its employees The net result There has been an exodus of talent from IDBI and the institution is struggling to stay afloat just when recession has prompted corporations to cut back on their borrowings IDBIs sanctions and disbursements have been falling and nonperforming assets increasing It is sitting on piles of cash but finding deployment avenues hard to come by Two former chiefs of IDBI S H Khan and G P Gupta spent a large chunk of their tenure and energy pleading with the finance ministry to delink IDBIs salary structure from that of the Reserve Bank of India but without success Small wonder that Chakrabarti who became acting chairman on February for a threemonth term has singled out the low morale of the staff as his prime concern He wants to address this on a war footing The Centre has now successfully demoralised him by offering him another uncertain term Former finance minister Manmohan Singh accepted Khans argument on marketdriven package he reportedly wanted a pay scale for his employees that was higher ICICIs but could not do anything about it P Chidambaram repeated Singhs failure on this front and Yashwant Sinha too thinks the proposal is not worth considering because it will have a ripple effect in the industry For instance RBI employees will immediately demand their pound of flesh The finance ministry refuses to see the point that the countrys central bank is not a commercial organisation and does not have to compete with ICICI When three successive finance ministers failed to address IDBIs problems the institution went for soft options It ended up appointing three consultants for restructuring in six years First Booz Allen Hamilton in followed by M B Athreya in and finally Boston Consulting Group The third consultant BCG is yet to submit its report While Booz Allen Hamilton charted out the roadmap for diversification and suggested that the institution spread its wings overseas and tap new business opportunities the Athreya panel said it must convert itself into a bank and the governments stake should come down without delay Over the last few years the institution has been planning its conversion into a bank and blaming the economy for its indifferent performance even as ICICI has been going full steam with new initiatives ICICI Bank is also exploiting synergies with its parent to the hilt while IDBI Bank seems to be embarrassed about ackowledging its pedigree Its not that everything is great at ICICI Over the past few years the institution has lost some senior executives ISec managing director Kishore Chaukar left to join the Tata group ICICI senior general managers Anando Mukherji joined Enron and N J Subaiah took charge at Centurion Bank which he subsequently left The industry suspects the quality of ICICIs assets and is not comfortable with the scorching pace of growth Even the wellpaid ICICI executive cadres find the pace of work is too much to handle and complain of fatigue In private they hate the mad rush for excellence And yet there is a method in ICICIs madness It has trimmed the flab with two successive voluntary retirement schemes branched out into consumer loans in a big way and transformed treasury operations into an art The finance ministry would do well to explore the possibility of divesting the governments stake in IDBI to ICICI Instead of pumping in Rs crore as recapitalisation funds into IFCI it can simply let it die and sell its assets to other banks and financial institutions IDBIs bulk and the brand name in project financing would combine well with ICICIs growing retail presence and unbridled aggression The combination would be formidable enough to give the State Bank of India a run for its money Of course a whole lot of issues need to settled before the process takes off like trimming the flab in IDBI and delinking it from the RBI pay structure et al IDBI merging with ICICI may sound like an absurd dream but it is certainly a better option than merging IFCI with IDBI If Reliance is willing to bid for staterun oil majors HPCL and

fund manager comment By Andrew Callus LONDON May Reuters Scottish Power Plc announced a restructuring on Thursday reflecting plans for expansion in the United States and a tighter power sector focus in its British home market Britains largest power utility was reporting a decline in pretax profits before exceptional items and goodwill for the year to March to million pounds million from million a year ago But its shares rose percent to pence on some good news on costs and power generation in the United States where plant breakdown and high prices have hit earnings and investor sentiment Hunter a power station in Utah came back on line on Thursday after a day breakdown that cost million a day and helped deliver percent sector shareprice underperformance over the period New US plants are also coming on stream The profit figure was in line with analysts forecasts hit by UK regulation the Hunter outage and high US power prices They are keeping those costs down in the United States said one sector analyst There were stories out there they were going to be worse than they have been saying and it wasnt The breakdown at Hunter part of the UK groups PacifiCorp acquisition was unusually costly because power had to be bought in to replace the megawatts MW of lost capacity while power prices in the region were very high Even with Hunter back up PacifiCorp has more customer demand than plant to supply it so high wholesale prices will continue to be a problem The new structure unveiled on Thursday consists of a US division including PacifiCorps regulated and unregulated businesses a UK division covering generation and energy supply in Britain and a third infrastructure division which includes power systems and Southern Water in the UK and create a link between US and UK infrastructure businesses NEW US PLANT Chief Executive Ian Russell told reporters by telephone the Hunter power plant was now reconnected to the grid and would reach full operating capacity within a few days He was also upbeat about prospects for expanding generation in the United States where Scottish Power aims to have new plants with an extra MW or percent of current capacity on stream this year He announced that the first of these a MW plant at Gadsby in Salt Lake City Utah began producing on Thursday as well Another MW plant being built in Oregon will be onstream in a month or so Russell said PORTLAND Scottish Power confirmed it was still looking at the possible sale or refinancing of its Southern Water business in Britain and Russell said there had been a number of expressions of interest for the business worth about billion pounds but we are some way away from a conclusion He also said he was still looking for a further US acquisition but would not confirm reports he was in talks with US power trading group Enron Corp about buying its Portland Oregon power arm When we acquired PacifiCorp we said it was a platform for further growth obviously Portland is right in our own back yard he said Frankly were still very busy with PacifiCorp and for the time being thats what we are focused on Investors have been concerned about the groups dealmaking plans given the weak market for UK water infrastructure assets and volatility in the US market There is still a bit of deal risk there amidst worries they may sell Southern Water too cheaply said one fund manager who is underweight in the stock CEO Russell said the threeway restructuring would help the group sharpen our focus on improving shareholder value and capture opportunities in the US western power markets PacifiCorp contributed operating profit of million pounds after the impact of the Hunter outage compared to million pounds four month contribution a year earlier The groups million poundsayear threeyear UK cost saving plan was on track at the end of its first year Russell said Finance director David Nish expressed continuing support for Thus its spunoff startup telecoms business in which it still holds just over percent Thus is still lossmaking and has been struck by general investor disaffection with telecoms companies and concerns about how it would secure future funding But Nish said Scottish Power had no plans to do anything other than be supportive of the company additional reporting by Sonya Dowsett Distractions interfere with key growth questions Financial Times May By Andrew Taylor in London Cynics claim that Scottish Powers legal action launched this week to rewrite a long term electricity supply contract was more about distracting attention from the groups poor results than a realistic bid to cut costs This judgment is a little harsh Scottish Power would benefit considerably if it could renegotiate the deal that requires it to buy threequarters of Scotlands nuclear output The British Energy contract is worth obn bn in the next four years Shareholders could do with some distraction Scottish Power by its own admission has had a tough year which will be confirmed today when it publishes results for Ian Russell who took over as chief executive in March may even indulge in the new boys practice of including the cost of further forseeable bad news in the figures making any subsequent improvement appear greater His biggest problem will be to convince the City that he is capable of developing an effective strategy to change the groups direction now it has abandoned plans to become a multiutility The group no longer believes adequate returns can be earned from developing a growing range of products to sell to its more than m customers The investment required to develop national brands win new customers and retain old ones is too high in an increasingly competitive UK retail sector it says Mr Russell who as Scottish Powers former finance director was closely associated with the previous policy has already withdrawn from joint ventures with Royal Bank of Scotland to provide financial services and with Thus to provide telecommunications The group is also discussing the future of Southern Water its south of England utility which Enel the Italian statecontrolled energy group is interested in buying Crossselling electricity and gas to Southern Water customers let alone other products has been disappointing it admits The group plans to concentrate on developing its energy interests in the UK and US But these also have their difficulties Some of the biggest problems involve PacifiCorp bought months ago in a deal worth about obn including debt The price is looking more expensive following big rises in US electricity wholesale prices PacifiCorp has not been as badly affected as some US electricity groups But it has faced problems because of a power station breakdown in Utah that forced it to buy higher priced electricity from other generators to meet customer demand The failure of a MW generating unit at its Hunter power plant in November has cost the group m om a day since One piece of good news for shareholders today will be the timing of its return to service this month Another positive note is that PacifiCorp is negotiating higher retail prices with US state regulators to offset increased generation charges It also has about MW of its own new power plant due to start production this year In the UK the group is facing increased competition for retail electricity and gas sales particularly in the household market It has also had to absorb big price cuts imposed on its power distribution side by Ofgem the industry regulator The shares which fell p on Wednesday to p have fallen by more than per cent against the FTSE All Share Index since December when the PacifiCorp offer was announced So where does the group go from here It made its reputation in the s as a shrewd acquirer of UK utilities Southern Water for obn and Manweb the northwest of England electricity supplier for obn Effective cost cutting increased value particularly at Manweb The group was also one of the first electricity companies to string telecommunication lines along its electricity pylons The sale of a per cent stake in Thus which operates the telecoms network raised obn in Financing further UK and US acquisitions will be challenging Thus shares have fallen from p a year ago to p on Wednesday night Scottish Power has net debt of some obn with interest thinly covered three times by earnings before tax and interest It has been talking with Enron about buying Portland General its Oregonbased electricity utility The group might need to sell Southern to cover the purchase price of about bn including debt Buying in the UK may be even harder Scottish Power has been outbid recently for regional electricity suppliers by the deeper pockets of large continental European utilities

there with the Enrons and Reliant Energies of the world the other power generators that sell electricity to the utilities is a company called National Energy Group It has power plants in states and controls a natural gas pipeline to Northern California And its owned by PGE Corp the parent company of PGE Co Try to keep up with me here PGE Co is the company that has been so devastated by

squatting in tall cotton as my daddy used to say The Corp received more than billion from the Co from according to a PUC audit But the Corp says it wouldnt be fair if it had to put any of that money back into the Co its ailing subsidiary It wants the people whose utility bills created that profit to pay higher bills now to bail out the Co so the Corp can avoid bankruptcy of its own Who is being unfair Meanwhile Southern California Edison also has been shipping its profits also more than billion at last report to its parent company while looking to the state for a bailout Now Gov Gray The Generator Davis wants the taxpayers of this state to pay billion to Southern California Edison for that utilitys transmission system But as far as I can tell Edisons rate payers already paid to build

and scream Call Coursey at or email LNG carriage to be preserve of Indiaflag ships Lloyds List International Copyright C LLoyds List Source World Reporter TM In an attempt to cash in on the liquefied natural gas revolution Indias shipping ministry is pushing through a proposal to restrict the transportation of the gas only to companies registered in India and vessels carrying the Indian flag It would seem that the logic primarily is to ensure that Indian shipping does not get left behind in the LNG transportation race Until now the ministry has managed to get LNG ferried by energy companies on fob basis We hope that this new proposal would give further impetus to Indian bottoms says shipping secretary Michael Pinto We will do all we can to get approval from the committee of secretaries and the Cabinet Since some of the shipping contracts have already been finalised this proposal would only be made applicable to future contracts However shipping experts are extremely doubtful whether the proposal can be implemented The leading Indian shipping companies have neither the funds nor the expertise of carrying LNG and would need the assistance of foreign companies to make the ventures a success A foreign LNG carrier is not going to settle for a minority stake unless the Indian shipper is able to put up his share of the equity which would be quite a handful says Sudhir J Mulji executive vicechairman of Great Eastern Shipping Company and current president of the Indian National Shipowners Association The proposal really does not seem to be feasible For the moment just two major contracts have been signed both involving the stateowned Shipping Corporation of India SCI The first one involves SCI American power major Enron and Mitsui of Japan for the carriage of m tonnes of LNG per annum for Enrons MW mega power project at Dabhol near Ratnagiri in southern Maharashtra SCI had entered into this memorandum of understanding with MOL formerly Mitsui OSK Lines and Atlantic Commercial Finance which is an Enron affiliate However it is only a partner in the consortium with Enron holding a stake and Mitsui OSK the balance The gas will be ferried by the LNG Lakshmi brandnew cu m capacity vessel being constructed in Japan at the Mitsui Shipyard The contract is valid for years from the date of starting However the consortium is registered in the Cayman Islands which is a tax haven and the LNG vessel will carry the flag of Malta SCI has also secured the contract for carrying m tonnes per annum of LNG for the governmentowned pipeline company Petronet LNG The gas is to be ferried from RasGas of Qatar to the companys upcoming LNG terminal at Dahej in Gujarat A similar Petronet terminal but half the size of Dahej is coming up in Kochi Kerala state The transportation contract for this is to be decided later Two other major Indian shipowners who have taken a step towards LNG transportation are Great Eastern Shipping and Essar Shipping The former has formed a consortium with Indian Oil Corporation and Exmar while Essar has joined hands with Malaysia International Shipping Corporation MISC to form a joint venture dedicated to gas transportation The Dollars bn MISC the national shipping line of Malaysia is one of the worlds leading owners and operators of LNG tankers As a listed company on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange MISC has the stateowned petroleum and oil giant Petronas a Fortune company as its largest shareholder with a stake of Our memorandum of understanding has both companies holding an equal equity share in the joint venture said Essar

PacifiCorp also serves customers in Washington Idaho Utah Wyoming and California for total of million residential and business customers PGE serves customers primarily in the populous northern Willamette Valley Speculation about the potential hookup with PGE surfaced during the weekend in Britains Observer newspaper In the article an unidentified source described the merger as an obvious one and yes there have been discussions On Tuesday officials from the various utilities and parent companies would neither confirm nor deny that talks formal or informal had taken place Its a vigorous no comment on the rumors said Mark Palmer Houstonbased Enron spokesman We dont comment on market speculation said Rachel Sherrard a spokeswoman for PacifiCorp The speculation whether of substance or whimsy has drawn the attention of state regulators and consumer advocacy groups I think it would get a great deal of scrutiny and I think there would be some serious concerns said Ron Eachus head of the Oregon Public Utility Commission The PUC must approve utility mergers The agency hasnt received any notice that talks are occurring Eachus said Bob Jenks executive director of the Citizens Utility Board said his organization which represents customers of investorowned utilities likely would oppose a PGEPacifiCorp merger Were not pleased by the idea he said The Citizens Utility Board has become

Lloyds List International Copyright C LLoyds List Source World Reporter TM With the Shipping Corporation of India taking a major stake in the Petronet LNG Indias maritime industries a high profile SHIRISH NADKARNI ON the final Thursday of March there was a celebration in NeDelhi involving the four members of the consortium that had bagged the Dollars m liquefied natural gas transportation contract of Petronet LNG It is the Japanese custom to celebrate an event like this and only the consortium members and their officials were invited to the function says KM Joseph director bulk carriers and tankers with the Shipping Corporation of India SCI which has a equity stake in the winning partnership The other members of the consortium are Japans MOL formerly Mitsui OSK Lines NYK Line and K Line and the contract involves ferrying m tonnes per annum of LNG from the Middle East to Petronet LNGs terminal at Dahej in Gujarat Two LNG carriers will be involved in the deal each capable of carrying cu m of gas and expected to cost Dollars m each The vessels are to be constructed at Daewoo Shipbuilding Yard in South Korea This was Indias second major LNG transportation deal and SCI the public sector shipping monolith which owns roughly half of the countrys oceangoing fleet of vessels has a stake in both of them as does MOL MOL is a professionally managed company whose cultural ethos is similar to ours says the goateebearded Prabhat Kumar Srivastava SCIs chairman and managing director Our relationship is based on total transparency and trust and we therefore feel comfortable with them There may well be more such tieups in the future The earlier deal was also sealed with MOL which has a stake in a joint venture named Greenfield Shipping Company GSC with US energy major Enron holding the remaining equity The three members will have joint ownership of the cu m LNG carrier LNG Lakshmi now under construction at the Mitsui Heavy Industries shipyard in Japan When ready the vessel will ferry m tpa of LNG from RasGas of Qatar to Enrons megapower facility at Dabhol near Ratnagiri in southern Maharashtra However to return to the Petronet deal The MOLSCI consortium won the coveted contract by quoting a charter hire rate of Dollars per day which was substantially lower than the bids of the two other competing consortia MISCEssar and ExmarGreat Eastern ShippingIndian Oil Corporation The Petronet LNG deal was the most prestigious and important LNG shipping project in the country and we were very keen to secure it says Mr Srivastava So we told our Japanese partners to quote the best possible rates A stake in the consortium formed with Enron may only be sufficient to net SCI a boardroom presence in GSC but its stake in the Petronet LNG shipping venture will allow the shipping major to exercise much more power on the latter companys board There are other issues involved If we had not emerged winners in Petronets shipping deal it would have done us a lot of harm for the other LNG shipping projects that are fast coming up in the country says Mr Srivastava We have already made tremendous headway in LNG shipping by being part of the Dabhol project and we were very keen to maintain the momentum Experts rate SCI as one of the best managed public sector enterprises and the bottom line of the company reinforces this feeling For the first nine months of the financial year SCI had a sales turnover of Rsbn Dollars m which was better than the Rsbn recorded for the corresponding nine months of the previous year The net profit zoomed from Rsm during the period April to December to Rsbn for the same nine months of While the results for the financial year ended March are still being compiled SCI officials place the sales turnover at around Rsbn and the net profit at just above the Rsbn mark While the companys tankers have produced spectacular results even the lossmaking liner division is expected to turn round the corner We have removed nearly of the nonperforming assets in the division and the balance will be chopped off in the fiscal year says Sudhir S Rangnekar director liner shipping division Recently international consultants Pricewaterhouse Coopers PwC carried out a SWOT analysis for SCI They suggested a corporate transformation of the company apart from going ahead with the information technology initiatives taken earlier The company went ahead and signed a memorandum of understanding with the ministry of shipping for the financial year whereby two new criteria will be used for judging the organisations performance A new criterion corporate transformation project implementation has been introduced in the MoU reflecting the emphasis that we are placing on enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations says Mr Rangnekar It also reflects our keenness to develop greater customer focus through process redesigning and improvement and adoption of the latest IT systems and applications

FERCS LATEST REFUND ORDERS Foster Electric Report c Copyright Foster Associates Inc About the same time that PGE Corp and Edison International announced combined writeoffs of nearly billion in unrecovered purchased power costs four major California energy suppliers reported increases ranging from percent to percent in firstquarter revenues Meanwhile FERC has issued new refund orders requiring many of these same generators to justify in overcharges during March PGE and Southern California Edison Cos WriteOffs After a long delay PGE and Edison during the middle of April confirmed what many knew was coming huge writeoffs for unrecovered purchased power costs during the year Edison announced that it was writing off billion in undercollected power costs for the year leaving the company with a billion loss for the year Edison chief John Bryson was hopeful nevertheless that a recent memorandum of understanding MOU his company signed with the state will allow Edison to recover some of those costs and help keep its Southern California Edison Co SoCal Edison affiliate out of bankruptcy Prompt implementation of the MOU can avoid the large costs of a SoCal Edison bankruptcy and make it possible for the company to restore its financial health and ability to maintain a reliable power grid said Bryson in a statement accompanying Edisons financial results Whether Brysons hope for quick implementation of the MOU will be realized is questionable Gov Gray Davis has been having a hard time finding the necessary legislative support for the proposal and to date has been unable even to find a legislator to sponsor a bill to implement the MOU Instead several state legislators are exploring alternatives including having the state buy SoCal Edisons transmission assets as well as the whole utility and turn it into a state power agency Edisons northern California neighbor PGE Corp reported a strong growth in revenues for led by the strong performance of its energy trading unit but that revenue growth was completely offset by the billion in losses incurred by its now bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric Co utility subsidiary While standard accounting rules required the utility to record a charge against earnings for unreimbursed wholesale and transition costs taking this charge does not diminish our conviction that the utility is entitled under law to recover these costs nor does it diminish our ongoing lawsuit in federal district court said PGE Corp chief Robert Glynn Generators FirstQuarter Revenue Reports In sharp contrast with PGEs and Edisons financial performance the parent companies of four of Californias largest generators reported large jumps in firstquarter revenues Enron Corp reported revenues of billion a whopping percent increase from a year earlier The company owns only a small amount of wind generation in California but sells power into the state through its Portland General Electric subsidiary and is an energy trader in the state Enrons commodity sales and service unit showed a percent increase in firstquarter earnings Reliant Energy Inc saw firstquarter earnings jump percent to billion The companys wholesale energy business unit produced million in operating income for the first quarter up sharply from the million loss the company reported a year earlier Reporting a slightly lower but still a substantial percent jump in firstquarter revenues was Dynegy Inc Of the companys billion in revenues for the period its marketing and trading subsidiary realized million in earnings nearly double the in earnings reported a year earlier The parent company reported a percent jump in first quarter earnings over the previous year Duke Energy Corp announced a percent boost in firstquarter revenues to billion led by a percent increase in earnings by wholesale energy unit FERCs Refund Order Similar to separate orders regarding January and February power sales in California FERC on issued a notice demanding that three generators justify in combined power sales during March FERC staff set a MWh proxy clearing price for the month and then applied it to the hours of Stage power alerts that were declared during March in California The staffs proxy prices for January and February were MWh and MWh respectively The clearing prices fluctuations can be attributed to changes in operating costs including fuel and emissions credits The latest refund order is the smallest of the three asking for cost support for just in transactions while the previous two orders cited a combined million in potential overcharges The three wholesale sellers being questioned by the current refund order Dynegy Power Marketing Inc Mirant California Mirant Delta and Mirant Portrero and Williams Energy Services Corp were named in the previous orders as well Once again Dynegy led the pack with the largest amount of potential refunds for March nearly Combined with the previous two orders the company is on the hook for more than

Missing link by Claire Poole The Daily Deal Copyright c The Deal LLC Buying Illinova gave Dynegy a key piece in a puzzle for trading energy anywhere anytime When Chuck Watson decided to take his company beyond natural gas trading he changed its name to Dynegy Inc and took as its logo a tangram a sevenpiece puzzle that can be assembled in thousands of ways Buying utility Illinova Corp in February gave him a piece for delivering such flexibility The Illinova acquisition was probably the most welltimed and best conceived buy of the year raves Jeremy Butler an analyst at Value Line Publishing Inc ReportCard DYNEGY ILLINOVA Stock Price A Profitability B Strategy A Braintrust B Culture B Competitive Position A Overall A Why Besides providing electricity to customers in a squaremile area in Illinois Decatur Illbased Illinova also had recently received regulatory approval to transfer its coal and gasfired generating plants megawatts in all to an unregulated subsidiary as part of the states deregulation of its electricity industry Thanks to soaring energy prices as well as to million to million in overall earnings estimated or achieved from optimizing Illinovas generation assets and improving its operating efficiencies Dynegy is seeing the effects of the deal on its bottom line Illinova has been extremely accretive to earnings said M Carol Coale an analyst at Prudential Securities in Houston Last year in fact Dynegys revenues nearly doubled to billion while its net earnings almost tripled to million or per diluted share as a result of the billion Illinova deal In the first quarter Dynegys net earnings jumped Investors have been amply rewarded Dynegys stock took off last year jumping to per share making it the second best performing stock in the Standard Poors Since the Illinova deal was announced June Dynegys stock has skyrocketed an astounding from to One of those happy investors is San Franciscobased oil and gas giant Chevron Corp which owns about of Dynegy For Watson who formed Dynegy in the late s out of Houston energy company NGS Corp where he was CEO and chairman the success of the Illinova deal underscores his quest to take power and trade it anywhere he wants anytime he wants at any price he wants Thats why he dubbed the company Dynegy a hybrid name taken by combining dynamic with energy If energy prices stay high and Dynegys traders continue to make winning bets analysts expect the companys net earnings per share to increase another this year to million or per share But Dynegy hasnt been immune to the power crisis afflicting California where it coowns four power plants with NRG Energy Inc of Minneapolis that generate megawatts of capacity Indeed since the crisis began Dynegys been defending itself against allegations that its overcharging for power The California situation has hurt Dynegy in other ways too On April for example its stock fell to after utility Pacific Gas Electric Co a unit of PGE Corp filed for bankruptcy Dynegy provides power to the California market as a wholesaler but not to PGE directly Dynegy has also been quibbling recently with another teetering California utility Sempra Energys San Diego Gas Electric which claimed April that Dynegy ordered it to shutter some of the facilities the utility sold it in but that it still operates because it doesnt think it will get paid Dynegy denied the charge Dynegy did not instruct SDGE to shut down generating units nor did we suggest that we would not make power available to creditworthy buyers Stephen W Bergstrom Dynegys president and COO wrote in a letter to SDGE Chairman and CEO Stephen Baum Dynegy has tried to downplay its exposure to the states power woes Its repeatedly pointed out to the press that its stake in the four power plants in California only represents of its total generating portfolio of megawatts or about Analysts however estimate Dynegys exposure in California could give its earnings a haircut of as much as this year Even so Dynegys stock has recovered to a recent Illinova has created some volatility to Dynegys stock because of the addition of power generation to its business Prudentials Coale said But overall its been a great deal While keeping most of Illinova management in place Dynegy made the companys chairman president and CEO Charles Bayless a nonexecutive director of the combined entity Dynegys also marketing and trading all of Illinovas megawatts of output Theyve streamlined power generation and traded around the assets while keeping the distribution business in a sweet spot said John Olson an analyst at Sanders Morris Harris in Houston Illinova meanwhile solved a big investorrelated problem for Dynegy Before the merger only of Dynegys shares were available to the public As part of the deal Watson convinced two of Dynegys strategic partners British Gas plc and Nova Chemicals to sell their combined stake for approximately million in cash and shares of a new convertible preferred stock It also issued million shares after the deal closed Those moves increased Dynegys float to more than of the shares outstanding which led money managers to flood in The companys market capitalization has since tripled to billion Operationally in its effort to focus on power generation trading and marketing Dynegy has been dumping some of its midstream assets such as processing plants and pipelines particularly in the midContinent region The idea now is to increase Dynegys socalled merchant power capacity or the electricity it sells wholesale to anyone who needs it to megawatts by through acquisitions new construction and asset management agreements As a result Watson has become what some are calling an acquisitions hound Hes already acquired some facilities On Jan Dynegy completed the purchase of two power plants in the Hudson River Valley the megawatt Roseton power plant in Newburgh NY and the megawatt Danskammer plant nearby from various area utilities for million Banc of America Securities llc advised Dynegy on both purchases Dynegy has had trouble picking up other power plants however Witness the deal it announced Nov to acquire megawatts worth of electricitygenerating assets in Nevada from Renobased Sierra Pacific Resources for million The deal got scotched April when Nevada regulators spooked by its nextdoor neighbors power crisis repealed the states electricity deregulation plan and put a moratorium on all power plant sales in the state Dynegy estimated the acquisition would have added cents per share to earnings Still since the Illinova merger the total generating capacity built or acquired by Dynegy now exceeds the total capacity added through the merger That includes megawatts of new natural gasfired generation facilities in Georgia Kentucky and Louisiana that are expected to begin commercial operation by June just in time for summer Like its crosstown rival Enron Corp Dynegy has also expanded via acquisitions into broadband telecommunications Dynegy also competes with Houstonbased Reliant Energy and Charlotte NCbased Duke Energy Both Enron and Dynegy see a big opportunity in broadband given that there are few other suppliers and that managing its movement is akin to whats involved with natural gas or electricity In August Dynegy announced it was acquiring Aurora Colobased Extant Inc a privately held developer of telecom solutions for million in cash and stock It completed the deal in September Then in November Dynegy announced it was acquiring privately held Iaxis Ltd a Londonbased telecom that owned and operated an mile fiberoptic network throughout Europe for almost million Dynegy completed the deal in March Dynegy is now developing a mile fiberoptic cable network in the US that it will link to Iaxis network in Europe It hopes its broadband unit which lost million in the first quarter will be profitable by the second half of Still Dynegy has differentiated itself as the antiEnron because among other things it continues to buy power plants rather than sell them Enron meanwhile has been trying to dump its hard assets such as Portland General Electric in Portland Ore Enron CEO Jeff Skilling a polished former McKinsey Co consultant just wants to be a gobetween and not just in energy but in broadband pulp and paper and metals while Dynegys Watson a scrappy former commodities trader thinks he can play power generation and trading off each other Itll be interesting to see who is right Looking back at the Illinova deal Dynegy Incs acquisition of Illinova Corp has proven one

Asian Wall Street Journal Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Indias electricity shortage cant be solved without a new approach Indias power problem is back on the front burner because global generating giant Enron is threatening to turn off the lights at its Dhabol plant and walk away from a contract with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board In an effort to collect million owed for electricity already supplied the American company has invoked central government guarantees and declared a political force majeure but without much success So technically India is facing a sovereign default after which Enron would spend years battling through the courts to get compensation for the billion project Of course everyone knows thats not going to happen After more brinksmanship from both sides in the coming days they will have to sit down and negotiate a settlement Some of the problems with Enron are unique to that particular arrangement but in its basic outline the saga epitomizes a flawed attempt to deal with Indias power problem narrowly defined a shortage of generating capacity The country suffers constant blackouts due to a supply shortage of about and even more during times of peak demand In the early s the central government sought to solve this shortfall by opening the doors to private investors like Enron But this proved to be a mistake because power distribution is controlled by the state governments they run it as a system of wealth redistribution rather than a business California recently made the earthshattering discovery that a lack of market pricing at the consumer level leads to disaster But Indias state electricity boards or SEBs proved that long ago they have long been bankrupt and often default on payments to private generators As a result most of the big names in power have now pulled out of India Yes the country does need to worry about generating capacity Its estimated that in the next years demand will more than double with an additional megawatts needed but only half of that is likely to be built That could increase the shortfall during peak demand to a frightening prospect But the first order of business is to reform distribution There is a debate now about how to give state governments the right incentives to reform their SEBs These owe almost billion to central governmentowned generators and mines from whom they buy much of their power and coal In the recently passed budget New Delhi included a provision to forgive this debt as long as the state governments commit to either privatizing their SEBs or putting a floor on electricity prices Electricity meters would actually be installed to measure power usage but subsidies would still be allowed many customers wouldnt pay enough to cover the true cost of that power Still this would be big progress by Indian standards if it happened Many farmers currently get their power for free and over of power generated is stolen something the SEBs euphemistically call transmission and distribution losses As a result the electricity boards average a return on investment of negative However New Delhi is offering quite a big carrot and not much stick After a March meeting between the prime minister and state leaders Rajnath Singh the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh said quite clearly that he wouldnt hike energy charges for farmers The reason is obvious he faces elections next year and free power has become an entitlement that no politician lightly takes away Chief ministers will likely sign on to New Delhis plan in order to get debt relief but will backslide on implementation The only thing that will make the states serious about reform is a hard budget constraint which is the opposite of what the government is offering One way to provide it would be to hand over the centrally owned power generators and mines to the states They would then have to figure out how to keep the system running If they still chose not to charge for electricity they would have to find the money for power generation from other parts of their budgets Another reform some have suggested is to pass a national law which legalizes private power producers Some states allow companies to have their own captive power plants to maintain supply when the public grid fails But these are typically not permitted to sell their power outside of the parent company If larger plants that could supply several industrial firms were legalized the states would come under greater pressure to reform The private power suppliers could cherrypick the best customers those willing to pay for reliable power leaving the state to subsidize the freeloaders This would also have the benefit of quickly boosting the countrys power supply since captive plants already have about megawatts of unused capacity New Delhi is still trying to reform the countrys power market by fiat This means years of political wrangling while a growing economy is strangled by a shortage of electricity Instead the wouldbe reformers could let the power of the invisible hand push the state governments in the right direction INDIA Foreign funds plough money into Indian shares By Anurag Sood Reuters English

percent the IMF estimates percent the Asian Development Bank percent and the Indian central bank percent Ajit Ranade economist at ABN AMRO Bank says Indias large domestic economy resilient to the global slowdown could pull more funds into the country But a blizzard of stock market scandals which revealed share price manipulation has unnerved some foreign investors Weak regulation is a part of an emerging market risk but that does not rule out caution said an India strategist at a foreign brokerage Analysts say foreign fund flows are unlikely to be influenced much by events such as the Enron controversy where the US energy giant is threatening to pull out of its billion power project in the western Indian state of Maharashtra Enron is Indias single biggest foreign direct investor They say factors that influence foreign portfolio investments are different from the considerations that drive longer term direct investments The Indian governments decision to hike foreign funds

eventuality Even a small criminal probe would put any arbitration decision sought by the DPC on hold The lobby pressing for scrapping the PPA said an FIR against the Maharashtra State Electricity Board under the provisions of Section of the Electricity Supply Act would suffice as there were enough grounds to prove that the entity or persons concerned had played games at one time or the other It cited bloated projections of energy demand in Maharashtra provided by the MSEB to DPC to justify the work on the Phase II which is now under stress following lenders reluctance to provide funds till the issue is sorted out When asked why Mr Deshmukh preferred renegotiation and trimming of power tariff to a probe Mr Patil said that is his view For their part the parties would press for change at the meeting on May We are not witch hunting There have been fraudulent acts and we want them probed India Handle Enron cautiously Deshmukh Our Special Correspondent The Hindu Copyright C Kasturi Sons Ltd KSL Source World Reporter TM Asia Intelligence Wire THIRUVANANTHAPURAM MAY The Maharashtra Chief Minister Mr Vilasrao Deshmukh today advised the State to handle the Enron issue cautiously and refrain from committing the mistakes made by his State Addressing a press conference here today Mr Deshmukh said the Maharashtra Government was treading carefully on the Enron issue and it hoped to renegotiate the power tariff with the US company Mr Deshmukhs observations assume significance in the context of the running controversy regarding the Kannur Power Project which had been denied permission by the LDF Government Mr Deshmukh said that Enron had written to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board that it was ready to renegotiate the power tariff provided the Government of India made a formal request He said the renegotiation would start as soon as the Union Government handed over the formal letter asking for a renegotiation Mr Deshmukh pointed out that the basic issue in Enrons Dabhol project was related to the power tariff The foreign exchange rate was fixed at Rs a dollar at the start of the project But now it had gone up to Rs a dollar thereby pushing the cost of power up He indicated that the renegotiations would focus on this aspect as well The Maharashtra Government had proposed renegotiation on the basis of the Godbole Commission recommendation He was confident that the Enron would agree to renegotiate the tariff in the interests of the Maharashtra Government and its own interests In reply to a question Mr Deshmukh said the Enron project had been a major drain on his States finances but it had overcome all problems by handling them very carefully He said the Maharashtra Government would extend all support to the UDF if it were to come to power to process the various parameters relating to the Kannur project so that it did not commit the same kind of mistake as Maharashtra did He however made it clear that his Government welcomed foreign direct investments but not at the cost of the States interests Mr Deshmukh attacked the Centre for not using the various options available under the WTO agreement to come out with a balanced importexport policy Asked for his comments on Mr Sharad Pawars statement that the NCP was considering joining the Peoples Front Mr Deshmukh made it very clear that his partys alliance with the NCP was confined to Maharashtra alone The alliance with the NCP is a post election affair as part of the attempts to unite all secular forces The Congress had fought the NCP and several other parties which are now part of the Congressled Government But the alliance had been formed in order to keep the BJPShiv Sena combine out he said Asked how his party could accept the NCP which had an alliance going with the BJP in Meghalaya Mr Deshmukh said the Congress NCP ties were confined to Maharashtra If the NCP creates any problems in Maharashtra the alliance would end he said Mr Deshmukh attacked the CPIMled LDF for its five year misrule which had left the State virtually bankrupt The credibility of the LDF is so low that the people would not vote for it The CPIMled Left parties would be defeated

NEW DELHI May THE Shipping Corporation of India Mitsui OSK Lines Atlantic Commercial Inc an Enron affiliate are holding parleys at Houston US the headquarters of Enron Incto decide the future course of action on its LNG shipping deal for the Dabhol Power Company DPC The controversy surrounding the Enronpromoted DPC and the apprehension raised by the lenders to the LNG shipping project has made the three shipping promoters of Greenfield Shipping Company take stock of the situation A final view on the LNG shipping deal will depend on what Enron decides on the power project per se and not just the second phase of the project which is being planned as a LNG driven plant Even the first phase is expected to switchover to LNG in a couple of years sources tracking the sequence of events told Business Line The promoters have already paid per cent of the vessel building cost to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Japan where the cubic metre capacity vessel is being constructed at a total cost of million According to the delivery schedule the LNG vessel named Laxmi is expected to be completed and delivered by October end this year A consortium of global banks led by ANZ Investment Bank has taken a high exposure on the LNG shipping project The Greenfield Shipping Company had struck a year loan with the lenders worth million at basis points over libor SCI has a per cent equity stake in the project while Mitsui OSKLines hold per cent and Atlantic Commercial Inc per cent The LNG shipping deal for Dabhol was the first LNG shipping contract in the country involving an Indian shipping line Greenfield Shipping Company had entered into a time charter agreement with DPC to transport LNG from West Asia to its power plant in Maharashtra at a timecharter hire rate of per day for years Unlike in the case of other ships LNG ships do not have a secondary market since these are acquired against specific longterm contracts In case of any eventuality Greenfield Shipping Company would find it difficult to divert the vessel elsewhere as globally spot trade in LNG is almost nil Fortunately for the Greenfield Shipping Company the prices for new LNG buildings have started firming up after travelling through a downward trend till recently Mitsui OSKLinesNYKK LineKKK LineSCI consortium which recently bagged the shipping contract from Petronet LNG Ltd also has placed an order with

Government with enough expertise to advise on similar projects elsewhere in the country This was one of the upshots at the news conference by the Maharashtra Chief Minister Mr Vilasrao Deshmukh who is on an election campaign on behalf of the United Democratic Front UDF here on Wednesday In the course of his interaction with the newspersons he said his Government would extend all support to UDF if

Dhabol project with Enron He said Enron had written to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB that it was ready to renegotiate power tariff provided the Union Government made a formal request The renegotiation would begin as soon as the Union Government handed over the formal letter in this regard he added The Chief Minister said the basic issue was related to the power tariff The foreign exchange component was fixed at Rs per dollar at the start of the project which had now gone up to Rs per dollar thereby pushing up the cost of power He indicated that the renegotiations would focus on this aspect as well He explained that the Maharashtra Government had proposed renegotiation on the basis of Godbole Commission recommendation He was confident that Enron would agree to renegotiate the tariff in its own interest as well as that of the State Government Our Bureau Let Enron Exit ADITYA CHATTERJEE POOJA KOTHARI The Times of India Copyright C The Times of India Source World Reporter TM FOR years Enron tried to woo Indian policymakers who couldnt seem to decide whether the Dabhol project was a good idea or not Today the boot is on the other foot and it seems to be pinching Enrons management is keen to stop investing in huge capitalintensive plants around the world In keeping with this strategy and no doubt exhausted by its ceaseless crisis management in India Enron is mulling a pullout But both the Centre and Maharashtra government want to renegotiate the power purchase agreement and have entrusted this responsibility to the Madhav Godbole panel Is Enron really as indispensable as the authorities seem to think it is Financially no Indeed if the only way to continue the project is on the present terms then it makes better sense to simply scrap it After all its better to amputate a gangrenous limb than to let the problem spread further A little arithmetic will make this amply clear If the Dabhol Power Company DPC does scrap its agreement with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board the Centre will have to cough up a sum of Rs crore a penalty amount of Rs crore for one years electricity bill and million as termination fees which works out to Rs crore at an assumed exchange rate of rupees to one dollar This is a onetime payment and the figure of Rs crore is corroborated by a recent statement by Union power secretary A K Basu Now if India were to continue with the present arrangement it would end up paying at least Rs crore per year for the next years to DPC On the other hand what would happen if the project were scrapped Well very simplistically India would save Rs crore Rs crore multiplied by years But things arent quite that simple because that money could earn interest while inflation would mean that Rs crore after years would not have the same value it would have today To get around this problem financial experts use a concept called net present value which discounts future earning streams as well as inflation to evaluate the attractiveness of a project If we use a discount rate of per cent then the value of the amount India would save by scrapping the Dabhol project works out to Rs crore over three times the amount India would have to pay today if the agreement with DPC is terminated Indian financial institutions FIs and banks which have lent money to DPC are actively lobbying to prevent such an eventuality But how badly would they be hit Well FIs led by Industrial Development Bank of India have provided loans of million and million in two phases This brings their total exposure to million Rs crore at an exchange rate of Besides State Bank of India also underwrote the maximum portion of a million crossborder loan and has an exposure of about million Rs crore Thus the cumulative exposure of Indian banks and FIs in DPC works out to around Rs crore However since only per cent of this amount has been disbursed so far the net exposure of Indian lenders amounts to Rs crore Since the Indian lenders are not covered by any counterguarantee their bottomline would be hit if Enron backs out The government being a majority stakeholder in most of these institutions would also be affected But even if all these loans are taken into account and added to the onetime payment of Rs crore the total cost to the government would be Rs crore still lower than Rs crore Thus the termination option will prove less costly for the nation than proceeding on the present terms What will happen to the assets and the plant did we hear you ask Well the government can sell it to private players and renegotiate the cost factor with them this time hopefully after doing a costbenefit analysis A sale of assets would also lessen the load on the government Who knows the government may actually manage to sell the ownership of DPC at a premium to another private sector player Of course fears have been raised that cancelling the project might cost us foreign direct investment since Enron is the biggest investor in India so far After all Brazil raised billion and China billion last year in comparison with Indias measly billion But theres another way of looking at the problem what does India really have to lose In short its a case of losing what you dont even have in the first place Many developing nations which were pushed into signing expensive power projects by multinationals have successfully renegotiated their contracts with no serious financial consequences Many nations simply did not have the money to pay for the inflated bills some refused to pay even after losing international arbitration awards while others like Costa Rica declared that the contracts signed with independent power producers like Enron have no legal status or are bad in law In July the Hungarian parliament declared that a PPA signed with multinational RWE was unconstitutional and void In August the Croatian government tore up a PPA signed between Enron and a previous government The contract was considered to be unaffordable and was allegedly signed in suspicious circumstances Enron subsequently abandoned the original agreement In September the Philippines took a decision to not renew financially crippling contracts with IPPs Controversy has accompanied the Dabhol project from the start In August the finance ministry had written to the power ministry that the size of the potential liability for a megawatt plant was around Rs crore per year The department of economic affairs had also warned that the risk of counterguarantees being invoked was not unreal given that state electricity bills had been defaulting in payments Caution was thrown to the winds then The least India can do now is ask for a renegotiation But does the Indian government have the courage to go eyeballtoeyeball with Enron and not blink first Scrapping the power purchase agreement involves a onetime payment of Rs crore However India would save over Rs crore by doing so There would be a net saving even after writing off FI loans to Dabhol Power Company IDBI whose life is it anyway Tamal Bandyopadhyay Business Standard Copyright c Business Standard On April a terse oneline announcement by the finance ministry gave the acting chairman and managing director of Industrial Development Bank of India IDBI S K Chakrabarti a threemonth extension The government was generous enough not to keep the CMD as well as the institution waiting till late evening which it normally does for the fax message from North Block But the acting IDBI chief may be asked to step down even in three weeks if the government is able to identify his successor He has been reappointed for a period of three months or till a regular CMD takes charge whichever is earlier Could there have been a better way to insult the countrys largest financial institution and its chief First the government planned to merge the Industrial Finance Corporation of India IFCI which is on the brink of collapse under the burden of ballooning nonperforming assets with IDBI to make them sink together Unable to push through the proposal in the face of stiff resistance put up by IDBI the government now appears to be keen on leading the countrys premier financial institution to its grave alone This not by giving an extension to the existing acting chief but by failing to identify his successor and thereby continuing the uncertainty at the top Nothing can move in an organisation when the CEO himself does not know how long he will survive Indias financial institutions have been repositioning themselves by going shortterm both on the assets as well as the liabilities sides But for that transformation to take effect they need leaders with a longterm tenure at the helm To understand this lets look at whats happening at ICICI another financial institution in the country that is breathing down on IDBIs neck and threatening to overtake it K V Kamath CEO and managing director of ICICI got a second fiveyear term seven days ahead of the expiry of his first term on March Once his second term is complete Kamath will have ended up running the show at ICICI for a decade ICICI does not only give its chief a long term to steer the ship but also grooms talent to take over the institution in due course Kamath was groomed by his predecessor N Vaghul In turn he is now grooming Nachiket Mor to succeed him Mor a former senior general manager of ICICI has recently been shifted to ICICI Bank as an executive director in charge of wholesale banking He is likely to be made the managing director of the bank when the present incumbent H N Sinor steps down next year Eventually he will take over the mantle from Kamath in by which time his stint at the bank will have given him enough operational experience in addition to his treasury management and other skills Given the circumstances IDBI is fighting a losing battle It will not be surprising if it goes the IFCI way with an uncertain leadership unable to steer a demoralised overstaffed ship becalmed by the apathetic bureaucracy of the North Block This is despite its tremendous brand value in project financing and widespread corporate relationships Carved out of the Reserve Bank of India by an Act of Parliament in IDBI has business relations with virtually every corporate house in India But that is not helping it tide over the crisis because the key to any financial intermediarys success at this juncture is how it handles its resources both currency as well as human In an ideal situation the cost of funds should be lower while the cost of human resources should be marketdriven In IDBIs case it is the reverse its cost of funds is on the higher side in the absence of aggressive treasury operations and it is not allowed to pay marketdriven salary to its employees The net result There has been an exodus of talent from IDBI and the institution is struggling to stay afloat just when recession has prompted corporations to cut back on their borrowings IDBIs sanctions and disbursements have been falling and nonperforming assets increasing It is sitting on piles of cash but finding deployment avenues hard to come by Two former chiefs of IDBI S H Khan and G P Gupta spent a large chunk of their tenure and energy pleading with the finance ministry to delink IDBIs salary structure from that of the Reserve Bank of India but without success Small wonder that Chakrabarti who became acting chairman on February for a threemonth term has singled out the low morale of the staff as his prime concern He wants to address this on a war footing The Centre has now successfully demoralised him by offering him another uncertain term Former finance minister Manmohan Singh accepted Khans argument on marketdriven package he reportedly wanted a pay scale for his employees that was higher ICICIs but could not do anything about it P Chidambaram repeated Singhs failure on this front and Yashwant Sinha too thinks the proposal is not worth considering because it will have a ripple effect in the industry For instance RBI employees will immediately demand their pound of flesh The finance ministry refuses to see the point that the countrys central bank is not a commercial organisation and does not have to compete with ICICI When three successive finance ministers failed to address IDBIs problems the institution went for soft options It ended up appointing three consultants for restructuring in six years First Booz Allen Hamilton in followed by M B Athreya in and finally Boston Consulting Group The third consultant BCG is yet to submit its report While Booz Allen Hamilton charted out the roadmap for diversification and suggested that the institution spread its wings overseas and tap new business opportunities the Athreya panel said it must convert itself into a bank and the governments stake should come down without delay Over the last few years the institution has been planning its conversion into a bank and blaming the economy for its indifferent performance even as ICICI has been going full steam with new initiatives ICICI Bank is also exploiting synergies with its parent to the hilt while IDBI Bank seems to be embarrassed about ackowledging its pedigree Its not that everything is great at ICICI Over the past few years the institution has lost some senior executives ISec managing director Kishore Chaukar left to join the Tata group ICICI senior general managers Anando Mukherji joined Enron and N J Subaiah took charge at Centurion Bank which he subsequently left The industry suspects the quality of ICICIs assets and is not comfortable with the scorching pace of growth Even the wellpaid ICICI executive cadres find the pace of work is too much to handle and complain of fatigue In private they hate the mad rush for excellence And yet there is a method in ICICIs madness It has trimmed the flab with two successive voluntary retirement schemes branched out into consumer loans in a big way and transformed treasury operations into an art The finance ministry would do well to explore the possibility of divesting the governments stake in IDBI to ICICI Instead of pumping in Rs crore as recapitalisation funds into IFCI it can simply let it die and sell its assets to other banks and financial institutions IDBIs bulk and the brand name in project financing would combine well with ICICIs growing retail presence and unbridled aggression The combination would be formidable enough to give the State Bank of India a run for its money Of course a whole lot of issues need to settled before the process takes off like trimming the flab in IDBI and delinking it from the RBI pay structure et al IDBI merging with ICICI may sound like an absurd dream but it is certainly a better option than merging IFCI with IDBI If Reliance is willing to bid for staterun oil majors HPCL and

Scotlands nuclear output The British Energy contract is worth obn bn in the next four years Shareholders could do with some distraction Scottish Power by its own admission has had a tough year which will be confirmed today when it publishes results for Ian Russell who took over as chief executive in March may even indulge in the new boys practice of including the cost of further forseeable bad news in the figures making any subsequent improvement appear greater His biggest problem will be to convince the City that he is capable of developing an effective strategy to change the groups direction now it has abandoned plans to become a multiutility The group no longer believes adequate returns can be earned from developing a growing range of products to sell to its more than m customers The investment required to develop national brands win new customers and retain old ones is too high in an increasingly competitive UK retail sector it says Mr Russell who as Scottish Powers former finance director was closely associated with the previous policy has already withdrawn from joint ventures with Royal Bank of Scotland to provide financial services and with Thus to provide telecommunications The group is also discussing the future of Southern Water its south of England utility which Enel the Italian statecontrolled energy group is interested in buying Crossselling electricity and gas to Southern Water customers let alone other products has been disappointing it admits The group plans to concentrate on developing its energy interests in the UK and US But these also have their difficulties Some of the biggest problems involve PacifiCorp bought months ago in a deal worth about obn including debt The price is looking more expensive following big rises in US electricity wholesale prices PacifiCorp has not been as badly affected as some US electricity groups But it has faced problems because of a power station breakdown in Utah that forced it to buy higher priced electricity from other generators to meet customer demand The failure of a MW generating unit at its Hunter power plant in November has cost the group m om a day since One piece of good news for shareholders today will be the timing of its return to service this month Another positive note is that PacifiCorp is negotiating higher retail prices with US state regulators to offset increased generation charges It also has about MW of its own new power plant due to start production this year In the UK the group is facing increased competition for retail electricity and gas sales particularly in the household market It has also had to absorb big price cuts imposed on its power distribution side by Ofgem the industry regulator The shares which fell p on Wednesday to p have fallen by more than per cent against the FTSE All Share Index since December when the PacifiCorp offer was announced So where does the group go from here It made its reputation in the s as a shrewd acquirer of UK utilities Southern Water for obn and Manweb the northwest of England electricity supplier for obn Effective cost cutting increased value particularly at Manweb The group was also one of the first electricity companies to string telecommunication lines along its electricity pylons The sale of a per cent stake in Thus which operates the telecoms network raised obn in Financing further UK and US acquisitions will be challenging Thus shares have fallen from p a year ago to p on Wednesday night Scottish Power has net debt of some obn with interest thinly covered three times by earnings before tax and interest It has been talking with Enron about buying Portland General its Oregonbased electricity utility The group might need to sell Southern to cover the purchase price of about bn including debt Buying in the UK may be even harder Scottish Power has been outbid recently for regional electricity suppliers by the deeper pockets of large continental European utilities What Scottish Powers shareholders will want to know is where growth will come from and how the group will pay for it USA UPDATE Calpine Kinder Morgan plan NMCalif natgas line Reuters English News

I refer of course to Californias energy market or as the power generators call it Who Wants to be a MultiBillionaire Its becoming clear that this game is fixed Regis is giving all of the questions What color is the sky to contestants like Enron and Reliant PGE and Southern California Edison Meanwhile we consumers are hit with How many kwh did the BPA generate in the month of May Sorry youre out of lifelines How are consumers supposed to compete in this game Even our legislators who belong to the same party as Gov Gray The Negotiator Davis dont know whats going on Its like trying to play poker while everybody else is holding the cards said Assemblywoman Pat Wiggins But while we may not be holding the cards well for sure be left holding the bag when this thing plays out So who do we blame State Sen Wes Chesbro has an idea In the long term the gougers need to be held accountable he said in a Monday article Ah yes The gougers Those outrageous outofstate dirty dealing pricefixing electricityrate gougers who have driven PGE right into bankruptcy and threaten to do the same to Southern California Edison Lets get em But hold on a minute It turns out that some of those gougers that caused PGE and Edison all that trouble are just PGE and Edison wearing different hats Both utilities produce power and sell it on the same market as the gougers Then they buy it back Also out there with the Enrons and Reliant Energies of the world the other power generators that sell electricity to the utilities is a company called National Energy Group It has power plants in states and controls a natural gas pipeline to Northern California And its owned by PGE Corp the parent company of PGE Co Try to keep up with me here PGE Co is the company that has been so devastated by Californias energy deregulation debacle Its the company to which you are writing monthly checks that are beginning to resemble your mortgage payment It is the company that for decades was guaranteed a profit by the rates set by the states Public Utilities Commission It is the company that said it lost billions before it declared bankruptcy last month Poor PGE Co PGE Corp on the other hand is squatting in tall cotton as my daddy used to say The Corp received more than billion from the Co from according to a PUC audit But the Corp says it wouldnt be fair if it had to put any of that money back into the Co its ailing subsidiary It wants the people whose utility bills created that profit to pay higher bills now to bail out the Co so the Corp can avoid bankruptcy of its own Who is being unfair Meanwhile Southern California Edison also has been shipping its profits also more than billion at last report to its parent company while looking to the state for a bailout Now Gov Gray The Generator Davis wants the taxpayers of this state to pay billion to Southern California Edison for that utilitys transmission system But as far as I can tell Edisons rate payers already paid to build maintain and operate that system with rates set by the PUC that guaranteed that company a profit Now were being asked to buy what those ratepayers built I know that PGEs and Edisons accountants and public relations people would argue that Im all wrong here And to tell the truth when I try to follow the money through a maze of stranded costs and contract power and uncollected power purchase costs and rate reduction bond credits and the like my eyes start to blur But theres nothing wrong with my sense of smell so I can tell you for sure this whole thing stinks What can we do Turn off the lights and scream Call Coursey at or email LNG carriage to be preserve of Indiaflag ships Lloyds List International Copyright C LLoyds List Source World Reporter TM In an attempt to cash in on the liquefied natural gas revolution Indias shipping ministry is pushing through a proposal to restrict the transportation of the gas only to companies registered in India and vessels carrying the Indian flag It would seem that the logic primarily is to ensure that Indian shipping does not get left behind in the LNG transportation race Until now the ministry has managed to get LNG ferried by energy companies on fob basis We hope that this new proposal would give further impetus to Indian bottoms says shipping secretary Michael Pinto We will do all we can to get approval from the committee of secretaries and the Cabinet Since some of the shipping contracts have already been finalised this proposal would only be made applicable to future contracts However shipping experts are extremely doubtful whether the proposal can be implemented The leading Indian shipping companies have neither the funds nor the expertise of carrying LNG and would need the assistance of foreign companies to make the ventures a success A foreign LNG carrier is not going to settle for a minority stake unless the Indian shipper is able to put up his share of the equity which would be quite a handful says Sudhir J Mulji executive vicechairman of Great Eastern Shipping Company and current president of the Indian National Shipowners Association The proposal really does not seem to be feasible For the moment just two major contracts have been signed both involving the stateowned Shipping Corporation of India SCI The first one involves SCI American power major Enron and Mitsui of Japan for the carriage of m tonnes of LNG per annum for Enrons MW mega power project at Dabhol near Ratnagiri in southern Maharashtra SCI had entered into this memorandum of understanding with MOL formerly Mitsui OSK Lines and Atlantic Commercial Finance which is an Enron affiliate However it is only a partner in the consortium with Enron holding a stake and Mitsui OSK the balance The gas will be ferried by the LNG Lakshmi brandnew cu m capacity vessel being constructed in Japan at the Mitsui Shipyard The contract is valid for years from the date of starting However the consortium is registered in the Cayman Islands which is a tax haven and the LNG vessel will carry the flag of Malta SCI has also secured the contract for carrying m tonnes per annum of LNG for the governmentowned pipeline company Petronet LNG The gas is to be ferried from RasGas of Qatar to the companys upcoming LNG terminal at Dahej in Gujarat A similar Petronet terminal but half the size of Dahej is coming up in Kochi Kerala state The transportation contract for this is to be decided later Two other major Indian shipowners who have taken a step towards LNG transportation are Great Eastern Shipping and Essar Shipping The former has formed a consortium with Indian Oil Corporation and Exmar while Essar has joined hands with Malaysia International Shipping Corporation MISC to form a joint venture dedicated to gas transportation The Dollars bn MISC the national shipping line of Malaysia is one of the worlds leading owners and operators of LNG tankers As a listed company on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange MISC has the stateowned petroleum and oil giant Petronas a Fortune company as its largest shareholder with a stake of Our memorandum of understanding has both companies holding an equal equity share in the joint venture said Essar Shippings chief executive Sanjay Mehta However at a later date we may both dilute our stakes equally in favour of a third strategic partner and continue to hold equal equity The final debtequity ratio for the acquisition of the LNG vessels will be decided by the management of the joint venture Shipping secretary Mr Pinto feels that there are many opportunities for Indian companies but is insistent that the tonnage be registered in India so that ancillary business activities in the sector are spurred We will try and secure tax benefits for the shipowners concerned since they badly need to gain the experience management and manpower training in a niche segment he said It would also help in Indian fleet expansion since tonnage has remained virtually stagnant for the last five yearsMichael

PacifiCorp also serves customers in Washington Idaho Utah Wyoming and California for total of million residential and business customers PGE serves customers primarily in the populous northern Willamette Valley Speculation about the potential hookup with PGE surfaced during the weekend in Britains Observer newspaper In the article an unidentified source described the merger as an obvious

no comment on the rumors said Mark Palmer Houstonbased Enron spokesman We dont comment on market speculation said Rachel Sherrard a spokeswoman for PacifiCorp The speculation whether of substance or whimsy has drawn the attention of state regulators and consumer advocacy groups I think it would get a great deal of scrutiny and I think there would be some serious concerns said Ron Eachus head of the Oregon Public Utility Commission The PUC must approve utility mergers The agency hasnt received any notice that talks are occurring Eachus said Bob Jenks executive director of the Citizens Utility Board said his organization which represents customers of investorowned utilities likely would oppose a PGEPacifiCorp merger Were not pleased by the idea he said The Citizens Utility Board has become increasingly critical of PacifiCorps handling of the Wests electricity crisis which has forced the utility into the expensive wholesale power market The board is fighting PacifiCorps efforts to raise

Lloyds List International Copyright C LLoyds List Source World Reporter TM With the Shipping Corporation of India taking a major stake in the Petronet LNG Indias maritime industries a high profile SHIRISH NADKARNI ON the final Thursday of March there was a celebration in NeDelhi involving the four members of the consortium that had bagged the Dollars m liquefied natural gas transportation contract of Petronet LNG It is the Japanese custom to celebrate an event like this and only the consortium members and their officials were invited to the function says KM Joseph director bulk carriers and tankers with the Shipping Corporation of India SCI which has a equity stake in the winning partnership The other members of the consortium are Japans MOL formerly Mitsui OSK Lines NYK Line and K Line and the contract involves ferrying m tonnes per annum of LNG from the Middle East to Petronet LNGs terminal at Dahej in Gujarat Two LNG carriers will be involved in the deal each capable of carrying cu m of gas and expected to cost Dollars m each The vessels are to be constructed at Daewoo Shipbuilding Yard in South Korea This was Indias second major LNG transportation deal and SCI the public sector shipping monolith which owns roughly half of the countrys oceangoing fleet of vessels has a stake in both of them as does MOL MOL is a professionally managed company whose cultural ethos is similar to ours says the goateebearded Prabhat Kumar Srivastava SCIs chairman and managing director Our relationship is based on total transparency and trust and we therefore feel comfortable with them There may well be more such tieups in the future The earlier deal was also sealed with MOL which has a stake in a joint venture named Greenfield Shipping Company GSC with US energy major Enron holding the remaining equity The three members will have joint ownership of the cu m LNG carrier LNG Lakshmi now under construction at the Mitsui Heavy Industries shipyard in Japan When ready the vessel will ferry m tpa of LNG from RasGas of Qatar to Enrons megapower facility at Dabhol near Ratnagiri in southern Maharashtra However to return to the Petronet deal The MOLSCI consortium won the coveted contract by quoting a charter hire rate of Dollars per day which was substantially lower than the bids of the two other competing consortia MISCEssar and ExmarGreat Eastern ShippingIndian Oil Corporation The Petronet LNG deal was the most prestigious and important LNG shipping project in the country and we were very keen to secure it says Mr Srivastava So we told our Japanese partners to quote the best possible rates A stake in the consortium formed with Enron may only be sufficient to net SCI a boardroom presence in GSC but its stake in the Petronet LNG shipping venture will allow the shipping major to exercise much more power on the latter companys board There are other issues involved If we had not emerged winners in Petronets shipping deal it would have done us a lot of harm for the other LNG shipping projects that are fast coming up in the country says Mr Srivastava We have already made tremendous headway in LNG shipping by being part of the Dabhol project and we were very keen to maintain the momentum Experts rate SCI as one of the best managed public sector enterprises and the bottom line of the company reinforces this feeling For the first nine months of the financial year SCI had a sales turnover of Rsbn Dollars m which was better than the Rsbn recorded for the corresponding nine months of the previous year The net profit zoomed from Rsm during the period April to December to Rsbn for the same nine months of While the results for the financial year ended March are still being compiled SCI officials place the sales turnover at around Rsbn and the net profit at just above the Rsbn mark While the companys tankers have produced spectacular results even the lossmaking liner division is expected to turn round the corner We have removed nearly of the nonperforming assets in the division and the balance will be chopped off in the fiscal year says Sudhir S Rangnekar director liner shipping division Recently international consultants Pricewaterhouse Coopers PwC carried out a SWOT analysis for SCI They suggested a corporate transformation of the company apart from going ahead with the information technology initiatives taken earlier The company went ahead and signed a memorandum of understanding with the ministry of shipping for the financial year whereby two new criteria will be used for judging the organisations performance A new criterion corporate transformation project implementation has been introduced in the MoU reflecting the emphasis that we are placing on enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of

FERCS LATEST REFUND ORDERS Foster Electric Report c Copyright Foster Associates Inc About the same time that PGE Corp and Edison International announced combined writeoffs of nearly billion in unrecovered purchased power costs four major California energy suppliers reported increases ranging from percent to percent in firstquarter revenues Meanwhile FERC has issued new refund orders requiring many of these same generators to justify in overcharges during March PGE and Southern California Edison Cos WriteOffs After a long delay PGE and Edison during the middle of April confirmed what many knew was coming huge writeoffs for unrecovered purchased power costs during the year Edison announced that it was writing off billion in undercollected power costs for the year leaving the company with a billion loss for the year Edison chief John Bryson was hopeful nevertheless that a recent memorandum of understanding MOU his company signed with the state will allow Edison to recover some of those costs and help keep its Southern California Edison Co SoCal Edison affiliate out of bankruptcy Prompt implementation of the MOU can avoid the large costs of a SoCal Edison bankruptcy and make it possible for the company to restore its financial health and ability to maintain a reliable power grid said Bryson in a statement accompanying Edisons financial results Whether Brysons hope for quick implementation of the MOU will be realized is questionable Gov Gray Davis has been having a hard time finding the necessary legislative support for the proposal and to date has been unable even to find a legislator to sponsor a bill to implement the MOU Instead several state legislators are exploring alternatives including having the state buy SoCal Edisons transmission assets as well as the whole utility and turn it into a state power agency Edisons northern California neighbor PGE Corp reported a strong growth in revenues for led by the strong performance of its energy trading unit but that revenue growth was completely offset by the billion in losses incurred by its now bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric Co utility subsidiary While standard accounting rules required the utility to record a charge against earnings for unreimbursed wholesale and transition costs taking this charge does not diminish our conviction that the utility is entitled under law to recover these costs nor does it diminish our ongoing lawsuit in federal district court said PGE Corp chief Robert Glynn Generators FirstQuarter Revenue Reports In sharp contrast with PGEs and Edisons financial performance the parent companies of four of Californias largest generators reported large jumps in firstquarter revenues Enron Corp reported revenues of billion a whopping percent increase from a year earlier The company owns only a small amount of wind generation in California but sells power into the state through its Portland General Electric subsidiary and is an energy trader in the state Enrons commodity sales and service unit showed a percent increase in firstquarter earnings Reliant Energy Inc saw firstquarter earnings jump percent to billion The companys wholesale energy business unit produced million in operating income for the first quarter up sharply from the million loss the company reported a year earlier Reporting a slightly lower but still a substantial percent jump in firstquarter revenues was Dynegy Inc Of the companys billion in revenues for the period its marketing and trading subsidiary realized million in earnings nearly double the in earnings reported a year earlier The parent company reported a percent jump in first quarter earnings over the previous year Duke Energy Corp announced a percent boost in firstquarter revenues to billion led by a percent increase in earnings by wholesale energy unit FERCs Refund Order Similar to separate orders regarding January and February power sales in California FERC on issued a notice demanding that three generators justify in combined power sales during March FERC staff set a MWh proxy clearing price for the month and then applied it to the hours of Stage power alerts that were declared during March in California The staffs proxy prices for January and February were MWh and MWh respectively The clearing prices fluctuations can be attributed to changes in operating costs including fuel and

boycott help lower Californias electricity bill By MICHAEL LIEDTKE AP Business Writer Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved SAN FRANCISCO AP Theres a limit to how much people will pay for most things in life If the cost scares off enough buyers prices eventually fall So what would happen if this textbook example from Economics were applied to Californias electricity crisis What if the state officials struggling to maintain energy supplies simply refused to buy power above a certain price and accepted more blackouts this summer The question would have been absurd just a few months ago and even now the notion seems surreal given the possible consequences Inviting even more blackouts inevitably would hurt businesses and frustrate consumers threatening to further depress Californias already slumping economy the sixth largest in the world But desperate times require drastic measures according to the economists lawmakers and activists who believe the state will be better off sitting in the dark than buying electricity at any price during a summer shortage likely to produce recurring blackouts anyway Its better to use blackouts and break the wholesale energy cartel than simply to suffer them said Michael Shames executive director of the Utility Consumer Action Network a San Diego watchdog group Refusing to buy enough power to keep the lights on would be like playing with fire counters Wells Fargo Co chief economist Sung Won Sohn Blackouts arent a just matter of inconvenience or being too hot or cold They cost businesses a lot of money Buying electricity at the last minute to meet the states power needs already has cost the California government billion in the past months The state energy bill for could reach billion in money otherwise spent on education public safety and health care Shames said Faced with the prospect of a significant budget deficit some lawmakers think its time for California to take a stand against the power wholesalers many of whom are based outside the state This Tuesday the state Senate Energy Committee will consider authorizing the state to refuse to buy power above certain prices Current law requires state electricity managers to avoid blackouts by buying all available power at any cost We have been over a barrel in so many ways said Sen Dede Alpert DCoronado who sponsored SBx Maybe theres a point in the market where we just say no and go with the planned blackout strategy instead Economists give the bill little chance of succeeding Its never going to happen Its not a viable option said University of California at Berkeley Professor Severin Borenstein one of the energy experts who have studied the idea The business lost during blackouts would mean more layoffs in a state already skittish over the technology downturn and the looming Hollywood writers strike economists say Other ripple effects include diminished gasoline supplies leading to even higher prices at the pump and distribution headaches that could leave store shelves bare And some consumers the elderly and the infirm for example need power at any price Without electricity Manteca resident Betty Jarzemkoski said she wouldnt be able to help her ailing husband to get out of his motorized bed at home It would be a real hardship for us said Jarzemkoski Im on a fixed income so I hope they can figure out something to bring down prices But we need power Despite such concerns the concept of a buyers boycott hasnt been flatly ruled out at least publicly by Gov Gray Davis as he struggles to reduce the states staggering electricity bill The state is spending as much as million per day to meet Californias electricity needs and the bleeding is sure to get worse When the summer heat increases demand and tightens supplies California might spend more than billion each week state officials estimate Extended blackouts pose an even greater cost economists say When Northern California suffered rolling blackouts for several hours Jan the economic losses totaled billion mostly from lost profits and wages estimated the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp Multiply that over several weeks across the entire state and it becomes apparent why it makes more sense for California to continue buying power at inflated prices even if leaves the state with deep debts and a ruined credit rating economists argue As it is California probably wont be able to round up enough power at any price on some days this summer making some blackouts a virtual certainty The blackouts will reduce the states economic output by billion to billion according to a study released last month by the Bay Area Economic Forum The resolve of the states politicians and ratepayers would be sorely tested for a boycott to succeed much in the way that labor strikes boil down to whether workers or management can withstand more financial pain Politicians arent going to willingly turn out the lights because politicians want to get reelected said Borenstein director of the University of Californias energy institute As soon as people start losing their jobs because the power is off the public will get tired of the blackouts real quick Still Californians might tolerate an increase in blackouts if they understand why the state chose to pursue such a drastic course said Stanford economics Professor Frank Wolak who heads the Independent System Operators market surveillance committee This isnt something you could do without an enormous public relations campaign he said The campaign would have to explain that the state had no other choice but to do this because federal power regulators arent doing their job and enforcing the law against unjust and unreasonable prices The largest outofstate generators are in such robust financial shape that it might take weeks before they would feel such pain from a California boycott that they would be forced to lower prices After making record profits

Limited BOMBAY May Reuters Indian lenders to US energy group Enron Corps gasfired power plant south of Bombay have appealed to the Indian government to help end the companys row with a stateowned electricity board over pricing and upaid bills The board of Enrons Indian unit Dabhol Power Co DPC has authorised management to stop selling power to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB if a bitter dispute over pricing and unpaid bills cannot be resolved In the past half year the MSEB has defaulted on bills for electricity supplied by Dabhol which operates the worlds largest gasfired plant on the west coast of India kilometres miles south of Bombay Indian financial institutions which contributed billion towards the project in loans are pressing the government to help end the crisis a source told Reuters We have asked the government for help We are awaiting their reply the source who is employed with a large financial institution said The domestic lenders to the project are Industrial Development Bank of India ICICI Ltd Industrial Finance Corporation of India Canara Bank and State Bank of India The Dabhol Power Company DPC owned percent by Enron last month took the major step of bailing out of the billion power project citing nonpayment of bills by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB The DPC boards move sparked widespread fears that Indias image as a safe destination for foreign direct investment would be damaged POWER STRUGGLE MSEB which is a stateowned utility has been a regular defaulter on payments to DPC saying that it finds the power too costly It has also backed out on its commitment to buy more power to be produced by the projects second phase which is to begin operations later this year Last month MSEB said it had paid Dabhol Power billion rupees million for electricity it bought in March But the payment only partially resolves the total overdue amount of billion rupees million which Enron has been unable to collect even after invoking guarantees issued by the government of Maharashtra Indias most industrialised state and the federal government The state utility still owes Enron payments for power purchases in December and January The Indian government has maintained that the contract must be renegotiated and has set up a committee to do so We are concerned and would like the renegotiations to happen fast the source added The dispute has raised fears that Enron could pull the plug on the project cease providing power to the local state electricity board and perhaps even sell the plant The plant is good Maharashtra needs power and I am sure buyers can be found the source added Indian rupees DNC Special Interests Write Bush Energy Policy PR Newswire Copyright c PR Newswire WASHINGTON May PRNewswire

campaign promise to regulate carbon dioxide emissions Bush has proposed drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and national monuments Bush has taken a backseat when it comes to the energy crisis California is experiencing while cutting funding for energy conservation programs He has also repaid top donors lobbyists and industry officials with key positions throughout his administration

on electricity White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said The president continues to believe that the issue is mostly a California matter dealing with the legislation that is before the state And the

EDT UK INTERVIEWInnogy starts trading power in mainland Europe By Stuart Penson Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited LONDON May Reuters British utility Innogy said on Thursday it had started trading wholesale electricity on the FrenchItalian border and was set to enter the German power market We have done some wholesale trading on the ItalyFrance border moving power from France to Italy and we are very close to doing some in Germany said director of trading Tony West in an interview with Reuters This year we will significantly increase our trading in mainland Europe we are discussing relationships with counterparties at the moment he added Innogy is building a European power trading team at its headquarters in Swindon southern England from where it already trades the UK gas and power markets FRANCE COULD BE KEY MARKET West said the company initially had expected the main focus of its European trading strategy to be Germany and the north west of the continent But the early signs were that France would also play a key role particularly as Innogy had gained access to capacity in the UKFrance undersea interconnector cable France has taken me by surprise It might be more important than we anticipated although there are clearly still issues about the speed of liberalisation said West A core of about eight companies regularly trade power in France including TXU Europe Enron and a trading alliance between Endesa and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter according to traders West said Innogy had so far concentrated on buying power in France not always from French companies and taking it to Italy via the cross border interconnector between the two countries Innogy had bought some of the megawatts available on the interconnector through recent auctions he said Its easy to trade through France the cost of taking power through to the border is minuscule although buying power in France and then selling it in France is a lot more difficult said West He said Innogy had signed grid balancing agreements with French transmission grid operator RTE Andy Duff managing director of generation and trading added France could become become important for Innogy on a retail level as well as a trading level depending on how effectively the UKFrance interconnector could be used The European market will be driven by the operation of interconnectors and transmission services as well as exchanges said Duff Innogy may look to trade on Germanys two power exchanges as well as that countrys burgeoning overthecounter market The company is in the process of signing standard trading agreements for Germany based on the terms devised by the industry group the European Federation of Energy Traders EFET FOCUS ON TRADING NOT ASSETS Duff said Innogys strategy in Europe was to focus on trading but not the acquisition of physical assets We are not going to lead with assets in Europe We will focus on trading servicestype arrangements extracting value from other companies assets Thats the main thrust of the business he said West said Innogys trading in mainland Europe would expand into natural gas as opportunities emerged The company already trades around the UKBelgium

improved their ability to pay back debt in recent weeks making their bonds a buy investors said Sentiment seems to be changing said Anna LeesJones who helps manage about billion pounds billion of corporate bonds at MG Investment Management Ive been building up my telecoms position all year British Telecoms year eurodenominated bonds sold in January yield about basis points more than government debt down from a record in March Contracts that pay out if the company goes bankrupt have also fallen in the past month according to Enron Corp which trades the derivatives Bond yields and bankruptcy derivatives have also declined for Deutsche Telekom and Royal KPN NV after the companies said they would sell assets to pay down debt that has pushed their credit ratings to record lows and weighed on their shares Phone companies sold billion of bonds last year to finance licenses and equipment for new mobile services British Telecom said yesterday it will sell its stakes in Japan Telecom Co and Spains Airtel SA to Vodafone Group for billion pounds British Telecom may also sell as much as billion pounds of shares to existing investors in a socalled rights offer according to Legal General Group Plc one of the companys shareholders Deutsche Telekom will sell assets such as cable television and a stake in Global One and Wind SpA Chief Financial Officer KarlGerhard Eick said last week KPN the biggest Dutch phone company said on March it plans to raise at least billion euros from asset sales to lower debt Those plans have helped shift investors perceptions of the companies creditworthiness money managers said Drastic Measures At the beginning of the year the market was assuming telecoms companies would be downgraded from singleA to triple B said Peter Harvey who helps run about billion at FC Management Drastic measures such as deeplydiscounted rights issues led investors to believe they will maintain their singleA status The gap or spread between British Telecoms sterling denominated bonds maturing in and UK fiveyear government bonds has narrowed basis points to basis points in the past month Spreads between Deutsche Telekoms percent five year euro bonds and German government debt narrowed basis points to in April Bankruptcy Swaps Fall Those shifts in sentiment are also reflected in Enrons bankruptcy swaps where prices have fallen in the past month said Simon Brooks a trader at Enron Enron prices the swaps using indexes that measure the probability of bankruptcy and the likely recovery rate in that event The price is expressed as a percentage above a benchmark interest rate such as the London interbank offered rate or Libor British Telecom bankruptcy swaps have declined to basis points from on April Enron said Bankruptcy swaps on Deutsche Telekom dropped to from while KPNs fell to from Over the same period France Telecom SAs declined to from and Telecom Italia SpAs fell to from British Telecoms bond yields may fall further relative to government debt analysts said They still offer higher yields than those of rival Vodafone Group Plc which has the same ratings though with a stable outlook While both companies have fiveyear eurodenominated bonds British Telecoms offer basis points more yield The rivals also both have bonds maturing in and Vodafones yield about basis points fewer If BT retains their rating their spreads should be probably to basis points narrower said Brian Venables head of credit strategy at WestLB Even though it has performed extremely well this year there is much greater potential for BTs debt Debt Reduction Target Both Moodys Investors Service which rates British Telecom A and Standard Poors which rates it A have those ratings on watch for further cuts after trimming them four rungs last year The companys asset sales to Vodafone are definitely positive in terms of the rating assessment said Aidan Fisher who rates British Telecom for Moodys In combination with the proceeds of a rights sale that would meet the target they set themselves this year thats quite a lot to achieve in a month period British Telecom has said it wants to slash its billion pounds of debt by a third and fend off further rating cuts Before companies such as British Telecom clarified their debtreduction plans the world and his wife were underweight telecom bonds in March said Harvey at FC The investment firm has since raised its holding of telecom bonds to neutral from underweight relative to its benchmark he said Bond yields were trading very much out of line to the rest of the market said LeesJones

analysis on Bloomberg BRITEL Corp GO for BTs bonds DT Corp GO for Deutsche Telekoms bonds UKCorporates warm to charms of credit derivatives By Tom Bergin Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited LONDON May Reuters European corporates are beginning to turn to credit derivatives among the more esoteric and complex of financial instruments to hedge the risk their debtors wont pay up market participants said on Thursday Credit derivatives are insurancelike tools that allow users to hedge the risk of default on a debt They are mainly used by banks hedge funds and insurance companies to hedge or gain exposure to the risk of a bond issuer defaulting Dealers said an environment of deteriorating credit quality and a growing awareness among corporates that credit derivatives offer certain advantages over established hedging tools was behind the increasing use of the instruments The market remains small with only around a dozen nonfinancial European corporates regularly using credit derivatives to manage their credit portfolio at present But market professionals predict they will one day become as commonplace in the corporate world as other hedging tools such as interest rate swaps and currency options We see corporate use as a big growth area for credit derivatives maybe the biggest says Bryan Seyfried vicepresident of Enron Credit in London Enron Credit grew out of the efforts of energy company Enron Corp to hedge its own credit risk portfolio and now specialises in marketing credit risk management solutions to other nonfinancial corporates Ralf Lierow director of credit derivatives at Siemens Financial Services in Munich said the ability to buy and sell in a liquid market means credit derivatives offer a flexibility that established tools like credit insurance and forfaiting guarantees lack Credit derivatives were are often cheaper than the alternatives too he added This is not a trading book thing For us the credit default swap is another tool for credit risk management Lierow said HELPS OPERATIONAL UNITS DO MORE BUSINESS Siemens Financial Services acts as the centralised risk portfolio management operation for companies within the Siemens electronics and industrial group It first started using credit derivatives in July Large companies like Siemens can have hundreds of millions of dollars in receivables on their books at any time The efficiency with which these companies manage the credit risk on their receivables has an impact on their day to day business The advantage for the operative area is that they can offload more receivables and do more business Lierow said Siemens uses credit default swaps the most liquid type of credit derivatives to hedge its portfolio of debtors on a constant basis As the balance of cash owed by each name fluctuates over time the company tries to match this with default swap positions Hence if a customer fails to pay Siemens can recoup the debt from the default swap seller Other companies use credit derivatives less frequently There are occasional corporate users that have secured oneoff requirements for balancesheet management aims or to strip out the credit risk of a commercial transaction said Walter Gontarek head of global credit products at RBC Dominion Securities By hedging a country or company risk which a corporate may not be comfortable in carrying a credit derivative can facilitate a project that may otherwise be unfeasible dealers said NOT PUT OFF BY BAD PRESS Corporates adoption of credit derivatives is in spite of the negative publicity the instruments have received in recent years A number of disputes over whether protection buyers could force banks to pay up on contracts have ended up in court However traders insist that subsequent work done on contract documentation minimises the risk of such disputes in future Nonetheless a very practical concern for corporates remains in that credit derivatives documentation was designed by bankers with sovereign and corporate bonds in mind The International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA standard documentation for credit default swaps allows for a payout in relation to defaults on bond payments but not on a private debtors failure to pay We use the ISDA framework but we need it redrafted in specific ways to fit our needs You cannot take a standard contract and trade on it if you want to hedge trade receivables Lierow said These amendments add to the cost of the credit derivative Another problem that corporates face is the complexity of credit derivatives There is little experience of the instruments which are barely a decade old in the corporate world Siemens had to get its expertise from the financial markets hiring Lierow from Bankgesellschaft Berlin Clive Banks UK head of derivatives sales to buyside clients at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney said much of the effort in marketing credit derivatives to corporates involves educating them about the products and the risks involved Its about explaining credit risk management and what kind of volatility and cost having credit risk introduces he said OUTLOOK PROMISING Yet some corporates are beginning to take full advantage of their new tool Lierow said that Siemens which currently only buys credit protection planned to start acting as a default swaps seller in the coming months He said selling would facilitate better matching of protection levels to actual exposures and would enable diversification of risk away from industry sectors where the companys activities are concentrated You could improve the portfolio mix by buying protection on automotives and selling protection on pharmaceuticals he said Allegheny Energy buys three power plants Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press

their forecast of the profitability of generating electricity in the US in and beyond because power prices are expected to drop more sharply than natural gas prices starting next year The analysts cut the profit margin in natural gasfired power in to a megawatthour from MWh a difference from their last forecast in February They lowered their power price index for by and for by Thursday in a published report Their forecast is based on forward markets for electricity and gas Gas prices are remaining strong for a much longer period of time while power prices drop off senior electricity industry analyst Raymond Niles said in a telephone conference with investors As a result stock prices for power producers such as AES Corp AES Mirant MIR Calpine Corp CPN and NRG Energy NRG could peak this summer in advance of strong third quarter earnings reports the Salomon report says Investors may still shy away from asset and investmentheavy power producers if realized prices begin to reflect the decreases in power prices now projected in the forward curve the report warns After this summer the stocks of energy companies that focus more on trading will regain momentum Salomon expects These energy merchant companies such as Enron Corp ENE Williams Cos WMB Duke Energy DUK and Dynegy DYN should be able to take advantage of higher trading volume and greater volatility in power markets in nonsummer months according to Salomon We expect annual trading volumes to grow industrywide between and on average during as the billion global energy commodity market continues to open the report predicts The overall electricity price trend is national according to Salomon The report titled Power Curve expects wholesale power prices to exceed last years by in the West and by on average in the eastern US including Texas But since their last forecast the analysts lowered their forward price curve for next year and beyond in of regional power pools Interestingly the exception to that is the New York Power Pool Niles told investors For the remainder of this year however Salomon still expects power producers to beat substantially last years breakthrough results About of the spike upward in western US power prices the past six months has been from something weve never seen before in this industry political and credit risk Niles said in the conference Western merchant power suppliers are benefitting from the unholy mess in California Niles said but that wont last forever Whenever the debate tapers off and we have a resolution in sight that premium will slowly drain out of the western markets and bring down profitability for the group Niles said National calls for reregulation due to the California crisis could continue to hurt stock prices for the entire sector even though reregulation wont happen Further in so far as such calls discourage investment in generating plants transmission lines and gas pipelines they could also extend the current period of extremely high

Company and Dynegy Canada midstream assets An additional million of equity is expected to be sold in the coming months to pay down shortterm debt and complete the permanent financing The improvement in Rating Outlook primarily reflects NBPs demonstrated commitment to undertake conservative longterm financing and operating strategies Future acquisitions at the partnership level are expected to be financed debtequity so as to maintain financial flexibility and a stable credit profile Moreover management has shown a strong bias to minimize commodity price risk as it expands its nonregulated gas

contract Dabhol Power Company DPC said in a statement As a matter of courtesy we have agreed to meet with them next week the DPC statement said Since the purpose of our meeting is to hear out the committee and understand their thoughts we will not present any proposal DPC said it had constantly maintained that it was open to maintaining a dialogue towards resolving issues But This meeting should in no manner be construed as an open offer from DPC to renegotiate the terms of the contract it added DPC and the government of the western state of Maharashtra have been locked in a payment battle for months with the states electricity board balking at paying Enron what it considers too high a rate for electricity At present Maharashtras State Electricity Board MSEB owes the DPC of which Enron is a percent stakeholder some million for power The Maharashtra government last week announced the formation of a panel of experts to renegotiate its contract with DPC and lower the cost of power sold to MSEB LARGEST FOREIGN INVESTMENT The Dabhol project the single largest foreign investment in India consists of two phases the alreadybuilt megawatt power plant and a MW plant that is expected to be finished this year Last week Dabhols board authorised the plants managing director to issue a preliminary notice of termination of service to MSEB The notice which has not been issued

investment missteps and unexpected disasters UK verticallyintegrated utility Scottish Power SPI is hoping a new strategy to streamline its businesses will signal a more focused period for the company But its got its work cut out While investors were cheered by news that its US Utahbased Hunter power plant is back online after a sixmonth outage that cost the company an estimated million uncertainty over its plans for its Southern Water unit and apparent ongoing commitment to lossmaking telecoms venture Thus are seen as muddling group focus It all adds up the lack of coherent strategy quite substantial downgrades and a whole host of noncore businesses that they dont have any natural management flair or expertise in said Brian Gallagher a senior fund manager at Londonbased Gartmore Investment Management which has GBP million of Scottish Power shares in its Global Utilities Fund We have a reasonably low opinion of the company The company said Thursday that its pretax profit before goodwill amortization and exceptional items for the fiscal year ending March fell to GBP million from GBP million a year ago Adjusted earnings per share declined to pence in the fiscal year from pence in The company acknowledged profits have been hit hard by the Hunter outage competition on wholesale and retail markets in the UK and strict price controls on its regulated infrastructure businesses Although the companys shares were trading at pence after the release of Thursdays earnings results up from pence Wednesday they are down more than from pence a year ago Executives say they are restructuring the business into three targeted divisions to capitalize on its traditional strengths in generation and power supply and infrastructure and to expand its overseas activities Weve now got a trading and commercial link between generation and supply and the first thing we are doing is putting emphasis on thaton growing earnings across that value chain Scottish Power Chief Executive Ian Russell told journalists in a conference call Thursday In the US we are focused on cost cutting and on acquiring new businesses Scottish Powers move away from a full multiutility profile begun last year with its partial disposal of Thus and its withdrawal from an Internet banking venture with the Royal Bank of Scotland toward a more narrowly focused energy business mimics a trend across the industry toward greater specialization The company is also considering selling Southern Water which would allow it to focus even more closely on its power business Yet analysts and investors say they are looking for more details of the companys overall growth strategy from Russell who took over as chief executive last month and other managers The toll from months of drift is evident they said Sales Of Southern Water Thus Seen Indeed despite its efforts to chart a new road Scottish Power appears to be reluctant to acknowledge the failure of some of its noncore ventures Russell said his company remains supportive of Thus which reported a fiscal year loss of GBP million this week and has no plans to exit its remaining stake in the company Similarly he said Scottish Power hasnt yet made a final decision to dispose of Southern Water which has cut costs under its Scottish parent but is increasingly unable to cover its capital expenditure although he said the company had received a number of offers from potential buyers Although he declined to identify any of the bidders Italian energy company Enel SpA ENI has confirmed its interest Industry sources said a prompt sale of the water unit looks likely with some bids already exceeding the GBP billion at which many analysts value the companys combined assets and debt Its unclear they said how Southern Water or Thus would fit into Scottish Powers new image Scottish Power sees itself as an international energy company a source familiar with the company said In a years time he added it would be unlikely that Southern Water and Thus would be part of the company Revenues from the sale of the water unit would also help Scottish Power pursue its US expansion without adding to its gearing levels analysts and investors said Russell declined to comment on reports Scottish Power is considering buying Enron Corps Oregonbased unit Portland General but admitted the company would be a logical geographical fit with Pacificorp Analysts said Scottish Powers plans for US growth is likely to be a key part of its energy strategy We like their US strategy where theyve leveraged expertise gained in the highly competitive UK market said Gareth LewisDavies head of utilities research at Lehman Brothers in London Closer to home competition and the trend toward increased specialization in the power industry may force Scottish Power to determine whether its business strength lies in asset management or retail and generation Strategic decisions need to be made and Im not sure if they are going to make them in the near term or not said Andrew Wright UK utilities analyst at UBS Warburg in London They are pretty much involved across the value chain and I think it remains to be seen which part of the value chain they

boycott help lower Californias electricity bill By MICHAEL LIEDTKE AP Business Writer Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved SAN FRANCISCO AP Theres a limit to how much people will pay for most things in life If the cost scares off enough buyers prices eventually fall So what would happen if this textbook example from Economics were applied to Californias electricity crisis What if the state officials struggling to maintain energy supplies simply refused to buy power above a certain price and accepted more blackouts this summer The question would have been absurd just a few months ago and even now the notion seems surreal given the possible consequences Inviting even more blackouts inevitably would hurt businesses and frustrate consumers threatening to further depress Californias already slumping economy the sixth largest in the world But desperate times require drastic measures according to the economists lawmakers and activists who believe the state will be better off sitting in the dark than buying electricity at any price during a summer shortage likely to produce recurring blackouts anyway Its better to use blackouts and break the wholesale energy cartel than simply to suffer them said Michael Shames executive director of the Utility Consumer Action Network a San Diego watchdog group Refusing to buy enough power to keep the lights on would be like playing with fire counters Wells Fargo Co chief economist Sung Won Sohn Blackouts arent a just matter of inconvenience or being too hot or cold They cost businesses a lot of money Buying electricity at the last minute to meet the states power needs already has cost the California government billion in the past months The state energy bill for could reach billion in money otherwise spent on education public safety and health care Shames said Faced with the prospect of a significant budget deficit some lawmakers think its time for California to take a stand against the power wholesalers many of whom are based outside the state This Tuesday the state Senate Energy Committee will consider authorizing the state to refuse to buy power above certain prices Current law requires state electricity managers to avoid blackouts by buying all available power at any cost We have been over a barrel in so many ways said Sen Dede Alpert DCoronado who sponsored SBx Maybe theres a point in the market where we just say no and go with the planned blackout strategy instead Economists give the bill little chance of succeeding Its never going to happen Its not a viable option said University of California at Berkeley Professor Severin Borenstein one of the energy experts who have studied the idea The business lost during blackouts would mean more layoffs in a state already skittish over the technology downturn and the looming Hollywood writers strike economists say Other ripple effects include diminished gasoline supplies leading to even higher prices at the pump and distribution headaches that could leave store shelves bare And some consumers the elderly and the infirm for example need power at any price Without electricity Manteca resident Betty Jarzemkoski said she wouldnt be able to help her ailing husband to get out of his motorized bed at home It would be a real hardship for us said Jarzemkoski Im on a fixed income so I hope they can figure out something to bring down prices But we need power Despite such concerns the concept of a buyers boycott hasnt been flatly ruled out at least publicly by Gov Gray Davis as he struggles to reduce the states staggering electricity bill The state is spending as much as million per day to meet Californias electricity needs and the bleeding is sure to get worse When the summer heat increases demand and tightens supplies California might spend more than billion each week state officials estimate Extended blackouts pose an even greater cost economists say When Northern California suffered rolling blackouts for several hours Jan the economic losses totaled billion mostly from lost profits and wages estimated the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp Multiply that over several weeks across the entire state and it becomes apparent why it makes more sense for California to continue buying power at inflated prices even if leaves the state with deep debts and a ruined credit rating economists argue As it is California probably wont be able to round up enough power at any price on some days this summer making some blackouts a virtual certainty The blackouts will reduce the states economic output by billion to billion according to a study released last month by the Bay Area Economic Forum The resolve of the states politicians and ratepayers would be sorely tested for a boycott to succeed much in the way that labor strikes boil down to whether workers or management can withstand more financial pain Politicians arent going to willingly turn out the lights because politicians want to get reelected said Borenstein director of the University of Californias energy institute As soon as people start losing their jobs because the power is off the public will get tired of the blackouts real quick Still Californians might tolerate an increase in blackouts if they understand why the state chose to pursue such a drastic course said Stanford economics Professor Frank Wolak who heads the Independent System Operators market surveillance committee This isnt something you could do without an enormous public relations campaign he said The campaign would have to explain that the state had no other choice but to do this because federal power regulators arent doing their job and enforcing the law against unjust and unreasonable prices The largest outofstate generators are in such robust financial shape that it might take weeks before they would feel such pain from a California boycott that they would be forced to lower prices After making record profits

Limited BOMBAY May Reuters Indian lenders to US energy group Enron Corps gasfired power plant south of Bombay have appealed to the Indian government to help end the companys row with a stateowned electricity board over pricing and upaid bills The board of Enrons Indian unit Dabhol Power Co DPC has authorised management to stop selling power to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB if a bitter dispute over pricing and unpaid bills cannot be resolved In the past half year the MSEB has defaulted on bills for electricity supplied by Dabhol which operates the worlds largest gasfired plant on the west coast of India kilometres miles south of Bombay Indian financial institutions which contributed billion towards the project in loans are pressing the government to help end the crisis a source told Reuters We have asked the government for help We are awaiting their reply the source who is employed with a large financial institution said The domestic lenders to the project are Industrial Development Bank of India ICICI Ltd Industrial Finance Corporation of India Canara Bank and State Bank of India The Dabhol Power Company DPC owned percent by Enron last month took the major step of bailing out of the billion power project citing nonpayment of bills by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB The DPC boards move sparked widespread fears that Indias image as a safe destination for foreign direct investment would be damaged POWER STRUGGLE MSEB which is a stateowned utility has been a regular defaulter on payments to DPC saying that it finds the power too costly It has also backed out on its commitment to buy more power to be produced by the projects second phase which is to begin operations later this year Last month MSEB said it had paid Dabhol Power billion rupees million for electricity it bought in March But the payment only partially resolves the total overdue amount of billion rupees million which Enron has been unable to collect even after invoking guarantees issued by the government of Maharashtra Indias most industrialised state and the federal government The state utility still owes Enron payments for power purchases in December and January The Indian government has maintained that the contract must be renegotiated and has set up a committee to do so We are concerned and would like the renegotiations to happen fast the source added The dispute has raised fears that Enron could pull the plug on the project cease providing power to the local state electricity board and perhaps even sell the plant The plant is good

The Democratic National Committee issued the following today Dick Cheney began dropping hints this week as to what the Bush energy policy will look like and it is long on oil and short on conservation But something was missing from the coverage of Cheneys announcement not just who benefits from the Bush plan but whos writing it as well Photo cgibinprnhDCF Its hard to understate the influence big donors and highranking executives have with the Bush Administration Take Tom Kuhn for example one of the energy executives who came calling when Bush was thinking about actually following through on his pledge to limit carbon dioxide levels Kuhn a top Bush fundraiser also served on Bushs Energy Department transition advisory team and still enjoys access to the highest reaches of the Bush White House Not surprisingly then the Big Oil Bush Administrations energy policy could not make Bushs huge donors and the special interests in the energy business any happier Since the energy industrys problems are Bushs problems the first things on Bushs hit list are the environmental regulations that keep Big Energy in check and our country clean With an energy executive running around the West

campaign promise to regulate carbon dioxide emissions Bush has proposed drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and national monuments Bush has taken a backseat when it comes to the energy crisis California is experiencing while cutting funding for energy conservation programs He has also repaid top donors lobbyists and industry officials with key positions throughout his administration

trading wholesale electricity on the FrenchItalian border and was set to enter the German power market We have done some wholesale trading on the ItalyFrance border moving power from France to Italy and we are very close to doing some in Germany said director of trading Tony West in an interview with Reuters This year we will significantly increase our trading in mainland Europe we are discussing relationships with counterparties at the moment he added Innogy is building a European power trading team at its headquarters in Swindon southern England from where it already trades the UK gas and power markets FRANCE COULD BE KEY MARKET West said the company initially had expected the main focus of its European trading strategy to be Germany and the north west of the continent But the early signs were that France would also play a key role particularly as Innogy had gained access to capacity in the UKFrance undersea interconnector cable France has taken me by surprise It might be more important than we anticipated although there are clearly still issues about the speed of liberalisation said West A core of about eight companies regularly trade power in France including TXU Europe Enron and a trading alliance between Endesa and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter according to traders West said Innogy had so far concentrated on buying power in France not always from French companies and taking it to Italy via the cross border interconnector between the two countries Innogy had bought some of the megawatts available on the interconnector through recent auctions he said Its easy to trade through France the cost of taking power through to the border is minuscule although buying power in France and then selling it in France is a lot more difficult said West He said Innogy had signed grid balancing agreements with French transmission grid operator RTE Andy Duff managing director of generation and trading added France could become become important for Innogy on a retail level as well as a trading level depending on how effectively the UKFrance interconnector could be used The European market will be driven by the operation of interconnectors and transmission services as well as exchanges said Duff Innogy may look to trade on Germanys two power exchanges as well as that countrys burgeoning overthecounter market The company is in the process of signing standard trading agreements for Germany based on the terms devised by the industry group the European Federation of Energy Traders EFET FOCUS ON TRADING NOT ASSETS Duff said Innogys strategy in Europe was to focus on trading but not the acquisition of physical assets We are not going to lead with assets in Europe We will focus on trading servicestype arrangements extracting value from other companies assets Thats the main thrust of the business he said West said Innogys trading in mainland Europe would expand into natural gas as opportunities emerged The company already trades around the UKBelgium

debt down from a record in March Contracts that pay out if the company goes bankrupt have also fallen in the past month according to Enron Corp which trades the derivatives Bond yields and bankruptcy derivatives have also declined for Deutsche Telekom and Royal KPN NV after the companies said they would sell assets to pay down debt that has pushed their credit ratings to record lows and weighed on their shares Phone companies sold billion of bonds last year to finance licenses and equipment for new mobile services British Telecom said yesterday it will sell its stakes in Japan Telecom Co and Spains Airtel SA to Vodafone Group for billion pounds British Telecom may also sell as much as billion pounds of shares to existing investors in a socalled rights offer according to Legal General Group Plc one of the companys shareholders Deutsche Telekom will sell assets such as cable television and a stake in Global One and Wind SpA Chief Financial Officer KarlGerhard Eick said last week KPN the biggest Dutch phone company said on March it plans to raise at least billion euros from asset sales to lower debt Those plans have helped shift investors perceptions of the companies creditworthiness money managers said Drastic Measures At the beginning of the year the market was assuming telecoms companies would be downgraded from singleA to triple B said Peter Harvey who helps run about billion at FC Management Drastic measures such as deeplydiscounted rights issues led investors to believe they will maintain their singleA status The gap or spread between British Telecoms sterling denominated bonds maturing in and UK fiveyear government bonds has narrowed basis points to basis points in the past month Spreads between Deutsche Telekoms percent five year euro bonds and German government debt narrowed basis points to in April Bankruptcy Swaps Fall Those shifts in sentiment are also reflected in Enrons bankruptcy swaps where prices have fallen in the past month said Simon Brooks a trader at Enron Enron prices the swaps using indexes that measure the probability of bankruptcy and the likely recovery rate in that event The price is expressed as a percentage above a benchmark interest rate such as the London interbank offered rate or Libor British Telecom bankruptcy swaps have declined to basis points from on April Enron said Bankruptcy swaps on Deutsche Telekom dropped to from while KPNs fell to from Over the same period France Telecom SAs declined to from and Telecom Italia SpAs fell to from British Telecoms bond yields may fall further relative to government debt analysts said They still offer higher yields than those of rival Vodafone Group Plc which has the same ratings though with a stable outlook While both companies have fiveyear eurodenominated bonds British Telecoms offer basis points more yield The rivals also both have bonds maturing in and Vodafones yield about basis points fewer If BT retains their rating their spreads should be probably to basis points narrower said Brian Venables head of credit strategy at WestLB Even though it has performed extremely well this year there is much greater potential for BTs debt Debt Reduction Target Both Moodys Investors Service which rates British Telecom A and Standard Poors which rates it A have those ratings on watch for further cuts after trimming them four rungs last year The companys asset sales to Vodafone are definitely positive in terms of the rating assessment said Aidan Fisher who rates British Telecom for Moodys In combination with the proceeds of a rights sale that would meet the target they set themselves this year thats quite a lot to achieve in a month period British Telecom has said it wants to slash its billion pounds of debt by a third and fend off further rating cuts Before companies such as British Telecom clarified their debtreduction plans the world and his wife were underweight telecom bonds in March said Harvey at FC The investment

analysis on Bloomberg BRITEL Corp GO for BTs bonds DT Corp GO for Deutsche Telekoms bonds UKCorporates warm to charms of credit derivatives By Tom Bergin Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited LONDON May Reuters European corporates are beginning to turn to credit derivatives among the more esoteric and complex of financial instruments to hedge the risk their debtors wont pay up market participants said on Thursday Credit derivatives are insurancelike tools that allow users to hedge the risk of default on a debt They are mainly used by banks hedge funds and insurance companies to hedge or gain exposure to the risk of a bond issuer defaulting Dealers said an environment of deteriorating credit quality and a growing awareness among corporates that credit derivatives offer certain advantages over established hedging tools was behind the increasing use of the instruments The market remains small with only around a dozen nonfinancial European corporates regularly using credit derivatives to manage their credit portfolio at present But market professionals predict they will one day become as commonplace in the corporate world as other hedging tools such as interest rate swaps and currency options We see corporate use as a big growth area for credit derivatives maybe the biggest says Bryan Seyfried vicepresident of Enron Credit in London Enron Credit grew out of the efforts of energy company Enron Corp to hedge its own credit risk portfolio and now specialises in marketing credit risk management solutions to other nonfinancial corporates Ralf Lierow director of credit derivatives at Siemens Financial Services in Munich said the ability to buy and sell in a liquid market means credit derivatives offer a flexibility that established tools like credit insurance and forfaiting guarantees lack Credit derivatives were are often cheaper than the alternatives too he added This is not a trading book thing For us the credit default swap is another tool for credit risk management Lierow said HELPS OPERATIONAL UNITS DO MORE BUSINESS Siemens Financial Services acts as the centralised risk portfolio management operation for companies within the Siemens electronics and industrial group It first started using credit derivatives in July Large companies like Siemens can have hundreds of millions of dollars in receivables on their books at any time The efficiency with which these companies manage the credit risk on their receivables has an impact on their day to day business The advantage for the operative area is that they can offload more receivables and do more business Lierow said Siemens uses credit default swaps the most liquid type of credit derivatives to hedge its portfolio of debtors on a constant basis As the balance of cash owed by each name fluctuates over time the company tries to match this with default swap positions Hence if a customer fails to pay Siemens can recoup the debt from the default swap seller Other companies use credit derivatives less frequently There are occasional corporate users that have secured oneoff requirements for balancesheet management aims or to strip out the credit risk of a commercial transaction said Walter Gontarek head of global credit products at RBC Dominion Securities By hedging a country or company risk which a corporate may not be comfortable in carrying a credit derivative can facilitate a project that may otherwise be unfeasible dealers said NOT PUT OFF BY BAD PRESS Corporates adoption of credit derivatives is in spite of the negative publicity the instruments have received in recent years A number of disputes over whether protection buyers could force banks to pay up on contracts have ended up in court However traders insist that subsequent work done on contract documentation minimises the risk of such disputes in future Nonetheless a very practical concern for corporates remains in that credit derivatives documentation was designed by bankers with sovereign and corporate bonds in mind The International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA standard documentation for credit default swaps allows for a payout in relation to defaults on bond payments but not on a private debtors failure to pay We use the ISDA framework but we need it redrafted in specific ways to fit our needs You cannot take a standard contract and trade on it if you want to hedge trade receivables Lierow said These amendments add to the cost of the credit derivative Another problem that corporates face is the complexity of credit derivatives There is little experience of the instruments which are barely a decade old in the corporate world Siemens had to get its expertise from the financial markets hiring Lierow from Bankgesellschaft Berlin Clive Banks UK head of derivatives sales to buyside clients at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney said much of the effort in marketing credit derivatives to corporates involves educating them about the products and the risks involved Its about explaining credit risk management and what kind of volatility and cost having credit risk introduces he said OUTLOOK PROMISING Yet some corporates are beginning to take full advantage of their new tool Lierow said that Siemens which currently only buys credit protection planned to start acting as a default swaps seller in the coming months He said selling would facilitate better matching of protection levels to actual exposures and would enable diversification of risk away from industry sectors where the companys activities are concentrated You could improve the portfolio mix by buying protection on automotives and selling protection on pharmaceuticals he said Allegheny Energy buys three power plants Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press

the profit margin in natural gasfired power in to a megawatthour from MWh a difference from their last forecast in February They lowered their power price index for by and for by Thursday in a published report Their forecast is based on forward markets for electricity and gas Gas prices are remaining strong for a much longer period of time while power prices drop off senior electricity

this summer in advance of strong third quarter earnings reports the Salomon report says Investors may still shy away from asset and investmentheavy power producers if realized prices begin to reflect the decreases in power prices now projected in the forward curve the report warns After this summer the stocks of energy companies that focus more on trading will regain momentum Salomon expects These energy merchant companies such as Enron Corp ENE Williams Cos WMB Duke Energy DUK and Dynegy DYN should be able to take advantage of higher trading volume and greater volatility in power markets in nonsummer months according to Salomon We expect annual trading volumes to grow industrywide between and on average during as the billion global energy commodity market continues to open the report

benefitting from the unholy mess in California Niles said but that wont last forever Whenever the debate tapers off and we have a resolution in sight that premium will slowly drain out of the western markets and bring down profitability for the group Niles said National calls for reregulation due to the California crisis could continue to hurt stock prices for the entire sector even though

Northern Border Rtg Outlook To Stable From Negative Business Wire Copyright c Business Wire NEW YORKBUSINESS WIREMay Fitch has affirmed its BBB senior debt rating for Northern Border Partners LP NBP and its A senior debt rating for its regulated pipeline affiliate Northern Border Pipeline Co NBPL The Rating Outlook for both companies is changed to Stable from Negative The rating action was taken after a review of NBPs recent acquisitions and longterm business plan A combination of debt and equity at NBP was used to fund the recent acquisitions of Bear Paw LLC Midwestern Gas Transmission Company and Dynegy Canada midstream assets An additional million of equity is expected to be sold in the coming months to pay down shortterm debt and complete the permanent financing The improvement in Rating Outlook primarily reflects NBPs demonstrated commitment to undertake conservative longterm financing and operating strategies Future acquisitions at the partnership level are expected to be financed debtequity so as to maintain financial flexibility and a stable credit profile Moreover management has shown a strong bias to minimize commodity price risk as it expands its nonregulated gas operations For example processing contracts for Bear Paws four processing facilities are contracted for on a percentage of proceeds basis and liquids prices have been hedged by NBP through limiting downside exposure NBPL continues to exhibit strong competitive market operating and financial characteristics that are consistent with its current A rating The company is a lowcost transporter of

Enron to meet govt panel over Indian project Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited NEW DELHI May Reuters The Indian unit of Enron Corp said on Thursday that its officials would meet members of a government panel formed to renegotiate a troubled billion power project in western India But the willingness to meet the panel next week should not be construed as an offer to renegotiate the contract Dabhol Power Company DPC said in a statement As a matter of courtesy we have agreed to meet with them next week the DPC statement said Since the purpose of our meeting is to hear out the committee and understand their thoughts we will not present any proposal DPC said it had constantly maintained that it was open to maintaining a dialogue towards resolving issues But This meeting should in no manner be construed as an open offer from DPC to renegotiate the terms of the contract it added DPC and the government of the western state of Maharashtra have been locked in a payment battle for months with the states electricity board balking at paying Enron what it considers too high a rate for electricity At present Maharashtras State Electricity Board MSEB owes the DPC of which Enron is a percent stakeholder some million for power The Maharashtra government last week announced the formation of a panel of experts to renegotiate its contract with DPC and lower the cost of power sold to MSEB LARGEST FOREIGN INVESTMENT The Dabhol project the single largest foreign investment in India consists of two phases the alreadybuilt megawatt power plant and a MW plant that is expected to be finished this year Last week Dabhols board authorised the plants managing director to issue a preliminary notice of termination of service to MSEB The notice which has not been issued would be the first step for Enron to pull out of the project Earlier a source familiar with the project told Reuters that Indian lenders who have provided millions of dollars to Houstonbased Enron to build DPC are lobbying with the government to act quickly and end the crisis We have asked the government for help We are awaiting their reply the source who is employed with a large financial institution said The domestic lenders to the project are Industrial Development Bank of India ICICI Ltd Industrial Finance Corporation of India Canara Bank and State Bank of India If Enron pulls out of the project the source said the lenders would have no choice but to seek an alternative buyer The plant is good Maharashtra needs power and I am sure buyers can be found the source added India

investment missteps and unexpected disasters UK verticallyintegrated utility Scottish Power SPI is hoping a new strategy to streamline its businesses will signal a more focused period for the company But its got its work cut out While investors were cheered by news that its US Utahbased Hunter power plant is back online after a sixmonth outage that cost the company an estimated million uncertainty over its plans for its Southern Water unit and apparent ongoing commitment to lossmaking telecoms venture Thus are seen as muddling group focus It all adds up the lack of coherent strategy quite substantial downgrades and a whole host of noncore businesses that they dont have any natural management flair or expertise in said Brian Gallagher a senior fund manager at Londonbased Gartmore Investment Management which has GBP million of Scottish Power shares in its Global Utilities Fund We have a reasonably low opinion of the company The company said Thursday that its pretax profit before goodwill amortization and exceptional items for the fiscal year ending March fell to GBP million from GBP million a year ago Adjusted earnings per share declined to pence in the fiscal year from pence in The company acknowledged profits have been hit hard by the Hunter outage competition on wholesale and retail markets in the UK and strict price controls on its regulated infrastructure businesses Although the companys shares were trading at pence after the release of Thursdays earnings results up from pence Wednesday they are down more than from pence a year ago Executives say they are restructuring the business into three targeted divisions to capitalize on its traditional strengths in generation and power supply and infrastructure and to expand its overseas activities Weve now got a trading and commercial link between generation and supply and the first thing we are doing is putting emphasis on thaton growing earnings across that value chain Scottish Power Chief Executive Ian Russell told journalists in a conference call Thursday In the US we are focused on cost cutting and on acquiring new businesses Scottish Powers move away from a full multiutility profile begun last year with its partial disposal of Thus and its withdrawal from an Internet banking venture with the Royal Bank of Scotland toward a more narrowly focused energy business mimics a trend across the industry toward greater specialization The company is also considering selling Southern Water which would allow it to focus even more closely on its power business Yet analysts and investors say they are looking for more details of the companys overall growth strategy from Russell who took over as chief executive last month and other managers The toll from months of drift is evident they said Sales Of Southern Water Thus Seen Indeed despite its efforts to chart a new road Scottish Power appears to be reluctant to acknowledge the failure of some of its noncore ventures Russell said his company remains supportive of Thus which reported a fiscal year loss of GBP million this week and has no plans to exit its remaining stake in the company Similarly he said Scottish Power hasnt yet made a final decision to dispose of Southern Water which has cut costs under its Scottish parent but is increasingly unable to cover its capital expenditure although he said the company had received a number of offers from potential buyers Although he declined to identify any of the bidders Italian energy company Enel SpA ENI has confirmed its interest Industry sources said a prompt sale of the water unit looks likely with some bids already exceeding the GBP billion at which many analysts value the companys combined assets and debt Its unclear they said how Southern Water or Thus would fit into Scottish Powers new image Scottish Power sees itself as an international energy company a source familiar with the company said In a years time he added it would be unlikely that Southern Water and Thus would be part of the company Revenues from the sale of the water unit would also help Scottish Power pursue its US expansion without adding to its gearing levels analysts and investors said Russell declined to comment on reports Scottish Power is considering buying Enron Corps Oregonbased unit Portland General but admitted the company would be a logical geographical fit with Pacificorp Analysts said Scottish Powers plans for US growth is likely to be a key part of its energy strategy We like their US strategy where theyve leveraged expertise gained in the highly competitive UK market said Gareth LewisDavies head of utilities research at Lehman Brothers in London Closer to home competition and the trend toward increased specialization in the power industry may force Scottish Power to determine whether its business strength lies in asset management or retail and generation Strategic decisions need to be made and Im not sure if they are going to make them in the near term or not said Andrew Wright UK utilities analyst at UBS Warburg in London They are pretty much involved across the value chain and I think it remains to be seen which part of the value chain they

Missing link by Claire Poole The Daily Deal Copyright c The Deal LLC Buying Illinova gave Dynegy a key piece in a puzzle for trading energy anywhere anytime When Chuck Watson decided to take his company beyond natural gas trading he changed its name to Dynegy Inc and took as its logo a tangram a sevenpiece puzzle that can be assembled in thousands of ways Buying utility Illinova Corp in February gave him a piece for delivering such flexibility The Illinova acquisition was probably the most welltimed and best conceived buy of the year raves Jeremy Butler an analyst at Value Line Publishing Inc ReportCard DYNEGY ILLINOVA Stock Price A Profitability B Strategy A Braintrust B Culture B Competitive Position A Overall A Why Besides providing electricity to customers in a squaremile area in Illinois Decatur Illbased Illinova also had recently received regulatory approval to transfer its coal and gasfired generating plants megawatts in all to an unregulated subsidiary as part of the states deregulation of its electricity industry Thanks to soaring energy prices as well as to million to million in overall earnings estimated or achieved from optimizing Illinovas generation assets and improving its operating efficiencies Dynegy is seeing the effects of the deal on its bottom line Illinova has been extremely accretive to earnings said M Carol Coale an analyst at Prudential Securities in Houston Last year in fact Dynegys revenues nearly doubled to billion while its net earnings almost tripled to million or per diluted share as a result of the billion Illinova deal In the first quarter Dynegys net earnings jumped Investors have been amply rewarded Dynegys stock took off last year jumping to per share making it the second best performing stock in the Standard Poors Since the Illinova deal was announced June Dynegys stock has skyrocketed an astounding from to One of those happy investors is San Franciscobased oil and gas giant Chevron Corp which owns about of Dynegy For Watson who formed Dynegy in the late s out of Houston energy company NGS Corp where he was CEO and chairman the success of the Illinova deal underscores his quest to take power and trade it anywhere he wants anytime he wants at any price he wants Thats why he dubbed the company Dynegy a hybrid name taken by combining dynamic with energy If energy prices stay high and Dynegys traders continue to make winning bets analysts expect the companys net earnings per share to increase another this year to million or per share But Dynegy hasnt been immune to the power crisis afflicting California where it coowns four power plants with NRG Energy Inc of Minneapolis that generate megawatts of capacity Indeed since the crisis began Dynegys been defending itself against allegations that its overcharging for power The California situation has hurt Dynegy in other ways too On April for example its stock fell to after utility Pacific Gas Electric Co a unit of PGE Corp filed for bankruptcy Dynegy provides power to the California market as a wholesaler but not to PGE directly Dynegy has also been quibbling recently with another teetering California utility Sempra Energys San Diego Gas Electric which claimed April that Dynegy ordered it to shutter some of the facilities the utility sold it in but that it still operates because it doesnt think it will get paid Dynegy denied the charge Dynegy did not instruct SDGE to shut down generating units nor did we suggest that we would not make power available to creditworthy buyers Stephen W Bergstrom Dynegys president and COO wrote in a letter to SDGE Chairman and CEO Stephen Baum Dynegy has tried to downplay its exposure to the states power woes Its repeatedly pointed out to the press that its stake in the four power plants in California only represents of its total generating portfolio of megawatts or about Analysts however estimate Dynegys exposure in California could give its earnings a haircut of as much as this year Even so Dynegys stock has recovered to a recent Illinova has created some volatility to Dynegys stock because of the addition of power generation to its business Prudentials Coale said But overall its been a great deal While keeping most of Illinova management in place Dynegy made the companys chairman president and CEO Charles Bayless a nonexecutive director of the combined entity Dynegys also marketing and trading all of Illinovas megawatts of output Theyve streamlined power generation and traded around the assets while keeping the distribution business in a sweet spot said John Olson an analyst at Sanders Morris Harris in Houston Illinova meanwhile solved a big investorrelated problem for Dynegy Before the merger only of Dynegys shares were available to the public As part of the deal Watson convinced two of Dynegys strategic partners British Gas plc and Nova Chemicals to sell their combined stake for approximately million in cash and shares of a new convertible preferred stock It also issued million shares after the deal closed Those moves increased Dynegys float to more than of the shares outstanding which led money managers to flood in The companys market capitalization has since tripled to billion Operationally in its effort to focus on power generation trading and marketing Dynegy has been dumping some of its midstream assets such as processing plants and pipelines particularly in the midContinent region The idea now is to increase Dynegys socalled merchant power capacity or the electricity it sells wholesale to anyone who needs it to megawatts by through acquisitions new construction and asset management agreements As a result Watson has become what some are calling an acquisitions hound Hes already acquired some facilities On Jan Dynegy completed the purchase of two power plants in the Hudson River Valley the megawatt Roseton power plant in Newburgh NY and the megawatt Danskammer plant nearby from various area utilities for million Banc of America Securities llc advised Dynegy on both purchases Dynegy has had trouble picking up other power plants however Witness the deal it announced Nov to acquire megawatts worth of electricitygenerating assets in Nevada from Renobased Sierra Pacific Resources for million The deal got scotched April when Nevada regulators spooked by its nextdoor neighbors power crisis repealed the states electricity deregulation plan and put a moratorium on all power plant sales in the state Dynegy estimated the acquisition would have added cents per share to earnings Still since the Illinova merger the total generating capacity built or acquired by Dynegy now exceeds the total capacity added through the merger That includes megawatts of new natural gasfired generation facilities in Georgia Kentucky and Louisiana that are expected to begin commercial operation by June just in time for summer Like its crosstown rival Enron Corp Dynegy has also expanded via acquisitions into broadband telecommunications Dynegy also competes with Houstonbased Reliant Energy and Charlotte NCbased Duke Energy Both Enron and Dynegy see a big opportunity in broadband given that there are few other suppliers and that managing its movement is akin to whats involved with natural gas or electricity In August Dynegy announced it was acquiring Aurora Colobased Extant Inc a privately held developer of telecom solutions for million in cash and stock It completed the deal in September Then in November Dynegy announced it was acquiring privately held Iaxis Ltd a Londonbased telecom that owned and operated an mile fiberoptic network throughout Europe for almost million Dynegy completed the deal in March Dynegy is now developing a mile fiberoptic cable network in the US that it will link to Iaxis network in Europe It hopes its broadband unit which lost million in the first quarter will be profitable by the second half of Still Dynegy has differentiated itself as the antiEnron because among other things it continues to buy power plants rather than sell them Enron meanwhile has been trying to dump its hard assets such as Portland General Electric in Portland Ore Enron CEO Jeff Skilling a polished former McKinsey Co consultant just wants to be a gobetween and not just in energy but in broadband pulp and paper and metals while Dynegys Watson a scrappy former commodities

Asian Wall Street Journal Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Indias electricity shortage cant be solved without a new approach Indias power problem is back on the front burner because global generating giant Enron is threatening to turn off the lights at its Dhabol plant and walk away from a contract with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board In an effort to collect million owed for electricity already supplied the American company has invoked central government guarantees and declared a political force majeure but without much success So technically India is facing a sovereign default after which Enron would spend years battling through the courts to get compensation for the billion project Of course everyone knows thats not going to happen After more brinksmanship from both sides in the coming days they will have to sit down and negotiate a settlement Some of the problems with Enron are unique to that particular arrangement but in its basic outline the saga epitomizes a flawed attempt to deal with Indias power problem narrowly defined a shortage of generating capacity The country suffers constant blackouts due to a supply shortage of about and even more during times of peak demand In the early s the central government sought to solve this shortfall by opening the doors to private investors like Enron But this proved to be a mistake because power distribution is controlled by the state governments they run it as a system of wealth redistribution rather than a business California recently made the earthshattering discovery that a lack of market pricing at the consumer level leads to disaster But Indias state electricity boards or SEBs proved that long ago they have long been bankrupt and often default on payments to private generators As a result most of the big names in power have now pulled out of India Yes the country does need to worry about generating capacity Its estimated that in the next years demand will more than double with an additional megawatts needed but only half of that is likely to be built That could increase the shortfall during peak demand to a frightening prospect But the first order of business is to reform distribution There is a debate now about how to give state governments the right incentives to reform their SEBs These owe almost billion to central governmentowned generators and mines from whom they buy much of their power and coal In the recently passed budget New Delhi included a provision to forgive this debt as long as the state governments commit to either privatizing their SEBs or putting a floor on electricity prices Electricity meters would actually be installed to measure power usage but subsidies would still be allowed many customers wouldnt pay enough to cover the true cost of that power Still this would be big progress by Indian standards if it happened Many farmers currently get their power for free and over of power generated is stolen something the SEBs euphemistically call transmission and distribution losses As a result the electricity boards average a return on investment of negative However New Delhi is offering quite a big carrot and not much stick After a March meeting between the prime minister and state leaders Rajnath Singh the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh said quite clearly that he wouldnt hike energy charges for farmers The reason is obvious he faces elections next year and free power has become an entitlement that no politician lightly takes away Chief ministers will likely sign on to New Delhis plan in order to get debt relief but will backslide on implementation The only thing that will make the states serious about reform is a hard budget constraint which is the opposite of what the government is offering One way to provide it would be to hand over the centrally owned power generators and mines to the states They would then have to figure out how to keep the system running If they still chose not to charge for electricity they would have to find the money for power generation from other parts of their budgets Another reform some have suggested is to pass a national law which legalizes private power producers Some states allow companies to have their own captive power plants to maintain supply when the public grid fails But these are typically not permitted to sell their power outside of the parent company If larger plants that could supply several industrial firms were legalized the states would come under greater pressure to reform The private power suppliers could cherrypick the best customers those willing to pay for reliable power leaving the state to subsidize the freeloaders This would also have the benefit of quickly boosting the countrys power supply since captive plants already have about megawatts of unused capacity New Delhi is still trying to reform the countrys power market by fiat This means years of political wrangling while a growing economy is strangled by a shortage of electricity Instead the wouldbe reformers could let the power of the invisible hand push the state governments in the right direction INDIA Foreign funds plough money into Indian shares By Anurag Sood Reuters English

percent the IMF estimates percent the Asian Development Bank percent and the Indian central bank percent Ajit Ranade economist at ABN AMRO Bank says Indias large domestic economy resilient to the global slowdown could pull more funds into the country But a blizzard of stock market scandals which revealed share price manipulation has unnerved some foreign investors Weak regulation is a part of an emerging market risk but that does not rule out caution said an India strategist at a foreign brokerage Analysts say foreign fund flows are unlikely to be influenced much by events such as the Enron controversy where the US energy giant is threatening to pull out of its billion power project in the western Indian state of Maharashtra Enron is Indias single biggest foreign direct investor They say factors that influence foreign portfolio investments are different from the considerations that drive longer term direct investments The Indian governments decision to hike foreign funds

the coalition or supportive of the Democratic Front Government today thrashed its effort to renegotiate the power purchase agreement PPA with the Enron sponsored Dabhol Power Company The least cost option was to initiate a judicial probe into the deal which was replete with fraud and seek the scrapping of the project they said This view was made public after the parties Peasants and Workers Party the CPIM the Janata Dal Secular the Samajwadi Party and others met here and decided to press the demand at a meeting of the coordination committee of all parties including the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party on May Its scheduled meeting for today was put off as the Chief Minister Mr Vilasrao Deshmukh was away electioneering in the South These parties worried about the huge unpayable DPC bills had been demanding a probe under the Inquiries Commissions Act but today upped the ante saying we are convinced of fraud in the agreement with DPC The renegotiation Mr N D Patil who leads the Left grouping and heads the allparty coordination panel said is not what we want we dont want it at all He and Mr Prabhakar Sanzgiri CPIM said we no longer suspect it We are convinced of malfeasance Along with Mr Pradhyumna Kaul of the AntiEnron Campaign they told a press conference that the moment fraud was proved the PPA could be annulled and the huge liquidation penalties can be avoided The demand was to scrap the mw phase II take over the mw Phase I and initiate a probe The Godbole Committee report has provided enough grounds though Phase I was a reality and Phase II only an eventuality Even a small criminal probe would put any arbitration decision sought by the DPC on hold The lobby pressing for scrapping the PPA said an FIR against the Maharashtra State Electricity Board under the provisions of Section of the Electricity Supply Act would suffice as there were enough grounds to prove that the entity or persons concerned had played games at one time or the other It cited bloated projections of energy demand in Maharashtra provided by the MSEB to DPC to justify the work on the Phase II which is now under stress following lenders reluctance to provide funds till the issue is sorted out When asked why Mr Deshmukh preferred renegotiation and trimming of power tariff to a probe Mr Patil said that is his view For their part the parties would press for change

Sons Ltd KSL Source World Reporter TM Asia Intelligence Wire THIRUVANANTHAPURAM MAY The Maharashtra Chief Minister Mr Vilasrao Deshmukh today advised the State to handle the Enron issue cautiously and refrain from committing the mistakes made by his State Addressing a press conference here today Mr Deshmukh said the Maharashtra Government was treading carefully on the Enron issue and it hoped to renegotiate the power tariff with the US company Mr Deshmukhs observations assume significance in the context of the running controversy regarding the Kannur Power Project which had been denied permission by the LDF Government Mr Deshmukh said that Enron had written to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board that it was ready to renegotiate the power tariff provided the Government of India made a formal request He said the renegotiation would start as soon as the Union Government handed over the formal letter asking for a renegotiation Mr Deshmukh pointed out that the basic issue in Enrons Dabhol project was related to the power tariff The foreign exchange rate was fixed at Rs a dollar at the start of the project But now it had gone up to Rs a dollar thereby pushing the cost of power up He indicated that the renegotiations would focus on this aspect as well The Maharashtra Government had proposed renegotiation on the basis of the Godbole Commission recommendation He was confident that the Enron would agree to renegotiate the tariff in the interests of the Maharashtra Government and its own interests In reply to a question Mr Deshmukh said the Enron project had been a major drain on his States finances but it had overcome all problems by handling them very carefully He said the Maharashtra Government would extend all support to the UDF if it were to come to power to process the various parameters relating to the Kannur project so that it did not commit the same kind of mistake as Maharashtra did He however made it clear that his Government welcomed foreign direct investments but not at the cost of the States interests Mr Deshmukh attacked the Centre for not using the various options available under the WTO agreement to come out with a balanced importexport policy Asked for his comments on Mr Sharad Pawars statement that the NCP was considering joining the Peoples Front Mr Deshmukh made it very clear that his partys alliance with the NCP was confined to Maharashtra alone The alliance with the NCP is a post election affair as part of the attempts to unite all secular forces The Congress had fought the NCP and several other parties which are now part of the Congressled Government But the alliance had been formed in order to keep the BJPShiv Sena combine out he said Asked how his party could accept the NCP which had an alliance going with the BJP in Meghalaya Mr Deshmukh said the Congress NCP ties were confined to Maharashtra If the NCP creates any problems in Maharashtra the alliance would end he said Mr Deshmukh attacked the CPIMled LDF for its five year misrule which had left the State virtually bankrupt The credibility of the LDF is so low that the people would not vote for it The CPIMled Left parties would be defeated

NEW DELHI May THE Shipping Corporation of India Mitsui OSK Lines Atlantic Commercial Inc an Enron affiliate are holding parleys at Houston US the headquarters of Enron Incto decide the future course of action on its LNG shipping deal for the Dabhol Power Company DPC The controversy surrounding the Enronpromoted DPC and the apprehension raised by the lenders to the LNG shipping project has made the three shipping promoters of Greenfield Shipping Company take stock of the situation A final view on the LNG shipping deal will depend on what Enron decides on the power project per se and not just the second phase of the project which is being planned as a LNG driven plant Even the first phase is expected to switchover to LNG in a couple of years sources tracking the sequence of events told Business Line The promoters have already paid per cent of the vessel building cost to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Japan where the cubic metre capacity vessel is being constructed at a total cost of million According to the delivery schedule the LNG vessel named Laxmi is expected to be completed and delivered by October end this year A consortium of global banks led by ANZ Investment Bank has taken a high exposure on the LNG shipping project The Greenfield Shipping Company had struck a year loan with the lenders worth million at basis points over libor SCI has a per cent equity stake in the project while Mitsui OSKLines hold per cent and Atlantic Commercial Inc per cent The LNG shipping deal for Dabhol was the first LNG shipping contract in the country involving an Indian shipping line Greenfield Shipping Company had entered into a time charter agreement with DPC to transport LNG from West Asia to its power plant in Maharashtra at a timecharter hire rate of per day for years Unlike in the case of other ships LNG ships do not have a secondary market since these are acquired against specific longterm contracts In case of any eventuality Greenfield Shipping Company would find it difficult to divert the vessel elsewhere as globally spot trade in LNG is almost nil Fortunately for the Greenfield Shipping Company the prices for new LNG buildings have started firming up after travelling through a downward trend till recently Mitsui OSKLinesNYKK LineKKK LineSCI consortium which recently bagged the shipping contract from Petronet LNG Ltd also has placed an order with

Government with enough expertise to advise on similar projects elsewhere in the country This was one of the upshots at the news conference by the Maharashtra Chief Minister Mr Vilasrao Deshmukh who is on an election campaign on behalf of the United Democratic Front UDF here on Wednesday In the course of his interaction with the newspersons he said his Government would extend all support to UDF if

would welcome foreign direct investments but not at the cost of the States interests Mr Deshmukh said the Maharashtra Government was hopeful of renegotiating the issue of tariff for the power from Dhabol project with Enron He said Enron had written to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB that it was ready to renegotiate power tariff provided the Union Government made a formal request The renegotiation would begin as soon as the Union Government handed over the formal letter in this regard he added The Chief Minister said the basic issue was related to the power tariff The foreign exchange component was fixed at Rs per dollar at the start of the project which had now gone up to Rs per dollar thereby pushing up the cost of power He indicated that the renegotiations would focus on this aspect as well He explained that the Maharashtra Government had proposed renegotiation on the basis of Godbole Commission recommendation He was confident that Enron would agree to renegotiate the tariff in its own interest as well as that of the State Government Our Bureau Let Enron Exit ADITYA CHATTERJEE POOJA KOTHARI The Times of India Copyright C The Times of India Source World Reporter TM FOR years Enron tried to woo Indian policymakers who couldnt seem to decide whether the Dabhol project was a good idea or not Today the boot is on the other foot and it seems to be pinching Enrons management is keen to stop investing in huge capitalintensive plants around the world In keeping with this strategy and no doubt exhausted by its ceaseless crisis management in India Enron is mulling a pullout But both the Centre and Maharashtra government want to renegotiate the power purchase agreement and have entrusted this responsibility to the Madhav Godbole panel Is Enron really as indispensable as the authorities seem to think it is Financially no Indeed if the only way to continue the project is on the present terms then it makes better sense to simply scrap it After all its better to amputate a gangrenous limb than to let the problem spread further A little arithmetic will make this amply clear If the Dabhol Power Company DPC does scrap its agreement with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board the Centre will have to cough up a sum of Rs crore a penalty amount of Rs crore for one years electricity bill and million as termination fees which works out to Rs crore at an assumed exchange rate of rupees to one dollar This is a onetime payment and the figure of Rs crore is corroborated by a recent statement by Union power secretary A K Basu Now if India were to continue with the present arrangement it would end up paying at least Rs crore per year for the next years to DPC On the other hand what would happen if the project were scrapped Well very simplistically India would save Rs crore Rs crore multiplied by years But things arent quite that simple because that money could earn interest while inflation would mean that Rs crore after years would not have the same value it would have today To get around this problem financial experts use a concept called net present value which discounts future earning streams as well as inflation to evaluate the attractiveness of a project If we use a discount rate of per cent then the value of the amount India would save by scrapping the Dabhol project works out to Rs crore over three times the amount India would have to pay today if the agreement with DPC is terminated Indian financial institutions FIs and banks which have lent money to DPC are actively lobbying to prevent such an eventuality But how badly would they be hit Well FIs led by Industrial Development Bank of India have provided loans of million and million in two phases This brings their total exposure to million Rs crore at an exchange rate of Besides State Bank of India also underwrote the maximum portion of a million crossborder loan and has an exposure of about million Rs crore Thus the cumulative exposure of Indian banks and FIs in DPC works out to around Rs crore However since only per cent of this amount has been disbursed so far the net exposure of Indian lenders amounts to Rs crore Since the Indian lenders are not covered by any counterguarantee their bottomline would be hit if Enron backs out The government being a majority stakeholder in most of these institutions would also be affected But even if all these loans are taken into account and added to the onetime payment of Rs crore the total cost to the government would be Rs crore still lower than Rs crore Thus the termination option will prove less costly for the nation than proceeding on the present terms What will happen to the assets and the plant did we hear you ask Well the government can sell it to private players and renegotiate the cost factor with them this time hopefully after doing a costbenefit analysis A sale of assets would also lessen the load on the government Who knows the government may actually manage to sell the ownership of DPC at a premium to another private sector player Of course fears have been raised that cancelling the project might cost us foreign direct investment since Enron is the biggest investor in India so far After all Brazil raised billion and China billion last year in comparison with Indias measly billion But theres another way of looking at the problem what does India really have to lose In short its a case of losing what you dont even have in the first place Many developing nations which were pushed into signing expensive power projects by multinationals have successfully renegotiated their contracts with no serious financial consequences Many nations simply did not have the money to pay for the inflated bills some refused to pay even after losing international arbitration awards while others like Costa Rica declared that the contracts signed with independent power producers like Enron have no legal status or are bad in law In July the Hungarian parliament declared that a PPA signed with multinational RWE was unconstitutional and void In August the Croatian government tore up a PPA signed between Enron and a previous government The contract was considered to be unaffordable and was allegedly signed in suspicious circumstances Enron subsequently abandoned the original agreement In September the Philippines took a decision to not renew financially crippling contracts with IPPs Controversy has accompanied the Dabhol project from the start In August the finance ministry had written to the power ministry that the size of the potential liability for a megawatt plant was around Rs crore per year The department of economic affairs had also warned that the risk of counterguarantees being invoked was not unreal given that state electricity bills had been defaulting in payments Caution was thrown to the winds then The least India can do now is ask for a renegotiation But does the Indian government have the courage to go eyeballtoeyeball with Enron and not blink first Scrapping the power purchase agreement involves a onetime payment of Rs crore However India would save over Rs crore by doing so There would be a net saving even after writing off FI loans to Dabhol Power Company IDBI whose life is it anyway Tamal Bandyopadhyay Business Standard Copyright c Business Standard On April a terse oneline announcement by the finance ministry gave the acting chairman and managing director of Industrial Development Bank of India IDBI S K Chakrabarti a threemonth extension The government was generous enough not to keep the CMD as well as the institution waiting till late evening which it normally does for the fax message from North Block But the acting IDBI chief may be asked to step down even in three weeks if the government is able to identify his successor He has been reappointed for a period of three months or till a regular CMD takes charge whichever is earlier Could there have been a better way to insult the countrys largest financial institution and its chief First the government planned to merge the Industrial Finance Corporation of India IFCI which is on the brink of collapse under the burden of ballooning nonperforming assets with IDBI to make them sink together Unable to push through the proposal in the face of stiff resistance put up by IDBI the government now appears to be keen on leading the countrys premier financial institution to its grave alone This not by giving an extension to the existing acting chief but by failing to identify his successor and thereby continuing the uncertainty at the top Nothing can move in an organisation when the CEO himself does not know how long he will survive Indias financial institutions have been repositioning themselves by going shortterm both on the assets as well as the liabilities sides But for that transformation to take effect they need leaders with a longterm tenure at the helm To understand this lets look at whats happening at ICICI another financial institution in the country that is breathing down on IDBIs neck and threatening to overtake it K V Kamath CEO and managing director of ICICI got a second fiveyear term seven days ahead of the expiry of his first term on March Once his second term is complete Kamath will have ended up running the show at ICICI for a decade ICICI does not only give its chief a long term to steer the ship but also grooms talent to take over the institution in due course Kamath was groomed by his predecessor N Vaghul In turn he is now grooming Nachiket Mor to succeed him Mor a former senior general manager of ICICI has recently been shifted to ICICI Bank as an executive director in charge of wholesale banking He is likely to be made the managing director of the bank when the present incumbent H N Sinor steps down next year Eventually he will take over the mantle from Kamath in by which time his stint at the bank will have given him enough operational experience in addition to his treasury management and other skills Given the circumstances IDBI is fighting a losing battle It will not be surprising if it goes the IFCI way with an uncertain leadership unable to steer a demoralised overstaffed ship becalmed by the apathetic bureaucracy of the North Block This is despite its tremendous brand value in project financing and widespread corporate relationships Carved out of the Reserve Bank of India by an Act of Parliament in IDBI has business relations with virtually every corporate house in India But that is not helping it tide over the crisis because the key to any financial intermediarys success at this juncture is how it handles its resources both currency as well as human In an ideal situation the cost of funds should be lower while the cost of human resources should be marketdriven In IDBIs case it is the reverse its cost of funds is on the higher side in the absence of aggressive treasury operations and it is not allowed to pay marketdriven salary to its employees The net result There has been an exodus of talent from IDBI and the institution is struggling to stay afloat just when recession has prompted corporations to cut back on their borrowings IDBIs sanctions and disbursements have been falling and nonperforming assets increasing It is sitting on piles of cash but finding deployment avenues hard to come by Two former chiefs of IDBI S H Khan and G P Gupta spent a large chunk of their tenure and energy pleading with the finance ministry to delink IDBIs salary structure from that of the Reserve Bank of India but without success Small wonder that Chakrabarti who became acting chairman on February for a threemonth term has singled out the low morale of the staff as his prime concern He wants to address this on a war footing The Centre has now successfully demoralised him by offering him another uncertain term Former finance minister Manmohan Singh accepted Khans argument on marketdriven package he reportedly wanted a pay scale for his employees that was higher ICICIs but could not do anything about it P Chidambaram repeated Singhs failure on this front and Yashwant Sinha too thinks the proposal is not worth considering because it will have a ripple effect in the industry For instance RBI employees will immediately demand their pound of flesh The finance ministry refuses to see the point that the countrys central bank is not a commercial organisation and does not have to compete with ICICI When three successive finance ministers failed to address IDBIs problems the institution went for soft options It ended up appointing three consultants for restructuring in six years First Booz Allen Hamilton in followed by M B Athreya in and finally Boston Consulting Group The third consultant BCG is yet to submit its report While Booz Allen Hamilton charted out the roadmap for diversification and suggested that the institution spread its wings overseas and tap new business opportunities the Athreya panel said it must convert itself into a bank and the governments stake should come down without delay Over the last few years the institution has been planning its conversion into a bank and blaming the economy for its indifferent performance even as ICICI has been going full steam with new initiatives ICICI Bank is also exploiting synergies with its parent to the hilt while IDBI Bank seems to be embarrassed about ackowledging its pedigree Its not that everything is great at ICICI Over the past few years the institution has lost some senior executives ISec managing director Kishore Chaukar left to join the Tata group ICICI senior general managers Anando Mukherji joined Enron and N J Subaiah took charge at Centurion Bank which he subsequently left The industry suspects the quality of ICICIs assets and is not comfortable with the scorching pace of growth Even the wellpaid ICICI executive cadres find the pace of work is too much to handle and complain of fatigue In private they hate the mad rush for excellence And yet there is a method in ICICIs madness It has trimmed the flab with two successive voluntary retirement schemes branched out into consumer loans in a big way and transformed treasury operations into an art The finance ministry would do well to explore the possibility of divesting the governments stake in IDBI to ICICI Instead of pumping in Rs crore as recapitalisation funds into IFCI it can simply let it die and sell its assets to other banks and financial institutions IDBIs bulk and the brand name in project financing would combine well with ICICIs growing retail presence and unbridled aggression The combination would be formidable enough to give the State Bank of India a run for its money Of course a whole lot of issues need to settled before the process takes off like trimming the flab in IDBI and delinking it from the RBI pay structure et al IDBI merging with ICICI may sound like an absurd dream but it is certainly a better option than merging IFCI with IDBI If Reliance is willing to bid for staterun oil majors HPCL and

sector analyst There were stories out there they were going to be worse than they have been saying and it wasnt The breakdown at Hunter part of the UK groups PacifiCorp acquisition was unusually costly because power had to be bought in to replace the megawatts MW of lost capacity while power prices in the region were very high Even with Hunter back up PacifiCorp has more customer demand than plant to supply it so high wholesale prices will continue to be a problem The new structure unveiled on Thursday consists of a US division including PacifiCorps regulated and unregulated businesses a

May By Andrew Taylor in London Cynics claim that Scottish Powers legal action launched this week to rewrite a long term electricity supply contract was more about distracting attention from the groups poor results than a realistic bid to cut costs This judgment is a little harsh Scottish Power would benefit considerably if it could renegotiate the deal that requires it to buy threequarters of Scotlands nuclear output The British Energy contract is worth obn bn in the next four years Shareholders could do with some distraction Scottish Power by its own admission has had a tough year which will be confirmed today when it publishes results for Ian Russell who took over as chief executive in March may even indulge in the new boys practice of including the cost of further forseeable bad news in the figures making any subsequent improvement appear greater His biggest problem will be to convince the City that he is capable of developing an effective strategy to change the groups direction now it has abandoned plans to become a multiutility The group no longer believes adequate returns can be earned from developing a growing range of products to sell to its more than m customers The investment required to develop national brands win new customers and retain old ones is too high in an increasingly competitive UK retail sector it says Mr Russell who as Scottish Powers former finance director was closely associated with the previous policy has already withdrawn from joint ventures with Royal Bank of Scotland to provide financial services and with Thus to provide telecommunications The group is also discussing the future of Southern Water its south of England utility which Enel the Italian statecontrolled energy group is interested in buying Crossselling electricity and gas to Southern Water customers let alone other products has been disappointing it admits The group plans to concentrate on developing its energy interests in the UK and US But these also have their difficulties Some of the biggest problems involve PacifiCorp bought months ago in a deal worth about obn including debt The price is looking more expensive following big rises in US electricity wholesale prices PacifiCorp has not been as badly affected as some US electricity groups But it has faced problems because of a power station breakdown in Utah that forced it to buy higher priced electricity from other generators to meet customer demand The failure of a MW generating unit at its Hunter power plant in November has cost the group m om a day since One piece of good news for shareholders today will be the timing of its return to service this month Another positive note is that PacifiCorp is negotiating higher retail prices with US state regulators to offset increased generation charges It also has about MW of its own new power plant due to start production this year In the UK the group is facing increased competition for retail electricity and gas sales

I refer of course to Californias energy market or as the power generators call it Who Wants to be a MultiBillionaire Its becoming clear that this game is fixed Regis is giving all of the questions What color is the sky to contestants like Enron and Reliant PGE and Southern California Edison Meanwhile we consumers are hit with How many kwh did the BPA generate in the month of May Sorry youre out of lifelines How are consumers supposed to compete in this game Even our legislators who belong to the same party as Gov Gray The Negotiator Davis dont know whats going on Its like trying to play poker while everybody else is holding the cards said Assemblywoman Pat Wiggins But while we may not be holding the cards well for sure be left holding the bag when this thing plays out So who do we blame State Sen Wes Chesbro has an idea In the long term the gougers need to be held accountable he said in a Monday article Ah yes The gougers Those outrageous outofstate dirty dealing pricefixing electricityrate gougers who have driven PGE right into bankruptcy and threaten to do the same to Southern California Edison Lets get em But hold on a minute It turns out that some of those gougers that caused PGE and Edison all that trouble are just PGE and Edison wearing different hats Both utilities produce power and sell it on the same market as the gougers Then they buy it back Also out there with the Enrons and Reliant Energies of the world the other power generators that sell electricity to the utilities is a company called National Energy Group It has power plants in states and controls a natural gas pipeline to Northern California And its owned by PGE Corp the parent company of PGE Co Try to keep up with me here PGE Co is the company that has been so devastated by Californias energy deregulation debacle Its the company to which you are writing monthly checks that are beginning to resemble your mortgage payment It is the company that for decades was guaranteed a profit by the rates set by the states Public Utilities Commission It is the company that said it lost billions before it declared bankruptcy last month Poor PGE Co PGE Corp on the other hand is squatting in tall cotton as my daddy used to say The Corp received more than billion from the Co from according to a PUC audit But the Corp says it wouldnt be fair if it had to put any of that money back into the Co its ailing subsidiary It wants the people whose utility bills created that profit to pay higher bills now to bail out the Co so the Corp can avoid bankruptcy of its own Who is being unfair Meanwhile Southern California Edison also has been shipping its profits also more than billion at last report to its parent company while looking to the state for a bailout Now Gov Gray The Generator Davis wants the taxpayers of this state to pay billion to Southern California Edison for that utilitys transmission system But as far as I can tell Edisons rate payers already paid to build maintain and operate that system with rates set by the PUC that guaranteed that company a profit Now were being asked to buy what those ratepayers built I know that PGEs and Edisons accountants and public relations people would argue that Im all wrong here And to tell the truth when I try to follow the money through a maze of stranded costs and contract power and uncollected power purchase costs and rate reduction bond credits and the like my eyes start to blur But theres nothing wrong with my sense of smell so I can tell you for sure this whole thing stinks What can we do Turn off the lights and scream Call Coursey at or email LNG carriage to be preserve of Indiaflag ships Lloyds List International Copyright C LLoyds List Source World Reporter TM In an attempt to cash in on the liquefied natural gas revolution Indias shipping ministry is pushing through a proposal to restrict the transportation of the gas only to companies registered in India and vessels carrying the Indian flag It would seem that the logic primarily is to ensure that Indian shipping does not get left behind in the LNG transportation race Until now the ministry has managed to get LNG ferried by energy companies on fob basis We hope that this new proposal would give further impetus to Indian bottoms says shipping secretary Michael Pinto We will do all we can to get approval from the committee of secretaries and the Cabinet Since some of the shipping contracts have already been finalised this proposal would only be made applicable to future contracts However shipping experts are extremely doubtful whether the proposal can be implemented The leading Indian shipping companies have neither the funds nor the expertise of carrying LNG and would need the assistance of foreign companies to make the ventures a success A foreign LNG carrier is not going to settle for a minority stake unless the Indian shipper is able to put up his share of the equity which would be quite a handful says Sudhir J Mulji executive vicechairman of Great Eastern Shipping Company and current president of the Indian National Shipowners Association The proposal really does not seem to be feasible For the moment just two major contracts have been signed both involving the stateowned Shipping Corporation of India SCI The first one involves SCI American power major Enron and Mitsui of Japan for the carriage of m tonnes of LNG per annum for Enrons MW mega power project at Dabhol near Ratnagiri in southern Maharashtra SCI had entered into this memorandum of understanding with MOL formerly Mitsui OSK Lines and Atlantic Commercial Finance which is an Enron affiliate However it is only a partner in the consortium with Enron holding a stake and Mitsui OSK the balance The gas will be ferried by the LNG Lakshmi brandnew cu m capacity vessel being constructed in Japan at the Mitsui Shipyard The contract is valid for years from the date of starting However the consortium is registered in the Cayman Islands which is a tax haven and the LNG vessel will carry the flag of Malta SCI has also secured the contract for carrying m tonnes per annum of LNG for the governmentowned pipeline company Petronet LNG The gas is to be ferried from RasGas of Qatar to the companys upcoming LNG terminal at Dahej in Gujarat A similar Petronet terminal but half the size of Dahej is coming up in Kochi Kerala state The transportation contract for this is to be decided later Two other major Indian shipowners who have taken a step towards LNG transportation are Great Eastern Shipping and Essar Shipping The former has formed a consortium with Indian Oil Corporation and Exmar while Essar has joined hands with Malaysia International Shipping Corporation MISC to form a joint venture dedicated to gas transportation The Dollars bn MISC the national shipping line of Malaysia is one of the worlds leading owners and operators of LNG tankers As a listed company on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange MISC has the stateowned petroleum and oil giant Petronas a Fortune company as its largest shareholder with a stake of Our memorandum of understanding has both companies holding an equal equity share in the joint venture said Essar Shippings chief executive Sanjay Mehta However at a later date we may both dilute our stakes equally in favour of a third strategic partner and continue to hold equal equity The final debtequity ratio for the acquisition of the LNG vessels will be decided by the management of the joint venture Shipping secretary Mr Pinto feels that there are many opportunities for Indian companies but is insistent that the tonnage be registered in India so that ancillary business activities in the sector are spurred We will try and secure tax benefits for the shipowners concerned since they badly need to gain the experience management and manpower training in a niche segment he said It would also help in Indian fleet expansion since tonnage has remained virtually stagnant for the last five yearsMichael

PacifiCorp also serves customers in Washington Idaho Utah Wyoming and California for total of million residential and business customers PGE serves customers primarily in the populous northern Willamette Valley Speculation about the potential hookup with PGE surfaced during the weekend in Britains Observer newspaper In the article an unidentified source described the merger as an obvious

no comment on the rumors said Mark Palmer Houstonbased Enron spokesman We dont comment on market speculation said Rachel Sherrard a spokeswoman for PacifiCorp The speculation whether of substance or whimsy has drawn the attention of state regulators and consumer advocacy groups I think it would get a great deal of scrutiny and I think there would be some serious concerns said Ron Eachus head of

Lloyds List International Copyright C LLoyds List Source World Reporter TM With the Shipping Corporation of India taking a major stake in the Petronet LNG Indias maritime industries a high profile SHIRISH NADKARNI ON the final Thursday of March there was a celebration in NeDelhi involving the four members of the consortium that had bagged the Dollars m liquefied natural gas transportation contract of Petronet LNG It is the Japanese custom to celebrate an event like this and only the consortium members and their officials were invited to the function says KM Joseph director bulk carriers and tankers with the Shipping Corporation of India SCI which has a equity stake in the winning partnership The other members of the consortium are Japans MOL formerly Mitsui OSK Lines NYK Line and K Line and the contract involves ferrying m tonnes per annum of LNG from the Middle East to Petronet LNGs terminal at Dahej in Gujarat Two LNG carriers will be involved in the deal each capable of carrying cu m of gas and expected to cost Dollars m each The vessels are to be constructed at Daewoo Shipbuilding Yard in South Korea This was Indias second major LNG transportation deal and SCI the public sector shipping monolith which owns roughly half of the countrys oceangoing fleet of vessels has a stake in both of them as does MOL MOL is a professionally managed company whose cultural ethos is similar to ours says the goateebearded Prabhat Kumar Srivastava SCIs chairman and managing director Our relationship is based on total transparency and trust and we therefore feel comfortable with them There may well be more such tieups in the future The earlier deal was also sealed with MOL which has a stake in a joint venture named Greenfield Shipping Company GSC with US energy major Enron holding the remaining equity The three members will have joint ownership of the cu m LNG carrier LNG Lakshmi now under construction at the Mitsui Heavy Industries shipyard in Japan When ready the vessel will ferry m tpa of LNG from RasGas of Qatar to Enrons megapower facility at Dabhol near Ratnagiri in southern Maharashtra However to return to the Petronet deal The MOLSCI consortium won the coveted contract by quoting a charter hire rate of Dollars per day which was substantially lower than the bids of the two other competing consortia MISCEssar and ExmarGreat Eastern ShippingIndian Oil Corporation The Petronet LNG deal was the most prestigious and important LNG shipping project in the country and we were very keen to secure it says Mr Srivastava So we told our Japanese partners to quote the best possible rates A stake in the consortium formed with Enron may only be sufficient to net SCI a boardroom presence in GSC but its stake in the Petronet LNG shipping venture will allow the shipping major to exercise much more power on the latter companys board There are other issues involved If we had not emerged winners in Petronets shipping deal it would have done us a lot of harm for the other LNG shipping projects that are fast coming up in the country says Mr Srivastava We have already made tremendous headway in LNG shipping by being part of the Dabhol project and we were very keen to maintain the momentum Experts rate SCI as one of the best managed public sector enterprises and the bottom line of the company reinforces this feeling For the first nine months of the financial year SCI had a sales turnover of Rsbn Dollars m which was better than the Rsbn recorded for the corresponding nine months of the previous year The net profit zoomed from Rsm during the period April to December to Rsbn for the same nine months of While the results for the financial year ended March are still being compiled SCI officials place the sales turnover at around Rsbn and the net profit at just above the Rsbn mark While the companys tankers have produced spectacular results even the lossmaking liner division is expected to turn round the corner We have removed nearly of the nonperforming assets in the division and the balance will be chopped off in the fiscal year says Sudhir S Rangnekar director liner shipping division Recently international consultants Pricewaterhouse Coopers PwC carried out a SWOT analysis for SCI They suggested a corporate transformation of the company apart from going ahead with the information technology initiatives taken earlier The company went ahead and signed a memorandum of understanding with the ministry of shipping for the financial year whereby two new criteria will be used for judging the organisations performance A new criterion corporate transformation project implementation has been introduced in the MoU reflecting the emphasis that we are placing on enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of

FERCS LATEST REFUND ORDERS Foster Electric Report c Copyright Foster Associates Inc About the same time that PGE Corp and Edison International announced combined writeoffs of nearly billion in unrecovered purchased power costs four major California energy suppliers reported increases ranging from percent to percent in firstquarter revenues Meanwhile FERC has issued new refund orders requiring many of these same generators to justify in overcharges during March PGE and Southern California Edison Cos WriteOffs After a long delay PGE and Edison during the middle of April confirmed what many knew was coming huge writeoffs for unrecovered purchased power costs during the year Edison announced that it was writing off billion in undercollected power costs for the year leaving the company with a billion loss for the year Edison chief John Bryson was hopeful nevertheless that a recent memorandum of understanding MOU his company signed with the state will allow Edison to recover some of those costs and help keep its Southern California Edison Co SoCal Edison affiliate out of bankruptcy Prompt implementation of the MOU can avoid the large costs of a SoCal Edison bankruptcy and make it possible for the company to restore its financial health and ability to maintain a reliable power grid said Bryson in a statement accompanying Edisons financial results Whether Brysons hope for quick implementation of the MOU will be realized is questionable Gov Gray Davis has been having a hard time finding the necessary legislative support for the proposal and to date has been unable even to find a legislator to sponsor a bill to implement the MOU Instead several state legislators are exploring alternatives including having the state buy SoCal Edisons transmission assets as well as the whole utility and turn it into a state power agency Edisons northern California neighbor PGE Corp reported a strong growth in revenues for led by the strong performance of its energy trading unit but that revenue growth was completely offset by the billion in losses incurred by its now bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric Co utility subsidiary While standard accounting rules required the utility to record a charge against earnings for unreimbursed wholesale and transition costs taking this charge does not diminish our conviction that the utility is entitled under law to recover these costs nor does it diminish our ongoing lawsuit in federal district court said PGE Corp chief Robert Glynn Generators FirstQuarter Revenue Reports In sharp contrast with PGEs and Edisons financial performance the parent companies of four of Californias largest generators reported large jumps in firstquarter revenues Enron Corp reported revenues of billion a whopping percent increase from a year earlier The company owns only a small amount of wind generation in California but sells power into the state through its Portland General Electric subsidiary and is an energy trader in the state Enrons commodity sales and service unit showed a percent increase in firstquarter earnings Reliant Energy Inc saw firstquarter earnings jump percent to billion The companys wholesale energy business unit produced million in operating income for the first quarter up sharply from the million loss the company reported a year earlier Reporting a slightly lower but still a substantial percent jump in firstquarter revenues was Dynegy Inc Of the companys billion in revenues for the period its marketing and trading subsidiary realized million in earnings nearly double the in earnings reported a year earlier The parent company reported a percent jump in first quarter earnings over the previous year Duke Energy Corp announced a percent boost in firstquarter revenues to billion led by a percent increase in earnings by wholesale energy unit FERCs Refund Order Similar to separate orders regarding January and February power sales in California FERC on issued a notice demanding that three generators justify in combined power sales during March FERC staff set a MWh proxy clearing price for the month and then applied it to the hours of Stage power alerts that were declared during March in California The staffs proxy prices for January and February were MWh and MWh respectively The clearing prices fluctuations can be attributed to changes in operating costs including fuel and

boycott help lower Californias electricity bill By MICHAEL LIEDTKE AP Business Writer Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved SAN FRANCISCO AP Theres a limit to how much people will pay for most things in life If the cost scares off enough buyers prices eventually fall So what would happen if this textbook example from Economics were applied to Californias electricity crisis What if the state officials struggling to maintain energy supplies simply refused to buy power above a certain price and accepted more blackouts this summer The question would have been absurd just a few months ago and even now the notion seems surreal given the possible consequences Inviting even more blackouts inevitably would hurt businesses and frustrate consumers threatening to further depress Californias already slumping economy the sixth largest in the world But desperate times require drastic measures according to the economists lawmakers and activists who believe the state will be better off sitting in the dark than buying electricity at any price during a summer shortage likely to produce recurring blackouts anyway Its better to use blackouts and break the wholesale energy cartel than simply to suffer them said Michael Shames executive director of the Utility Consumer Action Network a San Diego watchdog group Refusing to buy enough power to keep the lights on would be like playing with fire counters Wells Fargo Co chief economist Sung Won Sohn Blackouts arent a just matter of inconvenience or being too hot or cold They cost businesses a lot of money Buying electricity at the last minute to meet the states power needs already has cost the California government billion in the past months The state energy bill for could reach billion in money otherwise spent on education public safety and health care Shames said Faced with the prospect of a significant budget deficit some lawmakers think its time for California to take a stand against the power wholesalers many of whom are based outside the state This Tuesday the state Senate Energy Committee will consider authorizing the state to refuse to buy power above certain prices Current law requires state electricity managers to avoid blackouts by buying all available power at any cost We have been over a barrel in so many ways said Sen Dede Alpert DCoronado who sponsored SBx Maybe theres a point in the market where we just say no and go with the planned blackout strategy instead Economists give the bill little chance of succeeding Its never going to happen Its not a viable option said University of California at Berkeley Professor Severin Borenstein one of the energy experts who have studied the idea The business lost during blackouts would mean more layoffs in a state already skittish over the technology downturn and the looming Hollywood writers strike economists say Other ripple effects include diminished gasoline supplies leading to even higher prices at the pump and distribution headaches that could leave store shelves bare And some consumers the elderly and the infirm for example need power at any price Without electricity Manteca resident Betty Jarzemkoski said she wouldnt be able to help her ailing husband to get out of his motorized bed at home It would be a real hardship for us said Jarzemkoski Im on a fixed income so I hope they can figure out something to bring down prices But we need power Despite such concerns the concept of a buyers boycott hasnt been flatly ruled out at least publicly by Gov Gray Davis as he struggles to reduce the states staggering electricity bill The state is spending as much as million per day to meet Californias electricity needs and the bleeding is sure to get worse When the summer heat increases demand and tightens supplies California might spend more than billion each week state officials estimate Extended blackouts pose an even greater cost economists say When Northern California suffered rolling blackouts for several hours Jan the economic losses totaled billion mostly from lost profits and wages estimated the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp Multiply that over several weeks across the entire state and it becomes apparent why it makes more sense for California to continue buying power at inflated prices even if leaves the state with deep debts and a ruined credit rating economists argue As it is California probably wont be able to round up enough power at any price on some days this summer making some blackouts a virtual certainty The blackouts will reduce the states economic output by billion to billion according to a study released last month by the Bay Area Economic Forum The resolve of the states politicians and ratepayers would be sorely tested for a boycott to succeed much in the way that labor strikes boil down to whether workers or management can withstand more financial pain Politicians arent going to willingly turn out the lights because politicians want to get reelected said Borenstein director of the University of Californias energy institute As soon as people start losing their jobs because the power is off the public will get tired of the blackouts real quick Still Californians might tolerate an increase in blackouts if they understand why the state chose to pursue such a drastic course said Stanford economics Professor Frank Wolak who heads the Independent System Operators market surveillance committee This isnt something you could do without an enormous public relations campaign he said The campaign would have to explain that the state had no other choice but to do this because federal power regulators arent doing their job and enforcing the law against unjust and unreasonable prices The largest outofstate generators are in such robust financial shape that it might take weeks before they would feel such pain from a California boycott that they would be forced to lower prices After making record profits

Limited BOMBAY May Reuters Indian lenders to US energy group Enron Corps gasfired power plant south of Bombay have appealed to the Indian government to help end the companys row with a stateowned electricity board over pricing and upaid bills The board of Enrons Indian unit Dabhol Power Co DPC has authorised management to stop selling power to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB if a bitter dispute over pricing and unpaid bills cannot be resolved In the past half year the MSEB has defaulted on bills for electricity supplied by Dabhol which operates the worlds largest gasfired plant on the west coast of India kilometres miles south of Bombay Indian financial institutions which contributed billion towards the project in loans are pressing the government to help end the crisis a source told Reuters We have asked the government for help We are awaiting their reply the source who is employed with a large financial institution said The domestic lenders to the project are Industrial Development Bank of India ICICI Ltd Industrial Finance Corporation of India Canara Bank and State Bank of India The Dabhol Power Company DPC owned percent by Enron last month took the major step of bailing out of the billion power project citing nonpayment of bills by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB The DPC boards move sparked widespread fears that Indias image as a safe destination for foreign direct investment would be damaged POWER STRUGGLE MSEB which is a stateowned utility has been a regular defaulter on payments to DPC saying that it finds the power too costly It has also backed out on its commitment to buy more power to be produced by the projects second phase which is to begin operations later this year Last month MSEB said it had paid Dabhol Power billion rupees million for electricity it bought in March But the payment only partially resolves the total overdue amount of billion rupees million which Enron has been unable to collect even after invoking guarantees issued by the government of Maharashtra Indias most industrialised state and the federal government The state utility still owes Enron payments for power purchases in December and January The Indian government has maintained that the contract must be renegotiated and has set up a committee to do so We are concerned and would like the renegotiations to happen fast the source added The dispute has raised fears that Enron could pull the plug on the project cease providing power to the local state electricity board and perhaps even sell the plant The plant is good

EDT UK INTERVIEWInnogy starts trading power in mainland Europe By Stuart Penson Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited LONDON May Reuters British utility Innogy said on Thursday it had started trading wholesale electricity on the FrenchItalian border and was set to enter the German power market We have done some wholesale trading on the ItalyFrance border moving power from France to Italy and we are very close to doing some in Germany said director of trading Tony West in an interview with Reuters This year we will significantly increase our trading in mainland Europe we are discussing relationships with counterparties at the moment he added Innogy is building a European power trading team at its headquarters in Swindon southern England from where it already trades the UK gas and power markets FRANCE COULD BE KEY MARKET West said the company initially had expected the main focus of its European trading strategy to be Germany and the north west of the continent But the early signs were that France would also play a key role particularly as Innogy had gained access to capacity in the UKFrance undersea interconnector cable France has taken me by surprise It might be more important than we anticipated although there are clearly still issues about the speed of liberalisation said West A core of about eight companies regularly trade power in France including TXU Europe Enron and a trading alliance between Endesa and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter according to traders West said Innogy had so far concentrated on buying power in France not always from French companies and taking it to Italy via the cross border interconnector between the two countries Innogy had bought some of the megawatts available on the interconnector through recent auctions he said Its easy to trade through France the cost of taking power through to the border is minuscule although buying power in France and then selling it in France is a lot more difficult said West He said Innogy had signed grid balancing agreements with French transmission grid operator RTE Andy Duff managing director of generation and trading added France could become become important for Innogy on a retail level as well as a trading level depending on how effectively the UKFrance interconnector could be used The European market will be driven by the operation of interconnectors and transmission services as well as exchanges said Duff Innogy may look to trade on Germanys two power exchanges as well as that countrys burgeoning overthecounter market The company is in the process of signing standard trading agreements for Germany based on the terms devised by the industry group the European Federation of Energy Traders EFET FOCUS ON TRADING NOT ASSETS Duff said Innogys strategy in Europe was to focus on trading but not the acquisition of physical assets We are not going to lead with assets in Europe We will focus on trading servicestype arrangements extracting value from other companies assets Thats the main thrust of the business he said West said Innogys trading in mainland Europe would expand into natural gas as opportunities emerged The company already trades around the UKBelgium

improved their ability to pay back debt in recent weeks making their bonds a buy investors said Sentiment seems to be changing said Anna LeesJones who helps manage about billion pounds billion of corporate bonds at MG Investment Management Ive been building up my telecoms position all year British Telecoms year eurodenominated bonds sold in January yield about basis points more than government debt down from a record in March Contracts that pay out if the company goes bankrupt have also fallen in the past month according to Enron Corp which trades the derivatives Bond yields and bankruptcy derivatives have also declined for Deutsche Telekom and Royal KPN NV after the companies said they would sell assets to pay down debt that has pushed their credit ratings to record lows and weighed on their shares Phone companies sold billion of bonds last year to finance licenses and equipment for new mobile services British Telecom said yesterday it will sell its stakes in Japan Telecom Co and Spains Airtel SA to Vodafone Group for billion pounds British Telecom may also sell as much as billion pounds of shares to existing investors in a socalled rights offer according to Legal General Group Plc one of the companys shareholders Deutsche Telekom will sell assets such as cable television and a stake in Global One and Wind SpA Chief Financial Officer KarlGerhard Eick said last week KPN the biggest Dutch phone company said on March it plans to raise at least billion euros from asset sales to lower debt Those plans have helped shift investors perceptions of the companies creditworthiness money managers said Drastic Measures At the beginning of the year the market was assuming telecoms companies would be downgraded from singleA to triple B said Peter Harvey who helps run about billion at FC Management Drastic measures such as deeplydiscounted rights issues led investors to believe they will maintain their singleA status The gap or spread between British Telecoms sterling denominated bonds maturing in and UK fiveyear government bonds has narrowed basis points to basis points in the past month Spreads between Deutsche Telekoms percent five year euro bonds and German government debt narrowed basis points to in April Bankruptcy Swaps Fall Those shifts in sentiment are also reflected in Enrons bankruptcy swaps where prices have fallen in the past month said Simon Brooks a trader at Enron Enron prices the swaps using indexes that measure the probability of bankruptcy and the likely recovery rate in that event The price is expressed as a percentage above a benchmark interest rate such as the London interbank offered rate or Libor British Telecom bankruptcy swaps have declined to basis points from on April Enron said Bankruptcy swaps on Deutsche Telekom dropped to from while KPNs fell to from Over the same period France Telecom SAs declined to from and Telecom Italia SpAs fell to from British Telecoms bond yields may fall further relative to government debt analysts said They still offer higher yields than those of rival Vodafone Group Plc which has the same ratings though with a stable outlook While both companies have fiveyear eurodenominated bonds British Telecoms offer basis points more yield The rivals also both have bonds maturing in and Vodafones yield about basis points fewer If BT retains their rating their spreads should be probably to basis points narrower said Brian Venables head of credit strategy at WestLB Even though it has performed extremely well this year there is much greater potential for BTs debt Debt Reduction Target Both Moodys Investors Service which rates British Telecom A and Standard Poors which rates it A have those ratings on watch for further cuts after trimming them four rungs last year The companys asset sales to Vodafone are definitely positive in terms of the rating assessment said Aidan Fisher who rates British Telecom for Moodys In combination with the proceeds of a rights sale that would meet the target they set themselves this year thats quite a lot to achieve in a month period British Telecom has said it wants to slash its billion pounds of debt by a third and fend off further rating cuts Before companies such as British Telecom clarified their debtreduction plans the world and his wife were underweight telecom bonds in March said Harvey at FC The investment firm has since raised its holding of telecom bonds to neutral from underweight relative to its benchmark he said Bond yields were trading very much out of line to the rest of the market said LeesJones

analysis on Bloomberg BRITEL Corp GO for BTs bonds DT Corp GO for Deutsche Telekoms bonds UKCorporates warm to charms of credit derivatives By Tom Bergin Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited LONDON May Reuters European corporates are beginning to turn to credit derivatives among the more esoteric and complex of financial instruments to hedge the risk their debtors wont pay up market participants said on Thursday Credit derivatives are insurancelike tools that allow users to hedge the risk of default on a debt They are mainly used by banks hedge funds and insurance companies to hedge or gain exposure to the risk of a bond issuer defaulting Dealers said an environment of deteriorating credit quality and a growing awareness among corporates that credit derivatives offer certain advantages over established hedging tools was behind the increasing use of the instruments The market remains small with only around a dozen nonfinancial European corporates regularly using credit derivatives to manage their credit portfolio at present But market professionals predict they will one day become as commonplace in the corporate world as other hedging tools such as interest rate swaps and currency options We see corporate use as a big growth area for credit derivatives maybe the biggest says Bryan Seyfried vicepresident of Enron Credit in London Enron Credit grew out of the efforts of energy company Enron Corp to hedge its own credit risk portfolio and now specialises in marketing credit risk management solutions to other nonfinancial corporates Ralf Lierow director of credit derivatives at Siemens Financial Services in Munich said the ability to buy and sell in a liquid market means credit derivatives offer a flexibility that established tools like credit insurance and forfaiting guarantees lack Credit derivatives were are often cheaper than the alternatives too he added This is not a trading book thing For us the credit default swap is another tool for credit risk management Lierow said HELPS OPERATIONAL UNITS DO MORE BUSINESS Siemens Financial Services acts as the centralised risk portfolio management operation for companies within the Siemens electronics and industrial group It first started using credit derivatives in July Large companies like Siemens can have hundreds of millions of dollars in receivables on their books at any time The efficiency with which these companies manage the credit risk on their receivables has an impact on their day to day business The advantage for the operative area is that they can offload more receivables and do more business Lierow said Siemens uses credit default swaps the most liquid type of credit derivatives to hedge its portfolio of debtors on a constant basis As the balance of cash owed by each name fluctuates over time the company tries to match this with default swap positions Hence if a customer fails to pay Siemens can recoup the debt from the default swap seller Other companies use credit derivatives less frequently There are occasional corporate users that have secured oneoff requirements for balancesheet management aims or to strip out the credit risk of a commercial transaction said Walter Gontarek head of global credit products at RBC Dominion Securities By hedging a country or company risk which a corporate may not be comfortable in carrying a credit derivative can facilitate a project that may otherwise be unfeasible dealers said NOT PUT OFF BY BAD PRESS Corporates adoption of credit derivatives is in spite of the negative publicity the instruments have received in recent years A number of disputes over whether protection buyers could force banks to pay up on contracts have ended up in court However traders insist that subsequent work done on contract documentation minimises the risk of such disputes in future Nonetheless a very practical concern for corporates remains in that credit derivatives documentation was designed by bankers with sovereign and corporate bonds in mind The International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA standard documentation for credit default swaps allows for a payout in relation to defaults on bond payments but not on a private debtors failure to pay We use the ISDA framework but we need it redrafted in specific ways to fit our needs You cannot take a standard contract and trade on it if you want to hedge trade receivables Lierow said These amendments add to the cost of the credit derivative Another problem that corporates face is the complexity of credit derivatives There is little experience of the instruments which are barely a decade old in the corporate world Siemens had to get its expertise from the financial markets hiring Lierow from Bankgesellschaft Berlin Clive Banks UK head of derivatives sales to buyside clients at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney said much of the effort in marketing credit derivatives to corporates involves educating them about the products and the risks involved Its about explaining credit risk management and what kind of volatility and cost having credit risk introduces he said OUTLOOK PROMISING Yet some corporates are beginning to take full advantage of their new tool Lierow said that Siemens which currently only buys credit protection planned to start acting as a default swaps seller in the coming months He said selling would facilitate better matching of protection levels to actual exposures and would enable diversification of risk away from industry sectors where the companys activities are concentrated You could improve the portfolio mix by buying protection on automotives and selling protection on pharmaceuticals he said Allegheny Energy buys three power plants Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press

their forecast of the profitability of generating electricity in the US in and beyond because power prices are expected to drop more sharply than natural gas prices starting next year The analysts cut the profit margin in natural gasfired power in to a megawatthour from MWh a difference from their last forecast in February They lowered their power price index for by and for by Thursday in a published report Their forecast is based on forward markets for electricity and gas Gas prices are remaining strong for a much longer period of time while power prices drop off senior electricity industry analyst Raymond Niles said in a telephone conference with investors As a result stock prices for power producers such as AES Corp AES Mirant MIR Calpine Corp CPN and NRG Energy NRG could peak this summer in advance of strong third quarter earnings reports the Salomon report says Investors may still shy away from asset and investmentheavy power producers if realized prices begin to reflect the decreases in power prices now projected in the forward curve the report warns After this summer the stocks of energy companies that focus more on trading will regain momentum Salomon expects These energy merchant companies such as Enron Corp ENE Williams Cos WMB Duke Energy DUK and Dynegy DYN should be able to take advantage of higher trading volume and greater volatility in power markets in nonsummer months according to Salomon We expect annual trading volumes to grow industrywide between and on average during as the billion global energy commodity market continues to open the report predicts The overall electricity price trend is national according to Salomon The report titled Power Curve expects wholesale power prices to exceed last years by in the West and by on average in the eastern US including Texas But since their last forecast the analysts lowered their forward price curve for next year and beyond in of regional power pools Interestingly the exception to that is the New York Power Pool Niles told investors For the remainder of this year however Salomon still expects power producers to beat substantially last years breakthrough results About of the spike upward in western US power prices the past six months has been from something weve never seen before in this industry political and credit risk Niles said in the conference Western merchant power suppliers are benefitting from the unholy mess in California Niles said but that wont last forever Whenever the debate tapers off and we have a resolution in sight that premium will slowly drain out of the western markets and bring down profitability for the group Niles said National calls for reregulation due to the California crisis could continue to hurt stock prices for the entire sector even though reregulation wont happen Further in so far as such calls discourage investment in generating plants transmission lines and gas pipelines they could also extend the current period of extremely high

and its A senior debt rating for its regulated pipeline affiliate Northern Border Pipeline Co NBPL The Rating Outlook for both companies is changed to Stable from Negative The rating action was taken

Company and Dynegy Canada midstream assets An additional million of equity is expected to be sold in the coming months to pay down shortterm debt and complete the permanent financing The improvement in Rating Outlook primarily reflects NBPs demonstrated commitment to undertake conservative longterm financing and operating strategies Future acquisitions at the partnership level are expected to be financed debtequity so as to maintain financial flexibility and a stable credit profile Moreover management has shown a strong bias to minimize commodity price risk as it expands its nonregulated gas

Enron to meet govt panel over Indian project Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited NEW DELHI May Reuters The Indian unit of Enron Corp said on Thursday that its officials would meet members of a government panel formed to renegotiate a troubled billion power project in western India But the willingness to meet the panel next week should not be construed as an offer to renegotiate the contract Dabhol Power Company DPC said in a statement As a matter of courtesy we have agreed to meet with them next week the DPC statement said Since the purpose of our meeting is to hear out the committee and understand their thoughts we will not present any proposal DPC said it had constantly maintained that it was open to maintaining a dialogue towards resolving issues But This meeting should in no manner be construed as an open offer from DPC to renegotiate the terms of the contract it added DPC and the government of the western state of Maharashtra have been locked in a payment battle for months with the states electricity board balking at paying Enron what it considers too high a rate for electricity At present Maharashtras State Electricity Board MSEB owes the DPC of which Enron is a percent stakeholder some million for power The Maharashtra government last week announced the formation of a panel of experts to renegotiate its contract with DPC and lower the cost of power sold to MSEB LARGEST FOREIGN INVESTMENT The Dabhol project the single largest foreign investment in India consists of two phases the alreadybuilt megawatt power plant and a MW plant that is expected to be finished this year Last week Dabhols board authorised the plants managing director to issue a preliminary notice of termination of service to MSEB The notice which has not been issued

institution said The domestic lenders to the project are Industrial Development Bank of India ICICI Ltd Industrial Finance Corporation of India Canara Bank and State Bank of India If Enron pulls out

Scottish Power Looks To Refine Focus By Andrea Chipman Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LONDON Dow Jones After more than a year of lagging earnings investment missteps and unexpected disasters UK verticallyintegrated utility Scottish Power SPI is hoping a new strategy to streamline its businesses will signal a more focused period for the company But its got its work cut out While investors were cheered by news that its US Utahbased Hunter power plant is back online after a sixmonth outage that cost the company an estimated million uncertainty over its plans for its Southern Water unit and apparent ongoing commitment to lossmaking telecoms venture Thus are seen as muddling group focus It all adds up the lack of coherent strategy quite substantial downgrades and a whole host of noncore businesses that they dont have any natural management flair or expertise in said Brian Gallagher a senior fund manager at Londonbased Gartmore Investment Management which has GBP million of Scottish Power shares in its Global Utilities Fund We have a reasonably low opinion of the company The company said Thursday that its pretax profit before goodwill amortization and exceptional items for the fiscal year ending March fell to GBP million from GBP million a year ago Adjusted earnings per share declined to pence in the fiscal year from pence in The company acknowledged profits have been hit hard by the Hunter outage competition on wholesale and retail markets in the UK and strict price controls on its regulated infrastructure businesses Although the companys shares were trading at pence after the release of Thursdays earnings results up from pence Wednesday they are down more than from pence a year ago Executives say they are restructuring the business into three targeted divisions to capitalize on its traditional strengths in generation and power supply and infrastructure and to expand its overseas activities Weve now got a trading and commercial link between generation and supply and the first thing we are doing is putting emphasis on thaton growing earnings across that value chain Scottish Power Chief Executive Ian Russell told journalists in a conference call Thursday In the US we are focused on cost cutting and on acquiring new businesses Scottish Powers move away from a full multiutility profile begun last year with its partial disposal of Thus and its withdrawal from an Internet banking venture with the Royal Bank of Scotland toward a more narrowly focused energy business mimics a trend across the industry toward greater specialization The company is also considering selling Southern Water which would allow it to focus even more closely on its power business Yet analysts and investors say they are looking for more details of the companys overall growth strategy from Russell who took over as chief executive last month and other managers The toll from months of drift is evident they said Sales Of Southern Water Thus Seen Indeed despite its efforts to chart a new road Scottish Power appears to be reluctant to acknowledge the failure of some of its noncore ventures Russell said his company remains supportive of Thus which reported a fiscal year loss of GBP million this week and has no plans to exit its remaining stake in the company Similarly he said Scottish Power hasnt yet made a final decision to dispose of Southern Water which has cut costs under its Scottish parent but is increasingly unable to cover its capital expenditure although he said the company had received a number of offers from potential buyers Although he declined to identify any of the bidders Italian energy company Enel SpA ENI has confirmed its interest Industry sources said a prompt sale of the water unit looks likely with some bids already exceeding the GBP billion at which many analysts value the companys combined assets and debt Its unclear they said how Southern Water or Thus would fit into Scottish Powers new image Scottish Power sees itself as an international energy company a source familiar with the company said In a years time he added it would be unlikely that Southern Water and Thus would be part of the company Revenues from the sale of the water unit would also help Scottish Power pursue its US expansion without adding to its gearing levels analysts and investors said Russell declined to comment on reports Scottish Power is considering buying Enron Corps Oregonbased unit Portland General but admitted the company would be a logical geographical fit with Pacificorp Analysts said Scottish Powers plans for US growth is likely to be a key part of its energy strategy We like their US strategy where theyve leveraged expertise gained in the highly competitive UK market said Gareth LewisDavies head of utilities research at Lehman Brothers in London Closer to home competition and the trend toward increased specialization in the power industry may force Scottish Power to determine whether its business strength lies in asset management or retail and generation Strategic decisions need to be made and Im not sure if they are going to make them in the near term or not said Andrew Wright UK utilities analyst at UBS Warburg in London They are pretty much involved across the value chain and I think it remains to be seen which part of the value chain they

Missing link by Claire Poole The Daily Deal Copyright c The Deal LLC Buying Illinova gave Dynegy a key piece in a puzzle for trading energy anywhere anytime When Chuck Watson decided to take his company beyond natural gas trading he changed its name to Dynegy Inc and took as its logo a tangram a sevenpiece puzzle that can be assembled in thousands of ways Buying utility Illinova Corp in February gave him a piece for delivering such flexibility The Illinova acquisition was probably the most welltimed and best conceived buy of the year raves Jeremy Butler an analyst at Value Line Publishing Inc ReportCard DYNEGY ILLINOVA Stock Price A Profitability B Strategy A Braintrust B Culture B Competitive Position A Overall A Why Besides providing electricity to customers in a squaremile area in Illinois Decatur Illbased Illinova also had recently received regulatory approval to transfer its coal and gasfired generating plants megawatts in all to an unregulated subsidiary as part of the states deregulation of its electricity industry Thanks to soaring energy prices as well as to million to million in overall earnings estimated or achieved from optimizing Illinovas generation assets and improving its operating efficiencies Dynegy is seeing the effects of the deal on its bottom line Illinova has been extremely accretive to earnings said M Carol Coale an analyst at Prudential Securities in Houston Last year in fact Dynegys revenues nearly doubled to billion while its net earnings almost tripled to million or per diluted share as a result of the billion Illinova deal In the first quarter Dynegys net earnings jumped Investors have been amply rewarded Dynegys stock took off last year jumping to per share making it the second best performing stock in the Standard Poors Since the Illinova deal was announced June Dynegys stock has skyrocketed an astounding from to One of those happy investors is San Franciscobased oil and gas giant Chevron Corp which owns about of Dynegy For Watson who formed Dynegy in the late s out of Houston energy company NGS Corp where he was CEO and chairman the success of the Illinova deal underscores his quest to take power and trade it anywhere he wants anytime he wants at any price he wants Thats why he dubbed the company Dynegy a hybrid name taken by combining dynamic with energy If energy prices stay high and Dynegys traders continue to make winning bets analysts expect the companys net earnings per share to increase another this year to million or per share But Dynegy hasnt been immune to the power crisis afflicting California where it coowns four power plants with NRG Energy Inc of Minneapolis that generate megawatts of capacity Indeed since the crisis began Dynegys been defending itself against allegations that its overcharging for power The California situation has hurt Dynegy in other ways too On April for example its stock fell to after utility Pacific Gas Electric Co a unit of PGE Corp filed for bankruptcy Dynegy provides power to the California market as a wholesaler but not to PGE directly Dynegy has also been quibbling recently with another teetering California utility Sempra Energys San Diego Gas Electric which claimed April that Dynegy ordered it to shutter some of the facilities the utility sold it in but that it still operates because it doesnt think it will get paid Dynegy denied the charge Dynegy did not instruct SDGE to shut down generating units nor did we suggest that we would not make power available to creditworthy buyers Stephen W Bergstrom Dynegys president and COO wrote in a letter to SDGE Chairman and CEO Stephen Baum Dynegy has tried to downplay its exposure to the states power woes Its repeatedly pointed out to the press that its stake in the four power plants in California only represents of its total generating portfolio of megawatts or about Analysts however estimate Dynegys exposure in California could give its earnings a haircut of as much as this year Even so Dynegys stock has recovered to a recent Illinova has created some volatility to Dynegys stock because of the addition of power generation to its business Prudentials Coale said But overall its been a great deal While keeping most of Illinova management in place Dynegy made the companys chairman president and CEO Charles Bayless a nonexecutive director of the combined entity Dynegys also marketing and trading all of Illinovas megawatts of output Theyve streamlined power generation and traded around the assets while keeping the distribution business in a sweet spot said John Olson an analyst at Sanders Morris Harris in Houston Illinova meanwhile solved a big investorrelated problem for Dynegy Before the merger only of Dynegys shares were available to the public As part of the deal Watson convinced two of Dynegys strategic partners British Gas plc and Nova Chemicals to sell their combined stake for approximately million in cash and shares of a new convertible preferred stock It also issued million shares after the deal closed Those moves increased Dynegys float to more than of the shares outstanding which led money managers to flood in The companys market capitalization has since tripled to billion Operationally in its effort to focus on power generation trading and marketing Dynegy has been dumping some of its midstream assets such as processing plants and pipelines particularly in the midContinent region The idea now is to increase Dynegys socalled merchant power capacity or the electricity it sells wholesale to anyone who needs it to megawatts by through acquisitions new construction and asset management agreements As a result Watson has become what some are calling an acquisitions hound Hes already acquired some facilities On Jan Dynegy completed the purchase of two power plants in the Hudson River Valley the megawatt Roseton power plant in Newburgh NY and the megawatt Danskammer plant nearby from various area utilities for million Banc of America Securities llc advised Dynegy on both purchases Dynegy has had trouble picking up other power plants however Witness the deal it announced Nov to acquire megawatts worth of electricitygenerating assets in Nevada from Renobased Sierra Pacific Resources for million The deal got scotched April when Nevada regulators spooked by its nextdoor neighbors power crisis repealed the states electricity deregulation plan and put a moratorium on all power plant sales in the state Dynegy estimated the acquisition would have added cents per share to earnings Still since the Illinova merger the total generating capacity built or acquired by Dynegy now exceeds the total capacity added through the merger That includes megawatts of new natural gasfired generation facilities in Georgia Kentucky and Louisiana that are expected to begin commercial operation by June just in time for summer Like its crosstown rival Enron Corp Dynegy has also expanded via acquisitions into broadband telecommunications Dynegy also competes with Houstonbased Reliant Energy and Charlotte NCbased Duke Energy Both Enron and Dynegy see a big opportunity in broadband given that there are few other suppliers and that managing its movement is akin to whats involved with natural gas or electricity In August Dynegy announced it was acquiring Aurora Colobased Extant Inc a privately held developer of telecom solutions for million in cash and stock It completed the deal in September Then in November Dynegy announced it was acquiring privately held Iaxis Ltd a Londonbased telecom that owned and operated an mile fiberoptic network throughout Europe for almost million Dynegy completed the deal in March Dynegy is now developing a mile fiberoptic cable network in the US that it will link to Iaxis network in Europe It hopes its broadband unit which lost million in the first quarter will be profitable by the second half of Still Dynegy has differentiated itself as the antiEnron because among other things it continues to buy power plants rather than sell them Enron meanwhile has been trying to dump its hard assets such as Portland General Electric in Portland Ore Enron CEO Jeff Skilling a polished former McKinsey Co consultant just wants to be a gobetween and not just in energy but in broadband pulp and paper and metals while Dynegys Watson a scrappy former commodities

Asian Wall Street Journal Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Indias electricity shortage cant be solved without a new approach Indias power problem is back on the front burner because global generating giant Enron is threatening to turn off the lights at its Dhabol plant and walk away from a contract with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board In an effort to collect million owed for electricity already supplied the American company has invoked central government guarantees and declared a political force majeure but without much success So technically India is facing a sovereign default after which Enron would spend years battling through the courts to get compensation for the billion project Of course everyone knows thats not going to happen After more brinksmanship from both sides in the coming days they will have to sit down and negotiate a settlement Some of the problems with Enron are unique to that particular arrangement but in its basic outline the saga epitomizes a flawed attempt to deal with Indias power problem narrowly defined a shortage of generating capacity The country suffers constant blackouts due to a supply shortage of about and even more during times of peak demand In the early s the central government sought to solve this shortfall by opening the doors to private investors like Enron But this proved to be a mistake because power distribution is controlled by the state governments they run it as a system of wealth redistribution rather than a business California recently made the earthshattering discovery that a lack of market pricing at the consumer level leads to disaster But Indias state electricity boards or SEBs proved that long ago they have long been bankrupt and often default on payments to private generators As a result most of the big names in power have now pulled out of India Yes the country does need to worry about generating capacity Its estimated that in the next years demand will more than double with an additional megawatts needed but only half of that is likely to be built That could increase the shortfall during peak demand to a frightening prospect But the first order of business is to reform distribution There is a debate now about how to give state governments the right incentives to reform their SEBs These owe almost billion to central governmentowned generators and mines from whom they buy much of their power and coal In the recently passed budget New Delhi included a provision to forgive this debt as long as the state governments commit to either privatizing their SEBs or putting a floor on electricity prices Electricity meters would actually be installed to measure power usage but subsidies would still be allowed many customers wouldnt pay enough to cover the true cost of that power Still this would be big progress by Indian standards if it happened Many farmers currently get their power for free and over of power generated is stolen something the SEBs euphemistically call transmission and distribution losses As a result the electricity boards average a return on investment of negative However New Delhi is offering quite a big carrot and not much stick After a March meeting between the prime minister and state leaders Rajnath Singh the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh said quite clearly that he wouldnt hike energy charges for farmers The reason is obvious he faces elections next year and free power has become an entitlement that no politician lightly takes away Chief ministers will likely sign on to New Delhis plan in order to get debt relief but will backslide on implementation The only thing that will make the states serious about reform is a hard budget constraint which is the opposite of what the government is offering One way to provide it would be to hand over the centrally owned power generators and mines to the states They would then have to figure out how to keep the system running If they still chose not to charge for electricity they would have to find the money for power generation from other parts of their budgets Another reform some have suggested is to pass a national law which legalizes private power producers Some states allow companies to have their own captive power plants to maintain supply when the public grid fails But these are typically not permitted to sell their power outside of the parent company If larger plants that could supply several industrial firms were legalized the states would come under greater pressure to reform The private power suppliers could cherrypick the best customers those willing to pay for reliable power leaving the state to subsidize the freeloaders This would also have the benefit of quickly boosting the countrys power supply since captive plants already have about megawatts of unused capacity New Delhi is still trying to reform the countrys power market by fiat This means years of political wrangling while a growing economy is strangled by a shortage of electricity Instead the wouldbe reformers could let the power of the invisible hand push the state governments in the right direction INDIA Foreign funds plough money into Indian shares By Anurag Sood Reuters English

hunting for better returns in emerging Asia According to Lipper Asia Ltd a Reuters global funds data company investments by the biggest fund investors in Asia soared to billion in the JanuaryMarch

percent the IMF estimates percent the Asian Development Bank percent and the Indian central bank percent Ajit Ranade economist at ABN AMRO Bank says Indias large domestic economy resilient to the global slowdown could pull more funds into the country But a blizzard of stock market scandals which revealed share price manipulation has unnerved some foreign investors Weak regulation is a part of an emerging market risk but that does not rule out caution said an India strategist at a foreign brokerage Analysts say foreign fund flows are unlikely to be influenced much by events such as the Enron controversy where the US energy giant is threatening to pull out of its billion power project in the western Indian state of Maharashtra Enron is Indias single biggest foreign direct investor They say factors that influence foreign portfolio investments are different from the considerations that drive longer term direct investments The Indian governments decision to hike foreign funds

the coalition or supportive of the Democratic Front Government today thrashed its effort to renegotiate the power purchase agreement PPA with the Enron sponsored Dabhol Power Company The least cost option was to initiate a judicial probe into the deal which was replete with fraud and seek the scrapping of the project they said This view was made public after the parties Peasants and Workers Party the CPIM the Janata Dal Secular the Samajwadi Party and others met here and decided to press the demand at a meeting of the coordination committee of all parties including the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party on May Its scheduled meeting for today was put off as the Chief Minister Mr Vilasrao Deshmukh was away electioneering in the South These parties worried about the huge unpayable DPC bills had been demanding a probe under the Inquiries Commissions Act but today upped the ante saying we are convinced of fraud in the agreement with DPC The renegotiation Mr N D Patil who leads the Left grouping and heads the allparty coordination panel said is not what we want we dont want it at all He and Mr Prabhakar Sanzgiri CPIM said we no longer suspect it We are convinced of malfeasance Along with Mr Pradhyumna Kaul of the AntiEnron Campaign they told a press conference that the moment fraud was proved the PPA could be annulled and the huge liquidation penalties can be avoided The demand was to scrap the mw phase II take over the mw Phase I and initiate a probe The Godbole Committee report has provided enough grounds though Phase I was a reality and Phase II only an eventuality Even a small criminal probe would put any arbitration decision sought by the DPC on hold The lobby pressing for scrapping the PPA said an FIR against the Maharashtra State Electricity Board under the provisions of Section of the Electricity Supply Act would suffice as there were enough grounds to prove that the entity or persons concerned had played games at one time or the other It cited bloated projections of energy demand in Maharashtra provided by the MSEB to DPC to justify the work on the Phase II which is now under stress following lenders reluctance to provide funds till the issue is sorted out When asked why Mr Deshmukh preferred renegotiation and trimming of power tariff to a probe Mr Patil said that is his view For their part the parties would press for change

Sons Ltd KSL Source World Reporter TM Asia Intelligence Wire THIRUVANANTHAPURAM MAY The Maharashtra Chief Minister Mr Vilasrao Deshmukh today advised the State to handle the Enron issue cautiously and refrain from committing the mistakes made by his State Addressing a press conference here today Mr Deshmukh said the Maharashtra Government was treading carefully on the Enron issue and it hoped to renegotiate the power tariff with the US company Mr Deshmukhs observations assume significance in the context of the running controversy regarding the Kannur Power Project which had been denied permission by the LDF Government Mr Deshmukh said that Enron had written to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board that it was ready to renegotiate the power tariff provided the Government of India made a formal request He said the renegotiation would start as soon as the Union Government handed over the formal letter asking for a renegotiation Mr Deshmukh pointed out that the basic issue in Enrons Dabhol project was related to the power tariff The foreign exchange rate was fixed at Rs a dollar at the start of the project But now it had gone up to Rs a dollar thereby pushing the cost of power up He indicated that the renegotiations would focus on this aspect as well The Maharashtra Government had proposed renegotiation on the basis of the Godbole Commission recommendation He was confident that the Enron would agree to renegotiate the tariff in the interests of the Maharashtra Government and its own interests In reply to a question Mr Deshmukh said the Enron project had been a major drain on his States finances but it had overcome all problems by handling them very carefully He said the Maharashtra Government would extend all support to the UDF if it were to come to power to process the various parameters relating to the Kannur project so that it did not commit the same kind of mistake as Maharashtra did He however made it clear that his Government welcomed foreign direct investments but not at the cost of the States interests Mr Deshmukh attacked the Centre for not using the various options available under the WTO agreement to come out with a balanced importexport policy Asked for his comments on Mr Sharad Pawars statement that the NCP was considering joining the Peoples Front Mr Deshmukh made it very clear that his partys alliance with the NCP was confined to Maharashtra alone The alliance with the NCP is a post election affair as part of the attempts to unite all secular forces The Congress had fought the NCP and several other parties which are now part of the Congressled Government But the alliance had been formed in order to keep the BJPShiv Sena combine out he said Asked how his party could accept the NCP which had an alliance going with the BJP in Meghalaya Mr Deshmukh said the Congress NCP ties were confined to Maharashtra If the NCP creates any problems in Maharashtra the alliance would end he said Mr Deshmukh attacked the CPIMled LDF for its five year misrule which had left the State virtually bankrupt The credibility of the LDF is so low that the people would not vote for it The CPIMled Left parties would be defeated

of action on its LNG shipping deal for the Dabhol Power Company DPC The controversy surrounding the Enronpromoted DPC and the apprehension raised by the lenders to the LNG shipping project has made the three shipping promoters of Greenfield Shipping Company take stock of the situation A final view on the LNG shipping deal will depend on what Enron decides on the power project per se and not just

Unlike in the case of other ships LNG ships do not have a secondary market since these are acquired against specific longterm contracts In case of any eventuality Greenfield Shipping Company would

the tariff in its own interest as well as that of the State Government Our Bureau Let Enron Exit ADITYA CHATTERJEE POOJA KOTHARI The Times of India Copyright C The Times of India Source World Reporter TM FOR years Enron tried to woo Indian policymakers who couldnt seem to decide whether the Dabhol project was a good idea or not Today the boot is on the other foot and it seems to be pinching Enrons management is keen to stop investing in huge capitalintensive plants around the world In keeping with this strategy and no doubt exhausted by its ceaseless crisis management in India Enron is mulling a pullout But both the Centre and Maharashtra government want to renegotiate the power purchase agreement and have entrusted this responsibility to the Madhav Godbole panel Is Enron really as indispensable as the authorities seem to think it is Financially no Indeed if the only way to continue the project is on the present terms then it makes better sense to simply scrap it After all its better to amputate a gangrenous limb than to let the problem spread further A little arithmetic will make this amply clear If the Dabhol Power Company DPC does scrap its agreement with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board the Centre will have to cough up a sum of Rs crore a penalty amount of Rs crore for one years electricity bill and million as termination fees which works out to Rs crore at an assumed exchange rate of rupees to one dollar This is a onetime payment and the figure of Rs crore is corroborated by a recent statement by Union power secretary A K Basu Now if India were to continue with the present arrangement it would end up paying at least Rs crore per year for the next years to DPC On the other hand what would happen if the project were scrapped Well very simplistically India would save Rs crore Rs crore multiplied by years But things arent quite that simple because that money could earn interest while inflation would mean that Rs crore after years would not have the same value it would have today To get around this problem financial experts use a concept called net present value which discounts future earning streams as well as inflation to evaluate the attractiveness of a project If we use a discount rate of per cent then the value of the amount India would save by scrapping the Dabhol project works out to Rs crore over three times the amount India would have to pay today if the agreement with DPC is terminated Indian financial institutions FIs and banks which have lent money to DPC are actively lobbying to prevent such an eventuality But how badly would they be hit Well FIs led by Industrial Development Bank of India have provided loans of million and million in two phases This brings their total exposure to million Rs crore at an exchange rate of Besides State Bank of India also underwrote the maximum portion of a million crossborder loan and has an exposure of about million Rs crore Thus the cumulative exposure of Indian banks and FIs in DPC works out to around Rs crore However since only per cent of this amount has been disbursed so far the net exposure of Indian lenders amounts to Rs crore Since the Indian lenders are not covered by any counterguarantee their bottomline would be hit if Enron backs out The government being a majority stakeholder in most of these institutions would also be affected But even if all these loans are taken into account and added to the onetime payment of Rs crore the total cost to the government would be Rs crore still lower than Rs crore Thus the termination option will prove less costly for the nation than proceeding on the present terms What will happen to the assets and the plant did we hear you ask Well the government can sell it to private players and renegotiate the cost factor with them this time hopefully after doing a costbenefit analysis A sale of assets would also lessen the load on the government Who knows the government may actually manage to sell the ownership of DPC at a premium to another private sector player Of course fears have been raised that cancelling the project might cost us foreign direct investment since Enron is the biggest investor in India so far After all Brazil raised billion and China billion last year in comparison with Indias measly billion But theres another way of looking at the problem what does India really have to lose In short its a case of losing what you dont even have in the first place Many developing nations which were pushed into signing expensive power projects by multinationals have successfully renegotiated their contracts with no serious financial consequences Many nations simply did not have the money to pay for the inflated bills some refused to pay even after losing international arbitration awards while others like Costa Rica declared that the contracts signed with independent power producers like Enron have no legal status or are bad in law In July the Hungarian parliament declared that a PPA signed with multinational RWE was unconstitutional and void In August the Croatian government tore up a PPA signed between Enron and a previous government The contract was considered to be unaffordable and was allegedly signed in suspicious circumstances Enron subsequently abandoned the original agreement In September the Philippines took a decision to not renew financially crippling contracts with IPPs Controversy has accompanied the Dabhol project from the start In August the finance ministry had written to the power ministry that the size of the potential liability for a megawatt plant was around Rs crore per year The department of economic affairs had also warned that the risk of counterguarantees being invoked was not unreal given that state electricity bills had been defaulting in payments Caution was thrown to the winds then The least India can do now is ask for a renegotiation But does the Indian government have the courage to go eyeballtoeyeball with Enron and not blink first Scrapping the power purchase agreement involves a onetime payment of Rs crore However India would save over Rs crore by doing so There would be a net saving even after writing off FI loans to Dabhol Power Company IDBI whose life is it anyway Tamal Bandyopadhyay Business Standard Copyright c Business Standard On April a terse oneline announcement by the finance ministry gave the acting chairman and managing director of Industrial Development Bank of India IDBI S K Chakrabarti a threemonth extension The government was generous enough not to keep the CMD as well as the institution waiting till late evening which it normally does for the fax message from North Block But the acting IDBI chief may be asked to step down even in three weeks if the government is able to identify his successor He has been reappointed for a period of three months or till a regular CMD takes charge whichever is earlier Could there have been a better way to insult the countrys largest financial institution and its chief First the government planned to merge the Industrial Finance Corporation of India IFCI which is on the brink of collapse under the burden of ballooning nonperforming assets with IDBI to make them sink together Unable to push through the proposal in the face of stiff resistance put up by IDBI the government now appears to be keen on leading the countrys premier financial institution to its grave alone This not by giving an extension to the existing acting chief but by failing to identify his successor and thereby continuing the uncertainty at the top Nothing can move in an organisation when the CEO himself does not know how long he will survive Indias financial institutions have been repositioning themselves by going shortterm both on the assets as well as the liabilities sides But for that transformation to take effect they need leaders with a longterm tenure at the helm To understand this lets look at whats happening at ICICI another financial institution in the country that is breathing down on IDBIs neck and threatening to overtake it K V Kamath CEO and managing director of ICICI got a second fiveyear term seven days ahead of the expiry of his first term on March Once his second term is complete Kamath will have ended up running the show at ICICI for a decade ICICI does not only give its chief a long term to steer the ship but also grooms talent to take over the institution in due course Kamath was groomed by his predecessor N Vaghul In turn he is now grooming Nachiket Mor to succeed him Mor a former senior general manager of ICICI has recently been shifted to ICICI Bank as an executive director in charge of wholesale banking He is likely to be made the managing director of the bank when the present incumbent H N Sinor steps down next year Eventually he will take over the mantle from Kamath in by which time his stint at the bank will have given him enough operational experience in addition to his treasury management and other skills Given the circumstances IDBI is fighting a losing battle It will not be surprising if it goes the IFCI way with an uncertain leadership unable to steer a demoralised overstaffed ship becalmed by the apathetic bureaucracy of the North Block This is despite its tremendous brand value in project financing and widespread corporate relationships Carved out of the Reserve Bank of India by an Act of Parliament in IDBI has business relations with virtually every corporate house in India But that is not helping it tide over the crisis because the key to any financial intermediarys success at this juncture is how it handles its resources both currency as well as human In an ideal situation the cost of funds should be lower while the cost of human resources should be marketdriven In IDBIs case it is the reverse its cost of funds is on the higher side in the absence of aggressive treasury operations and it is not allowed to pay marketdriven salary to its employees The net result There has been an exodus of talent from IDBI and the institution is struggling to stay afloat just when recession has prompted corporations to cut back on their borrowings IDBIs sanctions and disbursements have been falling and nonperforming assets increasing It is sitting on piles of cash but finding deployment avenues hard to come by Two former chiefs of IDBI S H Khan and G P Gupta spent a large chunk of their tenure and energy pleading with the finance ministry to delink IDBIs salary structure from that of the Reserve Bank of India but without success Small wonder that Chakrabarti who became acting chairman on February for a threemonth term has singled out the low morale of the staff as his prime concern He wants to address this on a war footing The Centre has now successfully demoralised him by offering him another uncertain term Former finance minister Manmohan Singh accepted Khans argument on marketdriven package he reportedly wanted a pay scale for his employees that was higher ICICIs but could not do anything about it P Chidambaram repeated Singhs failure on this front and Yashwant Sinha too thinks the proposal is not worth considering because it will have a ripple effect in the industry For instance RBI employees will immediately demand their pound of flesh The finance ministry refuses to see the point that the countrys central bank is not a commercial organisation and does not have to compete with ICICI When three successive finance ministers failed to address IDBIs problems the institution went for soft options It ended up appointing three consultants for restructuring in six years First Booz Allen Hamilton in followed by M B Athreya in and finally Boston Consulting Group The third consultant BCG is yet to submit its report While Booz Allen Hamilton charted out the roadmap for diversification and suggested that the institution spread its wings overseas and tap new business opportunities the Athreya panel said it must convert itself into a bank and the governments stake should come down without delay Over the last few years the institution has been planning its conversion into a bank and blaming the economy for its indifferent performance even as ICICI has been going full steam with new initiatives ICICI Bank is also exploiting synergies with its parent to the hilt while IDBI Bank seems to be embarrassed about ackowledging its pedigree Its not that everything is great at ICICI Over the past few years the institution has lost some senior executives ISec managing director Kishore Chaukar left to join the Tata group ICICI senior general managers Anando Mukherji joined Enron and N J Subaiah took charge at Centurion Bank which he subsequently left The industry suspects the quality of ICICIs assets and is not comfortable with the scorching pace of growth Even the wellpaid ICICI executive cadres find the pace of work is too much to handle and complain of fatigue In private they hate the mad rush for excellence And yet there is a method in ICICIs madness It has trimmed the flab with two successive voluntary retirement schemes branched out into consumer loans in a big way and transformed treasury operations into an art The finance ministry would do well to explore the possibility of divesting the governments stake in IDBI to ICICI Instead of pumping in Rs crore as recapitalisation funds into IFCI it can simply let it die and sell its assets to other banks and financial institutions IDBIs bulk and the brand name in project financing would combine well with ICICIs growing retail presence and unbridled aggression The combination would be formidable enough to give the State Bank of India a run for its money Of course a whole lot of issues need to settled before the process takes off like trimming the flab in IDBI and delinking it from the RBI pay structure et al IDBI merging with ICICI may sound like an absurd dream but it is certainly a better option than merging IFCI with IDBI If Reliance is willing to bid for staterun oil majors HPCL and

fund manager comment By Andrew Callus LONDON May Reuters Scottish Power Plc announced a restructuring on Thursday reflecting plans for expansion in the United States and a tighter power sector focus in its British home market Britains largest power utility was reporting a decline in pretax profits before exceptional items and goodwill for the year to March to million pounds million from million a year ago But its shares rose percent to pence on some good news on costs and power generation in the United States where plant breakdown and high prices have hit earnings and investor sentiment Hunter a power station in Utah came back on line on Thursday after a day breakdown that cost million a day and helped deliver percent sector shareprice underperformance over the period New US plants are also coming on stream The profit figure was in line with analysts forecasts hit by UK regulation the Hunter outage and high US power prices They are keeping those costs down in the United States said one sector analyst There were stories out there they were going to be worse than they have been saying and it wasnt The breakdown at Hunter part of the UK groups PacifiCorp acquisition was unusually costly because power had to be bought in to replace the megawatts MW of lost capacity while power prices in the region were very high Even with Hunter back up PacifiCorp has more customer demand than plant to supply it so high wholesale prices will continue to be a problem The new structure unveiled on Thursday consists of a US division including PacifiCorps regulated and unregulated businesses a UK division covering generation and energy supply in Britain and a third infrastructure division which includes power systems and Southern Water in the UK and create a link between US and UK infrastructure businesses NEW US PLANT Chief Executive Ian Russell told reporters by telephone the Hunter power plant was now reconnected to the grid and would reach full operating capacity within a few days He was also upbeat about prospects for expanding generation in the United States where Scottish Power aims to have new plants with an extra MW or percent of current capacity on stream this year He announced that the first of these a MW plant at Gadsby in Salt Lake City Utah began producing on Thursday as well Another MW plant being built in Oregon will be onstream in a month or so Russell said PORTLAND Scottish Power confirmed it was still looking at the possible sale or refinancing of its Southern Water business in Britain and Russell said there had been a number of expressions of interest for the business worth about billion pounds but we are some way away from a conclusion He also said he was still looking for a further US acquisition but would not confirm reports he was in talks with US power trading group Enron Corp about buying its Portland Oregon power arm When we acquired PacifiCorp we said it was a platform for further growth obviously Portland is right in our own back yard he said Frankly were still very busy with PacifiCorp and for the time being thats what we are focused on Investors have been concerned about the groups dealmaking plans given the weak market for UK water infrastructure assets and volatility in the US market There is still a bit of deal risk there amidst worries they may sell Southern Water too cheaply said one fund manager who is underweight in the stock CEO Russell said the threeway restructuring would help the group sharpen our focus on improving shareholder value and capture opportunities in the US western power markets PacifiCorp contributed operating profit of million pounds after the impact of the Hunter outage compared to million pounds four month contribution a year earlier The groups million poundsayear threeyear UK cost saving plan was on track at the end of its first year Russell said Finance director David Nish expressed continuing support for Thus its spunoff startup telecoms business in which it still holds just over percent Thus is still lossmaking and has been struck by general investor disaffection with telecoms companies and concerns about how it would secure future funding But Nish said Scottish Power had no plans to do anything other than be supportive of the company additional reporting by Sonya Dowsett Distractions interfere with key growth questions Financial Times May By Andrew Taylor in London Cynics claim that Scottish Powers legal action launched this week to rewrite a long term electricity supply contract was more about distracting attention from the groups poor results than a realistic bid to cut costs This judgment is a little harsh Scottish Power would benefit considerably if it could renegotiate the deal that requires it to buy threequarters of Scotlands nuclear output The British Energy contract is worth obn bn in the next four years Shareholders could do with some distraction Scottish Power by its own admission has had a tough year which will be confirmed today when it publishes results for Ian Russell who took over as chief executive in March may even indulge in the new boys practice of including the cost of further forseeable bad news in the figures making any subsequent improvement appear greater His biggest problem will be to convince the City that he is capable of developing an effective strategy to change the groups direction now it has abandoned plans to become a multiutility The group no longer believes adequate returns can be earned from developing a growing range of products to sell to its more than m customers The investment required to develop national brands win new customers and retain old ones is too high in an increasingly competitive UK retail sector it says Mr Russell who as Scottish Powers former finance director was closely associated with the previous policy has already withdrawn from joint ventures with Royal Bank of Scotland to provide financial services and with Thus to provide telecommunications The group is also discussing the future of Southern Water its south of England utility which Enel the Italian statecontrolled energy group is interested in buying Crossselling electricity and gas to Southern Water customers let alone other products has been disappointing it admits The group plans to concentrate on developing its energy interests in the UK and US But these also have their difficulties Some of the biggest problems involve PacifiCorp bought months ago in a deal worth about obn including debt The price is looking more expensive following big rises in US electricity wholesale prices PacifiCorp has not been as badly affected as some US electricity groups But it has faced problems because of a power station breakdown in Utah that forced it to buy higher priced electricity from other generators to meet customer demand The failure of a MW generating unit at its Hunter power plant in November has cost the group m om a day since One piece of good news for shareholders today will be the timing of its return to service this month Another positive note is that PacifiCorp is negotiating higher retail prices with US state regulators to offset increased generation charges It also has about MW of its own new power plant due to start production this year In the UK the group is facing increased competition for retail electricity and gas sales particularly in the household market It has also had to absorb big price cuts imposed on its power distribution side by Ofgem the industry regulator The shares which fell p on Wednesday to p have fallen by more than per cent against the FTSE All Share Index since December when the PacifiCorp offer was announced So where does the group go from here It made its reputation in the s as a shrewd acquirer of UK utilities Southern Water for obn and Manweb the northwest of England electricity supplier for obn Effective cost cutting increased value particularly at Manweb The group was also one of the first electricity companies to string telecommunication lines along its electricity pylons The sale of a per cent stake in Thus which operates the telecoms network raised obn in Financing further UK and US acquisitions will be challenging Thus shares have fallen from p a year ago to p on Wednesday night Scottish Power has net debt of some obn with interest thinly covered three times by earnings before tax and interest It has been talking with Enron about buying Portland General its Oregonbased electricity utility The group might need to sell Southern to cover the purchase price of about bn including debt Buying in the UK may be even harder Scottish Power has been outbid recently for regional electricity suppliers by the deeper pockets of large continental European utilities

there with the Enrons and Reliant Energies of the world the other power generators that sell electricity to the utilities is a company called National Energy Group It has power plants in states and controls a natural gas pipeline to Northern California And its owned by PGE Corp the parent company of PGE Co Try to keep up with me here PGE Co is the company that has been so devastated by Californias energy deregulation debacle Its the company to which you are writing monthly checks that are beginning to resemble your mortgage payment It is the company that for decades was guaranteed a profit by the rates set by the states Public Utilities Commission It is the company that said it lost billions before it declared bankruptcy last month Poor PGE Co PGE Corp on the other hand is squatting in tall cotton as my daddy used to say The Corp received more than billion from the Co from according to a PUC audit But the Corp says it wouldnt be fair if it had to put any of that money back into the Co its ailing subsidiary It wants the people whose utility bills created that profit to pay higher bills now to bail out the Co so the Corp can avoid bankruptcy of its own Who is being unfair Meanwhile Southern California Edison also has been shipping its profits also more than billion at last report to its parent company while looking to the state for a bailout Now Gov Gray The Generator Davis wants the taxpayers of this state to pay billion to Southern California Edison for that utilitys transmission system But as far as I can tell Edisons rate payers already paid to build maintain and operate that system with rates set by the PUC that guaranteed that company a profit Now were being asked to buy what those ratepayers built I know that PGEs and Edisons accountants and

and scream Call Coursey at or email LNG carriage to be preserve of Indiaflag ships Lloyds List International Copyright C LLoyds List Source World Reporter TM In an attempt to cash in on the liquefied natural gas revolution Indias shipping ministry is pushing through a proposal to restrict the transportation of the gas only to companies registered in India and vessels carrying the Indian flag It would seem that the logic primarily is to ensure that Indian shipping does not get left behind in the LNG transportation race Until now the ministry has managed to get LNG ferried by energy companies on fob basis We hope that this new proposal would give further impetus to Indian bottoms says shipping secretary Michael Pinto We will do all we can to get approval from the committee of secretaries and the Cabinet Since some of the shipping contracts have already been finalised this proposal would only be made applicable to future contracts However shipping experts are extremely doubtful whether the proposal can be implemented The leading Indian shipping companies have neither the funds nor the expertise of carrying LNG and would need the assistance of foreign companies to make the ventures a success A foreign LNG carrier is not going to settle for a minority stake unless the Indian shipper is able to put up his share of the equity which would be quite a handful says Sudhir J Mulji executive vicechairman of Great Eastern Shipping Company and current president of the Indian National Shipowners Association The proposal really does not seem to be feasible For the moment just two major contracts have been signed both involving the stateowned Shipping Corporation of India SCI The first one involves SCI American power major Enron and Mitsui of Japan for the carriage of m tonnes of LNG per annum for Enrons MW mega power project at Dabhol near Ratnagiri in southern Maharashtra SCI had entered into this memorandum of understanding with MOL formerly Mitsui OSK Lines and Atlantic Commercial Finance which is an Enron affiliate However it is only a partner in the consortium with Enron holding a stake and Mitsui OSK the balance The gas will be ferried by the LNG Lakshmi brandnew cu m capacity vessel being constructed in Japan at the Mitsui Shipyard The contract is valid for years from the date of starting However the consortium is registered in the Cayman Islands which is a tax haven and the LNG vessel will carry the flag of Malta SCI has also secured the contract for carrying m tonnes per annum of LNG for the governmentowned pipeline company Petronet LNG The gas is to be ferried from RasGas of Qatar to the companys upcoming LNG terminal at Dahej in Gujarat A similar Petronet terminal but half the size of Dahej is coming up in Kochi Kerala state The transportation contract for this is to be decided later Two other major Indian shipowners who have taken a step towards LNG transportation are Great Eastern Shipping and Essar Shipping The former has formed a consortium with Indian Oil Corporation and Exmar while Essar has joined hands with Malaysia International Shipping Corporation MISC to form a joint venture dedicated to gas transportation The Dollars bn MISC the national shipping line of Malaysia is one of the worlds leading owners and operators of LNG tankers As a listed company on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange MISC has the stateowned petroleum and oil giant Petronas a Fortune company as its largest shareholder with a stake of Our memorandum of understanding has both companies holding an equal equity share in the joint venture said Essar Shippings chief executive Sanjay Mehta However at a later date we may both dilute our stakes equally in favour of a third strategic partner and continue to hold equal equity The final debtequity ratio for the acquisition of the LNG vessels will be decided by the management of the joint venture Shipping secretary Mr Pinto feels that there are many opportunities for Indian companies but is insistent that the tonnage be registered in India so that ancillary business activities in the sector are spurred We will try and secure tax benefits for the shipowners concerned since they badly need to gain the experience management and manpower training in a niche segment he said It would also help in Indian fleet expansion since tonnage has remained virtually stagnant for the last five yearsMichael

Lloyds List International Copyright C LLoyds List Source World Reporter TM With the Shipping Corporation of India taking a major stake in the Petronet LNG Indias maritime industries a high profile SHIRISH NADKARNI ON the final Thursday of March there was a celebration in NeDelhi involving the four members of the consortium that had bagged the Dollars m liquefied natural gas transportation contract of Petronet LNG It is the Japanese custom to celebrate an event like this and only the consortium members and their officials were invited to the function says KM Joseph director bulk carriers and tankers with the Shipping Corporation of India SCI which has a equity stake in the winning partnership The other members of the consortium are Japans MOL formerly Mitsui OSK Lines NYK Line and K Line and the contract involves ferrying m tonnes per annum of LNG from the Middle East to Petronet LNGs terminal at Dahej in Gujarat Two LNG carriers will be involved in the deal each capable of carrying cu m of gas and expected to cost Dollars m each The vessels are to be constructed at Daewoo Shipbuilding Yard in South Korea This was Indias second major LNG transportation deal and SCI the public sector shipping monolith which owns roughly half of the countrys oceangoing fleet of vessels has a stake in both of them as does MOL MOL is a professionally managed company whose cultural ethos is similar to ours says the goateebearded Prabhat Kumar Srivastava SCIs chairman and managing director Our relationship is based on total transparency and trust and we therefore feel comfortable with them There may well be more such tieups in the future The earlier deal was also sealed with MOL which has a stake in a joint venture named Greenfield Shipping Company GSC with US energy major Enron holding the remaining equity The three members will have joint ownership of the cu m LNG carrier LNG Lakshmi now under construction at the Mitsui Heavy Industries shipyard in Japan When ready the vessel will ferry m tpa of LNG from RasGas of Qatar to Enrons megapower facility at Dabhol near Ratnagiri in southern Maharashtra However to return to the Petronet deal The MOLSCI consortium won the coveted contract by quoting a charter hire rate of Dollars per day which was substantially lower than the bids of the two other competing consortia MISCEssar and ExmarGreat Eastern ShippingIndian Oil Corporation The Petronet LNG deal was the most prestigious and important LNG shipping project in the country and we were very keen to secure it says Mr Srivastava So we told our Japanese partners to quote the best possible rates A stake in the consortium formed with Enron may only be sufficient to net SCI a boardroom presence in GSC but its stake in the Petronet LNG shipping venture will allow the shipping major to exercise much more power on the latter companys board There are other issues involved If we had not emerged winners in Petronets shipping deal it would have done us a lot of harm for the other LNG shipping projects that are fast coming up in the country says Mr Srivastava We have already made tremendous headway in LNG shipping by being part of the Dabhol project and we were very keen to maintain the momentum Experts rate SCI as one of the best managed public sector enterprises and the bottom line of the company reinforces this feeling For the first nine months of the financial year SCI had a sales turnover of Rsbn Dollars m which was better than the Rsbn recorded for the corresponding nine months of the previous year The net profit zoomed from Rsm during the period April to December to Rsbn for the same nine months of While the results for the financial year ended March are still being compiled SCI officials place the sales turnover at around Rsbn and the net profit at just above the Rsbn mark While the companys tankers have produced spectacular results even the lossmaking liner division is expected to turn round the corner We have removed nearly of the nonperforming assets in the division and the balance will be chopped off in the fiscal year says Sudhir S Rangnekar director liner shipping division Recently international consultants Pricewaterhouse Coopers PwC carried out a SWOT analysis for SCI They suggested a corporate transformation of the company apart from going ahead with the information technology initiatives taken earlier The company went ahead and signed a memorandum of understanding with the ministry of shipping for the financial year whereby two new criteria will be used for judging the organisations performance A new criterion corporate transformation project implementation has been introduced in the MoU reflecting the emphasis that we are placing on enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations says Mr Rangnekar It also reflects our keenness to develop greater customer focus through process redesigning and improvement and adoption of the latest IT systems and applications

FERCS LATEST REFUND ORDERS Foster Electric Report c Copyright Foster Associates Inc About the same time that PGE Corp and Edison International announced combined writeoffs of nearly billion in unrecovered purchased power costs four major California energy suppliers reported increases ranging from percent to percent in firstquarter revenues Meanwhile FERC has issued new refund orders requiring many of these same generators to justify in overcharges during March PGE and Southern California Edison Cos WriteOffs After a long delay PGE and Edison during the middle of April confirmed what many knew was coming huge writeoffs for unrecovered purchased power costs during the year Edison announced that it was writing off billion in undercollected power costs for the year leaving the company with a billion loss for the year Edison chief John Bryson was hopeful nevertheless that a recent memorandum of understanding MOU his company signed with the state will allow Edison to recover some of those costs and help keep its Southern California Edison Co SoCal Edison affiliate out of bankruptcy Prompt implementation of the MOU can avoid the large costs of a SoCal Edison bankruptcy and make it possible for the company to restore its financial health and ability to maintain a reliable power grid said Bryson in a statement accompanying Edisons financial results Whether Brysons hope for quick implementation of the MOU will be realized is questionable Gov Gray Davis has been having a hard time finding the necessary legislative support for the proposal and to date has been unable even to find a legislator to sponsor a bill to implement the MOU Instead several state legislators are exploring alternatives including having the state buy SoCal Edisons transmission assets as well as the whole utility and turn it into a state power agency Edisons northern California neighbor PGE Corp reported a strong growth in revenues for led by the strong performance of its energy trading unit but that revenue growth was completely offset by the billion in losses incurred by its now bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric Co utility subsidiary While standard accounting rules required the utility to record a charge against earnings for unreimbursed wholesale and transition costs taking this charge does not diminish our conviction that the utility is entitled under law to recover these costs nor does it diminish our ongoing lawsuit in federal district court said PGE Corp chief Robert Glynn Generators FirstQuarter Revenue Reports In sharp contrast with PGEs and Edisons financial performance the parent companies of four of Californias largest generators reported large jumps in firstquarter revenues Enron Corp reported revenues of billion a whopping percent increase from a year earlier The company owns only a small amount of wind generation in California but sells power into the state through its Portland General Electric subsidiary and is an energy trader in the state Enrons commodity sales and service unit showed a percent increase in firstquarter earnings Reliant Energy Inc saw firstquarter earnings jump percent to billion The companys wholesale energy business unit produced million in operating income for the first quarter up sharply from the million loss the company reported a year earlier Reporting a slightly lower but still a substantial percent jump in firstquarter revenues was Dynegy Inc Of the companys billion in revenues for the period its marketing and trading subsidiary realized million in earnings nearly double the in earnings reported a year earlier The parent company reported a percent jump in first quarter earnings over the previous year Duke Energy Corp announced a percent boost in firstquarter revenues to billion led by a percent increase in earnings by wholesale energy unit FERCs Refund Order Similar to separate orders regarding January and February power sales in California FERC on issued a notice demanding that three generators justify in combined power sales during March FERC staff set a MWh proxy clearing price for the month and then applied it to the hours of Stage power alerts that were declared during March in California The staffs proxy prices for January and February were MWh and MWh respectively The clearing prices fluctuations can be attributed to changes in operating costs including fuel and emissions credits The latest refund order is the smallest of the three asking for cost support for just in transactions while the previous two orders cited a combined million in potential overcharges The three wholesale sellers being questioned by the current refund order Dynegy Power Marketing Inc Mirant California Mirant Delta and Mirant Portrero and Williams Energy Services Corp were named in the previous orders as well Once again Dynegy led the pack with the largest amount of potential refunds for March nearly Combined with the previous two orders the company is on the hook for more than

against power suppliers alleging they conspired to raise prices and boost profits while subjecting consumers to higher bills and rolling blackouts The county is the first to join the suit originally filed by San Francisco in January The suit seeks refunds for consumers of more than billion in alleged excess electricity profits The San Francisco suit contains significant allegations of manipulation and collusion by the wholesalers resulting in the disastrous consequences were all familiar with said lead deputy county counsel Alan Tieger We looked at the evidence on which those allegations were grounded and found they were indeed supported by the evidence expert and otherwise The suit names a dozen electricity generating and marketing companies including Duke Energy and Enron Energy Marketing Similar claims have been filed by three water districts in the San Diego area and two classaction lawsuits by private attorneys on behalf of consumers are pending against power

profiting mightily during Californias energy crisis Calpine said it earned million in the first three months of the year compared with million in the same period last year That profit level on billion in revenue puts Calpine in league with industries such as computer sales and securities brokering in terms of median return on revenue and far above the median annual return in the energy industry

firstquarter profit of million more than double its results one year ago AES reported gains yesterday of percent Other energy companies with business in California including Reliant and Enron have reported huge gains in recent days Calpine executives yesterday sought to distinguish themselves from other merchant energy companies in California saying most of the electricity it sells here is under relatively lowcost contracts with the utilities the state and other entities and very little of it is sold in the spot market where prices are often three times as high It is not our business strategy to play in the volatility of the market but to have longterm contracts said Bill Highlander the companys director of public relations Calpine was not among the companies named in a report last month by the California Independent System Operator identifying power concerns that gouged California consumers Calpines stock was hit hard earlier this month when it revealed that it had not set aside reserves to offset more than million in potentially bad debt owed by Pacific Gas Electric Co which filed for bankruptcy protection But Calpines stock was trading near the top of its week high yesterday ending up or percent to close at Ann Curtis Calpines chief financial officer said in an interview yesterday that the company still expects to be paid by PGE since the power it provides under contract to the utilities and the state is much less expensive than if they voided the contract and sold the power on the spot market It makes sense and would be in the best interest of the utility and state to honor the contract Curtis said As it had last quarter Calpines announcement made no mention of runaway wholesale energy costs in California which have severely damaged the states leading utilities and are beginning to hurt the state governments finances Rather Calpine Chief Executive Officer Peter Cartwright in a prepared statement attributed the earnings growth to the continued execution of Calpines strategy to acquire and build lowcost generation facilities in key power markets throughout the US More than half of the companys plants are in California Overall the supplier operates plants nationwide that generate nearly megawatts Calpine is one of the darlings of the energy industry viewed as a model for a new energy company because of its aggressive expansion plans and reliance on relatively clean efficient generation The company is relatively small in the industry with a market capitalization of about billion compared with about billion for an industry giant like Duke Energy of Charlotte NC Calpine is in the midst of a program that is expected by to boost its electricity generation portfolio to megawatts an amount equivalent to more than twice the energy

POWER PLANT PLAN DAVID FLESHLER and JEREMY MILARSKY Staff Writers South Florida SunSentinel Broward Metro B Copyright by the SunSentinel Coconut Creek filed a legal petition with the state Thursday that could stall Enron Corps plans for a power plant in Pompano Beach Attorneys for the city requested an administrative hearing on the states plans to issue an air permit for the plant This could delay the companys plans by six months if it doesnt thwart them altogether Coconut Creek which is downwind from the site is a center of opposition to Enron When Pompano Beach held public hearings on the project condominium complexes in Coconut Creek chartered buses to pack the meeting rooms with opponents The state Department of Environmental Protection already has announced its preliminary intention to issue the permit In its petition the city argues that the state had failed to take into account the cumulative effect of the sources of air pollution in the area These include the North Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant a Florida Power Light Co substation a Broward County landfill the Wheelabrator trash incinerator the Broward County Hazardous Materials Receiving Facility and the Waste Management Transfer Station according to the petition Eric Thode spokesman for Enron disputes the petitions statement that the cumulative effect on air quality has not been considered You have to take it into account when youre assessing air quality and the cumulative impact on air quality he said He said the petition may ruin the companys plans to open the plant by the summer of next year but not its plans to build the plant Well continue to go forward with the project he said Now that the petition has been filed DEP will decide whether to send it to the Division of Administrative Hearings Both sides present their case to a judge who recommends whether the department should issue the permit The department usually follows the recommendations said Alvaro Linero the DEP administrator handling the Enron petition Meanwhile in Deerfield Beach Enron officials made their final pitch to a volunteer committee thats studying their plans for a plant identical to the one proposed for Pompano Beach Company officials promised to build a plant that wouldnt be an eyesore to the subdivisions of Independence Bay and Waterways Steve Rose a traffic expert for Enron said the

MARGARITA Dow Jones Venezuela is forging ahead with plans to develop its natural gas industry through a series of concessions involving both foreign and local companies Industry officials reckon the effort should generate up to billion in investment over the next years The biggest push now underway in the Gasification of the Nation program is the awarding of licenses for the exploration and production of nonoil associated gas in centralwestern Venezuela a zone estimated to contain trillion to trillion cubic feet in reserves Of companies that have qualified for the concessions are foreign The government is also moving to open up offshore exploration and production of free gas in the Paria and Plataforma Deltana regions in waters bordering northeast Venezuela where officials suspect Tcf to Tcf are waiting to be discovered Jose Pacheco vice minister of energy told Dow Jones Newswires that the government wants to start the prequalification process sometime this year Trinidad he said has been aggressively tapping reserves in the area some of which may extend into Venezuela territory The government has been talking with authorities from the island to reach some understanding for the exploitation of the region he said Rafael Ramirez president of Venezuelas gas regulator said stateoil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA EPVZ has allocated million for exploration in the area He noted that industry giants such as Royal DutchShell RD BG Group Plcs British Gas BRG Exxon Mobil Corp XOM Phillips Petroleum Co P El Paso Corp EPG and Enron Corp ENE have already expressed interest in the area Pacheco Ramirez and other industry officials are attending a conference on gas and electricity Fiscal Incentives To Attract Companies Venezuela the worlds third largest oil producer has proven gas reserves of Tcf the eighth largest worldwide About these reserves are nonassociated It produces about six billion cubic feet a day of which goes to various segments of the countrys petroleum industry and is divided between electricity generation petrochemicals production the steel and aluminum industries the cement and manufacturing sectors and residential consumption Industry officials want to raise natural gas production to Bcfd to Bcfd by To meet that goal Venezuela is enticing companies by exempting them from the valueadded tax reducing the income tax for them to from and lowering it a further in they make new investments Royalties will be assessed at Companies interested in participating in the expansion of the natural gas pipeline network are excluded from royalties Ramirez said He noted that official pricing calculations indicate the rate of internal return on transmission and distribution of gas hovers around but could be higher for more efficient companies The latest transmission project underway would connect mainland Venezuela and Margarita Island The approximately kilometer pipeline will cost million Bidding is slated to start in the weeks ahead and the project should be completed by the end of Following Margarita a natural gas pipeline connecting Valencia and Paraguana is planned The network should then expand to the offshore platforms and ultimately link the populated cities across the northern coast to production facilities both inland and offshore Ultimately the transportation network should cover kilometers and extend to Colombia and Brazil The network will cost an estimated billion To turn around what has heretofore been an unprofitable business authorities are planning on economies of scale and dividing the country in four regions that will each include both industrial and residential consumers Pricing of natural gas will rise according to the type of consumer with the lowest tariffs assessed for residential and commercial clients and scale upwards for petrochemical producers the steel electricity and manufacturing industries and others Jorge Depresbiteris director general of Margarita electricity utility Seneca controlled by US CMS Generation Co said the substitution of diesel by natural gas could be viable for the companys bottom line if it is sold at billion British thermal units or less Beyond that the utilitys profitability will be affected Seneca he added is planning ahead for the conversion to natural gas because it is clear the gasification policy is being implemented and theres no turning back Regulatory authorities assured that natural gas will be adequately valued even as greater volumes come on stream and will include adjustments for devaluation in the countrys currency and if necessary for inflation Natural gas processing is yet another area in which newcomers are being invited to participate Overall energy ministry officials figure that natural gas can currently

of the US energy concern Enron Corp was authorized to issue a termination notice to pull out of a billion power project in western India the largest foreign investment in the country a newspaper reported Friday The project has been in trouble since December when the government of Maharashtra state demanded renegotiation of the price being charged for power from the project The board of the Dabhol Power Co the Indian subsidiary of Enron met in London on Wednesday and authorized the companys managing director to issue a preliminary notice to terminate the project billed as the worlds largest natural gas fired power plant The Times of India reported The board has given powers to the management to issue the pretermination notice But the meeting unanimously felt the need of the hour was not to terminate the project but to initiate a renegotiation process Vinay Bansal chairman of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board was quoted as saying by the newspaper Enron officials have

reconciliation period would follow any move by Dabhol Power to issue the termination notice Bansal said Indian lenders present at a meeting with foreign financial institutions in London earlier this week have said they favor renegotiation The state power utility has said it cannot pay Dabhols monthly electricity bills since rates for power have nearly quadrupled That prompted Dabhol to invoke a federal guarantee in February the first time in India that such a federal guarantee was invoked As part of the agreement between the company and the state government the federal government must pay in case of a state default But before the federal government stepped in the state government paid million in outstanding bills Since then the state power utility has confirmed that all pending bills have

Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved DABHOL India AP Workers in yellow helmets scramble up steel girders to fit pipes into place for the worlds largest natural gasfired power plant to be completed off Indias western coast this year by American energy giant Enron Corp But miles away in Bombay government officials say they cannot afford the electricity that Enron is now providing from a naphtha plant at the site and they expect the electricity generated by liquefied natural gas will cost even more Enron is simply unaffordable said Padamsinh Patil energy minister for the state of Maharashtra which includes Bombay The state cannot afford the power so we take less power but still have to pay Enron huge amounts India needs power during the ApriltoOctober hot season the nation had a daily shortfall of nearly megawatts of electricity according to the Center for Monitoring the Indian Economy Enrons naphtha and gas plants at Dabhol will together be able to generate about megawatts but politicians have trouble with the price Aging coal and gasfired plants that have been depreciated can charge about two rupees cents per kilowatt hour while Enrons naphtha plant has been charging to cents Everyone wants to use us to blame for the systemic problem that the state electricity boards in this country sell power for less than it costs them to generate or buy power said K Wade Cline president of Enron India Despite the protests Cline believes that the billion project Indias biggestever foreign investment will go on line at the end of But the companys frustrations are obvious This week the board of the Dabhol Power Co Enrons India subsidiary authorized the companys managing director to issue a preliminary notice that could lead to termination of the power project Enron says it is owed million for power delivered in December and January The February power bill has already been paid and Krishna Rao member of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board said Wednesday the March electricity bill was being paid Rao said renegotiation of the existing contract was the next step The government and DPC have to come together he said The termination notice will have to wait till negotiations actually begin Indian lenders insist it is impossible for Enron to pull out before it makes up the huge amounts already spent They speculate that the companys board is using pressure tactics to ensure timely payments in future An advantage for Enron and the major complaint against it is a unique contract that requires the federal government to pay up in case of default by Maharashtra Another grievance is that the Enron deal requires Maharashtra to pay for electricity even if it doesnt use it Enron invoked the federal guarantee in February when the state utility said it could not afford to pay Dabhol Power But before the national government stepped in state officials paid million in overdue bills The state bailout drew attention to the Enron deal with opponents again raising questions about the cost to be borne for foreign investment and development The debate comes as the government in New Delhi tries to reduce subsidies and sell off stateowned enterprises Enron says federal payment guarantees were essential because few foreign companies were willing to invest when India began opening its economy in the early s Who wanted to come to India at that time Very few companies did said Cline We came along with some others and said were willing to invest because we think India has a bright future Preparing for that future workers at Dabhol clamber around inside an LNG tank that could fit three jets stacked one atop another They weld a steelreinforced dome while others outside drill concrete blocks for the milelong jetty where the LNG tanker Laxmi meaning wealth in Hindi is scheduled to dock in November Enron says LNG is the cleanest and most economical fuel but Bombay politicians have their doubts They point at electricity prices that have increased fourfold which Enron attributes to the rise to the jump in oil prices and a depreciation of the Indian rupee Opponents of the project say the government should have invested in its own power plant instead of tying up with a foreign company Were not against foreign companies but the Enron project is a sure pill for Indias financial collapse said Pradyumna Kaul an antiEnron activist It will bankrupt the nation Both sides should agree to a separation and abort the contract now Enron believes a crackdown on power theft and reduction of waste in transmission and distribution would generate enough money to pay for Dabhols electricity A state governmentappointed committee agreed and this month called for reform of the state power utility that defaulted on its payments to Enron But the fivemember panel also insisted on lower tariffs and urged renegotiating the price agreement Enron chief executive Jeffrey Skilling likened the India situation to the power woes being felt in California The utility offers a fixed rate to their customers and the wholesale costs of electricity have gone up like they have in the US he said from Enron headquarters in Houston The distribution

JonesVenezuela is forging ahead with plans to develop its natural gas industry through a series of concessions involving both foreign and local companies Industry officials reckon the effort should generate up to billion in investment over the next years The biggest push now underway in the Gasification of the Nation program is the awarding of licenses for the exploration and production of nonoil associated gas in centralwestern Venezuela a zone estimated to contain trillion to trillion cubic feet in reserves Of companies that have qualified for the concessions are foreign The government is also moving to open up offshore exploration and production of free gas in the Paria and Plataforma Deltana regions in waters bordering northeast Venezuela where officials suspect Tcf to Tcf are waiting to be discovered Jose Pacheco vice minister of energy told Dow Jones Newswires that the government wants to start the prequalification process sometime this year Trinidad he said has been aggressively tapping reserves in the area some of which may extend into Venezuela territory The government has been talking with authorities from the island to reach some understanding for the exploitation of the region he said Rafael Ramirez president of Venezuelas gas regulator said stateoil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA EPVZ has allocated million for exploration in the area He noted that industry giants such as Royal DutchShell RD BG Group Plcs British Gas BRG Exxon Mobil Corp XOM Phillips Petroleum Co P El Paso Corp EPG and Enron Corp ENE have already expressed interest in the area Pacheco Ramirez and other industry officials are attending a conference on gas and electricity Fiscal Incentives To Attract Companies Venezuela the worlds third largest oil producer has proven gas reserves of Tcf the eighth largest worldwide About these reserves are nonassociated It produces about six billion cubic feet a day of which goes to various segments of the countrys petroleum industry and is divided between electricity generation petrochemicals production the steel and aluminum industries the cement and manufacturing sectors and residential consumption Industry officials want to raise natural gas production to Bcfd to cfd by To meet that goal Venezuela is enticing companies by exempting them from the valueadded tax reducing the income tax for them to from and lowering it a further in they make new investments Royalties will be assessed at Companies interested in participating in the expansion of the natural gas pipeline network are excluded from royalties Ramirez said He noted that official pricing calculations indicate the rate of internal return on transmission and distribution of gas hovers around but could be higher for more efficient companies The latest transmission project underway would connect mainland Venezuela and Margarita Island The approximately kilometer pipeline will cost million Bidding is slated to start in the weeks ahead and the project should be completed by the end of Following Margarita a natural gas pipeline connecting Valencia and Paraguana is planned The network should then expand to the offshore platforms and ultimately link the populated cities across the northern coast to production facilities both inland and offshore Ultimately the transportation network should cover kilometers and extend to Colombia and Brazil The network will cost an estimated billion To turn around what has heretofore been an unprofitable business authorities are planning on economies of scale and dividing the country in four regions that will each include both industrial and residential consumers Pricing of natural gas will rise according to the type of consumer with the lowest tariffs assessed for residential and commercial clients and scale upwards for petrochemical producers the steel electricity and manufacturing industries and others Jorge Depresbiteris director general of Margarita electricity utility Seneca controlled by US CMS Generation Co said the substitution of diesel by natural gas could be viable for the companys bottom line if it is sold at billion British thermal units or less Beyond that the utilitys profitability will be affected Seneca he added is planning ahead for the conversion to natural gas because it is clear the gasification policy is being implemented and theres no turning back Regulatory authorities assured that natural gas will be adequately valued even as greater volumes come on stream and will include adjustments for devaluation in the countrys currency and if necessary for inflation Natural gas processing is yet another area in which newcomers are being invited to participate Overall energy ministry officials figure that natural gas can currently substitute million

the project billed as the worlds largest natural gas fired power plant The Times of India reported The board has given powers to the management to issue the pretermination notice But the meeting

the first of three steps that could end in the abandonment of the billion project A sixmonth reconciliation period would follow any move by the Dabhol Power Company to issue the termination notice Bansal said Indian lenders present at a meeting with foreign financial institutions in London earlier this week have said they favor renegotiation The project has been in trouble since December when the government of Maharashtra state where the Dabhol project is located said the tariffs were exorbitant and demanded a new price agreement The state power utility said it could not pay Dabhols monthly electricity dues which prompted the company to invoke a federal guarantee in February This was the first time in India that a federal guarantee was invoked As part of the agreement between the company and the state government the federal government has to pay in case of a state default But before the federal government stepped in the state government paid million in outstanding bills Since then the state power utility has confirmed that all pending bills have been paid However a dispute over payment of million for December and January bills is pending Several political parties had

set to stay high LNG seems to be back in fashion Financial Times BusinessFinancial Desk Section A While a Utility May Be Failing Its Owner Is Not By By RICHARD A OPPEL Jr and LAURA M HOLSON The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company Pacific Gas and Electric the giant California utility may have just made one of the largest bankruptcy filings in history but it has been a banner year for the rest of its parent company the PG E Corporation In Bethesda Md far from the energy crisis in California another PG E subsidiary National Energy Group earned million last year and ranked as the nations thirdlargest power trader Compensation for the units executives soared Many investors now believe that the subsidiary just a decade in the making is by itself worth more than its yearold utility sibling How did National Energy get so big so fast By using cash partly generated by its sister utility to buy unregulated power plants in the Northeast expand tradingfloor operations and sell power across the country The exact numbers are in dispute but much of Nationals Energys profits last year came from California Most other large utilities have done the same thing over the past decade building national or even global power companies from roots in local monopolies But nowhere is the success of these unregulated businesses more of an issue than in California where PG Es investments may be challenged in bankruptcy court Still such transfers of assets were fundamental to deregulation plans in two dozen states and they were encouraged by federal rules designed to build a new wholesale marketplace in electricity And today the offspring of the nations utilities dominate that market after industry leader Enron Eight of the nations largest power marketers are affiliates or spinoffs of regulated utilities controlling about percent of power trading It is largely these unregulated power producers and traders whose sales of power in California have prompted accusations by state leaders of price gouging and demands for the price caps that federal regulators took their first halting steps toward embracing last week The profitability of the utilities unregulated operations is becoming clear as companies report earnings for the first three months of the year For example Reliant Energy reported that operating income at its unregulated wholesale energy business soared to million in the first quarter or percent more than at its regulated utility which serves Houston This week Reliant expects to spin off its unregulated businesses through an initial public stock offering that would put a market value on the new company of as much as billion more than the rest of Reliant A number of other major utility companies have spinoffs or trading and generation units that now earn nearly as much as or more than their core utility operations These include Duke Energy in Charlotte NC Sempra Energy of San Diego the Southern Company in Atlanta the Constellation Energy Group in Baltimore and Utilicorp United in Kansas City Mo In some places the growth of the unregulated businesses continues to raise questions of fairness particularly where utilities have been permitted to transfer plants to the new units at deep discounts to their market value Critics say that ratepayers whose bills paid for the plants construction should benefit more when the plants are sold In Florida a commission on energy deregulation formed by Gov Jeb Bush has proposed permitting such transfers on the grounds that they are needed to create a new wholesale marketplace Opponents including the Florida Municipal Electric Association which represents utilities owned by local governments say the plan would produce a billion windfall that should go to ratepayers In California some creditors of Pacific Gas and Electric have signaled that they will want the bankruptcy court in San Francisco to review parent PG Es efforts to keep its unregulated businesses out of creditors reach And the California Public Utilities Commission is investigating whether PG E and Edison International whose Southern California Edison utility unit is also near insolvency have improperly transferred cash to their parents and to unregulated sister companies A recent audit ordered by the commission showed that Pacific Gas and Electric transferred billion to PG E from to Most of that went to dividends and stock repurchases but million was invested in other subsidiaries primarily its National Energy Group unit Southern California Edison transferred billion to its parent company between and November a separate audit showed Edison International invested billion in its unregulated Mission Group subsidiaries during the same period Executives of the companies say the transfers were proper Audits have shown that we followed the rules and didnt do anything wrong said PG Es chief executive Robert Glynn We did not ask consumers in California to support any of the losses that occurred in those businesses when we started them up he said Now forcing the unregulated units to support their ailing sister utility he said would be no different than calling up shareholders and saying The California electric bills are pretty high send some money in so we can give it back to them Loretta Lynch the president of the utilities commission took a different view Should we look backward she asked and say Hey wait a minute that corporate structure profited by all of our power payments to them in the past and they should participate in helping us through to get to a solution in the future The cornerstone deal of PG Es unregulated energy business was struck four years ago when it acquired the hydroelectric and fossilfueled generation plants of New England Electric System for billion PG E is now one of the largest generators in the Northeast operating plants that can light up to five million averagesized homes While California officials say Pacific Gas and Electrics woes have been caused at least in part by market manipulation by outofstate generators the Justice Department has been investigating possible market abuses involving PG E and two other companies in New England Mr Glynn said that PG E had done nothing wrong and that the company has responded to Justice Department requests for information Overall PG Es National Energy Group has power plants in states and others under development or construction that include one in Athens NY that is expected to begin supplying electricity to New York City in It also operates an energy trading operation in Bethesda and controls a natural gas pipeline into Northern California To Wall Street the utility companies investments in unregulated businesses were a necessary survival tactic as investors demanded fastergrowing profits The stock market was going like gangbusters and the utilities returns of percent werent cutting it said Richard Cortright a utility analyst at Standard and Poors the bond rating agency Moreover as deregulation loomed industry executives saw no choice but to make new investments It looked like the utility opportunity was going to start shrinking Mr Glynn said Consumer groups question whether utilities would have invested more in improving basic service if they had not had the option of putting money elsewhere Mike Florio a lawyer with The Utility Reform Network a consumer group in San Francisco cited findings last year by state regulators that from to Pacific Gas Electric spent nearly million less on maintaining electric and gas facilities than had been factored into its rates Separately in the utility agreed to pay about million to settle charges that consumers were endangered because it failed to trim trees near highvoltage power lines Several hundred million dollars didnt get spent for maintenance and that ultimately falls to the bottom line as profit Mr Florio said Mr Glynn said the utility had always spent appropriate sums on maintenance coming within onehalf of one percent of the amount built into rates over a year period In the big picture he said it was hard to see how PG E had been a winner in deregulation even before its utilitys humiliating bankruptcy If you look at what happened the net of it was a loss Mr Glynn said because the value leaked out on the regulated utility side faster than we were able to build it on the nonregulated side

since the state government had not shown any serious interest in dissolving the difficult situation DPC and its international lenders were not in favour of continuing the project When contacted the DPC refused to comment The fate of DPCs MW project which is per cent complete hangs in the balance since the Indian financial institutions FIs led by the Industrial and Development Bank of India IDBI have stopped funding the debt portion of the project with around per cent of the US billion worth of total disbursement already pumped in Naturally we have stopped disbursement because we think that

without interference from state governments Sanjeev Goenka President CII told PTI There are lessons to be learnt from Enronthe premise on which the agreement was based was faulty We should not have had a counterguarantee clause in the agreement he said Expressing confidence that the issue would be resolved soon Goenka said even if Enron decides to pull out it will have no impact on private investment in the sector He said no fresh investments have come in because of Enron Investments will come only if investors are confident of getting viable returns Blaming poor confidence and low returns for lack of private sector investment in power sector Goenka said the present policy of cross subsidisation had placed an extra burden on the power companies and rendered them uncompetitive Goenka said the state electricity boards SEBs should be privatised and restructured to improve distribution and cut transmission losses In reference to privatisation of stateowned BALCO the CII chief

President James Wolfensohn has said his organisation did not have a magic formula for regional contracting in power projects and renegotiation of contracts like Enronpromoted Dabhol Power Company in Maharashtra may not be needed in future as public opinion is more alert to details of the contracts Wolfensohn made the remarks when an Indian correspondent asked him at a news conference whether the World Bank could aid developing countries to negotiate the right kind of contracts to avoid the kind of problems now confronting the DPC I think we have been helpful with a lot of the Governments in terms of rationalizing the power issue It is not just pricing The issue is also line transmission losses which have been tremendous in many of the countries he said I dont think we have a magic formula for regional contracting said Wolfensohn adding but I would say it has come into prominence more in recent years on both negotiation of contracts and on the establishment of pricing US analysts have noted that Dabhol rates and the Pakistani rates are very much higher than even in the United States where labour is much more expensive What he sees going on today the World Bank chief

Investor Time to sail Indira Vergis Business Standard Copyright c Business Standard Indias largest shipping company Shipping Corporation of India SCI has been attracting growing interest from analysts of late The main reasons include higher freight rates and the strong possibility of the government offloading its stake in SCI this financial year The government holds per cent of SCI stock and is aiming to divest upto per cent Indeed the plans for disinvesment are being viewed as a powerful trigger that can send its stock price soaring Swinging fortunes The shipping industry holds all the promise and perils of a cyclical industry When it comes to growth prospects for shipping companies much hinges on the level of activity in world trade and shipping tonnage Nearly per cent of Indias external trade moves by sea Major products transported include crude oil petroleum products iron ore steel and grains Mighty force With its army of ships in its fleet boasting million tonnes in dead weight tonnage dwt staterun SCI represents a powerful force in the Indian shipping industry It accounts for nearly per cent of the countrys total operating tonnage Sailing behind are private competitors like GE Shipping Essar and Varun Shipping Ships can be broadly classified into tankers and bulk carriers Tankers include crude carriers carrying crude oil product carriers for transporting other liquid cargo like petroleum products and chemicals carriers Bulk cargo carriers move dry cargo like ores and grains As on April crude carriers made up nearly per cent of SCIs gross registered tonnagegrt while product carriers accounted for around per cent Bulk carriers took up nearly per cent Better times ahead After weathering stormy waters in the past few years the shipping industry seems ready to chart higher growth in calmer climate propelled by higher freight rates Over the past year freight rates have climbed on an average per cent in the tankers market to around Similarly in the dry bulk segment the Baltic Freight Index the most widelywatched global indicator of spot dry bulk rates is still floating at levels after having peaked at levels in September While it has slipped from the levels a year ago analysts expect the index to remain perched around these levels For many these are signs of better fortunes for shipping companies like SCI We expect freight rates to stay firm in probably just marginally lower from current levels says PKSrivastava chairman and managing director SCI Restructuring helps SCI has also made some restructuring efforts It includes attempts to prune business segments seen to be a drag on company profits like the liners division Over the past year the company has found buyers for vessels half of them liners This definitely helps them improve profits and cash flows says Deepak Agrawal analyst at kotakstreetcom The selling of old ships however is a recurring theme in shipping operations These sales not only improve cash flows but also lift some burden off operating costs In SCIs case it accounts for nearly per cent of the sales This cash can also be employed in the tanker business Agarwal adds In another step SCI is also thrashing out the details of a voluntary retirement scheme for employees It has more than employees on its roster In addition heeding consulting house Pricewaterhouse CoopersPwC recommendations it is also turning to information technology to improve operational efficiency However PwCs suggestion that SCI be split into three separate companies has been rejected by the government The restructuring moves are having a positive impact on the company says Agarwal Winds of change Experts say that certain emerging global trends will also influence future operations of SCI For one international maritime laws can lead to a supply dip in large carriers like tankers The International Maritime Organisation IMO regulations could see the supply of tankers coming under slight pressure agrees Agrawal The IMO has asked the global shipping industry to gradually phase out single hull tankers and embrace newer double hull tankers seen as more environmentconscious As scrapping of old design tankers gathers pace the nature of shipbuilding will ensure that they wont be replaced immediately Industry sources say that it takes roughly three years to build and operate large carriers like tankers The impending imbalance in tanker demand and supply also seems reason enough for some to believe that freight rates for the segment will remain pegged at higher levels Besides production pattern changes in Indias oil industry a major client for the shipping sector are also engineering changes in some segments Improved oil refining capacity in the country is already signalling declining demand for product tankers carrying petroleum products On the other hand demand for crude tankers is slated to rise as demand for crude surges to feed increased refining capacity India imports nearly per cent of its total requirements of crude oil In SCI was the countrys largest carrier of crude bringing in per cent of the total requirements of the staterun and joint venture oil companies There is also growing evidence that more consumers are shifting smaller breakbulk cargoes into containers Industry watchers say that this rate of containerisation of cargo is set to quicken Container shipping forms slightly more than half the worlds cargo shipping yet currently forms just under three per cent of SCIs grt It is a very important segment for us next only to the LNG segment says Srivastava Howeverhe adds we are looking more at alliances in this segment and not additional capital expenditure here The brightest spot One opportunity that experts forecast will be a revenuegrosser for the Indian shipping industry in the coming years is the budding demand for natural gas With demand expected to far outstrip local supplies the government is already considering legislation for the transportation and import of liquefied natural gasLNG SCI with its Mitsui OSK Linesled consortium has already edged ahead of rivals in this arena by clinching a million deal with Petronet LNG to build and operate two LNG carriers by It has also formed a joint venture with US energy giant Enron Corp and Mitsui for a vessel to transport LNG from the Middle East to Enrons subsidiary Dabhol Power Company by the end of But the current imbroglio over whether Enron wants to continue operations in India or pull out does put a question mark on the contract Besides in a bid to strengthen fleet size SCI has also placed orders worth Rs crore to build four Aframax tankers in South Korea and an LR tanker in Cochin In fiscal we are looking at acquiring ships says Srivastava While the company has a stash of Rs crore in reserves it often turns to domestic and international financial markets to finance its fleet expansion Recently it raised million Rs crore in external commercial borrowings at basis points above the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR In fiscal total debt for the shipping firm stood at Rs crore Financials The benefits of restructuring accompanied by buoyant freight rates were reflected in SCIs financial performance last year For the nine months ending December operations generated Rs crore in sales jumping per cent from the yearago period But net profit zoomed a mindboggling per cent to Rs crore from Rs crore in the same period last year Cost cutting measures contained total expenditure It rose just per cent to Rs crore from Rs crore Operating margins added basis points to per cent from per cent Slicing costs further were declining interest payments at Rs crore compared to Rs in the same period last year Depreciation costs rose marginally from Rs crore to Rs crore But lower interest and depreciation figures did translate into a hefty tax bill of Rs crore double the figure it paid in the yearago period In fiscal return on net worth stood at per cent Valuations An overwhelming chunk of shares in the hands of the government has often deterred investors from trading in SCI stock Yet the stock remains noteworthy since it has turned in a better performance than the benchmark BSE Sensex Over fiscal while the Sensex sunk per cent SCIs stock handed out a stunning per cent return to shareholders Starting out at Rs in March it more than doubled to Rs twelve months later And thats still per cent off the year high of Rs witnessed in February Analysts continue to remain positive on the stock Significantly at Rs the stock quotes at just around half its book value of Rs Trading at just six times its earnings the share still offers good value Godbole to head DPC renegotiation panel Renni Abraham MUMBAI Business Standard Copyright c Business Standard With the Madhav Godbole committee along with a central government representative to conduct the renegotiation in the Dabhol Power Company DPC project for effecting reductions in the latters power tariffs and restructuring the Power Purchase Agreement PPA the ball is now in the power majors court The Godbole committees recommendations with regards to the renegotiation process were arrived at unanimously an aspect that its chairman confirmed to Business Standard on Sunday Godbole however stated that he was yet to receive any official intimation of his appointment on renegotiating team Maharashtras energy minister Padmasinh Patil however confirmed that the Godbole Committee would renegotiate the DPC project and said The chief minister would be announcing the names officially on Monday We are now hopeful of a speedy negotiation process to resolve the DPC imbroglio Godbole when asked how long the renegotiation process would take said I would have to see the stand taken by Enron on the issue of renegotiations before commenting on this issue With the government deciding to sustain the resolution process with the same team Godbole Committee the recommendations made by it would for all purposes set the benchmark for the renegotiation process Godbole told Business Standard As far as the restructuring of the PPA and other recommendations made by the committee with regards to the DPC project are concerned there was unanimity among all the members The committees report notes The exact terms need to be agreed between the contracting parties but in the committees opinion unless the negotiations proceed on these broad guidelines and various parties make concessions of this magnitude the ultimate result is likely to be as infructuous as the earlier renegotiations in The concessions recommended by the committee include the seperation of the LNG facility It is critical that the cost of this facility be distributed over its entire capacity and not just over the amount sold to the power plant the LNG facility be seperated into a distinct facility whose capital costs are reflected in the fuel charge not as take or pay but only in proportion to the extent of fuel regasified for power generation compared to the total regasification capacity Also recommended are renegotiation of the LNG supply and shipping agreements converting the tariff into twoparts removal of all dollar denomination in the fixed charge component and financial restructuring of DPC and cancellation of escrow agreement amongst other things Meanwhile president of Enron Indian Wade Kline when contacted offered no comments on the DPC issue Industrial Management ENERGY DENMARK INHERITS THE WIND The tiny country now leads the world in windmill technology By William Echikson in Ringkobing Denmark with Janet Ginsburg in Chicago Business Week B Copyright McGrawHill Inc Gabled redbrick farmhouses dot the gently rolling green fields of the Jutland peninsula on Denmarks west coast Its a scene straight out of a Hans Christian Andersen fairy taleexcept for one prominent feature Rising stories are spaceage white towers topped with giant threebladed propellers that span feet Windmills have been part of Denmarks landscape for centuriesbut not like these and never with so much economic impact Many of our farmers make more money out of power generation than farming says Johannes Poulsen managing director of Vestas Wind System Vestas leads a cluster of companies that have made tiny Denmark population million the worlds top producer and exporter of windmills For Denmark wind power is a fairy tale come true Not only does the wind industry supply about of Denmarks power but Danish companies currently control about of the billion global windmill market and their share is increasing Whats more the market itself has been growing by to a year since the late s creating a tidy windfall for the manufacturers Vestas for example has seen its stock rise twentyfold in three years Revenues grew by last year to million and profits hit million Wind is the great energy success story of the last decade says Roderick Bridge an analyst at HSBC Investment Bank in London FLAWED POLICY The US could have played a bigger role American companies began to build the first generation of truly modern windmills in the early s armed with Carterera tax credits aimed at promoting green energy The credits got the industry off the ground but the policy was flawed Both the Federal government and California offered tax credits only for the installation of windmills not for operating and maintaining them So when the windmills broke down they were often simply left to rust After energy prices fell and funding for wind programs under Ronald Reagan contracted the US gave up its lead in wind technology It was Uncle Sam that birthed the industry then lost it to the rest of the world laments James Dehlsen founder of US turbine maker Zond Corp which was sold later to Houstonbased Enron Corp Denmarks public policy has been more consistent and was better conceived from the start The government chose to pay windmill owners abovemarket prices for their power subsidizing upkeep and investment in new technology The original California system encouraged doctors and dentists to buy wind turbines says Vestas Poulsen but our wind producers have much more of an incentive to care whether they work Another difference From the beginning Danish windmill makers knew they needed to export Our small home market gives us no choice says Per Hornung Pedersen chief financial officer at the secondlargest Danish producer NEG Micon This early export focus gave the Danes a leg up on big competitors in Germany and Spain Wise technology choices helped the Danes build on the generous government support While US manufacturers working with aerospace technology concentrated on lightweight materials that were efficient but fragile Danish companies started off as heavyduty farm machinery makers The original Danish turbines were more than twice the weight of comparable American turbines and proved much more durable recalls Birger T Madsen managing director of Denmarkbased BTM Consult a leading wind power consultancy Gradually the Danes improved the efficiency of their devices Where early models were outfitted with kilowatt generators todays models can churn out as much as of megawatts enough to power homes Larger and megawatt machines are under developmentsome of them destined for offshore environments where the wind is reliable but storms waves and salty conditions demand unprecedented ruggedness And improvements in computerized control systems are helping turbines squeeze out more watts from the wind more efficiently The best windmills now can produce a kilowatthour of electricity for about centshalf the cost of five years ago and approaching the price of power generated by gasfired plants Still the wind business must overcome some giant hurdles starting with political risks In the US a tax credit for wind power comes up for congressional renewal this December at a time when President George W Bush is pushing for a cut in federal funding for renewable power and conservation programs And even though wind power is increasingly cost competitive many wouldbe windmill operators in both the US and Europe still need subsidies to win longterm financing So if the tax credit isnt renewed the Danes largest market could blow away LITTLE SECRET Critics contend that the subsidies themselves are a problem They argue that wind power will never prove its merit until the artificial tax credits and price supports on both sides of the Atlantic are removed The Danish government pays more than million to wind generators every year Partly as a result of those high subsidies the Danes pay the highest rates for electricity in the world argues Brian OConnell author of a book critical of renewable energy policies Skeptics have other objections as well Birds sometimes get chopped in the turbines And people who live near wind farms often say they are an eyesore But the biggest problems are intrinsic Windmills only produce when the wind is up and for now there is no way to store the surplus electricity Until that issue is resolved BTM Consult figures wind systems could supply a maximum of about a third of global electricity demand Thats much more than now but with solar and other renewables lagging far behind the difference would still have to be made up by fossil fuels At least some of winds liabilities may eventually be solved Powerstorage technologies are in development in laboratories around the world And while the US has officially repudiated the Kyoto Protocol which called for dramatic cuts in carbon emissions other governments are likely to encourage more wind power as part of the effort to reduce greenhouse gases The European Union for one has set targets for a fivefold growth of renewable energy by Worldwide the Danes face growing competition from ABB The giant SwedishSwiss power company recently announced a novel type of gearless windmill that converts turbine rotation to energy by means of a magnetrun transformerless highvoltage generator Since the gearbox is often a source of trouble ABBs gearless device could make a big splash in the market Nevertheless many analysts believe the Danes have a comfortable edge NEG Micon recently raised million in fresh financing and is expected to report a profit for Its stock has more than tripled over the past year yielding a market cap up to billion Vestas market cap is billion and privately held companies report soaring sales Already the windmill business has revived rural Jutlands economy which previously struggled along on shipbuilding fishing and farming When the shipyard in the town of Ringkobing went broke in Vestas converted the facilities to make windmills Now its expanding the site and has doubled its workforce to in the past five years All the shipyard workers got jobs here says Vestas welder Thomas Knudsen Wind power may look like an anachronism But its gaining ground more quickly than other renewable sources It may well turn

Business Week EU Copyright McGrawHill Inc When President Bush discarded the Kyoto Protocolan international agreement to cut emissions of carbon dioxide and other globalwarming gaseshe blamed the decision on a slowing US economy and an energy crisis The idea of placing caps on CO does not make economic sense for America Bush said on Mar Some of the worlds largest companies disagree DuPont for example has already made substantial cuts in its greenhousegas emissions and says it will continue to do so despite the Administrations reluctance The announcements around Kyoto dont change our resolve says Paul Tebo corporate vicepresident for safety health and environment at DuPont Why Because the companys environmental program pays off in enhanced shareholder value says Tebo You cant measure this to the penny but it is very real Corporate reputation is a very valuable part of our company GOOD SENSE DuPont is not alone On Apr the Business Roundtable proposed various solutions to the globalwarming problem in a report titled Unleashing Innovation The Right Approach to Global Climate Change Earnest W Deavenport chairman and chief executive of Eastman Chemical Co who chaired the Business Roundtables environment task force said the report represents the business communitys interest in being part of the solution to concerns about global climate change Increasingly corporations are deciding to join efforts to curb global warming because the strategy makes good business sense Others include BP Amoco Royal DutchShell Ford and General Motorsall companies that would be expected to fight limits on greenhousegas emissions Until recently these four companies were members of the Global Climate Coalition a group formed to oppose mandatory limits on greenhouse emissions All have pulled out BP and Shell arent stopping with that gesture They have joined two dozen other companiesincluding Alcoa Enron GeorgiaPacific and Toyotain a new group called the Pew Center on Global Climate Change The center brings companies together to search for solutions to the globalwarming problem I think they are convinced that at one time or another there will be regulation of greenhouse gases because this is a real problem says Pew Center President Eileen Claussen Its difficult to know whether the companies will keep their resolve when the time comes to act on their pledges to cut emissions Some of them however have already begun to act BP and Shell for example have each established internal emissionstrading schemes The idea is to reduce emissions more than necessary where it is economical to do so creating emissions permits to be sold to other units within the company If emissions trading among companies becomes a reality BP and Shell unlike their competitors will already know how to use it to their advantage The Big Three auto makers have likewise jumped ahead of regulators with a game of oneupsmanship to boost vehicle mileage Ford Motor Co took the lead in when it publicly promised to improve the fuel economy of all its SUVs by over five years General Motors Corp promised to beat Fords improvements And DaimlerChrysler has just joined the game saying it will meet or beat any Ford SUV fueleconomy gains These moves represent a significant change in corporate behavior So far it has been mostly promises But if those promises arent kept environmental groups which are watching very closely will do their best to stage a public flogging The Bush Administration with its narrow view of the worlds energy problems sees boosts in oil exploration and production as nonnegotiable goals Cheap energy is good for the economy and boosting supply is one way to help bring down prices But the Administration has given no hint that it perceives global warming as a serious problem And such a stance carries a risk While some uncertainty remains about the consequences of global warming the overwhelming evidence suggests that the phenomenon is real The probusiness

Report And the Winners Are Six European Schools Rank Among Worlds Top MBA Programs By Ronald Alsop and Edward Taylor Staff Reporters The Wall Street Journal Europe Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Six European institutions rank among the worlds best business schools in a new Wall Street Journal survey of corporate recruiters In a result thats sure to surprise many business schools and students alike ESADE of Spain INSEAD of France and IMD of Switzerland beat such elite American institutions as Columbia University the University of California at Los Angeles and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology The other European schools in the top are London Business School of the UK and Instituto de Empresa and IESE of Spain The Tuck School at Dartmouth College the worlds first graduate school of business ranks No in the Journals first survey of MBA recruiters Darmouth beat out such institutions as Harvard University Stanford University and the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania Recruiters who rated the schools in an online survey praised Dartmouths small collegial MBA program for producing general managers who make loyal team players For more on Dartmouth see the story on page Close behind Dartmouth in second and third place were two other small MBA programs with fewer than fulltime students Carnegie Mellon Universitys Graduate School of Industrial Administration and Yale Universitys School of Management Both received high marks for their students teamwork strengths and analytical and problemsolving skills The rankings are based on a survey conducted last fall by Harris Interactive Inc in which recruiters rated schools they knew from firsthand experience The survey reached people in the field doing the actual recruiting the heads of business units line managers and others not just the humanresources executives stationed at corporate headquarters Each school was ranked on factors that influence a recruiters decision to visit a particular campus and hire a particular graduate such as the careerservices office the core curriculum and students leadership potential and teamwork skills In addition a schools final ranking took into account its mass appeal based on the number of recruiters who rated it Theres no question that all of the schools in the study offer quality MBA programs But The Wall Street JournalHarris Interactive study of MBA programs is the only major survey that focuses exclusively on the opinions of recruiters the buyers of MBA talent Consider it a consumers ranking of MBA programs with results that differ considerably from those in other businessschool guides The MBA programs outside the US made a strong showing in the survey representing nearly of the ranked business schools Thats especially impressive because of the recruiters rated only US schools selected nonUS schools only and selected both American and nonUS schools The MBA degree an American creation is being offered by more universities and their graduates appeal to multinational companies seeking managers with a strong international perspective Canada claims the highestranked nonUS school the University of Western Ontario in nd place while the six European schools are joined by one in Mexico and a second one in Canada Theres a very good showing of nonUS schools in the survey says Joy Sever a senior vice president at Harris Interactive For some of the schools it may have been the first time they had been approached to participate in a ranking Moreover she says peoples assumptions about whats best needs to be thought about in a different way given that several European schools outranked some American heavyweights Indeed the one of the biggest surprises of the survey is the mixed reviews garnered by the big prestigious business schools Some of the titans including Northwestern the University of Chicago and Harvard ranked in the top But Wharton placed only th and Columbia University MIT and Stanford finished much further down in the rankings Recruiters complained that graduates of some of the most prominent schools expect too much too soon in terms of salary and position and are difficult to retain for very long Not a single school in the Western US made it into the top The toprated school in the West the Haas School of Business at the University of California Berkeley placed st In fact recruiters say they have stopped visiting some of the California schools especially Stanford because their graduates are simply unwilling to leave the sunshine and Silicon Valley behind Business schools in California also lagged behind the other schools on students leadership potential their general management point of view and recruiter satisfaction with the careerservices office What school is best depends on the recruiters needs says recruiter Laura Barker Morse at venturecapital firm Atlas Venture The Bostonbased recruiting principal has recruited for earlystage technology companies in the US and Europe for more than years choosing students from Harvard Stanford MIT Berkeley Wharton Columbia and INSEAD because they met certain needs We want to be helpful to our fast growing companies So for a strong technology and business orientation in Europe we tend to go to INSEAD which uses the casestudy method patterned after Harvard Ms Barker Morse says But for European companies we also go out of our way to get to know the Europeans who attend US schools What set the top schools apart from the rest For one thing they significantly outscored the others on five specific attributes teaching analytical and problemsolving skills recruiters past success with the quality of graduates hired from that school the schools preparation of students for the New Economy graduates strategic thinking and chemistry or general good feelings about the school Many of the topranked schools also received high scores for their graduates communication and interpersonal skills which nine out of recruiters said they consider very important Jeff Puzas a manager at the consulting firm PRTM in Washington DC has recruited at both Harvard and Carnegie Mellon and believes Carnegie Mellon has the edge in analytical and technical skills while graduates of Harvard excel in interpersonal communication Interpersonal skills are like a sixth sense and have been highly underrated as a differentiating factor for students says Mr Puzas a Carnegie Mellon graduate Most of what I do every day as a management consultant has to do with interpersonal skills not my IQ The need for companies to effectively communicate with clients means Elena Florez Spanish recruiting coordinator for American Management Systems Inc in Madrid recruits mainly from IESE the International Graduate School of Management in Barcelona and Instituto de Empresa in Madrid In Spain not many people speak English so we need people who can understand the language and culture she says Being small clearly was a virtue for many of the business schools in the survey Half of the top schools and of the top report fulltime MBA enrollments of fewer than students In general recruiters say they find graduates of small MBA programs more collaborative and personable than their counterparts at large schools Paolo Raffaelli key account manager at Guidant Corp a US developer of cardiovascular products says smaller schools like Switzerlands IMD with a class size of around students offer a more intimate studying environment This allows faculty to observe each student more closely he says As one survey respondent remarks about Switzerlands IMD theres a real focus on getting students a great job that is a really good fit Another respondent Julie Hamrick president of Ignite Sales a fouryearold Internet marketing firm in Dallas has visited business schools of all sizes But we find time and time again betterprepared students at the small schools theyre less theoretical more handson she says They also seem more teamoriented and its critically important that you can rely on every member of the team in a startup like mine Adds a recruiter who has hired students from IMD Small is clearly stronger Ms Hamrick scouts for MBA talent at her alma mater Southern Methodist University which ranked ninth in the survey and has a fulltime MBA enrollment of She also has recruited at Dartmouth with fulltime students and found that in many ways it epitomizes the smallschool environment The studentfaculty ratio is to team projects figure heavily in the curriculum and many students live in campus dorms and belong to school hockey teams and ski groups in remote snowy Hanover New Hampshire You have to get along at a small business school like Tuck theres no place to hide says Bill Sones a consultant for a software company in Boston who received his MBA degree from Yale in The student and alumni networks are very closeknit at Dartmouth and Yale Students arent out for No as much you dont have to watch your back But a small class size can sometimes work against a school Lucy Barry head of recruitment for Londonbased strategy consultants LEK Consulting recruits more people from Fontainebleaubased INSEAD than IMD in Lausanne Its a numbers game says Ms Barry We are more likely to find a candidate at a school with a larger class size particularly if there are a large number of recruiters INSEAD has nearly MBA students in Fontainebleau and Singapore The businessschool survey included an academics section in which recruiters nominated schools they considered exceptional in certain fields of study Three schools placed first in two different academic disciplines Wharton for accounting and finance Stanford for ecommerce and entrepreneurship and Harvard for general management and strategy But academic reputation had surprisingly little bearing on recruiters overall rankings of the schools Faculty and curriculum were among the leastsignificant factors in the survey That helps explain why some of the academic starts didnt dazzle recruiters and didnt necessarily receive a top ranking In the finer academic institutions virtually of the faculty are PhDs says Jack Bragin of the recruiting firm Michael Page International Inc But students can benefit from professors who are more streetwise and have more realworld experience Many recruiters said they find it especially difficult to compete for graduates from some of the academic elite That may change amid the economic slowdown as the job market eases But at the time of the survey respondents complained that they often came away from the elite schools emptyhanded because of graduates unrealistic salary and career expectations They also criticized the graduates for having arrogant attitudes and said they find few team players at some of the prestigious schools Recruiters are clearly ambivalent about schools like Harvard which they overwhelmingly name as the MBA program with the most competitive environment They see it as the gold standard of business schools but the largest number think of arrogance when asked what first comes to mind when they hear the Harvard name Even so when recruiters were asked which school they would choose to get an MBA degree Harvard ranked third in number of mentions Harvard graduates I have interviewed are discernibly different from other Ivy League graduates more wellrounded entrepreneurial and worldy says Mr Bragin But you have to deal with their excessive expectations about what their MBA degree will get them Some seem to expect to be CEO within two years Kristin Gandy associate recruiter for Enron Corp was disappointed with her visit to MIT last year She recalls that about half the students on her interview schedule failed to show up and didnt bother to call or write a letter of apology We didnt have a good fall season at MIT and werent at all pleased with the results Ms Gandy says But she adds the school seems to be changing for the better this year under its new careerdevelopment director Indeed Jackie Wilbur the new director says MIT students will now lose recruiting services if they miss interviews MITs Sloan School of Management ranked th in the survey and received its lowest scores for its careerservices office value for the money spent on the recruiting effort and companies success in retaining its graduates Richard Schmalensee the Sloan Schools dean is sympathetic to recruiters frustrations but he doesnt apologize for his students selectivity You can make the argument that our students are expensive and hard to keep Mr Schmalensee says But if they werent Id have a problem with that People who like to take risks and are looking for challenging work are drawn to MIT Tim Butler director of MBA career development programs at Harvard believes recruiters too quickly blame the schools for their low recruiting yield or their inability to retain the graduates they do hire The real issue often is the attractiveness of the company and its ability to develop their careers and keep them interested he says Companies think only of pay as a way to keep employees They need to think more creatively of how to excite these top performers The Rating Criteria Recruiters rated business schools and their students on these attributes School Attributes The careerservices office at that school The past success recruiters have had in terms of the number of graduates they have hired from that school The past success theyve had with the quality of graduates they have hired from that school The core curriculum A particular specialty that is offered at that school The faculty The students average number of years of work experience The willingness of the schools students to relocate to the job location recruiters require The longterm success recruiters have had with students hired from the school The success they have had retaining students hired from the school The schools success in preparing students for the New Economy

to buy a jet online you may ask Who knows Who cares respond Boeing execs Thats not why theyre consumed with the Internet Boeing doesnt want to be the Amazoncom of the aerospace industry What Boeing wants to do is rethink its business It needs to build planes faster and for less money More significant it needs to get into less cyclical highermargin businesses like aircraft maintenance The math here is pretty simple Boeing earns margins building planes It can make more than margins servicing them Theoretically at least the Internet will make doing all this easier in other cases it will make it possible Whats happening at Boeing is hardly new A handful of corporate executives like John Chambers Larry Ellison Kenneth Lay Michael Dell and Jack Welch have understood the power of the Internet for years Its why virtually no paper changes hands at Cisco its why Oracle could even claim to have saved billion a year its why Enron has been able to transform itself from a lowmargin natural gas supplier to a highmargin energytrading firm its why Dell has no stores and no inventory and its why GE can boast it will more than double pretax earnings in the next few years The difference today is that the stakes are much higher Embracing the Net when the economy was booming and few competitors understood the technology was one thing Then failure could be repositioned as a learning experience Now with recessionnot stock optionsthe dominant topic at cocktail parties there is little room to screw up Investors are demanding fiscal discipline and so technology budgets are tightening expected to grow just to this year down from last year At the same time the pressure on corporations to develop a Net game before their competitors do is only growing Its a scary combination At a recent conference Merrill Lynch CEO David Komansky said he couldnt remember a time at least in his business when there was such an enormous premium on being right The pressure isnt keeping them from trying Even with tech spending slowing when it comes to using the Web to make operations more efficient few CEOs are scaling back according to Chuck Phillips a Morgan Stanley analyst who regularly surveys chief information officers Ralph Szygenda GMs CIO brags that hes cut GMs tech spending by in five years to billion and still made a billion investment in ebusiness For companies just now gearing up theyre lucky The Net has been with us long enough that a handful of lessons are emerging Looking at Boeings Internet strategy is particularly instructive It may be the most ambitious of any major corporation yet True GE and the automakers too are using the Internet to run their core businesses better But talk to Boeing execs and youll find that everything at the company is being reexamined from how it interacts with its customers and suppliers right down to whether plane making should be its core business The goal is to change the entire fabric of the company Part of the reason for the overhaul is that for such a hightech operation Boeing until recently was a pretty backward place Sure the company liked to think it knew more about building planes than anyone in the world but good luck trying to get your hands on that information after the planes were built Much of its extensive knowledge about aerospace design and manufacturing was locked in giant paper binders or in one of incompatible procurement computer systems The only people who could find it were people who knew where to look Even until the middle of last year suppliers could be making the same part for a handful of Boeing divisions and because of the distinct procurement computers get different contracts A big chunk of the work is finished but theres still more to do Many small parts like brackets which connect overhead bins to the fuselage are still designed and manufactured from scratch every time Right now if you wanted to look inside Boeing to see if another division had manufactured a part with the specs you needed you cant do that says CIO Scott Griffin Digitizing the data is already helping to solve the problems Even better its helping trim costs Boeing generates a billion pages of paper a year building planes In two years Griffin wants to have cut that by to There are costs in printing paper in managing it in shipping it he says None of this has anything to do with building a plane Its evil he says like inventory The hope to run Boeing as efficiently as Cisco where memos invoices engineering drawingsvirtually everythinghappen over the Net instead of on paper Eventually as Boeing goes down this road Webifying the company will help ease entry into new lines of business and increase sales To compete in the maintenance market Boeing is arming its crews with wireless devices that connect to the companys databases If a crew member wants to consult the manual while on the tarmac he can do so without having to drive back to the hangar This summer Boeing is going to begin purchasing airplane production parts online from its suppliers Standardizing and reducing the number of parts has helped boost margins on planebuilding to from in Last month for the first time Boeing conducted an online reverse auction for natural gas which it uses to heat many of its plants It got the gas cheaper and sealed the deal in a few hours instead of several weeks And the company is increasingly giving its customers the easy access to Boeing information they crave On myboeingfleetcom customers can now research design and maintenance issues for almost all of the airlines commercial fleet and order many of the parts they need The upshot Online sales of Boeing spare parts are up more than and where Boeing once retained some employees just to handle faxes and phone calls from its customers it now does the same work with people The ultimate payoff for Boeing could be huge But its strategy is fraught with risks Think about it In maintenance one of Boeings big competitorsGEis also one of its biggest customers More broadly Boeing is spending millions of dollars to get its employees to change the way they work And people dont like to change the way they do anything For Griffin or any of Boeings senior executives implementing all this isnt particularly glamorous work Not like say buying or turning around companies Webifying is an expensive disruptive unsexy management challenge When Boeing started on its reengineering four years ago costs skyrocketed and at first productivity dropped Its like fixing subway tracks a necessary evil that when completed goes largely unnoticed Look at whats happened to Nike Last year the company decided to automate its entire supply chain so that when retailers ordered shoes they could do it on the Nike site The hope was that the system would automatically take payments deliver the shoes and when supplies dropped notify the manufacturers in Asia The reality was that Nike wound up with too much inventory in some models and not enough in others Earnings for the quarter ended Feb fell as a result Analysts believe the problem will take the rest of the year at leastto correct This is what we get for our million wondered Nike Chairman Phil Knight What makes Boeings strategy even riskier is that theres no guarantee that success will lead to a lasting competitive advantage Charles Schwab is learning that right now It revolutionized the brokerage industry in early when it started allowing clients to research buy and sell stocks online By mid that experiment had proven so successful that big brokerage firms were quaking For a few weeks Schwabs market cap exceeded Merrill Lynchs even though Schwab had onefifth its sales That isnt so anymore Merrill and the other big firms launched their own electronic trading products soon after and today Merrills offerings are as sophisticated as Schwabs Schwabs market capitalization is now less than half Merrills So whats a big ol corporation to do Here are four lessons Grab the lowhanging fruit first The conventional wisdom among consultants and other reengineering cognoscenti is that in order to truly leverage a business on the Internet one has to follow Boeings lead and rethink the business model from the top down Otherwise says Ray Lane a partner at Kleiner Perkins and the former No at Oracle the process stalls as yearold department heads who think they know everything get caught in turf battles He may be right But most companies dont have the stomach for that kind of risk Indeed the nearbilliondollar cargo operations of United and American airlines are taking a different tack Theyve started small teaming up with a new Dallas company called NextJet to offer businesses and consumers doortodoor sameday package delivery On domestic flights a huge percentage of passenger planes cargo space goes unused Airlines have long sold this excess space but it was up to the sender to get the package to the airport find the right flight and arrange to have the package picked up at the destination NextJet created software that trolled reservation systems figured out the quickest way to route packages and worked with couriers for delivery American and United simply rebranded NextJets system and stuck it on their Websites The result United started offering the service in early March and says that in the first three weeks it scored steady customers with zero marketing We had everyone from architects and lawyers needing to get documents across the country by days end to parents on vacation sending house keys to their lockedout teenage children says Jim Hartigan who runs the United Cargo operation At a pop each package is like having an extra passengerand you dont have to feed the cargo or give it legroom Soon United will market the service more aggressively to corporate customers Hartigan says he can see doubling the size of Uniteds cargo business using the Net But starting small helps his team understand the pitfalls of the business without too much risk Dont get fixated on the technology Certainly the right hardware and software are important to be successful But they are catalysts not solutions says Adrian Slywotsky a consultant at Mercer Management in Boston Webifying a business is about getting employees to work more efficiently he says And that has everything to do with good management and little to do with technology Not that many CEOs get it To this day most start with the technology rather than the business issues he says Lisa Harris the CIO at Staff Leasing a billion Florida company that acts as the HR department for small to medium sized businesses says her company learned that lesson the hard way It spent millions on an online system two years ago with the idea of using the Net to offer customers hour selfservice HR support backed up by a call center to answer more complicated questions The only trouble was that operators in the call center were being evaluated based on how many calls they answered As a result they didnt encourage clients to use the Website but rather to continue calling with their questions The solution Staff Leasing began evaluating callcenter operators not just on volume of calls answered but on errors generated In addition the company started handing operators bonuses for every account they moved to the Web It was BF Skinner meets the Web Operators could do things the old way make a mistake and get penalized or they could get a bonus for doing things the new way They quickly fell in line Then another problem cropped up Once customers became comfortable using the Web to handle basic HR needs the only questions they had for the operators were questions most couldnt answer Difficult dilemmas had previously been handled by specially trained HR consultants Solution Fire some callcenter operators retrain others and hire more consultants Today with of Staff Leasings customers using the Web the company has cut million a year in expenses A good lesson says Harris but one that took too long to figure out When we started the project it was strictly an infotech operation she says It wasnt until a year later that it became a project sponsored by the entire business Its not about cutting out the middleman Two years ago the chief benefit of a Web strategy was in allowing manufacturers to bypass distributors and reach out directly to customers But today middlemen seem if anything to be thriving Most early attempts to eliminate distributors have failed What happened The Internet enabled manufacturers to sell directly to customers but it didnt teach them how to sell It turned out that their distributors lengthy relationships with their customers werent easily broken In most markets middlemen are the basis of trust to do the transaction says Michael Nevens a consultant at McKinsey Co in Palo Alto Calif Look at the resale market for semiconductors he says When manufacturers have excess chips they dont want to advertise that because it drives the price down but they still want to sell them Meanwhile chip buyers want to be sure the chips they are getting are of good quality Who solves that problem A middleman both parties trust In the computer hardware business for example there were a flood of online catalog companies like Buycom which were convinced that the Internet would quickly kill off the salesman and that the only way to compete was on price Computer retailing giant CDW wasnt one of them Instead it embraced its middleman status and made big investments in staff not just technology to pull it off In CDW started bulking up growing from salesmen to nearly by the end of last year The result a record year for revenue growth and earnings To make this strategy work CDW made sure that salesmen got a commission even when the sale went through the Internet Small and mediumsized businesses need efficiency but there also are certain situations where you just need to talk to someone says Jim Shanks CDWs CIO Sure a large percentage of our business comes unassisted through the Web but the majority of the business is one where a customer gets educated and then calls the account manager Dont reject plans with hardtomeasure results Department store and advertising pioneer John Wanamaker once noted that half his advertising was wasted he just didnt know which half Its a cute way of saying that while advertising works its bottomline benefit is hard if not impossible to measure Some Internet initiatives are going to be like that too The smart companies will pursue them Fidelity Investments for example last year began offering Web based k administration for small companies Its been an instant hit The program added companies last year Historically its been hard for small companies to have k benefits because administrators charged too much or in Fidelitys case didnt offer them at all because they were too expensive to operate Whats in it for Fidelity Well the program was expensive to set up isnt profitable and doesnt generate big fees But ek isnt being measured by how much money it makes Its about taking a small risk on a technology that might prove to be essentialboth to getting into a new market and to discovering new tools for existing customers I had this same discussion in the early s when we went after the middle market says Steve Elterich president of Fidelity eBusiness At that point no one was offering k services to them Thats now our most profitable market segment Why A lot of those companieslike Microsofthave grown into very very big companies Digesting all this change wont be easy The Internet isnt just some passing management fad but a fundamental shift in the way Americans and the world conduct business Indeed some consultants like Don Tapscott still believe its impact will be as profound as the impact of the corporation itself more than a century ago It wont happen fast but it will happen For those whose first inclination is to bury their head in the sand at least until the economy picks up Resist Now is the time to look around and learn from those who have already made their mistakes REPORTER ASSOCIATE

Lee Raymond Tries to Prove Bigger Is Better Published in May issue of Bloomberg Markets Irving Texas April Bloomberg Exxon Mobil Corps Hoover Diana drilling platform floats in the sapphireblue barracudafilled waters of the Gulf of Mexico about miles off the coast of Galveston Texas The platforms three decks provide more than acres of living and working space as it taps the more than million barrels of oil and gas trapped in two adjacent fields feet below This massive project cost billion a sum only an oil company with assets by the barrelful can afford Thats a point Lee Raymond Exxon Mobils chairman and chief executive has made repeatedly as he faces the toughest challenge of his career convincing investors that his billion acquisition of Mobil Corp on November was a good idea that bigger really is better Raymond has weapons to make his case The marriage of Exxon Corp and Mobil Corp created a behemoth with billion in assets including oil and gas fields in countries and territories on six continents refineries that sell about million gallons of fuel a day in countries and service stations worldwide This should be his moment With Internet and dotcom stocks in decline investors are looking harder at the value Big Oil companies provide theres an oilpatch veteran in the White House and those pesky environmentalists are in retreat Stellar Balance Sheet Raymond can point to a stellar balance sheet as well Last year Exxon Mobil squeezed out of those formidable assets a profit of billion which was more than double the year earlier and a record for a publicly traded company Revenue increased percent to billion also a record For the first quarter of this year revenue rose percent to billion and profit climbed percent to billion The Irving Texasbased enterprise is now by far the largest publicly traded company on earth in terms of revenue and profit Past revenue title holder General Motors Corp brought in billion in and WalMart Stores Inc s No had sales of billion Royal DutchShell Group the No publicly traded oil company earned billion from revenue of billion and No BP Amoco Plc earned billion from revenue of billion For further comparison the No through No US oil companies Chevron Corp Texaco Inc Conoco Inc and USXMarathon Group had combined earnings of billion from combined revenue of billion Not Much Enthusiasm Investors havent shown much enthusiasm for Exxon Mobil this year The companys stock price on April is up percent for the year its shares have still traded at a discount to the Standard Poors Index which it has outperformed for years since If Exxon Mobils priceearnings ratio were to rise to the SPs level of from its recent level of the companys shares would cost up percent BP trades at times earnings Chevron at times and Texaco at Twenty one of the analysts who follow Exxon Mobil rate the company a buy Investors question whether Exxon Mobil can sustain its performance if oil and gas prices fall About percent or billion of Exxon Mobils profits came from the sale of oil and gas prices of which rose percent and percent respectively year over year Refining Business The companys refining business brought in billion its chemical business earned billion and the remainder came from such operations as mining Some critics such as Enron Corp CEO Jeff Skilling say the company might be better off if it broke into its component parts Investors seem to agree Shares of Houstonbased EOG Resources Inc the former exploration and production arm of Enron more than tripled last year and shares of San Antoniobased refiner Valero Energy Corp rose percent Is it the best way to play energy No said Charles White of Avatar Associates which manages a little more than billion and counts Exxon Mobil shares as one of its largest holdings For instance if you wanted an exploration company and were willing to do the research and trade often youd be better off with EOG Apache Corp or Devon Energy But if youre just looking for a big company Exxon Mobil is the bellwether Other Critics Other critics including Michael Carpenter Citigroup Incs head of investment and corporate banking have labeled Exxon Mobils successful first full year a fluke The only companies in the world that make more money than we do today are a couple of oil companies that got lucky with high oil prices Carpenter told analysts in January Citigroup the biggest US financial services company earned billion last year With such critical shots aimed at his company Raymond often finds himself on the defensive He counters by pointing to the contributions that big projects like the Hoover and Diana fields will make down the line By the Hoover Diana operation could produce about barrels of oil and million cubic feet of gas a day At current prices that translates into more than billion of sales a year Protected From Price Fluctuations Raymond also proclaims that his company will make money irrespective of prices The detractors or the critics can say weve benefited from high oil and gas prices and theres no question that is true But thats not really the way we analyze the business he said Instead of saying Given a price heres what were going to do we went to the other side and said Lets accept that we cannot forecast the price so what can we do Thats a much more challenging task Oil and gas prices may actually have to fall for Exxon Mobil to prove itself When Exxon agreed to buy Mobil oil prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange were hovering around a barrel the lowest levels seen since the Great Depression The merger was supposed to create a company with an inventory of projects large enough and efficient enough to withstand those types of prices Per Barrel In its first full fiscal year as a company oil prices averaged more than a barrel It hasnt been tested on the low side Buying Mobil was just one of many steps Exxon has taken in the past decade or so to switch from focusing on growth to focusing on controlling costs Raymond cites the cost savings that the company has reaped following the merger Exxon Mobil has raised its mergerrelated savings estimate percent to billion a year in part by intending to cut jobs by New technology is integral to the costcutting effort Raymond who used to be with Exxons research group in Houston often refers to Exxon Mobil as the NASA of the sea Exxon Mobil spends more than million a year developing proprietary technology for everything from stronger steel so pipelines can take gas out of remote places like Alaska to platform designs for fields deeper than Hoover and Diana Deepwater Fields Because it can cost million to million to drill a single well at deepwater fields such as Hoover and Diana William Drennan the companys head geosciences researcher focuses on ensuring that few dry holes get dug He spends much of his day standing in front of a seamless foot screen in a blackedout room in Houston that looks like a miniaturized IMAX theater The auditorium contains stadiumstyle seats with large tables for note taking On the tables are D glasses that when worn turn the image on the screen into a hologram Drennan can then virtually walk through a map of an oil reservoir and working with his fellow scientists determine where wells should be drilled Last year advances in drilling methods and reservoir mapping helped Exxon Mobil cut to cents its cost to find a barrel of oil down from in Selective Investments Raymond says cost cutting is important because it forces Exxon Mobil to be more selective in its investments than its peers are A bad investment decision could be around for more than years he said In August he offered analysts a chart showing that from to BP wrote off billion worth of projects Shell wrote off billion and Exxon Mobil wrote off none If you look around youll see all of our competitors have had massive writeoffs Raymond said And what amazes me is that when that happens the investment community cheers and I kind of wonder Were they cheering when those investments were made Raymonds been applying his brand of frugality at Exxon since joining the company as a production research engineer in Tulsa Oklahoma in soon after receiving a PhD in chemical engineering from the University of Minnesota A native of Watertown South Dakota who attended the University of Wisconsin as an undergraduate Raymond moved up the ladder with Exxon in the US Venezuela and Aruba Exxon Nuclear He became president of Exxon Nuclear Co in and moved to New York in when he was named executive vice president of Exxon Enterprises a company that had principal responsibility for Exxons investments outside the areas of petroleum chemicals and minerals About that time oil companies cash rich from high prices and in the hopes of diversifying profits were making acquisitions in businesses they knew little about Exxon sold office equipment Mobil owned discount retailer Montgomery Ward The strategy reached the height of silliness when Gulf Corp later acquired by Chevron considered buying Ringling Brothers and Barnum Bailey Circus Analysts werent much more impressed with Exxons forays beyond oil They were especially turned off by Exxons billion purchase of Reliance Electric Co a Clevelandbased manufacturer of motors and electrical communications and weighing equipment in EnergySaving Device The company hoped to profit from technological developments contained in an energysaving device for electric motors the technology eventually proved to be commercially unfeasible By Raymond had been named president and director of what was then called Esso InterAmerica Inc with responsibilities for Exxons operations in the Caribbean and Central and South America so Reliances downfall wasnt his problem He was named a senior vice president and director of the corporation in Exxon sold Reliance for billion in in a leveraged buyout by a management group and what were then Citicorp Capital Investors and PrudentialBache Securities Inc That same year Exxon sold Exxon Nuclear and its share of the companys Rockefeller Center headquarters in Manhattan It would move to its current headquarters in Irving Texas in One year later Raymond became president of Exxon Corp He was named chairman and chief executive of Exxon Corp in April succeeding Lawrence Rawl who was about to reach the companys mandatory retirement age of Dark Suits White Shirts Raymond a man who favors dark suits white shirts and red ties has earned a reputation for handson management When he bought Mobil for example he and now retired Mobil head Lucio Lou Noto hammered out most of the details on their own waiting until due diligence to call in advisers Raymond said the ultimate lesson he learned in the years before he took control of Exxon is that efficiency is king for large companies If youre the most efficient competitor on a large scale then its axiomatic in my mind that youre going to end up over time with a very sound financial result and a very strong cash flow and a high return on capital employed which is what the objective of Exxon Mobil is Raymond said Return on Capital Exxon Mobils return on capital employed an industry measure of how effectively a company manages its capital was percent last year the highest in the industry Shells return was percent and BPs was percent according to the companies From to Exxon alone generated a return on capital employed of percent beating BP and Shell which each returned percent I believe they will continue to have the best returns on capital employed which ensures their premium valuation said Denis Walsh of Bostonbased State Street Corp Exxon Mobils fourthlargest shareholder State Street as of December held about million Exxon Mobil shares Under Raymond Exxon Mobil has focused on capital discipline It is one of just seven public corporations worldwide with AAA credit ratings by both Standard Poors Ratings Services and Moodys Investors Service it can therefore borrow money at about percent or less Net Debt At the end of Exxon Mobil had billion in net debt which included billion in debt and billion in cash Thats about percent of its total capital compared with an average of percent for the SP percent at other major oil companies and percent for the oil industry analysts say In its entire year history Exxon Mobil has never been more able to deploy technology throughout its system say analysts Thats because when Exxon merged with Mobil it also restructured the company Instead of only rolling Mobils assets into Exxons existing corporate structure Raymond and Noto decided to set up an entirely new company organization changing from dozens of regionalbased business units into global businesses Five divisions based in Houston find and produce oil and gas Chemical and coal operations are also based there And four divisions based in Fairfax Virginia make and sell fuels New Ideas Across Old Boundaries The new structure is designed to promote new ideas across old boundaries Stephen Hart who manages Exxon Mobils Baytown Texas refinery said one of the first steps in that process dubbed cold eyes involved sending Mobil employees through his plants to see how they would do things differently The refinery North Americas largest can process barrels of crude oil daily It was like Christmas being able to find out how each other did things Hart said I know guys who have wanted to get into Baytown for years Sharing best practices doesnt always work During one of the coldeyes tours former Mobil employees identified what they thought was a way to reduce the maintenance time on Baytowns catalytic cracker a plant used to make gasoline to days from days Hart says that due to unrelated issues they werent able to complete the maintenance that fast How To Be Attractive Still the effort continues You have to be the lowestcost producer to be attractive in this business Hart said One of the powers of Exxon and Mobil coming together is weve now got the best brains in chemistry refining engineering et cetera to figure out how to be the leader in every product we produce Jim Guerra an Exxon employee for years said employees are linked by a former Mobil tool called BestNet an intranet message system Before the advent of BestNet if he had a problem with a catalytic cracking unit he was supposed to call a regional central engineer on the phone and ask for advice This could take up to a day if the engineer was in the field Now Guerra and employees like him use BestNet to post questions and instantly receive answers from colleagues around the world who have wide experience Efficient Deepwater Drilling Efficient deepwater drilling will be crucial to the companys financial future Although oil and gas companies have begun to explore only half the known deepwater basins theyve already found the equivalent of more than billion barrels of oil and over billion more barrels remain to be found Exxon Mobil leads the industry in deepwater prospects with nearly blocks worldwide that cover more than million acres an area the size of France Next year the company plans to tap two fields near Hoover and Diana called Marshall and Madison that hold another million barrels moving the company toward an ambitious goal of boosting worldwide production percent a year through The company is also involved in nine other Gulf of Mexico discoveries in waters deeper than feet that are currently producing or advancing toward development The companys geologists expect these fields to hold more than billion barrels of oil and gas Balance Sheet in Good Shape Because Exxon Mobils balance sheet is in good shape it can focus on finding other things besides debt reduction on which to spend the more than billion in cash it generates annually Generally the options include acquisitions capital spending stock buybacks and dividend increases Analysts dont expect the company to make any sizable acquisitions until after the company sells off some of the assets it gained in the merger They will remain disciplined in their focus on return on capital employed and not spend their free cash flow unwisely said State Streets Walsh As of January Exxon Mobil planned to spend up to billion on capital projects including developing oil fields and improving its refineries in up as much as percent over last year Though Raymond wont say what Exxon Mobil plans to divest Matthew Warburton an analyst at UBS Warburg in New York says the company will sell about billion of Mobils old oil and gas fields annually Sale of Aera Energy Fadel Gheit an analyst at Fahnestock Co says a prime candidate for sale is Exxon Mobils stake in Aera Energy LLC a joint venture with Shell in California that currently produces about barrels of oil and million cubic feet of gas a day Exxon Mobils share could be worth more than billion Investors will be surprised at the scope and size of the asset sales said Gheit Last year Exxon Mobil raised billion from asset sales required by federal regulators Exxon Mobil paid billion in dividends or a common share up from billion or a year earlier the th straight yearly increase That leaves stock repurchases for which the former Exxon Corp was famous From to Exxon repurchased more than billion of its common shares at a cost of about billion Mobil purchased about million shares during that period for about billion Continuous Buyback Through the end of Exxon Mobil purchased million shares at a cost of about billion Instead of announcing a level for buybacks like Shells billion goal Exxon Mobil buys continuously With shares as undervalued as they are UBS Warburgs Warburton said the company could repurchase billion of stock in Because of the companys stature Exxon Mobil shares often serve as a proxy for the energy industry said Michael LaBranche chairman and chief executive of LaBranche Co As the companys specialist on the New York Stock Exchange LaBranche is responsible for raising the volume of Exxon Mobil shares traded on the exchange An average of about million of Exxon Mobils billion common shares outstanding change hands daily up from about million daily last year That kind of liquidity is good when a company is trying to attract large institutional investors Fidelity and Barclays Exxon Mobils two largest shareholders are Fidelity Investments and Barclays Global Investors both of which sell many indexrelated funds Many of these funds must own Exxon Mobil shares because the company makes up a large percentage of key indexes such as the SP and the Dow Jones Industrial Average For example of every invested in an SP fund buys Exxon Mobil shares Only General Electric Co at and Microsoft Corp at get more of the investment Exxon Mobil shares make up percent of the Dow There are side effects to this status Some investors use Exxon Mobils liquidity to treat the company like a bank buying the companys shares and holding them until their favorite stock starts to rise again This is something the company has to suffer through in part because of its status as a defensive or antitechnology stock Exxon and the Nasdaq When the Nasdaq started to plummet in March you could often use the indexs daily performance to track how Exxon Mobil shares traded for the day Usually the relationship was an inverse one My wife has the view Raymond said that when she looks at the stock market in the morning if she sees the Nasdaq is up she says Well Im not even going to look at Exxon Mobil And if the Nasdaq is down she goes Hooray Exxons up dont even need to look That may no longer be true as investors beaten down by the drop in the Nasdaq so far this year search for companies that have earnings Exxon Mobil is the place to hide for the time being said Allen Ashcroft a portfolio manager with Allied Investment Advisors Inc This year Exxon Mobil is expected to earn a share or about billion according to First CallThomson Financial Estimates range from to a share or about billion to about billion Conventional Wisdom The conventional wisdom is that Exxons earnings last year were as good as it gets said Fahnestock analyst Gheit who used to be at Mobil Corp and who rates Exxon Mobil shares a buy but this old dog may have a few new tricks Size doesnt always guarantee success for Exxon Mobil In March the company lost to BP a contract to build a liquefied natural gas terminal in China And the company after being slapped with a billion judgment in its infamous Valdez oil spill in has since become a magnet for other large judgments including a billion case related to natural gas royalties in Alabama that the company has allegedly underpaid since Raymond Undaunted Raymond remains undaunted Putting Mobil together with Exxon gave us by far the largest asset base with more quality projects to do than anyone in our industry and you can be sure that were going to take advantage he said Raymond has yet to convince many investors of that And he wont get the respect he craves on Wall Street until he proves that his enormous enterprise is smarter than its rivals not just bigger David Wells in the New York newsroom or kl Story illustration For the most important Exxon Mobil news type XOM US EQUITY ICN GO SURVEY ENERGY UTILITY REVIEW US demand boosts marketplace LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS by David Buchan With prices for natural gas set to stay high LNG seems to be back in fashion Financial Times Apr By DAVID BUCHAN If the US is a drag on the world oil market with its enormous imports placing strains on prices its newfound appetite for liquefied natural gas LNG imports is wholly welcome In contrast to its effect on the oil market US demand is not raising the world price for gas because there is as yet no such thing but rather reflecting local north American hunger for gas At the same time US readiness to buy shortterm LNG cargoes is adding flexibility and depth to a world market characterised by longterm contracts and an apparently rigid supply line of specialised tanker ships carrying frozen gas from one billiondollar terminal to another The US has introduced a new dynamic into the market says Ron Billings head of ExxonMobils LNG business But LNG is an expensive business You need Dollars bn to get going says Dick de Jong Shells head of LNG with Dollars bn needed to build one train or unit liquefying m tonnes of gas a year and three tankers costing around Dollars m each to move the product And there have been false LNG dawns before In the mids when US importers of LNG found the deregulated price of domestic natural gas slipping below that of LNG they fought to wriggle out of their longterm LNG contracts and mothballed their LNG import terminals But with US natural gas prices double what they were a year ago and looking set to stay high the industry is scrambling to put the terminals back into operation The capacity of the largest at Lake Charles in Louisiana is being expanded and BP and Shell are buying capacity at Cove Point on the Chesapeake Bay which is due to start receiving LNG next year after a gap of two decades BP Chevron El Paso Phillips Petroleum and Enron are prospecting for sites for new import terminals on both coasts of the US the west coast has to rely on gas from the AsiaPacific region and the east coast on Atlantic basin gas because most LNG carriers are too big to pass through the Panama canal Right now LNG only amounts to per cent of total US demand says Skip Horvath president of the US Natural Gas Supply Association But it is very important to certain areas and it does not involve building extra pipelines which have become increasingly difficult to site in the US The US is also helping something like a spot market to develop in world LNG Of the spot cargoes of LNG traded last year many went to the US The upshot is that many companies are beginning to build a bit of spare capacity into their LNG plants Some companies such as BP are starting to order LNG ships which are not tied to any specific LNG contracts and which could therefore be available to carry spot cargoes Contracts are also becoming more flexible as shown in BPs recent contract to supply LNG to the Dominican Republic At years the contract was no shorter than the old norm But instead of pinning down the origin of the gas as is usual in LNG contracts it allows BP to supply the gas from anywhere within its portfolio though the gas will probably come from BPs plant in Trinidad and Tobago The export push of certain gasproducing countries is also conducive to the development of a more flexible market Nigeria for example is very keen to abolish the flaring of gas that comes up with oil extraction and sees LNG exports as the only feasible way of commercialising this gas Its current LNG gas is on longterm contract to Europe but last year for instance the Nigerian LNG consortium of Shell TotalFinaElf and Agip sold six spot cargoes to the US A consortium of US oil companies is looking at a second Nigerian LNG project Egypt is another enthusiast for LNG In the past six months it has signed three LNG deals one with Union Fenosa of Spain and two with AngloItalian partnerships of BP and Eni and of BG and Edison Like Nigeria Egypt appears to see the US especially with its current high prices as a useful supplement to its core European market But it is in Asia that LNG first started to overcome that regions long distances and lack of pipelines and it is still in Asia that the big volumes of LNG are traded Whether the Asian market becomes more flexible may depend on the balance in supply and demand in the Asian region On the supply side large Middle East LNG producers notably Qatar are making their presence felt alongside producers based in Indonesia Malaysia Brunei and Australias North West Shelf Qatars Rasgas is rapidly expanding its capacity in conjunction with ExxonMobil in particular to supply Indias Petronet with which it has the worlds largest LNG contract of m tonnes a year On the demand side India and China are clearly the big potential growth markets in a region where demand has been dominated by Japan South Korea and Taiwan But they may prove difficult and slow to develop as Enrons persistent payment problems in India have shown So the Asian market may develop into the sort of buyers market that would allow for instance the big Japanese utilities to negotiate the shorter and flexible contracts they want However there will be no revolution in LNG says Martin Houston a vicepresident of BG though the share of LNG traded short term could rise from to per cent by the end of the decade Mr Billings of ExxonMobil concurs Things are changing and maybe contracts will be shorter than years But when you look at the enormous investments involved you have to say there are not too many players who are going to let the whole LNG value chain go ahead as a speculative

NEW DELHI Dow Jones Indias Maharashtra State Electricity Board is hopeful of renegotiating its power purchase agreement with the US energy major Enron Corps ENE Indian unit Dabhol Power Co MSEB Chairman Vinay Bansal said late Sunday The billion megawatt Dabhol project has been mired in financial disputes after MSEB its main customer failed to pay several of its bills The project has the largest single foreign investment in India The Dabhol project has been in trouble since December when the government of Maharashtra state where the Dabhol project is located said the company charged exorbitant prices for electricity and thus demanded a new price agreement Meanwhile the board of Dabhol Power at its meeting in London April had authorized DPCs managing director to proceed with a preliminary move toward terminating its troubled joint venture power project in western India We are at a point of renegotiating the power purchase agreement with Dabhol Power Co A committee has been constituted with the government of India participation I am hopeful of a positive outcome Bansal told Dow Jones Newswires in a telephone interview He said he hadnt heard anything from DPCs management on the preliminary termination notice Its true that the DPC board has authorized the companys managing director to issue a preliminary termination notice I am not sure why when or whether he will use it Bansal said The preliminary termination notice is the first of three steps that end in the abandonment of the project agreed to by investors when the joint venture was formed Bansal said that if the preliminary notice of termination is issued by the DPCs managing director there will be a sixmonth suspension period in which the two sides will be negotiating to remedy the defect If the dispute cannot be resolved even after the negotiations the final termination takes place Thereafter MSEB or a third party may buy the Dabhol unit The compensation price will be decided by the arbitrator whose decision will be based on which of the two parties has defaulted Bansal said Enron India spokesman Jimmy Mogal refused to comment on the DPC boards decision when reached by Dow Jones Newswires saying it was an internal company matter Indian lenders present at a meeting with foreign financial institutions in London on April have said they favor renegotiation of the DPCMSEB power purchase agreement Under a counterguarantee agreement the federal government is obliged to pay Enron when MSEB defaults Enron invoked that guarantee in February marking the first time in Indian history that a company has invoked such a federal guarantee when the state utility said it couldnt afford to pay Dabhol But before the federal government stepped in the state government paid million in outstanding bills Since then the state power utility has confirmed that all pending bills have been paid However a dispute over payment of million for December and January bills is pending For its part MSEB says it wants the power bills to be offset against a billion rupee INR fine it levied on Dabhol for what it said was the nonsupply of power for intermittent periods between October and the end of January Several political parties had earlier demanded the project be scrapped since the costs had increased to INR from INR per unit agreed to six years ago for electricity generated by the megawatt naphtha

lenders in a spot Business Line The Hindu Copyright C Kasturi Sons Ltd KSL Source World Reporter TM Asia Intelligence Wire MUMBAI April DABHOL Power Companys DPC overseas lenders have a guarantee cover of about Rs crore from the IDBIled consortium of Indian lenders If the Enronsponsored project is terminated the Indian lenders will have to incur the additional burden over and above the funds they have already sunk in This is in addition to the Union Governments guarantee of about Rs crore to overseas lenders Sources said according to the agreements between the overseas lenders the Indian financiers and the Government the total payout in the event of termination would not be less than the entire foreign debt Of the total debt of close to billion about per cent has been already disbursed by lenders of which per cent has been lent by overseas entities If the blame of termination finally comes to rest on any Indian entity the penalty payable to Enron would amount to about Rs crore Irrespective of the payments to be made to Enron promised returns on premature termination the foreign lenders are secured by the word of domestic financial institutions and not just the Central and State Governments Sources said this is one of the major reasons Indian lenders are opposed to premature termination of the project apart from their loans being unsecured At the DPC board meeting in London IDBI had voted against the resolution to initiate termination The sources said Enron wants to see some concrete and positive signals from the Government within about three weeks that it is serious about the project A positive signal according to them would mean a commitment that phase II would continue on schedule and the power produced would be lifted completely It also wants the first phase to be up and running at full steam without hindrance However even if foreign creditors have to be paid off it is unlikely to be in a single settlement Domestic lenders may have to negotiate some kind of an arrangement to repay the foreign debt in tranches Another possibility albeit a remote one is that the new entity that takes over the project will also take over the foreign debt Meanwhile the expert panel to be formed for renegotiation of the power purchase agreement will include all members of the Godbole Committee a State Government official said It will also include one member each

electricity board MSEB and federal governments refusal to honour the Rs billion counterguarantee In DPCs board meeting held in London on April Enron India Managing Director K Wade Cline and DPC President Neil McGregor made it clear they were not very keen for completion of the project as the management felt that both the state government and the Centre Indian Government were undermining the gravity of the situation a senior state government official who attended the meeting told PTI here Sunday Cline told the DPC directors that since the state government had not shown any serious interest in dissolving the imbroglio DPC and its international lenders were not in favour of continuing the project When contacted DPC spokesperson refused to comment The fate of DPCs MW project which is per cent complete hangs in balance since the Indian financial institutions FIs led by IDBI have stopped funding the debt portion of the project with around per cent of the USD billion worth total disbursement already pumped in Naturally we have stopped disbursement as we think that it is indeed a lossmaking proposition as of now If MSEB begins paying we would go ahead with our funding as well an IDBI official said According to the IDBI official this very stand adopted by Indian lenders has upset the DPC management and Enron top bosses in Houston as well In the meeting Cline had informed that DPCs foreign lenders had put up a condition before the company that they would cough up the required USD million only if Indian FIs fulfill their debt component the official added Other than the issuance of termination notice to MSEB another issue that rocked the heated meeting was Godbole review committees strong stand on separating the USD million Liquified Natural Gas terminal from Dabhol

recommendations made public two weeks ago the Godbole panel had recommended renegotiation of the five million tonnes LNG terminal facility and DPCs shipping agreements with Oman LNG and ADGAS The

week on lending Indias Power Grid Corp million as part of a billion package to finance reform and development in the countrys power sector The total amount of money with everything included is about billion a bank spokeswoman told Reuters The multilateral lenders board meets on Thursday to vote on its contribution to the package that has three central elements two related to efficiency and distribution and a third to Power Grids diversification into telecommunications Part of the World Bank loan if approved will go to support the first phase of laying fiberoptic cables across the Power Grid network the spokeswoman said India threw open its longdistance telecommunications sector last August and Power Grid which has a network of miles km of transmission lines plans to provide endtoend bandwidth services The loan package is unusual in that it would be granted directly to the stateowned power distribution utility rather than to the sovereign government of India The government is however guarantor to the program The bank spokeswoman declined to speculate on whether the boards decision would be influenced by the crisis brewing in Indias power sector with US energy company Enron Corp ENEN The bank is engaged at the national level and the state level in power reforms broadly the spokeswoman said declining to comment specifically on Enron and the questions that its potential pullout from India raised about reform in the mainly staterun power sector Houstonbased Enron took a major step on Wednesday toward bailing out of an almost complete billion power project on the west coast of India in a bitter dispute over pricing and unpaid bills The dispute threatens to undermine already weak foreign private investor confidence in direct investments in India which totaled just billion last year a fraction of Chinas billion The World Bank would make any loan to Power Grid on its usual repayment terms of years with five years grace with an interest rate at an unspecified margin above the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR The spokeswoman said other lenders in the program included Germanys Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau KfW with up to million and domestic Indian institutions If passed by the banks Washingtonbased board next week the World Bank loan agreement would then be signed in India by representatives from the bank in Delhi Power Grid and government officials The funds would then be available for draw down within days UK Scottish Power mulls Portland bid paper Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited LONDON April Reuters Scottish Power is

Portlands owner Enron last week broke off talks with the US utility Sierra Pacific on a billion sale opening the door to Scottish Power it said The article said Portland which sells power to customers around the state capital of Oregon would be a perfect fit for the Scottish Powers Pacificorp unit in the US northwest which it bought in The paper said Scottish Powers intentions would come under scrutiny when the company reports results next week Scottish Power could not be immediately reached for comment India Save Dabhol project Business Line The Hindu Copyright C Kasturi Sons Ltd KSL Source World Reporter TM Asia Intelligence Wire THE DECISION OF the Dabhol Power Company board at its meeting in London on Wednesday to authorise the Managing Director to issue a notice of termination on the contract to sell MW of power in India is important for the message it sends to New Delhi the Maharashtra Government and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board Closing down the project would be a real option at the right time In the normal course especially in view of all that has happened over the past few months including DPC invoking the political force majeure clause in the power purchase agreement it would have been no surprise had a final decision on termination been taken at the board meeting itself That this has not happened means the project can still be salvaged and this should now become the focus of all the parties But this will not be easy not merely because of the defects in the PPA from the Indian standpoint that is but also because of the bad blood unnecessarily created between the two sides To take but one example The MSEB went ahead to clear its March bill to DPC under protest despite an earlier communication after the payment of the February bill from the Enron India Managing Director Mr K Wade Cline that the company would not and will not recognise any payments made as being under protest The MSEBs reported response was that it was not taking any notice of this stand because Mr Wade Clines letter had no legal standing adding we will continue to pay our bills under protest Let them dispute it This is no way to engage in a dispute as it detracts from the main effort to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution and instead focusses on ephemeral and secondary issues that have little bearing with the core problem Now that the focus will once again shift to India from London hopefully both sides will try their best to arrive at a settlement which actually means they will have to climb down from their positions One the MSEB cannot be expected to continue paying through its nose for power which it does not even consume not merely because this is unfair and unjust but also because the Board simply does not have the funds Further if it does not make any sense for the MSEB to be part of such an arrangement even if it is of its own making it makes even less sense for the Maharashtra Government and the Centre to be penalised for a widelyacknowledged infirmity in the PPA As for DPC being the hardnosed investor it is it cannot but be aware of the financial untenability of certain aspects of the PPA In such a situation provided the principal promoters like Enron Corporation want to continue operating in India of which one is not very certain the sensible perhaps even ethical course would be to agree to an amended PPA which would at least be equitable to the two sides The central point in the issue is that the MW power project to be completed by the yearend is an asset to the nations infrastructure implying at once that letting it go to seed is no option at all At the same time the DPC promoters must be allowed to make their money not on the scale allowed by the existing onesided and patently unfair PPA but at a level which will make the PPA seem a fair document in keeping with the norms applied to such projects This means the PPA will have to be renegotiated a path already accepted by the Indian side but on which DPC is yet to make its stand clear Admittedly top DPC officials have let it be known that they are willing to talk preferably with the Centre So all may not be lost visavis the Dabhol power

Minister Mr Suresh Prabhu has informed the Lok Sabha that systemic changes need to be introduced and institutionalised if the chronically sick State electricity boards SEBs were to be restructured on an enduring basis Responding to the concern expressed by the senior Congress leader Mr Madhavrao Scindia during question hour Mr Prabhu said that the outstanding dues of the SEBs were a staggering Rs crore The Government has constituted an expert group to recommend measures for onetime settlement of outstanding dues of the SEBs towards Central public sector understandings as also the dues from the Central public sector units to State power utilities The expert group headed by the Planning Commission member Dr Montek Singh Ahluwalia would submit its report before the end of this month It would suggest a strategy for capital restructuring of SEBs including the provision of structural adjustment loans so as to enable them to tide over the present financial crisis make them operationally viable and improve their credit rating He agreed with Mr Scindia that the onetime solution for outstanding dues should be an alltime solution and there should not be any recurrence of this problem in future Tracing the genesis of the problems of the SEBs to the difference in the cost of energy generation and the cost of tariff which entails a loss of Re per unit Mr Prabhu said this year the power stations would be generating billion units That is why restructuring of the SEBs on a permanent basis was a must The Minister said that the Government was working on a package Accordingly all the consumers should be metered and all the distribution centres would be treated as profit centres and all the SEBs would have to give a projection of their performance before the year begins When Mr Scindia drew the Ministers attention to a point on the liabilities of the Enron company which he described as damaging the interest of the country the State Government and the power company resulting in massive confusion Mr Prabhu clarified that the agreement was between the State Government of Maharashtra and the Enron company and the Centres role is limited in giving counterguarantee to the guarantee provided by the State Government He said a Standing Committee has been constituted under the Ministries of Finance Power and Law and the Petroleum and Natural Gas would also be roped in to resolve the tangle Sops for shipping urged When Mr Rajaiah Malayala and Mr PC Thomas demanded sops for the indigenous shipping industry which has been facing rough weather the Minister of Shipping Mr

ratings SP Business Line The Hindu Copyright C Kasturi Sons Ltd KSL Source World Reporter TM Asia Intelligence Wire MUMBAI April INDIAS sovereign rating would remain unaffected by aggravation of the Enron dispute according to international rating agency Standard Poors The ratings are unaffected because the issues with Dabhol Power Company DPC are not about a default on debt This is a technical distinction but an important one The Government incurs many types of liabilities but we do not consider all of them to be debt for our purpose Mr Joydeep Mukherji Head of Sovereign Ratings SP told Business Line in a mailed reply A counterguarantee backing the Maharashtra guarantee on the State Electricity Boards obligation to pay Dabhol is not debt as far as our ratings go he said With the Enronsponsored DPC teetering on the brink many quarters feared that it would seriously impair foreign investor sentiment and international rating agencies would downgrade the country Mr Mukherji agrees that the issue would hit sentiment Our rating is a judgement on the ability to pay debt fully and on time It is not an indication of profitability or a view about investment prospects The Enron episode will certainly hurt foreign investor sentiment but that is separate from a debt rating he said Enron is about the only foreign investor left in the countrys power sector Many players such as Cogentrix and Powergen have already exited their respective ventures With that backdrop Mr Mukherji said At a broader level not about the rating itself the episode is very bad for India Regardless of the merits of the Dabhol case it sends a clear and negative signal to potential foreign investors going beyond the energy sector India has lots of consumers farmers and industries willing to pay lots of money for reliable guaranteed power supply Many Indian and foreign groups are eager to set up plats to provide that power and make a profit It should have been a winwin situation for all sides Instead the only result after a decade of reform is that loadshedding is as bad as ever and most private investors in power have packed up and left in bitterness However a view that projects such as Dabhol power are not viable in a country with low resources and paying capacity is gaining currency Some analysts ask when utilities in California where delinquency levels are close to zero could not afford the power sold by independent producers such as Enron what chances of survival does MSEB have Dinesh Narayanan Maharashtra to appoint Godbole to lead renegotiations with DPC Press Trust of

Vilasrao Deshmukh had categorically stated that he was hopeful of renegotiating the PPA even though Enron was contemplating serving of notice terminating power supply to the state He maintained that termination of PPA between DPC and MSEB would be harmful to both and that Enron should not take any harsh decision in the matter THROUGH ASIA PULSE The BS Weekend Power play over Dabhol Pradeep Raje and S Ravindran Business Standard Copyright c Business Standard As Vinay Bansal chairman of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB walked into a board meeting of the Enronpromoted Dabhol Power Company DPC in London on Wednesday April he had reason to be happy The other person who had reason to smile was the Maharashtra energy secretary V M Lal Bansal and Lal are on the DPC board by virtue of MSEB holding a per cent stake in it Why should they be smiling when the chief item on the agenda was to authorise Enron managing director Wade Cline to serve a preliminary notice terminating the contract for the Dabhol power project a contract signed in and renegotiated in Well for the simple reason that two days earlier the clique of lenders to the project had advised Enron not to terminate the contract Fortified with the knowledge that Enron couldnt possibly go against the advice of the lenders the BansalLal duo assumed the board agenda was almost infructuous Indeed the lenders had made a strong case against the termination of the contract noting that since per cent of the construction was already over no purpose would be served by precipitating matters Even the foreign lenders whose loans are covered by the central government counterguarantee were persuaded by the Indian lenders Industrial Development Bank of India IDBI ICICI and the State Bank of India that the bankers primary business was to invest money in a project that would return revenue streams over a period of time and not simply to recover their principal invested Preliminary reports of the lenders meeting suggest the foreign lenders who were initially planning to pack their bags and escape the uncertainties of the project saw merit in the argument that they might lose a significant chunk of their India exposure at one go Fresh investment avenues are not coming up and the foreign lenders didnt want to be left out of the India pie After all in the business of global banking it is only association with existing projects that begets fresh opportunities But despite the lenders posturing and wellintentioned advice for the Enron representatives on the DPC board the latter wasnt one to give up so easily especially after venturing this far just to show its displeasure with the way matters were progressing DPC has all along argued that it has a watertight contract and that MSEB should honour its obligations under the contract It was only after the state government refused to honour its guarantee and even the central government seemed to side with the Maharashtra government rather than honour its own counterguarantee that DPC decided to pull the trumps in its contract It had to make a point if MSEB and the local governments werent willing to pay up what was due they would have to pay up all the penalty clauses for termination of the contract So despite the lenders advice the board chose to let the sword hang tantalisingly closer to MSEBs head It authorised Enron India managing director Wade Cline to serve the notice as and when he deemed fit If the Indian side was talking tough all this while to force DPC to accept its stand on renegotiating a lower tariff the latter had dangled the threat of phenomenal penalties if the government strayed off the course charted in the power purchase agreement As the resolution was carried through the MSEB chairman and energy secretary realised their bluff was called The smiles vanished But they still put up a brave front Speaking from London MSEB officials denied that they had been checkmated This does not mean that they will issue the notice immediately Cline has only been authorised to do so they said But they did admit that the situation had not been defused in spite of the fact that the government had made some conciliatory moves Just before the DPC board meet the Union government had announced on April that a committee comprising representatives of the state government MSEB and nominees from the Centre would be set up to renegotiate the power purchase agreement with DPC to get lower tariffs In retrospect lenders say Enron seems to have realised that they had no option but to sit with the state government and thrash out fresh tariffs After all it couldnt afford to let payments being held up for months on end Moreover if MSEB was not drawing enough power from the MW Phase I of the project claiming financial inability to service the purchases what is the guarantee that it would draw power when the larger MW Phase II comes up Putting up capacities when the goods dont sell doesnt make sense So to salvage the investment Enron realised that it had little option but to renegotiate with the state government Then it simply became a matter of fortifying positions ahead of the negotiations In short it is trying to convey that it will negotiate but it better be a deal that satisfies the Houston Texasbased company The problem as far as the DPC is concerned is the high tariff it charged the MSEB These have been as high as Rs per unit at times Critics of the project consisting of politicians bureaucrats and NGOs have said that this is crippling MSEB The fixed cost alone for the first phase of MW is Rs crore per month This means that MSEB has to pay DPC Rs crore whether it buys power or not This fixed charge will rise to Rs crore per month when the second phase is commissioned by December For the MSEB which rakes in around Rs crore per month the prospect of paying out Rs crore to one supplier is a nightmare What does the immediate future offer In the next few weeks expect Enron and the negotiating committee to open direct parleys There will be hard bargaining on both sides By deciding to to send its nominees into the renegotiating committee the Government of India has made it clear that it is taking the issue very seriously Earlier the government was content to treat it as a fight between the state government MSEB and DPC But the fact that unpaid bills were being claimed from its own account through the counterguarantee clauses seems to have forced the Centre to be much more careful in what the two sides agree on Indeed the central government has just realised what a mess it had got itself into It had sided with MSEB when it decided not to honour the counter guarantee invoked by DPC for the December bill of Rs crore But that got the Centre embroiled in an arbitration proceeding over this amount And above all the central government being the sovereign cannot be seen as being so petty as to wriggle out of its obligations One false move and the entire worth of the Centres word would be laid to waste Playing on that Enron is trying to show that any renegotiations on its part are in the nature of mercy concessions since it has a valid signed contract no one messes with it What this means is that there is no way the state government MSEB and the Government of India can shy away from their obligations of paying the DPC bills MSEB owes at least Rs crore to DPC for December and January Indeed DPC made it clear to the Godbole committee that nothing was sacred However it would negotiate at a common forum which consists of all the three other affected parties MSEB the Maharashtra government and the Union government This concern of DPC has already been met The issue of what is to be renegotiated still remains The Godbole committee itself had laid out the extent of concessions for each of the parties to the deal and had warned that unless the entire package is agreed upon this round of negotiations will end like the previous round held in The committee said The renegotiations will be a complete failure and will only end up complicating matters further These recommendations are well known and documented now However for the record the Godbole panel has recommended splitting the liquefied natural gas LNG project from the power project DPC has set up a million tonne LNG terminal of which only million tonne is for the power plant However the entire cost of the LNG facility has been loaded on to the power project If this recommendation is accepted it will first bring down the cost of the power project Then it will eliminate the need for MSEB to buy about million tonne of LNG whether it wants it or not This in turn will relieve MSEB of an annual burden of million The excess LNG could be marketed to other players which are mushrooming The Reliance and Essar groups as well as Petronet LNG are keen to set up LNG terminals in western India It has also said that the equity return for the DPC tariff be defined in rupees than in dollar terms This will insulate the tariff from exchange rate fluctuations It further adds that this tariff should be benchmarked to the lowest cost of power supply from other gasbased plants in the world The committee has recommended that the sale of power be allowed to others apart from MSEB This is possible only if the tariff is brought down to rates comparable with other producers Central utilities like the National Thermal Power Corporation NTPC and the Power Trading Corporation besides power companies like BSES and Tata Power have already made it clear that they are not keen on buying DPC power at the current rates BSES and Tata Power charge their customers only between Rs to Rs per unit The least cost DPC power works out to Rs per unit What happens if the renegotiations fail and Enron decides to pull out of the project Will it mean the end of foreign direct investment in a sector which is starved of funds There has been little investment in the power sector over the last decade due to the poor financial health of the state electricity boards The health of these boards has in fact deteriorated over the last decade when reforms have been launched Unless this basic problem is addressed there will be little investment coming into this sector says R V Shahi CMD of power major BSES This is a point of view that is echoed in the Godbole committee report which is otherwise quite critical of DPC The report warns The committee would like to state strongly that none of the solutions espoused for independent power projects in general and DPC in particular is tenable without the reform of MSEB especially its distribution business The day MSEB reforms and its finances are in order Bansal and Lal will smile more often India waits for a rediscovery Paran Balakrishnan Business Standard Copyright c Business Standard Has India slipped off the world map once again Or is it about to be rediscovered now that times are turning tough and inventories are piling up in the international marketplace Six years ago international bankers and corporations couldnt get enough of India In everyones mind India was the Promised Land with a gigantic population that was hungering for everything from electricity to televisions and Black Label whisky Foreign investors bought the GDRs of companies like Garden Vareli and Arvind Mills that were selling extraordinary growth stories The world has altered beyond recognition since then The foreign investors discovered the harsh truth that a gigantic market by itself doesnt always add up to huge sales Many investors burnt their fingers buying GDR issues in companies that soon became terminally ill The enthusiasm for India ebbed gradually but it returns from time to time India became the flavour of the season about one year ago when hitech fever was at its frenzied peak Suddenly investors decided that India was logging on to the world and would soon be a good bet once again Businessmen like Azim Premji were written about in magazines around the world and it was hard not to notice Indias hitech revolution Plenty has happened since then and its a safe bet that anyone who invested in the Indian stock market one year ago must have lost money if he didnt get out in doublequick time What about the giant investments that everyone predicted would flow into India A few years ago former finance minister P Chidambaram told an audience in London that foreign investment in India would easily touch billion by It hasnt even touched half that amount in and theres certainly no sign that it is about to pick up sharply The fact is that brokers analysts and the global corporations are a bit tired of India This country is a rickety and rumbunctious democracy and it suffers from a degree of unpredictability that foreigners find baffling The stock market had just begun to pick up when the Tehelka tapes threw it off course once again The body blow came after bull operator Ketan Parekh was arrested and accused of manipulating the market Says one Londonbased broker You never know what to expect It is just one thing after another On another front the signals are getting mixed by the continuing travails of Enron and the Maharashtra government As everyone knows the worlds power position has changed unimaginably and companies like Enron have discovered that there are electricity shortages in places like California Suddenly their enthusiasm for the developing world has waned rapidly Nevertheless foreign money is still pouring into the stock markets As the Dow Jones Index and the Nasdaq grind to a halt it is clear that there wont be super profits in these markets for several years to come Suddenly with the index at Mumbai looks a better bet The market is almost certainly undervalued and there are definitely bargains to be had Back in the mids growth in the United States had slowed to a halt and the giant corporations decided that they had to get to Europe and South East Asia where growth was ticking along at a comfortable pace Come the s and the action has shifted back to America It is extremely likely that the wheel is about to turn once again and this time countries like China and India could be in sharp focus Does it matter what foreign businessmen think about India The answer is definitely yes Foreign money has changed the balance of power on the Bombay Stock Exchange And the globe has shrunk with email and swifter jet travel And with the WTO policing the world India must learn to play by the rules of the game It must learn to look like a star of the business world and do business like one Enron gets set to pull the plug on power project South China Morning Post c Copyright South China Morning Post Publishers All Rights Reserved A dispute over unpaid debts owed to a United States power conglomerate is casting a cloud over Indias foreign investment hopes After a year battle the countrys largest direct foreign investor is ready to retreat but the Indians could be the longterm losers Texasbased Enron this week took a big step toward abandoning an almostcomplete US billion project in India The board of Dabhol Power the Indian subsidiary of Enron met in London on Wednesday and authorised the companys managing director to issue a preliminary notice to terminate the project which has been billed as the worlds largest naturalgasfired power plant The Times of India reported The board has given powers to the management to issue the pretermination notice But the meeting unanimously felt the need of the hour was not to terminate the project but to initiate a renegotiation process Vinay Bansal chairman of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB was quoted as saying by the newspaper The notice is the first of three steps that could end in the abandonment of the US billion project A sixmonth reconciliation period would follow any move by Dabhol to issue the termination notice Mr Bansal said In the past six months the MSEB has defaulted on bills for electricity supplied by Dabhol which operates another plant kilometres south of Bombay Late on Thursday the MSEB said it had paid Dabhol Power billion rupees about HK million for electricity it bought in March But the payment only partially resolves the total overdue amount of billion rupees which Enron has been unable to collect even after invoking guarantees issued by the government of Maharashtra and the federal government The state utility also owes Enron payments for power delivered in December and January Neither government is willing to foot the bill for a project which has proved expensive and hugely unpopular Yet failing to meet obligations with Enron threatens to reinforce the image of India as a poor investment climate making it harder for the nation to raise the huge sums needed to improve its infrastructure Ironically Enron was once viewed as playing a lead role in sparking infrastructureinvestment led growth A decade ago the company offered to build a string of power plants after India rolled out the red carpet to multinationals The country needed to add megawatts of generating capacity a year to meet demand that was growing at per cent to per cent annually However years of socialism had left the nation with a network of moneylosing staterun utilities incapable of paying the estimated billion rupees per year development cost The governments reluctance to reform the domestic power sector meant few domestic companies were willing to build plants Enron and a swarm of other foreign energy companies offered to fill the void Enron quickly struck a deal in the early s to build a plant in Maharashtra a contract renegotiated after a state election brought to power a new government which claimed the terms were too generous and the result of alleged kickbacks Through the deal Enron became the largest foreign investor in the country accounting for per cent of total direct foreign investment in India since The massive project proved hugely unpopular Its power cost more than that from stateowned plants as a result of the rupees depreciation against the US dollar and partly due to the rise in the cost of naphtha the original fuel source At its peak operating rate the plants output cost about rupees per kilowatt hour However because of the payment dispute with the state power board it is running at only per cent of capacity and charges rupees per kilowatt hour more than three times the rate of other suppliers Many Indians believe the Enron contract has bankrupted the state power board and threatens to wreck the shaky state budget if the contract is not renegotiated We dont want Enron They can go and sell their power elsewhere state finance minister Jayant Patil said last month The MW first phase of the project began operating in May and later this year the second phase is due to come on line tripling output to MW That is forcing both sides to toughen their positions as next year the amount owed by the state will more than quadruple to more than US billion a year under the year contract The nasty dispute seems certain to cripple efforts to attract other foreign investment India attracted just US billion in direct foreign investment last year China with a roughly comparable population and an economy twice the size of Indias attracts times more Enron not needed at all says NGO Manjiri Damle The Times of India Copyright C The Times of India Source World Reporter TM PUNE Prayas the consumer watchdog body on electricity has told the energy review committee headed by Dr Madhav Godbole that the costly Enron power project was not needed to meet the energy requirements of the state and that the very legality and clearances given to the project were questionable Prayas was invited by the Godbole committee which is reviewing the controversial project and other private power projects that are coming up in the state to make a submission on the Enron issue The nongovernmental organisation NGO stated that the energy demand of the state was million units MU in fiscal which was expected to go up to MU in fiscal Possible generation from the existing plants would be MU and hence there would be no need to add capacity The state may suffer a peakhour shortfall of to MU which could be mitigated by exploring other options like purchase of captive energy from industrial units Prayas added The NGO told the committee that the MSEBs own generation could be maximised through a series of steps Quality of coal supplied to the MSEBs thermal plants could be improved by blending imported coal thereby generating an additional MW Utilisation of Urans idle capacity could yield another MW Power could also be procured from Tata BSES captive industrial plants and cogeneration by sugar factories On proposed options regarding Enron Prayas stated that the sale of Enron power outside Maharashtra would not be possible because other states would not afford it Besides there would be major legal and contractual problems as well the NGO has said About other private power projects like Bhadrawati Reliance and other liquid fuelbased projects coming up in the state Prayas advised that the government and the MSEB should ensure cancellation of all power purchase agreements PPAs Statewide stir against Enron from March A Staff Reporter The Times of India Copyright C The Times of India Source World Reporter TM PUNE Leftist and socialist parties have planned an intense statewide agitation from March to demand the scrapping of the Enron project Addressing a press conference here on Tuesday general secretary of the committee Prof Ajit Abhyankar said over demonstrators would group under the banner of the antiglobalisation action committee and stage demonstrations at the Enron site in Dabhol We will be ready to face any action from the police he said adding that dharnas would also be held in front of all tehsil offices around the state to coincide with the demonstrations at Dabhol In Pune district demonstrations have been planned at Khed Junnar Haveli Purandar Shirur Maval PimpriChinchwad and other tehsil offices Prof Abhyankar said Over activists are expected to participate in the agitation in the district while a team of Pune activists will leave for Dabhol on Wednesday Prof Abhyankar expressed happiness over the fact that not just the leftists parties but also the common people were participating in the antiEnron drive Although some constituents of the Democratic Front government are trying their best to save Enron a strong section in the government is of the opinion that the Enron agreement is an insult to the state and the Union government he said Without taking names he hinted that the Nationalist Congress Party NCP and the Bharatiya Janata Party BJP may forge an alliance to keep Enron in the state Speaking on the economic aspects Prof Abhyankar said that once the second phase of Enron became operational the MSEB would have to cough up Rs crore annually for buying electricity that the state did not need or could afford Enron India in dispute over future of gasfired power plant By RAMOLA TALWAR BADAM Associated Press Writer Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved DABHOL India AP Workers in yellow helmets scramble up steel girders to fit pipes into place for the worlds largest natural gasfired power plant to be completed off Indias western coast this year by American energy giant Enron Corp But miles away in Bombay government officials say they cannot afford the electricity that Enron is now providing from a naphtha plant at the site and they expect the electricity generated by liquefied natural gas will cost even more Enron is simply unaffordable said Padamsinh Patil energy minister for the state of Maharashtra which includes Bombay The state cannot afford the power so we take less power but still have to pay Enron huge amounts India needs power during the ApriltoOctober hot season the nation had a daily shortfall of nearly megawatts of electricity according to the Center for Monitoring the Indian Economy Enrons naphtha and gas plants at Dabhol will together be able to generate about megawatts but politicians have trouble with the price Aging coal and gasfired plants that have been depreciated can charge about two rupees cents per kilowatt hour while Enrons naphtha plant has been charging to cents Everyone wants to use us to blame for the systemic problem that the state electricity boards in this country sell power for less than it costs them to generate or buy power said K Wade Cline president of Enron India Despite the protests Cline believes that the billion project Indias biggestever foreign investment will go on line at the end of An advantage for Enron and the major complaint against it is a unique contract that requires the federal government to pay up in case of default by Maharashtra Another grievance is that the Enron deal requires Maharashtra to pay for electricity even if it doesnt use it Enron invoked the federal guarantee in February when the state utility said it could not afford to pay Dabhol Power Corp Houstonbased Enrons Indian subsidiary But before the national government stepped in state officials paid million in overdue bills Enron says it is owed million for power delivered in December and January The February power bill has already been paid and Krishna Rao member of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board said Wednesday the March electricity bill was being paid The state bailout drew attention to the Enron deal with opponents again raising questions about the cost to be borne for foreign investment and development The debate comes as the government in New Delhi tries to reduce subsidies and sell off stateowned enterprises Enron says federal payment guarantees were essential because few foreign companies were willing to invest when India began opening its economy in the early s Who wanted to come to India at that time Very few companies did said Cline We came along with some others and said were willing to invest because we think India has a bright future Preparing for that future workers at Dabhol clamber around inside an LNG tank that could fit three jets stacked one atop another They weld a steelreinforced dome while others outside drill concrete blocks for the milelong jetty where the LNG tanker Laxmi meaning wealth in Hindi is scheduled to dock in November Enron says LNG is the cleanest and most economical fuel but Bombay politicians have their doubts They point at electricity prices that have increased fourfold which Enron attributes to the rise to the jump in oil prices and a depreciation of the Indian rupee Opponents of the project say the government should have invested in its own power plant instead of tying up with a foreign company Were not against foreign companies but the Enron project is a sure pill for Indias financial collapse said Pradyumna Kaul an antiEnron activist It will bankrupt the nation Both sides should agree to a separation and abort the contract now Enron believes a crackdown on power theft and reduction of waste in transmission and distribution would generate enough money to pay for Dabhols electricity A state governmentappointed committee agreed and this month called for reform of the state power utility that defaulted on its payments to Enron But the fivemember panel also insisted on lower tariffs and urged renegotiating the price agreement Enron chief executive Jeffrey Skilling likened the India situation to the power woes being felt in California The utility offers a fixed rate to their customers and the wholesale costs of electricity have gone up like they have in the US he said from Enron headquarters in Houston The distribution company is having a liquidity squeeze identical to what you have with Pacific Gas Electric Meanwhile at Dabhol managers are moving to the next phase training workers to man tug boats to guide that first LNG tanker into port When you first go into these villages with helicopters bulldozers theyre nervous as any of us would

natural gas and power prices pumped up investors have electrified the stocks of the major energytrading companies over the past year For Enron Corp however the surge was shortcircuited Enron the nations top natural gas trader and the leading wholesale electricity marketer has been punished on Wall Street for the past seven months Its stock price has fallen more than percent since August in large part because of investor pessimism toward the companys nascent highspeed Internet unit Just as Enron shares were inflated by speculative enthusiasm for Enron Broadband Services Inc they lost considerable gas when investors realized the unit would not be profitable for a couple of years said Jeff Skilling Enrons president and chief executive Meanwhile the stock prices of Enron competitors Duke Energy Corp Dynegy Inc Reliant Energy Inc and El Paso Corp seen doubledigit percentage growth for the year thanks to volatile natural gas and electricity prices an essential ingredient for profits in the energytrading business Enrons success as a buyer and seller of power contracts helped shield its own stock for a while Skilling said but the weak Internet unit left them feeling a little bit like a duck in a pond And there are still a lot of hunters around that pond with a lot of ammo left The only way to resuscitate Enrons stock price now Skilling said is to improve earnings The Houstonbased company has done just that Its wholesale electricity trading operations fueled a percent growth in net profit during the three months ended March But a recent spate of negative news about the company has kept investors jittery In March Enrons attempt to sell its Portland General Electric Co unit to Reno Nevadabased Sierra Pacific Resources fell apart and its exclusive year videoondemand partnership with Blockbuster Inc was called off Enron also has been dogged lately by difficulties collecting money from customers in India where a utility has defaulted on nearly million in payments and in California where the companys exposure to the bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric Co is about million The deflated valuation of Enrons stock however is most directly linked to its moneylosing broadband unit People ascribed a lot of value to the units business plan said Dennis Higgins an energy analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Enron Broadband Services delivers speedy Web services over its nationwide fiberoptic network and sells bandwidth as a commodity to telecommunications firms such as BellSouth Corp and Qwest Communications International Inc It lost million in the first quarter but Skilling said the whollyowned subsidiary is gaining traction though it would not be profitable for another two or three years Financial analysts now either ignore the Internet services division when discussing Enrons outlook for and early or they go out of their way in research reports to highlight reduced expectations for Enron Broadband Ronald Barone an energy analyst at UBS Warburg put a positive spin on the collapse in broadband valuation in a recent research note The downward revision of some highly aggressive price targets well above were healthy steps in getting this once top performer back on track to delivering solid shareholder returns he said Barone still says Enrons stock will reach this level only it will take months instead of months The companys firstquarter profit was million as it swapped electricity and natural gas contracts at a time when low supplies and high demand drove up energy prices nationwide The stocks of Enrons competitors have chugged along since April but Enron shares have fallen about percent The Williams Companies Inc which also invested heavily in telecommunications has also been a weak performer on Wall Street compared to its rivals remaining basically unchanged since a year ago Donato Eassey an energy analyst at Merrill Lynch said Enrons shares are due for a turnaround predicting that the floodgates are going to open At a time when the United States is short on supplies of natural gas and electricity and demand is on the rise few companies are bettersuited than Enron to help folks deal with those high prices

Portlandsources By Andrew Callus Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited LONDON April Reuters Scottish Power Plc has held talks with Enron Corp about buying its Portland Oregonbased power utility Portland General a good geographic fit for the British groups existing US arm PacifiCorp industry sources said on Monday Its an obvious one and yes there have been discussions said one source speaking after the official breakdown last week of energy trader Enrons talks to sell Portland to Nevadabased utility Sierra Pacific Resources Corp PacifiCorp operates in six US states including Oregon and has its headquarters in Portland the state capital Utility holding company Sierra had been preparing to pay about billion for Portland and assume billion in debt But the deal ran into trouble as the US West Coast power crisis unfolded earlier this year and talks were officially called off last Thursday Reports that Britains biggest utility may step in for Portlands customer base and megawatts of generating capacity surfaced at the weekend in Britains Observer newspaper PacifiCorp faces its own power crisis fallout including million a day buyingin costs resulting from the failure of one of its generators The problems have helped depress Scottish Powers share price to a point where it now registers five percent UK sector underperformance over the past two years And analysts said Portland has a significant exposure to current high US power prices with only about megawatts of its own generating capacity but megawatts of peak demand to satisfy US utility acquisitions are always fraught with regulatory difficulties and in this case an additional regulatory complication is that Portland owns a decommissioning nuclear power station COST SAVING OPPORTUNITIES Nevertheless Scottish Power has said it intends to expand further in the US to exploit opportunities for merger cost savings in a highly fragmented market The groups English rival National Grid Group was able to take out percent of New England utility EUAs cost base by merging it with neighbouring power group NEES last year Its current weak share price and lack of cash after the PacifiCorp buy has hindered development but in March it made clear it might sell its UK water business Southern Water The proceeds are earmarked for acquisition purposes and industry sources have put the price sought at billion pounds billion Enel of Italy has confirmed an interest On Monday Scottish Power was tightlipped We do not comment on market speculation said a spokesman But analysts said Portland was an obvious choice given that it serves mainly the city of Portland and its surrounding area in the middle of one of PacifiCorps key markets Its hard to see them finding a better company to buy in terms of geographic fit and potential cost savings said Peter Atherton of Schroder Salomon Smith Barney who released a note last week pointing out the opportunity But he is wary of the move On the surface selling Southern Water and acquiring PGE Portland would appear attractive for SPW said the research note However the loss of Southern Waters predictable earnings profile would at least short term put pressure on earnings and dividend cover Scottish Power will face questions about Portland and Southern Water at its annual results presentations on Thursday this week Analysts predict pretax profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items of million pounds for the year to March down from million a year earlier Lower wholesale prices and regulatory price cuts on retail and distribution in the UK will more than offset the effect of a complete full year contribution from PacifiCorp which only fed into Scottish Powers profits for four months in the previous year A change to accounting practices which alters the way deferred taxation is treated will also account for about million pounds of the profit fall analysts said with higher telecoms losses also a factor

Himendra Kumar Dow Jones Newswires Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved SURVEY ENERGY UTILITY REVIEW US edges closer to new energy policy The recent power crisis in California has raised American awareness of the situation and the Bush administration seems to be more committed to the problem writes David Buchan Financial Times Apr By DAVID BUCHAN The US is striving towards some kind of energy policy When it eventually gets one the impact on the rest of the world will be considerable The longterm health of the worlds biggest economy depends on resolution of its domestic energy problems It also has an impact on the market and climate generally as the worlds biggest importer of oil and emitter of greenhouse gases The US is also home to the worlds largest private energy sector but also has a government prone to use energy as a weapon of foreign policy Through sanctions Washington has kept its own companies out of certain oilproducing countries and tried to keep others out too The only absolutely clear thing about the Bush administrations national energy policy is that it wants one That itself is a change Like governments in other industrialised countries Washington has steadily retreated from the energy sector It has moved from tight administration fixing natural gas prices for example to loose regulation shared in electricity with states and local governments The US has a Strategic Petroleum Reserve created after the s oil shocks and actually used it last year In extremis the US is also willing to go to war for oil as it showed in the Gulf conflict years ago But the general sentiment was that the marketplace would provide a solution and that energy problems like bad weather and economic cycles to which they are related could be relied on to fade away This complacency has been blown away by the California power crisis last years runup in world oil prices partly due to US gasoline and heating oil shortages and the arrival in the White House of a president and vicepresident with a background in Texan oil The Texasbased oil and gas industry tends to see the crisis as primarily one of supply In the past years according to the American Petroleum Institute US oil output has fallen from m barrels a day to m bd This is despite the fact that companies now drill deeper to an average of feet compared to feet in cheaper average well cost of Dollars compared with Dollars in real terms in and better a per cent success ratio compared with per cent in During the same period imports both crude and refined product have risen from m bd to just over m bd Natural gas output has not fallen off to the same degree But nor in a sense can it Environmental factors have driven up demand for gas faster than for oil Unlike oil it cannot be imported by sea except in the liquefied form that still accounts for only per cent of US gas consumption After the trough in activity companies spurred on by higher gas prices are now pressing every available rig into service for drilling in the US and Canada But they are having to run hard just to stay in place Mark Pappa Houstonbased chief executive of EOG formerly Enron Oil and Gas and now one of the most active drillers in North America explains why We are now getting gas out of the ground faster than we can find it because technology in accelerated extraction is advancing faster than in seismology he says As a result the rate at which production declines as a share of the base is rising from an average annual decline rate of per cent in to per cent in In the Gulf of Mexico decline rates can go up to per cent a year says Mr Pappa So the industry is eyeing federal land The federal government owns onethird of US land but where years ago per cent of this was available for drilling leases now only per cent is The industry hopes with reason that the Bush administration will reverse this trend However this will not be easy The administrations plan to open up part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ANWR to drilling has stirred strong opposition There are obstacles elsewhere too While the federal government owns and could in theory lease the entire outer continental shelf for drilling in practice California blocks exploitation of the Pacific while Florida even under Governor Jeb Bush the presidents brother insists on keeping the drillers away from both its coasts Companies would also like to make fuller use of what leases they have says John Seitz president of Anadarko His company currently North Americas most active driller on m acres is doubling operations in the Rockies but often has to dismantle rigs temporarily during the wildlife breeding and tourist seasons If access to resources is a problem so is the infrastructure to get it to market A new report produced jointly by the Baker Institute in Houston and the Council on Foreign Relations in New York points out how deregulation was initially smoothed by surplus capacities along the entire energy chain accumulated in the days of governmentsubsidised industry and falling demand The excess capacity existed in refineries tankers pipelines rigs and of course in power generation It allowed expansion of energy use without significantly affecting underlying costs says the report The surplus capacity has largely vanished under the impact of deregulation the accompanying price volatility that has made new investment risky and quite separate pressures from environmental regulation Take oil refineries Twenty years ago the US had of them with a combined capacity of m bd and overall utilisation of per cent Last year the country had refineries with a m bd capacity that was per cent used It is the same story with the nuclear reactors that provide per cent of US electricity Not a single new nuclear plant permit has been issued since the year of the Three Mile Island accident But reregulation is to blame for another handicap the proliferation of regional gasoline standards complicating refining and logistic problems and frequently causing local shortages and prices spikes A single standard was never going to suffice in so large a country with for instance milehigh Denver requiring a less volatile fuel than lowlying Houston But states and cities have increasingly used the Clean Air Act and the replacement of lead in fuel to demand that the oil companies provide them with differing cocktails of gasoline and diesel to suit their environmental needs The upshot is that the oil companies are now asked to provide more than different fuels California the northeast and the upper midwest require gasoline reformulated to be more oxygenated and less smelly Atlanta demands a lower sulphur and less evaporative fuel than the rest of Georgia and garages in the two halves of the city of St Louis because they are in two different states have to sell different types of gasoline The standards are unenforceable in the sense that drivers cannot be confined to a certain zone simply by virtue of what they carry in their tank But this has not lessened local authorities enthusiasm for them In this area as in that of electricity infrastructure it is hard to see what the Bush administration can do to prevent such balkanisation without riding roughshod over states rights Equally difficult but even more pressing is to forge a single electricity transmission network to carry the huge amounts of power that are being traded across the country by commodity energy brokers such as Enron and Dynegy The federal authorities have slender means at their disposal While it has sole authority over the natural gas trade and network the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Ferc has to share supervision of electricity trade with states which themselves have sole power to rule on the siting of power plants and lines Deregulation has made the latter task harder In the days of local monopolies people knew that at least a power plant however ugly in their backyard would be serving their needs But in todays world of competitive longdistance power trading the plant could be lighting cooling or heating the other end of the country Nonetheless Ferc realises it has to be more of a bully to preach the right model for US power even if that means treading on state sensibilities We were overly deferential to Californias rules and market design says one Ferc official US companies hope President Bush will give them a freer run at foreign as well as domestic oil The US has trade and investment bans on eight countries of which Iraq Iran and Libya are Opec members and a fourth Sudan a growing oil producer The upshot according to Cambridge Energy Research Associates may be to reduce the production capacity of the three sanctioned Opec producers by m bd That in turn makes the world market tighter than it would otherwise have been to the obvious detriment of such a big oil importer as the US US companies clearly fret more at the unilateral sanctions on Iran and Libya than the multilateral United Nations embargo on Iraq which also restricts their competitors It may also be time for the US to recognise not only how outdated the notion of energy independence at home is but also the wisdom of cloaking its foreign energy policy in a more multilateral guise The Baker InstituteCouncil on Foreign Relations report suggests ways this might be done The US could take a less confrontational line towards Opec on prices set Russia an example by signing the European energy charter treaty that governs energy trade and transit and adopt a hemispheric approach to energy relations with Canada and Mexico Copyright The Financial Times Limited SURVEY ENERGY UTILITY REVIEW Move to build a stronger base on alternative cleaner power ECONOMICS OF ENERGY SUPPLY RENEWABLE POWER by Matthew Jones Recent figures indicate that up to there was more than MW of installed windpower capacity around the world the majority of which was in Europe and mainly in Germany Denmark and Spain Financial Times Apr By MATTHEW JONES Earlier this year Shea Homes the tenth largest house builder in the US struck a deal with solar cell manufacturer AstroPower to make solar power a standard feature in new homes in San Diego California With a shortage of electricity in California and rolling blackouts sweeping the state Shea had spotted a market for environmentally friendly homes in which the owners could take control of their own power generation This relatively modest move which Shea hopes to extend to a further homes in the next months is one indication of the way in which new energy technologies are becoming more mainstream In the US Europe and to a lesser extent Asia manufacturers of solar cells wind turbines fuel cells and microturbines are reporting booming sales AstroPower has already sold all of the cells it can make for this year Robin Batchelor manager of Merrill Lynch Investment Managers new energy technology fund says the growth is being driven by environmental pressure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and concerns about power quality and reliability from centralised generation systems in some parts of the world The California power crisis has raised awareness of some of these technologies and at the same time has allowed manufacturers to demonstrate that they work On top of this many countries around the world are offering fiscal incentives to build green power plants and improvements in the technology are bringing the costs more into line with conventional power generation Windpower is leading the way so far The most uptodate industry figures show more than MW of installed capacity around the world at the end of Of this per cent was installed in Europe mainly in Germany Denmark and Spain per cent in North America and the remaining per cent largely in the AsiaPacific region Photovoltaic or solar cells are further behind because of relatively higher equipment costs About MW of capacity had been installed at the end of in countries belonging to the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development A recent report by Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein the German banking group forecasts that both wind and solar power generating capacity will grow by per cent a year in the next five years to MW and MW respectively Longer term figures produced by Royal DutchShell the AngloDutch oil group show solar power overtaking wind in and becoming the worlds overall largest source of electricity by Fuel cells which convert hydrogen to electricity heat and water vapour through an electrochemical reaction are still at a relatively embryonic stage but are developing rapidly Manufacturers such as Ballard Power Systems of Canada and Fuel Cell Energy FCE of the US have in recent months begun to make the transition from pilot projects to first commercial sales Ballard which specialises in fuel cells for the transportation market has signed an agreement to supply cells for public buses in European cities FCE produces larger fuel cells for the stationary power market It is expected this summer to win a contract to supply fuel cells to Connecticut under an agreement with Enron the US energy group The pace of deployment of fuel cells into the transport market is currently uncertain and will depend on the motor and oil industries agreeing what fuel to use as a source of hydrogen The ideal solution is to use pure hydrogen gas but oil companies argue that this requires a lot of storage capacity and would mean building a new fuel infrastructure around the world at vast expense Other solutions are being developed including the use of methanol or ordinary petrol from which hydrogen can be produced onboard the vehicle via a reformer Industry observers are more confident about the market for stationary fuel cells According to a study published in March by Allied Business Intelligence an independent US researcher global electricity generating capacity from fuel cells will grow from just MW in to MW by The countries expected to take the lead are the US Germany and Japan Microturbines are seen as an intermediary step towards fuel cells allowing efficient smallscale generation of electricity from a variety of more traditional fuels including natural gas propane diesel kerosene and methanebased gases sourced from landfill or wastewater sites Growth in sales has accelerated in the last year driven in large part by the California energy crisis Capstone one of the leading manufacturers saw its microturbine sales more than triple last year and has a backlog of orders for Some in the energy industry believe the surge in the use of new energy technologies may now be under threat following the refusal by the US to ratify the Kyoto agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions Recent policy statements by the new Bush administration indicate it is more focused on developing fossil fuels and solving the immediate energy shortages than increasing the use of alternative energy forms However the European Union appears to be gathering enough support to push ahead with the agreement without the US In spite of his stand against Kyoto president Bush has also agreed to extend fiscal incentives for electricity generated from wind power and biomass for another three years a move that has been greeted favourably by the markets

magnesium industry dawns GOLDEN TRIANGLE RESOURCES NL ASXSIGNALG HOMEX Melbourne MEDIA RELEASE CONTINUED WOODSREEF REFINERY PROJECT AND ASSOCIATED THIRD PARTY POWER STATION The Board is well aware that a major factor limiting the growth of the magnesium market has been attitudes of users competing products such as plastics and other metals and the lack of a large sustainable quality supply Environmental imperatives and the need to reduce fuel usage globally is deemed to be the strongest imperative as evidenced by Fords extension of the contract for take out with AMC If we are to aspire to become a major supplier of value added products then we must have our own independent source of supply and be able to guarantee its quality and continuity Underpinning our offer of strategic reliability cost and quality regimes is the Companys parallel strategy to offer additional longterm security of supply for companies that choose to work with us GTLs wholly owned subsidiary Pacific Magnesium Pty Ltd plans to build a magnesium refinery in northern New South Wales Australia and is now engaged in initial elements of the definitive and bankable stages of feasibility The cost of this activity is estimated at M It has been the practice of the Board to seek to raise funds as needed to meet set goals We have sufficient funds available to continue with our RD program and refinery evaluation work having just completed a site evaluation study and we are in the process of creating a feedstock protocol It is apparent to us that the development of the alloying technology has more immediate prospects for revenue generation and alliance participation when compared to the longer lead time and costs for the apparatus pilot and the refinery bankable feasibility design and construction A key driver in our strategic positioning is our environmental advantage and we are informing governments industry and commerce across of the globe of this now Using serpentinite as the feedstock this production facility would be designed to capture the green environmental label since unlike magnesite there is no carbon dioxide in our feedstock Additionally the Company will undertake no mining to gain access to its feedstock unlike the magnesite mines in Queensland Northern Territory South Australia and Tasmania GTL also proposes to remove and neutralise environmentally harmful tailings that are currently the responsibility of the NSW government This will potentially save the taxpayers millions of dollars This refinery once completed has the potential to provide from its planned completion date in and beyond security of supply of high quality metal and alloys If the apparatus is ready we propose to use it AN OFFER TO GOVERNMENT TO COJOINTLY DEVELOP THE VALUE ADDING TECHNOLOGIES IN AUSTRALIA GTL has made an offer to the Federal Victorian and NSW governments seeking their interest in establishing an RD laboratory here in Australia to focus on the alloying and the electrolyser research and development and commercialisation The necessary prototypes could be built here in association with industry government and academia from a major university working with our research venture at Bell Gurion University in Israel The proposed activities could include design construction and testing of multifunctional technological plants for the production of magnesium and its alloys electrical furnaces for the production of magnesium alloys with components of highly different densities including alloys with special characteristics facilities for the continuous casting of thin sheets or bands of magnesium alloys A THIRD PARTY POWER STATION We have all seen the debate on the critical state of energy supply here in Australia and recently in the USA The price and availability of reliable energy is critical to our proposal There is no power station near Woodsreef There is a lowlevel availability to Barraba We have held extensive discussions with suppliers governments State and Federal and with industry experts The refinery requires an electricity supply of between MW and MW base load and the Board has determined that experienced energy corporations will be invited to propose a build own and operate scenario with GTR as the base contract Any surplus would be offered in the growing Australian national electricity market Local businesses and local government shires in the region have been canvassed with a view to creating a supply regime GTR has received a written offer from Enron Australia one of the worlds largest energy traders and producers to act as the trader of both electricity and a magnesium metal hedge We have had positive discussions on this and will move towards a more defined outcome as a part of our planned bankable feasibility study TARGETED REVENUE STREAMS At this early stage of assessment and given the immaturity of the current global market unknown growth cycle and competitive response from plastics and other substitutes it is very difficult to assess the revenue streams and associated costs We are therefore refraining from making definitive claims Our assembled investigation and discussions with industry participants indicates a potential revenue stream in the hundreds of millions of dollars per annum In support of this we have focused on the history of the aluminium industry as a major pointer of the possible future values Magnesium metal and its alloying properties indicate a high potential for application in the industry sectors described in the opening paragraphs of this document This coupled with the impetus of environmental regulatory frameworks across the globe demanding reductions in weight and greenhouse emissions underlies our confidence in GTLs vision outlined above Published material including that of the Light Metals Action Agenda background paper on aluminium magnesium and titanium issues published by the Department of Industry Science and Resources of the Australian Government values the revenue generation for the Australian aluminium industry at over AUD billion annually Among other things this publication says the magnesium industry is at a stage of development where key players are represented by a number of magnesium metal projects as with aluminium end users are likely to become key players as increased demand for light metals drives growth Nov Further the publication says according to one analyst rising demand for light weight automotive components could see world magnesium production increase from its current level of thousand tonnes to million tonnes

its sale quite possibly to Enel for close to Lbn a precursor to a bn move for Oregonbased Portland General Last week long term sale negotiations between Enron owner of this PacifiCorp neighbour and Sierra Pacific broke down but we believe Portland Generals short power position would increase rather than decrease the companys risk profile With these uncertainties and the Californian situation set to remain a drag on profits for some time the shares are likely to be held back Vivendi Environnement Q Data Even though shareholder Vivendi Universal has already released Q data Vivendi Environnements Q isnt due until the end of the week or even Monday next For the three months to end March we look for sales of ebn and EBITDA of ebn There will have been further benefit on consolidation from e weakness Q e was more favourable than a year earlier So far the US operations do not appear to be affected overall by the economic slowdown the water business has benefited from a

Jackson Opens Houston Project Office Houston Chronicle InvestingMONEY A Slamarama For The New Economy Money Magazine Enron CEO Skilling Reinvents Company Unnerving Investors New York Enron CEO Skilling Reinvents Company Unnerving Investors Published in May issue of Bloomberg Markets Houston May Bloomberg A year ago Enron Corp CEO Jeffrey Skilling put up a banner in the lobby of his companys Houston office tower that welcomed visitors to The Worlds Leading Energy Company Skilling has now decided that the companys tag should be more ambitious The Worlds Leading Company the banner says today Its no shock that even the CEO isnt sure how to describe Enron for its a company swept by constant change In the s Skilling transformed a regulated gaspipeline company into the largest competitor in the business of trading energy mainly natural gas and electric power Now Skilling is pushing the company into Internet trading of all sorts of things paper products plastics metals fiberoptic bandwidth commercial credit pollution emission controls and even weather derivatives All of this morphing unnerves investors and some of the companys ventures may not be growing as fast as Enron says according to analysts and industry insiders They say the company is overstating the value of the new businesses its entering Some investors are increasingly concerned about a lack of clarity regarding where the company is going and what exactly it does now Owning Enron is a bit of a leap of faith said John Hancock Advisers Inc mutual fund manager Greg Phelps who invests billion in utility stocks and doesnt own any Enron I want to buy a stock where I have absolute certainty about the business and direction its headed Exuding Nervous Energy Skilling a man who exudes nervous energy and speaks in rapidfire bursts says his track record should ease investors concerns In the first quarter of Enrons profit from operations rose percent to million as revenue almost quadrupled to billion Enron shares have soared more than fold since the start of the decade four times the gain of the Standard Poors Index Enrons shares have dropped percent this year closing at on April Enron isnt merely a trading company Skilling says Its a logistics concern that ties together supply and demand for any given commodity and then figures out the most costefficient way to deliver that commodity to its destination Skilling who joined Enron in after leading McKinsey Cos energy and chemical consulting practices is unapologetic about moving the company in so many different directions In five years well be a different company he said Were not finished reinventing ourselves Billion in Assets Enron owns billion in assets including miles of pipeline that span states and transport percent of all of the natural gas consumed in the US The company owns an mile fiberoptic network in the US and controls power plants and other energy projects in countries on four continents Pinpointing what Enron does isnt easy Some businesses are simple to grasp In Enron won billion in energy management contracts from such giant corporations as OwensIllinois Inc and International Business Machines Corp The bulk of Enrons money percent of revenue and more than fourfifths of profit in came from wholesale energy operations and services what it calls the financialization of energy Cloaked in Secrecy This is largely the gas and electricity trading business it pioneered Enron cloaks the details of that business in secrecy citing competitive reasons which makes its breadandbutter activities as difficult to understand as the abstract Joan Miro lithograph that looms behind Skillings desk Enron keeps a lot of facts close to the vest said Andre Meade an analyst at Commerzbank Capital Markets That makes constructing earnings models a real challenge Even many of Enrons employees are shielded from the intricacies of Enrons business Signs in stairwells and on office walls forbid employees from freely moving around the building into trading rooms and other offlimits areas For now Wall Street is betting that behind closed doors Skilling and company will figure out how to extend Enrons trading prowess into fastgrowing industries Of the analysts who track Enron of them rate the stock a buy Enron traded at times earnings on April Thats exactly double the priceearnings ratio of for rival Duke Energy Corp the biggest US utility owner and energy trader and percent higher than the SP s April multiple GE of the New Economy Enron is uniquely positioned to be the GE of the new economy said Merrill Lynchs Donato Eassey This isnt a management team to bet against With analyst expectations so positive some longtime Enron holders are selling stock Especially with its high valuation the stocks risky and I dont see much upside said Timothy Ghriskey senior portfolio manager at Dreyfus Corp which controls funds that sold about million Enron shares at the end of If they fail to deliver for one reason or another things could get ugly Enron says its sales will swell to at least billion Analysts and investors say there are several trouble spots that could slow its growth Trading Broadband Bandwidth At a lateJanuary meeting in Houston Skilling told analysts and investors and dozens of others hooked in via the Web that Enrons biggest immediate opportunity is its plan to trade broadband bandwidth space on the fiberoptic networks that zip voices data and images around the planet Skilling says that based on discounted cash flow Enrons broadband business is worth billion or a share Thats a hefty valuation considering the business lost million on million in revenue in Enron has already hit a major roadblock in part of its broadband plan delivering videos over its own highspeed fiberoptic network In March Enron and Blockbuster Inc broke off a planned year venture to deliver movies and other content directly into customers homes Enron says Blockbuster didnt provide the quantity and quality of movies needed to deliver the service Enron and Blockbuster Disagree Blockbuster has a different take Blockbuster wanted out of the deal basically because we had a lack of confidence in Enron said Karen Raskopf Blockbusters vice president of corporate communications Specifically Blockbuster maintains that Enron couldnt handle technical issues such as protecting the copyright of the films that were to be distributed Maybe Enron could have worked those details out Raskopf said but we decided there were plenty of other carriers out there that were more sophisticated technically Several analysts and industry executives say that Enrons broadband business isnt worth anywhere near the valuation that Skilling talks about I dont want to be disrespectful because Enrons made remarkable progress from its days as a regulated pipeline said Leo Hindery Jr former CEO of Global Crossing Ltd which like Enron has a nationwide fiberoptic network But theyre way out of their league in the telecommunications business The valuation numbers they throw around are laughable theyll be a bit player at best California Energy Crisis The California energy crisis is likely to derail ongoing efforts to deregulate electricity markets in about states and could slow the opening of markets in several Asian and European countries as well analysts and consultants say eliminating future profit streams Not so says Skilling Deregulation is here to stay despite the problems in California he said adding Deregulation doesnt cause problems Stupid deregulation does Besides he said Enron merely trades and doesnt produce power in California The companys biggest business is in the wholesale market serving utilities and big industrial suppliers not retail customers Japan and Europe Are Opening Up Plus wholesale markets in Japan and Europe are rapidly opening up California wont nick us he said Critics charge that Enron which doesnt reveal its California financial results has been reaping huge profits during the crisis California has been a feeding frenzy with every trading company in the world feasting on it and Enron is the biggest and shrewdest of them all said Michael Shames executive director of the Utility Consumers Action Network Doubters wonder whether Enron can succeed in new businesses like fiber I dont think this industry is going to evolve as swiftly as Enron believes it will said Rod Woodward a telecom services industry analyst at consultancy Frost Sullivan Inc Skilling brushes off such skepticism People who throw stones at us dont keep me up at night he said I worry about whether the air conditioner will blow and knock out our computer servers Proving Naysayers Wrong Skilling contends hes proved the naysayers wrong once before In at the Colorado ski resort of Beaver Creek in his first presentation to energy analysts and investors Skilling outlined his plan to transform Enron from an asset based pipeline company into a trading company I basically laid out our trading model for them said Skilling The crowd yawned They didnt get it I was brilliant So we went out and proved we were right Skillings intensity permeates Enrons headquarters In the lobby about employees wait in line for a Starbucks coffee jolt at pm In the companys elevators TVs blare with messages to maximize revenue There arent many private offices in Enrons headquarters building most floors are open to encourage communication between workers Of the few walls that are around many are write and wash to encourage extemporaneous diagramming Skillings office is filled with toys a mini basketball hoop Koosh Ball rackets for his two sons Hes divorced and also has a daughter Mile Bicycle Ride Hes working himself into shape so this spring he can lead about employees on a mile bicycle ride from Austin to Houston for charity He says he hates his th floor office with its foot ceilings mahogany paneling and sweeping views of the nations fourthlargest city Its too quiet and too removed from any action he said So hes moving to the seventhfloor trading room of a story tower being built across the street from Enrons current headquarters Even on vacations Skilling doesnt kick back Every year the Pittsburgh native and Harvard Business School graduate takes important customers on a trip This isnt the sedate corporate golf outing to Augusta National or Pebble Beach Skilling leads such jaunts as a sevenday trek through the Australian outback and a thousandmile dirt bike expedition in Mexico If I cant bust up a couple bikes I dont really want to go he said GungHo Atmosphere That sort of gung ho atmosphere is a far cry from Enrons early days in when it was formed by the billion merger of InterNorth and Houston National Gas and became the largest naturalgas pipeline company in the US The industry was in the midst of great upheaval as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission began deregulating the gas pipeline business Until then the business could have been the poster boy for overregulation By federal law companies that owned pipelines could sell gas only to a handful of gas and electric utilities along their routes If there were a big freeze in Chicago or a heat wave in Atlanta for instance pipelines couldnt reroute their supply to meet demand In Chairman Kenneth Lay retained Skilling who was then a consultant at McKinsey to help spot opportunities as the business deregulated Government Loosens Rules Over the next few years as the government slowly loosened rules Skilling put together a plan to buy natural gas reserves and package them for sale at various prices to any number of customer specifications fixed prices floating prices with minimum and maximum caps guaranteed increases in supply if temperatures soared or plummeted Both Enron officials and outside analysts say that companies would save as much as percent of their cost of buying gas and Enron would profit from the trades and from packaging other lucrative services such as futures and swaps contracts that companies use to hedge their energy costs There was a lot of initial resistance said Skilling who joined Enron permanently in August Enron engineers had no concept about what we were trying to do They wanted to see the gas It was like trading pork bellies and asking to see the pigs Big Trading Floors With Lays backing Skilling pressed ahead He ripped out walls and built big trading floors to foster interaction At first the business grew slowly through phonebased trading desks In the early days wed sit on our hands a lot said Keith Hannon who was in Enrons power business and is now president and chief operating officer of Enrons broadband unit It took a while to find buyers and sellers and convince them what we could do In the late s Enron extended its gastrading business to electricity The US government encouraged competition in via the Energy Policy Act About half of the states began enacting laws or rules to let electricity generators compete for retail customers on price which opened the door for Enron to replicate its buyandsell gas trading model for electricity In April as Internet mania began sweeping through even oldline corporations John Sherriff head of Enrons European operations and Greg Whalley who was head trader at the time decided to take another look at using the Internet to boost trading volumes Torpedoes Previous Efforts Skilling had torpedoed previous online efforts fearing the complexity of trading energy online and concerned that opening up the system would expose Enron to too much risk So wellknown was his aversion to risk that the team of employees that created EnronOnline didnt even tell Skilling about it until two weeks before it was ready to launch It isnt a typical businesstobusiness exchange that brings buyers and sellers together to negotiate trades At EnronOnline which cost million to put together Enron does all of the buying and selling A trader with gas to market sells it to Enron which then finds a buyer for the fuel Enron either finds a way to deliver the gas or ships it through its own pipes That system enables Enron to skim a profit at every stage of the transaction buying selling and transporting the commodity in addition to packing on lucrative services such as swaps options and forwards Competitors say that energy buyers wont be satisfied with a site that allows them to buy from only one supplier EnronOnline A market is buyers sellers and speculators said Harvey Padewer president of Duke Energy Group which oversees Duke Energys nonutility business EnronOnline is Come buy from me and that isnt a market Skilling counters that Enrons results speak for themselves In its first full year of operation EnronOnline completed transactions with a total value of billion and its European business posted a threefold increase in power trading and a fourfold gain in gas trading Enrons trading and risk management business did especially well last year with revenue up percent and profit up percent because of wide price swings in California and other markets this past winter Those swings prompt energy buyers and sellers to try to lock in prices which Enron does with futures forwards and other financial instruments Volatility is what a trader like Enron thrives on said Merrill Lynchs Eassey Volatility Brings Competitors The volatility also brought in scores of competitors Last July six of Enrons biggest rivals including Duke and El Paso Energy Corp bought stakes in the Intercontinental Exchange as part of a plan to take business from EnronOnline Entergy Corp a New Orleans power company and Koch Industries Inc a closely held refiner and gas pipeline owner formed an energytrading venture in April Other companies including Bloomberg LP parent company of Bloomberg News and BayCorp Holdings Ltd owner of a New Hampshire utility have developed electronic marketplaces for energy Room For Everyone Skilling says theres room for everyone The total wholesale gas and power market in North America Europe and Japan will grow to trillion over the next several years from billion today according to Enron estimates Only about percent of that market has deregulated said Skilling So we still have more than half of the market to go I think a lot of that will be transacted online While the competition is catching up in the business that Enron pioneered the company is forging ahead into new opportunities such as weather People laugh when they hear about us and I hate that said Gene Taylor marketing director of Enrons weather risk management business Weve processed transactions since and have been profitable in each of the last three years Weather brokers at other companies say that Enrons claims sound reasonable This past autumn for example an executive at Bombardier Inc a Montreal aerospace company that also makes snowmobiles did an Internet search for weather trading and found Enron Bombardier was offering customers who bought new snowmobiles by October a refund if total snowfall in their area was less than half of the average of the prior three years Bombardier Example Enron collected money from Bombardier for each snowmobile sold and paid premiums in March so Bombardier could refund customers in lowsnowfall areas Enron has doubled to the size of its weather trading staff and has tripled to the number of meteorologists plucking talent from places like the Weather Channel to grow the business Taylor says his analysis of earnings reports reveals that the bottom lines of percent of all publicly traded companies are somehow affected by weather I see no reason why anyone should wear weather risk when they hedge away things like currency fluctuations Taylor said By bringing weather trading online we have a big opportunity to bring in hundreds of companies and process thousands of weather trades Other major players in this business include Southern Co Aquila Inc and Koch Energy Trading FiberOptic Broadband Opportunity Skilling says weather is a sideshow compared with Enrons biggest business opportunity fiberoptic broadband the hairthin glass tubing that transmits data at the speed of light Until now telecommunications carriers ATT and Level Communications Inc among them had sold bandwidth in fixedrate monthly contracts locking buyers into paying for capacity they didnt always need Enron can offer customers only as much bandwidth as they need and on short notice In October for example Enron signed a threeyear pact to manage the fiberoptic needs of i Technologies Inc a Dallasbased Internet software company Under the deal terms of which werent disclosed Enron will provide i with the capacity to link its headquarters with offices in Parsippany New Jersey Tokyo Brussels and Mumbai and Bangalore India on an asneeded basis Enron will use its own network as well as other unspecified network providers Where Profits Will Come From Skilling expects to profit in the broadband business in other ways as well He hopes Enrons trading system will sell more service through its own network which covers miles a small portion of the miles of fiber in the US He also expects to make money on the spread between buy and sell prices for the bandwidth as well as on related activities like risk management If successful Enron says the business could prove to be a gold mine The global broadband market will expand to as much as billion in from billion in Skilling says and he estimates it could generate billion in annual operating profits in five years Aggressive Estimates Those estimates are too aggressive several analysts consultants and industry executives say especially since at least different fiberoptic networks span North America alone and excess capacity has driven prices down about percent in a year I give them credit for trying to change the market but theyre spreading a lot of misinformation said Chris Lemmer executive director of broadband trading and risk management at rival Williams Communications Group Inc in Tulsa Oklahoma Lemmer says Skilling is looking at the entire broadband universe wholesale retail and residential services when he projects industry growth Its unlikely Lemmer charges that Enron can get a healthy slice of each of these disparate businesses Competitors like Lemmer say that Enron isnt being realistic and that its lack of expertise in the business is showing This isnt the gas business where you can stick pipe in the ground and leave it there for years said Lemmer In this business infrastructure continually changes and Enron seems to be ignoring that because it interferes with the propaganda theyre trying to spread Billion Value For Business So far the results dont seem to justify Skillings billion value for the business Though Enron says the number of broadband trading transactions in the first quarter of has risen to from just in the same period a year ago the business isnt yet profitable In the fourth quarter the broadband business reported a million loss on revenue of million They really have to post the numbers and show that the broadband business is going somewhere said Commerzbank analyst Meade Company History A glimpse at company history reveals that Enron doesnt always deliver what it promises A case in point is the companys October purchase of Wessex Water Plc of the UK for billion in cash and assumed debt Enron officials spoke of the water business in much the same way they now talk about broadband Its a fragmented international market worth billion a year and Enron could extend its expertise to this business and win a huge share of that market Lay tapped Enron vice chairman Rebecca Mark one of the most prominent women in US business as chairman and CEO of Azurix Corp an Enron subsidiary that was supposed to win projects to repair build or buy governmentowned water systems Mark cut a distinctive figure in the maledominated industry wearing spike heels and miniskirts as she traveled the globe negotiating complex energy projects Azurixs performance never matched expectations The company was spun off in an initial public offering at a share in June The stock rose to a high of in August and then plunged all the way down to by October Executive Quits That prevented Azurix from using its stock for acquisitions as the company had originally planned Mark quit in August and resigned from Enrons board An Azurix official says Mark plans to be a private investor in other water businesses In December Enron bought back Azurix for million or a share Skilling says hes learned lessons from Enrons struggles helping him create what he describes as the prototype stcentury corporation Its part of the learning curve he said I think our legacy will be that we proved you can build a business on intellectual capital not physical assets A selfdescribed business history buff Skilling argues that the era of corporate success based on gathering assets is over He says modern companies that try to emulate J P Morgans assembling of US Steel or Harold Geneens buying spree to form ITT are making a mistake Exxon Mobil Merger He cites in particular the creation of Exxon Mobil Corp and DaimlerBenz AGs crossborder acquisition of Chrysler Corp Mergers like ExxonMobil were good ideas to cut costs but theyll run out of opportunities and we wont he said Thats because he argues Enron isnt tied to its assets in the same way as a big integrated company If youre stuck with a whole bunch of concrete that you cant move youre in trouble he said Only about percent of Enrons billion in assets is tied up in plants and equipment and Skilling says hes willing to sell anything anytime Skilling says hed rather spend money retaining good people who are easily shifted around to new businesses Were brainpower intensive Skilling said When Enron created its broadband business for example it moved people mainly from Enrons energytrading units into the new division in the space of a week Skilling Not Shy Skilling doesnt shy away from voicing his opinions publicly In December he stunned the crowd at Arthur Andersen LLPs annual Energy Symposium in Houston by predicting the demise of Exxon Mobil an enterprise with billion in profit in and BP Amoco Plc the third largest publicly traded oil company He said that integrated oil companies ones that drill for oil and natural gas transport and refine it and sell the resulting fuels to consumers cant possibly be the lowcost provider and producer in all of their businesses The odds of that are zero he said We have a marketplace now that can provide virtual integration getting all those components quicker and cheaper These big companies will topple over from their own weight Soon after that speech Skilling was promoted to CEO as Lay stepped aside Lay who remains chairman said the best time for succession to occur was when the company is doing well Fine Judgments Theres always the danger that Skilling will misjudge which industries are ripe for Enrons Internet trading platform and that some of Enrons biggest initiatives like its muchballyhooed plans to shake up the broadband business wont meet their lofty expectations There are heightened competition and the possibility for unfavorable changes in the regulatory environment to worry about as well Skilling says his new job and the challenges that come with it wont change too much the way he operates Ill probably have to be a little less blunt he said For all of Enrons grand plans that might be this former pipeline companys biggest pipe dream Adam Levy in Atlanta or kl International World Watch Compiled by David I Oyama The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc THE AMERICAS BRIEFLY Petroleo Brasileiro will likely pay million for the stake owned by Enron in naturalgas distributor Cia Distribuidora de Gas do Rio de Janeiro or CEG a Petrobras official close to the negotiations said The Agenda Setting The Agenda Enrons Kenneth Lay on the Energy Crunch By Noah Rothbaum SmartMoney c SmartMoney All rights reserved Weve all seen what energy deregulation has done to California Could it happen in your state this summer We put the question to Kenneth Lay chairman of Enron North Americas largest marketer of electricity and natural gas An early supporter of deregulation Lay has testified before Congress on numerous occasions advocating deregulation Q What went wrong in California A They didnt deregulate They tried to but they never got there California was halfway in between The wholesale market was deregulated but prices for customers were fixed and fixed in a way that competitors could not compete for customers without losing money Q Do you still think deregulation is a good idea A We think complete deregulation with consumer choice and competition will result in the lowest prices and the best alternatives for consumers including a lot of innovations Q Are there other deregulated states that may run into problems A The New England states arent nearly as competitive There is a good chance they will have problems this summer It could be a power crisis or their consumers will not end up with the benefits that customers in places like Pennsylvania get New York will probably be very tight But it moved very quickly after last summer to buy turbines I am told they will be generating electricity by this summer so New York well may avoid a serious problem Q Will we see blackouts in other states besides California this summer A The most vulnerable area this summer is California And because of that other western states will be vulnerable to problems The West is probably the most interconnected electricity reliability area in the country WIND ENERGY PROJECT Caribbean Update Copyright Gale Group Inc All rights reserved COPYRIGHT Caribbean Update Inc In early February the National Congress approved the decree for the Enron Wind

companies watching their stock prices race downhill faster than Picabo Street at Lillehammer they dont even know if the lights will stay on Take Solectron the worlds largest contractelectronics manufacturer Rolling blackouts ordered by Californias desperate utilities cut off power to seven of the companys buildings for two hours in January costing in the neighborhood of a handful of millions of dollars in the careful phrasing of spokesman Kevin Whalen Its enough to make a company think about getting off the grid And some are The Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group whose members include industry heavyweights Cisco Intel and Exodus is reviewing options for selfgeneration also called distributed generation Known to the cognoscenti simply as DG distributedgeneration technologies include microturbines smallscale generators fuel cells which generate electricity with an electrochemical reaction and flywheels which store kinetic energy within a rapidly spinning wheel And while it appears to be a drastic move even for powerhungry companies DG offers tantalizing possibilities to investors who can stomach the risk of an emerging technology One things for sure the energy shortage isnt going away The US power grid is facing an alarming supply and demand imbalance According to Scott Sitzer an economist at the Energy Information Administration US consumption of electricity increased at a percent annual rate between and while capacity rose just percent a year For the next years the agency forecasts demand growth of percent per year which will require at least megawatts of additional capacity to satisfy But only megawatts worth of power plants have been approved for construction over the next five years according to John Hammerschmidt portfolio manager and energy analyst at the topperforming mutual fund company Turner Investment Partners And supply isnt the only problem quality matters too Even a onesecond interruption in power can wreak havoc on data centers which require reliability The US baseload power grid can only offer three nines reliability or percent which means in one year youll be down an average of eight hours says Hammerschmidt The digital economy cant take blips it needs to get up to six nines So its easy to see why DG could be a hot growth area Over the next to years DG could become to percent of US generating capacity says Bernie Ziemianek director of distributed resources at the Electric Power Research Institute a Palo Alto Califbased RD firm Hammerschmidt agrees He launched the Turner Energy Power Technology fund on Mar There are IPOs on the shelf in this area he says This is going to be a very very hot investable area providing great returns over the next several years These volatile stocks are not for the fainthearted Having been caught up in the tech frenzy of last year many have crashed to sobering levels with the Nasdaq Most are losing money But Hammerschmidt doesnt see a dotcomstyle bubble for DG I dont think they will get hyped to ridiculous valuation levels he says because theyre competing against the cost of a kilowatthour One of his favorites is Active Power ACPW which is down percent from its week high Active is a leader in flywheel technology which Hammerschmidt sees as better than batteries for backup before a generator kicks in which can take seven or eight seconds Unlike batteries which need to be replaced flywheels need no maintenance and basically last forever he says He also likes the fact that Active has a marketing agreement with Caterpillar the No manufacturer of diesel generators So when you buy a generator from CAT theyll try to sell you a flywheel he explains The numbers are staggering when you look at all the generators now hooked up to batteries Hammerschmidt owns shares or about percent of the company across the Turner funds and he expects Active to turn a profit by the third quarter of David Smith who recently launched coverage of several powertechnology stocks at Salomon Smith Barney likes Capstone Turbine CPST which is off percent from its high They already have commercial products out in the market so they have a firstmover advantage They are technologically more advanced than any others out there and the timing is right Smith says Indeed Capstone just opened a subsidiary in California Soon after Harza Energy a Chicagobased engineering and energyconsulting firm announced its intention to purchase Capstone microturbines for the Association of California Water Agencies Quinten Nufer the powertech analyst at UBS Warburg rates FuelCell Energy FCEL down percent from its high a strong buy Nufer says FuelCells moltencarbonate cell is more efficient than competing products and he likes the fact that the company has customers including DaimlerChrysler and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power And Nufer is pleased that FuelCell has a partner in Enron which has agreed to place a large order in exchange for warrants to purchase

ushered in a fresh paradigm in the relationship between the two countries Made in India and showcased in Singapore seems to be the new maxim In order to take this new thinking forward National Computer Systems NCS a leading Singaporeheadquartered systems and network integrator is scouting for Indian partners to form strategic alliances to address the booming Asian services market This initiative is expected to kickstart the Asian Ecosystem to steamroll the new economy In this connection NCS chief KC Lee is in India to meet prospective technology companies for such partnerships He will be meeting a few key infotech companies located in Bangalore New Delhi and Mumbai The objective of these strategic alliances will be to leverage the technical skills of the Indian companies and then showcasing the combined offerings in Singapore Lee said He says NCS a part of the reputed Singapore Telecom on its part will bring in its expertise in the areas of banking finance infrastructure and egovernance besides the marketing activities The idea is to use Singapore as a test care point and roll out the offerings that are made in India According to Lee India has a strong brand name in IT services and Singapore offers a better marketing platform and the proposed alliances offer a winwin situation to both Once this model is successful in Asia NCS plans to extend it to Europe and USA Nothing stops us from going to Europe and the US Lee added In India over the last twoandahalf years NCS has executed a few key projects in the areas of banking finance large corporates and service

to provide over b assistance to India Business Line The Hindu Copyright C Kasturi Sons Ltd KSL Source World Reporter TM Asia Intelligence Wire NEW DELHI April AFTER a spell of deceleration in lending following sanctions on India in the last couple of years in the last decade the Asian Development Bank ADB is all set to make good by extending over billion by way of its Country Assistance Programme to India in the next four years Disclosing this to newspersons here a senior official from the Manilabased regional development bank Mr Klaus Gerhaeusser said that for the current year the Banks lending to India would be of the order of billion including million to earthquake affected Gujarat to million for power sector in Madhya Pradesh and an additional million for private sector participation in infrastructure million for western corridor of the Prime Ministers Golden Quadrilateral highway project and million for West Bengals Metro Rail Project Mr Gerhaeusser said that from to India would get on average billion a year so that the mediumterm country assistance to India would reach billion beyond He said the ADB officials held intensive discussion with Indian Government officials both at the Centre and in the States during the last two weeks to wrap up the Banks Medium Term Lending Programme covering fouryear period He said the States under focus from the Banks point of view include Madhya Pradesh Gujarat and Kerala though during the current visit of the Bank mission exploratory talks were initiated with the newlyformed State Government of Chhattisgarh Besides these States other States keen on getting lending from the ADB include Tamil Nadu and Karnataka he said adding that the Bank enters into comprehensive dialogue with the respective States about the sector in which loan was being made so that reforms in this sector and overall macroeconomic position of the State could be thoroughly reviewed to make the future project lending to them sustainable Alongside he said the Bank discusses the tax reform expenditure management debt management including restructuring and reform of Stateowned enterprises He said one of the mandates of this mission is to discuss with State governments to what extent they are committed to undertake reforms and sustain them so as to qualify for continued future assistance from the Bank On the loan assistance programme he said traditionally the Bank supported power sector in States but now it was extended to the Centre also Discussions are ongoing with Power Finance Corporation to leverage reform in other reformminded States particularly given the importance of power sector in rural electrification he said Once the National Highway Development Programme NHDP is through by the Bank would start dialogue with the National Highway Authority of India NHAI for assisting the Golden Quadrilateral highway corridor programme in which the Bank could provide technical assistance in the form of capacity building for executing agency to prepare project preparation and logistics management Mr Gerhaeusser said He said the Banks offer of assistance for West Bengal in the highway corridor programme was mainly due to sub regional considerations given the strategic location of the State in that area Asked about whether the Enron tangle would have any effect on the Banks assistance to power sector lending programme in India Mr Gerhaeusser said that we do not like to comment on this issue The Government of Maharashtra and the Central Government were dealing with this He however said that the Bank undertakes power sector programme with the State Government concerned only after thoroughly satisfying itself with various parameters of the concerned States commitment to reform in the sector To a query about how much component of over billion loan assistance to India would comprise soft loans being extended from the Banks Asian Development Fund ADF Mr Kazu Sakai Programme Manager of India at ADB said that last year negotiations for fresh pledge to ADF were over Unfortunately both India and China were not to get this assistance So all the assistance for India would be from the Banks Ordinary Capital ResourcesOCR bearing market related interest To a specific query about the Banks commitment to extend loan for restructuring Indian Railways Mr Gerhaeusser clarified that the Expert Committee on Restructuring of Indian Railways had not completed its final report and there was a delay of one and a half year He said that assuming that report would be ready within the next few months it would be discussed thoroughly by all the people concerned and it is premature to talk about assistance in terms of big loans for restructuring Railways he added Our Bureau India Enron

if Reliance is interested in taking over the Dabhol Power Company DPC he merely said the company has an open mind Enron is still running DPC They are our partners in oil exploration We look at value propositions as and when they arise We have an open mind he said The MW LNGbased Patalganga project had run into trouble when the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB declined to provide escrow cover citing financial constraints The project which is yet to achieve financial close is awaiting the Governments decision on the matter The Energy Review Committee headed by Dr Madhav Godbole had recommended in its interim report that all PPAs with IPPs be deferred and they also be made public Neither of the two IPPs Reliance Patalganga and Ispat Bhadravati are today contractually structured to meet the needs of intermediate and peaking load in either MSEB or Maharashtra allowing these IPPs to proceed as currently structured will only result in a problem similar to DPC re emerging in future Therefore the panel recommends that MSEB defer all PPAs with IPPs and reexamine them in accordance with a LeastCost Plan and in any case till such time the demand levels in the State permit

Industrial Deve lopment Bank of India IDBI have asked the Centre to honour its counterguarantee and pay Rs crore for the December bill immediately to end the impasse over the billion Dabhol Power Company DPC project in Maharashtra In a letter to finance secretary Ajit Kumar despatched on Saturday the domestic lenders said the Centre must immediately step in to defuse the crisis and save them from posting irreparable losses if Enron walks out of the project This is possibly the first instance of onshore lenders moving the finance ministry to save a project This is unprecedented As a lastditch attempt the financial institutions are putting pressure on the Centre to save the project and their money said a source in the ministry The lenders suspect that DPC may eventually declare itself bankrupt as the company had hinted at roping in a bankruptcy lawyer at last weeks meeting in London against the backdrop of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB having defaulted on its payments The MSEBs payment of Rs crore under protest has not helped its cause much as DPC will classify the payment as a contingent liability in its balance sheet and may declare itself insolvent if MSEB continues to pay up this way pointed out an institutional source At the London meeting the bankruptcy law issue was raised even though DPC did not clearly spell out its future course of action on this The Indian lenders persuaded DPC not to go ahead with its proposal to terminate the power purchase agreement PPA against the stiff resistance of the foreign lenders But they have merely bought a threeweek reprieve In case the issues are not sorted out within three weeks the situation may worsen as the EPC contractor Bechtel may pull out if DPC fails to pay up The EPC contractor may serve the pull out notice in June The government must resolve these issues on a warfooting said another source familiar with developments The lenders letter to the finance ministry has listed a host of issues ranging from the delay in giving technical clearance for pollution control to DPC to honouring the Centres as well as the Maharashtra governments counterguarantees It has categorically said if the

Sabbagh Dow Jones Newswires USA Enron says no plans to sell Dabhol stake By C Bryson Hull Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited HOUSTON May Reuters Enron Corp has no immediate plans to sell its stake in the troubled billion Dabhol power project in western India the energy giants chairman said on Tuesday Were not in any discussion right now on selling the plant Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay told reporters after the companys annual meeting He did not say whether the company planned to sell the project in the future Enron has said in the past that it is unlikely to sell the plant until its payment disputes are resolved The lenders have sent the government of India a letter indicating the various things both the government of Maharashtra and the government of India need to do to come back into compliance with the contract The Houstonbased company and the government of the western state of Maharashtra have been locked in a payment battle for months with the states electricity board balking at paying Enron what it considers too high a rate for electricity The fight is also now with the national government of India which is contractually bound to cover defaulted payments by Maharashtra but has since changed that position At present Maharashtras State Electricity Board MSEB owes the Dabhol Power Plant of which Enron is a percent stakeholder some million for power The Dabhol project the single largest foreign investment in India consists of two phases the alreadybuilt megawatt power plant and a MW plant that is expected to be finished this year The second phase could be finished later if the payment issue remains unresolved Lay said The construction activity is being scaled down so it is impacting operations but its still not too late to stop any damage from that if the governments step up and honor the contracts he said Last week Dabhols board authorized the plants managing director to issue a preliminary notice of termination of service to MSEB The notice which has not been issued would be the first step for Enron to pull out of the project Both governments have a few more weeks to respond to the letter from the creditors Lay said Enron has already declared political force majeure a legal maneuver that allows a party to break a contract because of situations beyond their control such as coups or civil war India can illafford the very public fight Dabhol has become Lay said It sends a very bad signal to the rest of the world as to the difficulties of investing in India which is not what India needs right now Lay said India needs a lof of foreign investment if the country expects to build up its infrastructure he said Indian Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha on Monday told Reuters there is no need for us to think that because there is a problem with Enron it is necessarily going to act as a dampener to foreign direct investment Centre spikes plan to fix Enron Vinu Lal The Times of India Copyright C The Times of India Source World Reporter TM MUMBAI This one would have turned the table in favour of Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB only if the Centre had not opposed it Even before the Dabhol Power Company DPC board meeting that took place in London on April MSEB was readying with a termination notice intended to be slapped on Enron just in case But both the Union ministries of power and finance struck down MSEBs termination notice plan Sources confirmed that the board was legally advised to prepare a termination notice citing contractual default and that the MSEB chairman Vinay Bansal had duly signed the notice But in a marathon meeting between Union minister of power Suresh Prabhu and finance minister Yashwant Sinha on April MSEB officials were advised not to act in haste as it would precipitate the issue However sources added that if MSEB had slapped the notice first then the liquidated damages payable by the board would have been considerably less visavis the situation prevailing now where Enron has authorised the management to issue termination notice It is still not clear why the Centre spiked the boards plan to issue a termination notice since they had a valid point in issuing the same citing the penalty of Rs crore for misdeclaration of power If Enron cites nonpayment as a default they are also liable to face termination for defaulting by misdeclaring their plants capacity sources added Interestingly on April Mr Prabhu was advised by the Shiv Sena leader Bal Thackeray on the issue where he was requested not to dump the project on Maharashtra Since the project has sovereign guarantee of the Indian government it was mandatory that the Union ministries of finance and power to clear the proposal of issuing a termination notice The Cabinet subcommittee of the government of Maharashtra which met thrice recently had finalised the notice under Schedule of the power purchase agreement where the contracted party Enron has not obliged to PPA conditions citing the penalty issue When contacted Vinay Bansal refused to comment on the issue where the Centre scuttled MSEBs plans Legal sources associated with the board confirmed that under Section of the power purchase agreement MSEB had prepared a termination notice in retaliation to the drastic steps Enron was resorting to after payment defaults Indias Dabhol Pwr Co Naphtha Supply Remains Regular Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc NEW DELHI Dow Jones US energy major Enron Corps ENE India unit Dabhol Power Co is continuing to receive regular supplies of naphtha a DPC official told Dow Jones Newswires Wednesday The US billion Dabhol power project has been mired in financial disputes since its main customer the Maharashtra State Electricity Board failed to pay several of its bills The dispute has raised concerns about the regularity of DPCs naphtha supply We have a term agreement with Indian Oil Corp IOC for the supply of naphtha until the end of this year he said He added that the plant will switch from naphtha to liquified natural gas as a fuel source in I confirm that one or two shipments of naphtha are coming every month Each shipment is carrying about metric tons of naphtha Shipments come depending on the power that Maharashtra State Electricity Board draws hesaid The naphtha is sourced from IOCs Gujarat refinery A committee appointed to renegotiate the MSEBs power purchase agreement with the DPC will hold its first meeting with DPC management May the Press Trust of India reported Tuesday Dabhol has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power Critics object to Dabhol charging INR a kilowatthour for its power compared with INRKWh charged by other suppliers By Himendra Kumar Dow Jones Newswires Maharashtra Electricity Board unamused by new Enron demand Mahesh Vijapurkar The Hindu Copyright C Kasturi Sons Ltd KSL Source World Reporter TM Asia Intelligence Wire MUMBAI MAY The Enronsponsored Dabhol Power Company DPC appears to have adopted a twintrack approach threaten withdrawal by terminating the power purchase agreement PPA and simultaneously asking the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB to activate some features of the same accord Just days before its board of directors met in London and authorised the local management to decide when the PPA should be terminated the DPC asked the MSEB to operationalise the escrow agreement This sources said was a bid to confuse issues by sending contradictory signals An unamused MSEB shot off a letter saying the DPC by invoking its rights under a force majeure clause enabling it to suspend the PPA could not now ask for operationalising the escrow agreement It had to be either of the two options not both Under an amended and restated accord signed in March specific revenue collection centres of the MSEB were identified and collections from these would have to be lodged into a separate account in an identified bank the cover had to be times the monthly billing of the mw phase II Already the escrow for Phase I is operational with revenue circles of the MSEB committed to the DPC to meet its billing So far despite the controversy surrounding the bills they have not been encashed even once Curiously enough there had been according to well placed sources some informal even if feeble suggestions that the DPC may go slow on the activation of the second phase of the project which the State says does not come within its ability to digest the burden If so why did it want the escrow to be operationalised The MSEB had to point out following this demand that DPC could not have the cake and eat it too It could not invoke the force majeure clause then threaten to have the PPA terminated and at the same time ask for activation of this feature of the PPA At the London meeting of the Board this issue was neither listed nor discussed The escrow agreement as designed requires fresh infusion of funds through allocation of more regions of the MSEBs revenue network to meet shortfalls since the tariff is forever mounting or remains high and as the Godbole Committee pointed out a situation where virtually all of MSEBs revenues would be required to be escrowed to meet DPC payments That would leave little for wages and fuel let alone additional power purchase from any source and the Godbole panel wanted it cancelled Was it therefore a demand for operationalisation of the agreement to see what steps the MSEB and the Government would take PPA to be terminated in May Even if DPC decides to issue notice terminating the PPA it would not be earlier than midMay since IDBI which leads the consortium of Indian lenders guaranteeing the provisions made by the foreign lenders had asked for a threeweek freeze on any decision by the company IDBI which voted against authorising the local management to issue a notice terminating the PPA at its London meeting suggested that by that time the renegotiation could commence even as members of the consortium led by it were consulted given their very high exposures The IDBIled consortiums cover of around Rs crores to lenders abroad makes it a major player in the events that would unfold in the near future Its stand has been in sharp contrast to the overseas financiers who were dismayed at the nonpayment of bills by the MSEB in time the disputes and the controversy surrounding the project They are more inclined towards withdrawing from the project Close between and per cent of the debt on the billion project has come from foreign lenders The Indian component also leads to serious concerns as those of their foreign counterparts It is unlikely that the DPC board can take any decision independent of the wishes or inclinations of the lenders In effect the IDBI told the board Give us some time we will come back Now that the Madhav Godbole Committee has been expanded with the addition of the MSEB Chairman the State Government and also a nominee of the Union Finance Ministry negotiations could commence but the DPC which has adopted a blow hot blow cold attitude would have to respond The Maharashtra Chief Minister Mr Vilasrao Deshmukh has said that the moment the Centre nominates its representative we will write to the DPC to come for renegotiations The DPC response would indicate the course it wants to take terminate the deal or enter into talks Sinha hopes sanctions will be lifted soon Sridhar Krishnaswami The Hindu Copyright C Kasturi Sons Ltd KSL Source World Reporter TM Asia Intelligence Wire WASHINGTON MAY The Finance Minister Mr Yashwant Sinha has expressed confidence that the United States will lift the economic sanctions against India as quickly as possible Mr Sinha here for the last few days to attend the Spring Meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund had a number of bilateral meetings with his counterparts from around the world including the US Treasury Secretary Mr Paul ONeill The sanctions figured at the meeting with Mr ONeill but only at the latters instance He himself mentioned the issue of sanctions Mr Sinha told reporters at a press conference at the Indian embassy here Indias views have been very clear We have said from day one that the sanctions hurt US interests more than they hurt Indian interests and the fact that they are raising it with us is an indication of their keen desire to be able to do away with it as quickly as possible he said During a meeting here last month with Mr Jaswant Singh the Secretary of State Gen Colin Powell raised the issue Mr Sinha said his meeting with Mr ONeill reflected a substantial measure of the commitment and interest of the Republican administration and the desire to pursue the outlines of the Vision Statement as it related to economic and financial matters Mr ONeill accepted the invitation to visit India later this year to attend the second of a series of Cabinetlevel forum meetings first of which was held in Washington last year Mr Sinha said the Enron imbroglio did not figure in any of his meetings here but the subject of foreign direct investment did In fact the Minister had brought it with Mr ONeill and explained the present situation Mr ONeill was said to have been satisfied and Mr Sinha said the Enron problem was well understood here and the issue was not a dampener to foreign investment in India Concern at violence against minorities In another development the US Commission on international religious freedom has flayed India the BJP for the disturbing increase in violence against religious minorities and called on the Bush administration to take steps to pressure New Delhi into pursuing those responsible for violent acts against religious minorities The violence is especially troubling because it has coincided with the increase in political influence at the national and in some places the State level of the Sangh Parivar a collection of exclusivist Hindu nationalist groups of which the current ruling party the Bharatiya Janata Party is a part the Commission said in the section on India The Commission said its perception came from a number of sources including an extensive examination of the situation in India testimony from Indians of various religious hues experts academics and through personal interviews of victimised groups Its efforts to travel in an official capacity to India had been scuttled by the Government there the Commission said Apart from the friction between Muslims and Hindus and the contributing causes to these over the years the Commission said the violence against Christians increased dramatically in India since Particularly troubling are the continued reports that religious institutions are being pointedly desecrated by militant groups groups that several Christian leaders describe as associated with the Sangh Parivar it said Though the BJPled Government was not directly implicated many accused it of hesitating to prosecute persons or groups responsible in the process building a climate where extremists believed violence against religious minorities would go unpunished Though the worst of the extremist groups do not have official power they are closely aligned with those in power and are seen by human rights organisation to be deliberately encouraging an environment of increasing hostility towards religious minorities the Commission said It also mentioned the suggestion that the tension between the ruling BJP and members of the Sangh Parivar was partly behind the Governments reluctance to pursue the perpetrators of sectarian violence It also made suggestions to the Bush administration on how to deal with India first of them being that the administration should persistently press India to pursue perpetrators of violence against religious groups The Bush administration has been called upon to press New Delhi to oppose attempts to interfere with or prohibit ties between religious communities in India and any government efforts to regulate religious choice or conversion The US should pressure New Delhi to allow official visits from government agencies concerned with human rights including religious freedom and that New Delhi should also be asked to allow visits from non governmental human rights organisations and groups concerned with religious freedom The Commission also called on the US to allocate funds from its foreign assistance programmes for the promotion of education on religious tolerance and inclusiveness in India Neither State nor MSEB has

attention was drawn to the dispute between MSEB and Enron with both treatening to serve termination notices on each aother for breaking contractual agreements The government was of the view that the Enron imbroglio must be resolved amicably through negotiations the Chief Minister told reporters Deshmukh said the energy review committee headed by former bureaucrat Dr Madhav Godbole had been given

invitation to ONeill to visit India later this year to attend the next meeting of the forum adding the invitation was accepted Sinha said the performance of Indian economy was recognised by the IMF and added that everyone was very confident that not only would India be able to maintain its growth but improve upon it When asked what accounted for Indias decision to welcome a new trade round now though it had been opposed by India and other developing countries at Seattle Sinha said Our position has been that we are not against a new trade round and we have reiterated that position here The world community also feels that there should be a new trade round We have our point of view with regard to the agenda for the new trade round I dont think we have diluted that stand or that position There was a general feeling that a new trade round if properly conducted and properly negotiated could be of great help he said Pointing out that EU is reported to be spending billion US dollar a year for agricultural subsidies which is many times their total overseas development assistance Sinha said if the agricultural market could be opened to exports from developing countries including India they would benefit greatly So there is a general feeling that a new trade round should take place but on the basis of an understanding about what the agenda and the outcome will be That is something in regard to which developing countries will lay a very important role he said When asked that many people were of the view that the rupee may go down to to the US dollar Sinha said he had heard that doomsday scenario several times before for the last three years and it had not happened I dont think we have reason to be despondent on that score On NRI investment in India Sinha said India had a very positive outlook about NRI investment and he had already done a great deal to make it worthwhile for them to invest in India Answering a query on the Enron issue he said that no one had raised that the issue with him during his meetings with several ministers and multilaterals here but the general issue of Foreign Direct Investment FDI came up during his meeting with ONeill and I myself took the opportunity to point out to him what was happening I explained to him that I had a meeting with the Chief Minister of Maharashtra a western Indian state a few days before I came here in which the Power Minister of the federal government also joined and we came to the conclusionthat the Maharashtra government would set up a negotiating team which they have done now to renegotiate the power purchase agreement with Enron We agreed that we will nominate a Government of India representative on this negotiating team We also agreed that neither of the two sides Enron and Maharashtra should take any precipitate action and that we should negotiate and find a negotiated solution to this problem Sinha said He said I personally feel there is no reason for us to think that because there is

because these are the markets which are our major markets for exports But he said that the slowdown has not had as negative of an effect on India as it has had on other developing nations in Asia

minority education UWire c Copyright UWire All Rights Reserved By Ken Fountain The Daily Cougar U Houston HOUSTON Increasing access to higher education for members of Houstons minority communities will be one of the most critical challenges facing the citys business and civic leaders said a panel of such leaders at a forum held Monday on the University of Houston campus Who Will Lead was the topic of the discussion for the Elizabeth D Rockwell Distinguished Leadership Forum which was cosponsored by the Bauer College of Business Rockwell is a winner of the UH Distinguished Alumna Award and is an executive of CIBC Oppenheimer Corp Demographic trends indicate that Texas and Houston will within a few years be comprised of a minoritymajority population meaning that the different minority groups combined will outnumber Caucasians The speakers agreed that ensuring young people from those backgrounds gain the education necessary to enter the increasingly hightech workforce is a matter of economic survival for the region Theres nothing more important in our community right now said Kenneth Lay chairman of the board of Enron the Houstonbased natural gas supply company that Fortune magazine has named the Worlds Most Innovative Company for the last six years Some progress is being made Some programs have been shown to be pretty effective Lay said They have significantly increased the graduation rates of minority members from high school the percentage going on to college and the percentage getting out of college Lay noted that less than percent of Hispanics in Texas graduate from college That is a time bomb waiting to blow us all up unless we solve that problem he said adding that a large number of Hispanics particularly male who drop out of high school eventually go to prison We spend about a year keeping them in prison but yet we cant spend maybe or a year trying to get them educated while theyre in high school he said John Mendelsohn president of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center concurred I think its very important that a city of this size have major university power to take the kids that do make it into college and educate them and move them into the leadership roles and join our workforce as leaders Mendelsohn said I applaud UH President Art Smiths attempts to bring the University of Houston to a higher level he added in reference to the Smith administrations advocating of the Texas Legislature to create a Texas Excellence Fund The fund would help the University achieve the status of a Tier I research university I think its critically important for the fourth largest city in the United States to have a school like this join the jewel we have of Rice University which is small and one of the very best in the world but cant produce the number of welleducated youngsters that this public university can Mendelsohn said Joseph Pratt a faculty member of the Bauer College of Business and executive director of the UH Scholars Community pointed out from the audience that the University has several such programs to encourage young people from minority communities to pursue higher education The Scholars Community is an oncampus program

generation assets and improving its operating efficiencies Dynegy is seeing the effects of the deal on its bottom line Illinova has been extremely accretive to earnings said M Carol Coale an analyst at Prudential Securities in Houston Last year in fact Dynegys revenues nearly doubled to billion while its net earnings almost tripled to million or per diluted share as a result of the billion Illinova deal In the first quarter Dynegys net earnings jumped Investors have been amply rewarded Dynegys stock took off last year jumping to per share making it the second best performing stock in the Standard Poors Since the Illinova deal was announced June Dynegys stock has skyrocketed an astounding from to One of those happy investors is San Franciscobased oil and gas giant Chevron Corp which owns about of Dynegy For Watson who formed Dynegy in the late s out of Houston energy company NGS Corp where he was CEO and chairman the success of the Illinova deal underscores his quest to take power and trade it anywhere he wants anytime he wants at any price he wants Thats why he dubbed the company Dynegy a hybrid name taken by combining dynamic with energy If energy prices stay high and Dynegys traders continue to make winning bets analysts expect the companys net earnings per share to increase another this year to million or per share But Dynegy hasnt been immune to the power crisis afflicting California where it coowns four power plants with NRG Energy Inc of Minneapolis that generate megawatts of capacity Indeed since the crisis began Dynegys been defending itself against allegations that its overcharging for power The California situation has hurt Dynegy in other ways too On April for example its stock fell to after utility Pacific Gas Electric Co a unit of PGE Corp filed for bankruptcy Dynegy provides power to the California market as a wholesaler but not to PGE directly Dynegy has also been quibbling recently with another teetering California utility Sempra Energys San Diego Gas Electric which claimed April that Dynegy ordered it to shutter some of the facilities the utility sold it in but that it still operates because it doesnt think it will get paid Dynegy denied the charge Dynegy did not instruct SDGE to shut down generating units nor did we suggest that we would not make power available to creditworthy buyers Stephen W Bergstrom Dynegys president and COO wrote in a letter to SDGE Chairman and CEO Stephen Baum Dynegy has tried to downplay its exposure to the states power woes Its repeatedly pointed out to the press that its stake in the four power plants in California only represents of its total generating portfolio of megawatts or about Analysts however estimate Dynegys exposure in California could give its earnings a haircut of as much as this year Even so Dynegys stock has recovered to a recent Illinova has created some volatility to Dynegys stock because of the addition of power generation to its business Prudentials Coale said But overall its been a great deal While keeping most of Illinova management in place Dynegy made the companys chairman president and CEO Charles Bayless a nonexecutive director of the combined entity Dynegys also marketing and trading all of Illinovas megawatts of output Theyve streamlined power generation and traded around the assets while keeping the distribution business in a sweet spot said John Olson an analyst at Sanders Morris Harris in Houston Illinova meanwhile solved a big investorrelated problem for Dynegy Before the merger only of Dynegys shares were available to the public As part of the deal Watson convinced two of Dynegys strategic partners British Gas plc and Nova Chemicals to sell their combined stake for approximately million in cash and shares of a new convertible preferred stock It also issued million shares after the deal closed Those moves increased Dynegys float to more than of the shares outstanding which led money managers to flood in The companys market capitalization has since tripled to billion Operationally in its effort to focus on power generation trading and marketing Dynegy has been dumping some of its midstream assets such as processing plants and pipelines particularly in the midContinent region The idea now is to increase Dynegys socalled merchant power capacity or the electricity it sells wholesale to anyone who needs it to megawatts by through acquisitions new construction and asset management agreements As a result Watson has become what some are calling an acquisitions hound Hes already acquired some facilities On Jan Dynegy completed the purchase of two power plants in the Hudson River Valley the megawatt Roseton power plant in Newburgh NY and the megawatt Danskammer plant nearby from various area utilities for million Banc of America Securities llc advised Dynegy on both purchases Dynegy has had trouble picking up other power plants however Witness the deal it announced Nov to acquire megawatts worth of electricitygenerating assets in Nevada from Renobased Sierra Pacific Resources for million The deal got scotched April when Nevada regulators spooked by its nextdoor neighbors power crisis repealed the states electricity deregulation plan and put a moratorium on all power plant sales in the state Dynegy estimated the acquisition would have added cents per share to earnings Still since the Illinova merger the total generating capacity built or acquired by Dynegy now exceeds the total capacity added through the merger That includes megawatts of new natural gasfired generation facilities in Georgia Kentucky and Louisiana that are expected to begin commercial operation by June just in time for summer Like its crosstown rival Enron Corp Dynegy has also expanded via acquisitions into broadband telecommunications Dynegy also competes with Houstonbased Reliant Energy and Charlotte NCbased Duke Energy Both Enron and Dynegy see a big opportunity in broadband given that there are few other suppliers and that managing its movement is akin to whats involved with natural gas or electricity In August Dynegy announced it was acquiring Aurora Colobased Extant Inc a privately held developer of telecom solutions for million in cash and stock It completed the deal in September Then in November Dynegy announced it was acquiring privately held Iaxis Ltd a Londonbased telecom that owned and operated an mile fiberoptic network throughout Europe for almost million Dynegy completed the deal in March Dynegy is now developing a mile fiberoptic cable network in the US that it will link to Iaxis network in Europe It hopes its broadband unit which lost million in the first quarter will be profitable by the second half of Still Dynegy has differentiated itself as the antiEnron because among other things it continues to buy power plants rather than sell them Enron meanwhile has been trying to dump its hard assets such as Portland General Electric in Portland Ore Enron CEO Jeff Skilling a polished former McKinsey Co consultant just wants to be a gobetween and not just in energy but in broadband pulp and paper and metals while Dynegys Watson a scrappy former commodities

Asian Wall Street Journal Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Indias electricity shortage cant be solved without a new approach Indias power problem is back on the front burner because global generating giant Enron is threatening to turn off the lights at its Dhabol plant and walk away from a contract with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board In an effort to collect million owed for electricity already supplied the American company has invoked central government guarantees and declared a political force majeure but without much success So technically India is facing a sovereign default after which Enron would spend years battling through the courts to get compensation for the billion project Of course everyone knows thats not going to happen After more brinksmanship from both sides in the coming days they will have to sit down and negotiate a settlement Some of the problems with Enron are unique to that particular arrangement but in its basic outline the saga epitomizes a flawed attempt to deal with Indias power problem narrowly defined a shortage of generating capacity The country suffers constant blackouts due to a supply shortage of about and even more during times of peak demand In the early s the central government sought to solve this shortfall by opening the doors to private investors like Enron But this proved to be a mistake because power distribution is controlled by the state governments they run it as a system of wealth redistribution rather than a business California recently made the earthshattering discovery that a lack of market pricing at the consumer level leads to disaster But Indias state electricity boards or SEBs proved that long ago they have long been bankrupt and often default on payments to private generators As a result most of the big names in power have now pulled out of India Yes the country does need to worry about generating capacity Its estimated that in the next years demand will more than double with an additional megawatts needed but only half of that is likely to be built That could increase the shortfall during peak demand to a frightening prospect But the first order of business is to reform distribution There is a debate now about how to give state governments the right incentives to reform their SEBs These owe almost billion to central governmentowned generators and mines from whom they buy much of their power and coal In the recently passed budget New Delhi included a provision to forgive this debt as long as the state governments commit to either privatizing their SEBs or putting a floor on electricity prices Electricity meters would actually be installed to measure power usage but subsidies would still be allowed many customers wouldnt pay enough to cover the true cost of that power Still this would be big progress by Indian standards if it happened Many farmers currently get their power for free and over of power generated is stolen something the SEBs euphemistically call transmission and distribution losses As a result the electricity boards average a return on investment of negative However New Delhi is offering quite a big carrot and not much stick After a March meeting between the prime minister and state leaders Rajnath Singh the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh said quite clearly that he wouldnt hike energy charges for farmers The reason is obvious he faces elections next year and free power has become an entitlement that no politician lightly takes away Chief ministers will likely sign on to New Delhis plan in order to get debt relief but will backslide on implementation The only thing that will make the states serious about reform is a hard budget constraint which is the opposite of what the government is offering One way to provide it would be to hand over the centrally owned power generators and mines to the states They would then have to figure out how to keep the system running If they still chose not to charge for electricity they would have to find the money for power generation from other parts of their budgets Another reform some have suggested is to pass a national law which legalizes private power producers Some states allow companies to have their own captive power plants to maintain supply when the public grid fails But these are typically not permitted to sell their power outside of the parent company If larger plants that could supply several industrial firms were legalized the states would come under greater pressure to reform The private power suppliers could cherrypick the best customers those willing to pay for reliable power leaving the state to subsidize the freeloaders This would also have the benefit of quickly boosting the countrys power supply since captive plants already have about megawatts of unused capacity New Delhi is still trying to reform the countrys power market by fiat This means years of political wrangling while a growing economy is strangled by a shortage of electricity Instead the wouldbe reformers could let the power of the invisible hand push the state governments in the right direction INDIA Foreign funds plough money into Indian shares By Anurag Sood Reuters English

of Asian Emerging Markets at Alliance Capital He said these were funds deserting the United States on fears of a slowdown and losses on Wall Street but afraid to get into crisisridden Japan and hence hunting for better returns in emerging Asia According to Lipper Asia Ltd a Reuters global funds data company investments by the biggest fund investors in Asia soared to billion in the JanuaryMarch

percent the IMF estimates percent the Asian Development Bank percent and the Indian central bank percent Ajit Ranade economist at ABN AMRO Bank says Indias large domestic economy resilient to the global slowdown could pull more funds into the country But a blizzard of stock market scandals which revealed share price manipulation has unnerved some foreign investors Weak regulation is a part of an emerging market risk but that does not rule out caution said an India strategist at a foreign brokerage Analysts say foreign fund flows are unlikely to be influenced much by events such as the Enron controversy where the US energy giant is threatening to pull out of its billion power project in the western Indian state of Maharashtra Enron is Indias single biggest foreign direct investor They say factors that influence foreign portfolio investments are different from the considerations that drive longer term direct investments The Indian governments decision to hike foreign funds investment limit in Indian firms to percent has also added to fresh buying in Indian software services firms Indias technology sector is still the best in the region It has got low capital expenditure

the coalition or supportive of the Democratic Front Government today thrashed its effort to renegotiate the power purchase agreement PPA with the Enron sponsored Dabhol Power Company The least cost option was to initiate a judicial probe into the deal which was replete with fraud and seek the scrapping of the project they said This view was made public after the parties Peasants and Workers Party the CPIM the Janata Dal Secular the Samajwadi Party and others met here and decided to press the demand at a meeting of the coordination committee of all parties including the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party on May Its scheduled meeting for today was put off as the Chief Minister Mr Vilasrao Deshmukh was away electioneering in the South These parties worried about the huge unpayable DPC bills had been demanding a probe under the Inquiries Commissions Act but today upped the ante saying we are convinced of fraud in the agreement with DPC The renegotiation Mr N D Patil who leads the Left grouping and heads the allparty coordination panel said is not what we want we dont want it at all He and Mr Prabhakar Sanzgiri CPIM said we no longer suspect it We are convinced of malfeasance Along with Mr Pradhyumna Kaul of the AntiEnron Campaign they told a press conference that the moment fraud was proved the PPA could be annulled and the huge liquidation penalties can be avoided The demand was to scrap the mw phase II take over the mw Phase I and initiate a probe The Godbole Committee report has provided enough grounds though Phase I was a reality and Phase II only an eventuality Even a small criminal probe would put any arbitration decision sought by the DPC on hold The lobby pressing for scrapping the PPA said an FIR against the Maharashtra State Electricity Board under the provisions of Section of the Electricity Supply Act would suffice as there were enough grounds to prove that the entity or persons concerned had played games at one time or the other It cited bloated projections of energy demand in Maharashtra provided by the MSEB to DPC to justify the work on the Phase II which is now under stress following lenders reluctance to provide funds till the issue is sorted out When asked why Mr Deshmukh preferred renegotiation and trimming of power tariff to a probe Mr Patil said that is his view For their part the parties would press for change

Sons Ltd KSL Source World Reporter TM Asia Intelligence Wire THIRUVANANTHAPURAM MAY The Maharashtra Chief Minister Mr Vilasrao Deshmukh today advised the State to handle the Enron issue cautiously and refrain from committing the mistakes made by his State Addressing a press conference here today Mr Deshmukh said the Maharashtra Government was treading carefully on the Enron issue and it hoped to renegotiate the power tariff with the US company Mr Deshmukhs observations assume significance in the context of the running controversy regarding the Kannur Power Project which had been denied permission by the LDF Government Mr Deshmukh said that Enron had written to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board that it was ready to renegotiate the power tariff provided the Government of India made a formal request He said the renegotiation would start as soon as the Union Government handed over the formal letter asking for a renegotiation Mr Deshmukh pointed out that the basic issue in Enrons Dabhol project was related to the power tariff The foreign exchange rate was fixed at Rs a dollar at the start of the project But now it had gone up to Rs a dollar thereby pushing the cost of power up He indicated that the renegotiations would focus on this aspect as well The Maharashtra Government had proposed renegotiation on the basis of the Godbole Commission recommendation He was confident that the Enron would agree to renegotiate the tariff in the interests of the Maharashtra Government and its own interests In reply to a question Mr Deshmukh said the Enron project had been a major drain on his States finances but it had overcome all problems by handling them very carefully He said the Maharashtra Government would extend all support to the UDF if it were to come to power to process the various parameters relating to the Kannur project so that it did not commit the same kind of mistake as Maharashtra did He however made it clear that his Government welcomed foreign direct investments but not at the cost of the States interests Mr Deshmukh attacked the Centre for not using the various options available under the WTO agreement to come out with a balanced importexport policy Asked for his comments on Mr Sharad Pawars statement that the NCP was considering joining the Peoples Front Mr Deshmukh made it very clear that his partys alliance with the NCP was confined to Maharashtra alone The alliance with the NCP is a post election affair as part of the attempts to unite all secular forces The Congress had fought the NCP and several other parties which are now part of the Congressled Government But the alliance had been formed in order to keep the BJPShiv Sena combine out he said Asked how his party could accept the NCP which had an alliance going with the BJP in Meghalaya Mr Deshmukh said the Congress NCP ties were confined to Maharashtra If the NCP creates any problems in Maharashtra the alliance would end he said Mr Deshmukh attacked the CPIMled LDF for its five year misrule which had left the State virtually bankrupt The credibility of the LDF is so low that the people would not vote for it The CPIMled Left parties would be defeated

of action on its LNG shipping deal for the Dabhol Power Company DPC The controversy surrounding the Enronpromoted DPC and the apprehension raised by the lenders to the LNG shipping project has made the three shipping promoters of Greenfield Shipping Company take stock of the situation A final view on the LNG shipping deal will depend on what Enron decides on the power project per se and not just

million According to the delivery schedule the LNG vessel named Laxmi is expected to be completed and delivered by October end this year A consortium of global banks led by ANZ Investment Bank has taken a high exposure on the LNG shipping project The Greenfield Shipping Company had struck a year loan with the lenders worth million at basis points over libor SCI has a per cent equity stake in

Unlike in the case of other ships LNG ships do not have a secondary market since these are acquired against specific longterm contracts In case of any eventuality Greenfield Shipping Company would find it difficult to divert the vessel elsewhere as globally spot trade in LNG is almost nil Fortunately for the Greenfield Shipping Company the prices for new LNG buildings have started firming up

the tariff in its own interest as well as that of the State Government Our Bureau Let Enron Exit ADITYA CHATTERJEE POOJA KOTHARI The Times of India Copyright C The Times of India Source World Reporter TM FOR years Enron tried to woo Indian policymakers who couldnt seem to decide whether the Dabhol project was a good idea or not Today the boot is on the other foot and it seems to be pinching Enrons management is keen to stop investing in huge capitalintensive plants around the world In keeping with this strategy and no doubt exhausted by its ceaseless crisis management in India Enron is mulling a pullout But both the Centre and Maharashtra government want to renegotiate the power purchase agreement and have entrusted this responsibility to the Madhav Godbole panel Is Enron really as indispensable as the authorities seem to think it is Financially no Indeed if the only way to continue the project is on the present terms then it makes better sense to simply scrap it After all its better to amputate a gangrenous limb than to let the problem spread further A little arithmetic will make this amply clear If the Dabhol Power Company DPC does scrap its agreement with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board the Centre will have to cough up a sum of Rs crore a penalty amount of Rs crore for one years electricity bill and million as termination fees which works out to Rs crore at an assumed exchange rate of rupees to one dollar This is a onetime payment and the figure of Rs crore is corroborated by a recent statement by Union power secretary A K Basu Now if India were to continue with the present arrangement it would end up paying at least Rs crore per year for the next years to DPC On the other hand what would happen if the project were scrapped Well very simplistically India would save Rs crore Rs crore multiplied by years But things arent quite that simple because that money could earn interest while inflation would mean that Rs crore after years would not have the same value it would have today To get around this problem financial experts use a concept called net present value which discounts future earning streams as well as inflation to evaluate the attractiveness of a project If we use a discount rate of per cent then the value of the amount India would save by scrapping the Dabhol project works out to Rs crore over three times the amount India would have to pay today if the agreement with DPC is terminated Indian financial institutions FIs and banks which have lent money to DPC are actively lobbying to prevent such an eventuality But how badly would they be hit Well FIs led by Industrial Development Bank of India have provided loans of million and million in two phases This brings their total exposure to million Rs crore at an exchange rate of Besides State Bank of India also underwrote the maximum portion of a million crossborder loan and has an exposure of about million Rs crore Thus the cumulative exposure of Indian banks and FIs in DPC works out to around Rs crore However since only per cent of this amount has been disbursed so far the net exposure of Indian lenders amounts to Rs crore Since the Indian lenders are not covered by any counterguarantee their bottomline would be hit if Enron backs out The government being a majority stakeholder in most of these institutions would also be affected But even if all these loans are taken into account and added to the onetime payment of Rs crore the total cost to the government would be Rs crore still lower than Rs crore Thus the termination option will prove less costly for the nation than proceeding on the present terms What will happen to the assets and the plant did we hear you ask Well the government can sell it to private players and renegotiate the cost factor with them this time hopefully after doing a costbenefit analysis A sale of assets would also lessen the load on the government Who knows the government may actually manage to sell the ownership of DPC at a premium to another private sector player Of course fears have been raised that cancelling the project might cost us foreign direct investment since Enron is the biggest investor in India so far After all Brazil raised billion and China billion last year in comparison with Indias measly billion But theres another way of looking at the problem what does India really have to lose In short its a case of losing what you dont even have in the first place Many developing nations which were pushed into signing expensive power projects by multinationals have successfully renegotiated their contracts with no serious financial consequences Many nations simply did not have the money to pay for the inflated bills some refused to pay even after losing international arbitration awards while others like Costa Rica declared that the contracts signed with independent power producers like Enron have no legal status or are bad in law In July the Hungarian parliament declared that a PPA signed with multinational RWE was unconstitutional and void In August the Croatian government tore up a PPA signed between Enron and a previous government The contract was considered to be unaffordable and was allegedly signed in suspicious circumstances Enron subsequently abandoned the original agreement In September the Philippines took a decision to not renew financially crippling contracts with IPPs Controversy has accompanied the Dabhol project from the start In August the finance ministry had written to the power ministry that the size of the potential liability for a megawatt plant was around Rs crore per year The department of economic affairs had also warned that the risk of counterguarantees being invoked was not unreal given that state electricity bills had been defaulting in payments Caution was thrown to the winds then The least India can do now is ask for a renegotiation But does the Indian government have the courage to go eyeballtoeyeball with Enron and not blink first Scrapping the power purchase agreement involves a onetime payment of Rs crore However India would save over Rs crore by doing so There would be a net saving even after writing off FI loans to Dabhol Power Company IDBI whose life is it anyway Tamal Bandyopadhyay Business Standard Copyright c Business Standard On April a terse oneline announcement by the finance ministry gave the acting chairman and managing director of Industrial Development Bank of India IDBI S K Chakrabarti a threemonth extension The government was generous enough not to keep the CMD as well as the institution waiting till late evening which it normally does for the fax message from North Block But the acting IDBI chief may be asked to step down even in three weeks if the government is able to identify his successor He has been reappointed for a period of three months or till a regular CMD takes charge whichever is earlier Could there have been a better way to insult the countrys largest financial institution and its chief First the government planned to merge the Industrial Finance Corporation of India IFCI which is on the brink of collapse under the burden of ballooning nonperforming assets with IDBI to make them sink together Unable to push through the proposal in the face of stiff resistance put up by IDBI the government now appears to be keen on leading the countrys premier financial institution to its grave alone This not by giving an extension to the existing acting chief but by failing to identify his successor and thereby continuing the uncertainty at the top Nothing can move in an organisation when the CEO himself does not know how long he will survive Indias financial institutions have been repositioning themselves by going shortterm both on the assets as well as the liabilities sides But for that transformation to take effect they need leaders with a longterm tenure at the helm To understand this lets look at whats happening at ICICI another financial institution in the country that is breathing down on IDBIs neck and threatening to overtake it K V Kamath CEO and managing director of ICICI got a second fiveyear term seven days ahead of the expiry of his first term on March Once his second term is complete Kamath will have ended up running the show at ICICI for a decade ICICI does not only give its chief a long term to steer the ship but also grooms talent to take over the institution in due course Kamath was groomed by his predecessor N Vaghul In turn he is now grooming Nachiket Mor to succeed him Mor a former senior general manager of ICICI has recently been shifted to ICICI Bank as an executive director in charge of wholesale banking He is likely to be made the managing director of the bank when the present incumbent H N Sinor steps down next year Eventually he will take over the mantle from Kamath in by which time his stint at the bank will have given him enough operational experience in addition to his treasury management and other skills Given the circumstances IDBI is fighting a losing battle It will not be surprising if it goes the IFCI way with an uncertain leadership unable to steer a demoralised overstaffed ship becalmed by the apathetic bureaucracy of the North Block This is despite its tremendous brand value in project financing and widespread corporate relationships Carved out of the Reserve Bank of India by an Act of Parliament in IDBI has business relations with virtually every corporate house in India But that is not helping it tide over the crisis because the key to any financial intermediarys success at this juncture is how it handles its resources both currency as well as human In an ideal situation the cost of funds should be lower while the cost of human resources should be marketdriven In IDBIs case it is the reverse its cost of funds is on the higher side in the absence of aggressive treasury operations and it is not allowed to pay marketdriven salary to its employees The net result There has been an exodus of talent from IDBI and the institution is struggling to stay afloat just when recession has prompted corporations to cut back on their borrowings IDBIs sanctions and disbursements have been falling and nonperforming assets increasing It is sitting on piles of cash but finding deployment avenues hard to come by Two former chiefs of IDBI S H Khan and G P Gupta spent a large chunk of their tenure and energy pleading with the finance ministry to delink IDBIs salary structure from that of the Reserve Bank of India but without success Small wonder that Chakrabarti who became acting chairman on February for a threemonth term has singled out the low morale of the staff as his prime concern He wants to address this on a war footing The Centre has now successfully demoralised him by offering him another uncertain term Former finance minister Manmohan Singh accepted Khans argument on marketdriven package he reportedly wanted a pay scale for his employees that was higher ICICIs but could not do anything about it P Chidambaram repeated Singhs failure on this front and Yashwant Sinha too thinks the proposal is not worth considering because it will have a ripple effect in the industry For instance RBI employees will immediately demand their pound of flesh The finance ministry refuses to see the point that the countrys central bank is not a commercial organisation and does not have to compete with ICICI When three successive finance ministers failed to address IDBIs problems the institution went for soft options It ended up appointing three consultants for restructuring in six years First Booz Allen Hamilton in followed by M B Athreya in and finally Boston Consulting Group The third consultant BCG is yet to submit its report While Booz Allen Hamilton charted out the roadmap for diversification and suggested that the institution spread its wings overseas and tap new business opportunities the Athreya panel said it must convert itself into a bank and the governments stake should come down without delay Over the last few years the institution has been planning its conversion into a bank and blaming the economy for its indifferent performance even as ICICI has been going full steam with new initiatives ICICI Bank is also exploiting synergies with its parent to the hilt while IDBI Bank seems to be embarrassed about ackowledging its pedigree Its not that everything is great at ICICI Over the past few years the institution has lost some senior executives ISec managing director Kishore Chaukar left to join the Tata group ICICI senior general managers Anando Mukherji joined Enron and N J Subaiah took charge at Centurion Bank which he subsequently left The industry suspects the quality of ICICIs assets and is not comfortable with the scorching pace of growth Even the wellpaid ICICI executive cadres find the pace of work is too much to handle and complain of fatigue In private they hate the mad rush for excellence And yet there is a method in ICICIs madness It has trimmed the flab with two successive voluntary retirement schemes branched out into consumer loans in a big way and transformed treasury operations into an art The finance ministry would do well to explore the possibility of divesting the governments stake in IDBI to ICICI Instead of pumping in Rs crore as recapitalisation funds into IFCI it can simply let it die and sell its assets to other banks and financial institutions IDBIs bulk and the brand name in project financing would combine well with ICICIs growing retail presence and unbridled aggression The combination would be formidable enough to give the State Bank of India a run for its money Of course a whole lot of issues need to settled before the process takes off like trimming the flab in IDBI and delinking it from the RBI pay structure et al IDBI merging with ICICI may sound like an absurd dream but it is certainly a better option than merging IFCI with IDBI If Reliance is willing to bid for staterun oil majors HPCL and

fund manager comment By Andrew Callus LONDON May Reuters Scottish Power Plc announced a restructuring on Thursday reflecting plans for expansion in the United States and a tighter power sector focus in its British home market Britains largest power utility was reporting a decline in pretax profits before exceptional items and goodwill for the year to March to million pounds million from million a year ago But its shares rose percent to pence on some good news on costs and power generation in the United States where plant breakdown and high prices have hit earnings and investor sentiment Hunter a power station in Utah came back on line on Thursday after a day breakdown that cost million a day and helped deliver percent sector shareprice underperformance over the period New US plants are also coming on stream The profit figure was in line with analysts forecasts hit by UK regulation the Hunter outage and high US power prices They are keeping those costs down in the United States said one sector analyst There were stories out there they were going to be worse than they have been saying and it wasnt The breakdown at Hunter part of the UK groups PacifiCorp acquisition was unusually costly because power had to be bought in to replace the megawatts MW of lost capacity while power prices in the region were very high Even with Hunter back up PacifiCorp has more customer demand than plant to supply it so high wholesale prices will continue to be a problem The new structure unveiled on Thursday consists of a US division including PacifiCorps regulated and unregulated businesses a UK division covering generation and energy supply in Britain and a third infrastructure division which includes power systems and Southern Water in the UK and create a link between US and UK infrastructure businesses NEW US PLANT Chief Executive Ian Russell told reporters by telephone the Hunter power plant was now reconnected to the grid and would reach full operating capacity within a few days He was also upbeat about prospects for expanding generation in the United States where Scottish Power aims to have new plants with an extra MW or percent of current capacity on stream this year He announced that the first of these a MW plant at Gadsby in Salt Lake City Utah began producing on Thursday as well Another MW plant being built in Oregon will be onstream in a month or so Russell said PORTLAND Scottish Power confirmed it was still looking at the possible sale or refinancing of its Southern Water business in Britain and Russell said there had been a number of expressions of interest for the business worth about billion pounds but we are some way away from a conclusion He also said he was still looking for a further US acquisition but would not confirm reports he was in talks with US power trading group Enron Corp about buying its Portland Oregon power arm When we acquired PacifiCorp we said it was a platform for further growth obviously Portland is right in our own back yard he said Frankly were still very busy with PacifiCorp and for the time being thats what we are focused on Investors have been concerned about the groups dealmaking plans given the weak market for UK water infrastructure assets and volatility in the US market There is still a bit of deal risk there amidst worries they may sell Southern Water too cheaply said one fund manager who is underweight in the stock CEO Russell said the threeway restructuring would help the group sharpen our focus on improving shareholder value and capture opportunities in the US western power markets PacifiCorp contributed operating profit of million pounds after the impact of the Hunter outage compared to million pounds four month contribution a year earlier The groups million poundsayear threeyear UK cost saving plan was on track at the end of its first year Russell said Finance director David Nish expressed continuing support for Thus its spunoff startup telecoms business in which it still holds just over percent Thus is still lossmaking and has been struck by general investor disaffection with telecoms companies and concerns about how it would secure future funding But Nish said Scottish Power had no plans to do anything other than be supportive of the company additional reporting by Sonya Dowsett Distractions interfere with key growth questions Financial Times May By Andrew Taylor in London Cynics claim that Scottish Powers legal action launched this week to rewrite a long term electricity supply contract was more about distracting attention from the groups poor results than a realistic bid to cut costs This judgment is a little harsh Scottish Power would benefit considerably if it could renegotiate the deal that requires it to buy threequarters of Scotlands nuclear output The British Energy contract is worth obn bn in the next four years Shareholders could do with some distraction Scottish Power by its own admission has had a tough year which will be confirmed today when it publishes results for Ian Russell who took over as chief executive in March may even indulge in the new boys practice of including the cost of further forseeable bad news in the figures making any subsequent improvement appear greater His biggest problem will be to convince the City that he is capable of developing an effective strategy to change the groups direction now it has abandoned plans to become a multiutility The group no longer believes adequate returns can be earned from developing a growing range of products to sell to its more than m customers The investment required to develop national brands win new customers and retain old ones is too high in an increasingly competitive UK retail sector it says Mr Russell who as Scottish Powers former finance director was closely associated with the previous policy has already withdrawn from joint ventures with Royal Bank of Scotland to provide financial services and with Thus to provide telecommunications The group is also discussing the future of Southern Water its south of England utility which Enel the Italian statecontrolled energy group is interested in buying Crossselling electricity and gas to Southern Water customers let alone other products has been disappointing it admits The group plans to concentrate on developing its energy interests in the UK and US But these also have their difficulties Some of the biggest problems involve PacifiCorp bought months ago in a deal worth about obn including debt The price is looking more expensive following big rises in US electricity wholesale prices PacifiCorp has not been as badly affected as some US electricity groups But it has faced problems because of a power station breakdown in Utah that forced it to buy higher priced electricity from other generators to meet customer demand The failure of a MW generating unit at its Hunter power plant in November has cost the group m om a day since One piece of good news for shareholders today will be the timing of its return to service this month Another positive note is that PacifiCorp is negotiating higher retail prices with US state regulators to offset increased generation charges It also has about MW of its own new power plant due to start production this year In the UK the group is facing increased competition for retail electricity and gas sales particularly in the household market It has also had to absorb big price cuts imposed on its power distribution side by Ofgem the industry regulator The shares which fell p on Wednesday to p have fallen by more than per cent against the FTSE All Share Index since December when the PacifiCorp offer was announced So where does the group go from here It made its reputation in the s as a shrewd acquirer of UK utilities Southern Water for obn and Manweb the northwest of England electricity supplier for obn Effective cost cutting increased value particularly at Manweb The group was also one of the first electricity companies to string telecommunication lines along its electricity pylons The sale of a per cent stake in Thus which operates the telecoms network raised obn in Financing further UK and US acquisitions will be challenging Thus shares have fallen from p a year ago to p on Wednesday night Scottish Power has net debt of some obn with interest thinly covered three times by earnings before tax and interest It has been talking with Enron about buying Portland General its Oregonbased electricity utility The group might need to sell Southern to cover the purchase price of about bn including debt Buying in the UK may be even harder Scottish Power has been outbid recently for regional electricity suppliers by the deeper pockets of large continental European utilities

squatting in tall cotton as my daddy used to say The Corp received more than billion from the Co from according to a PUC audit But the Corp says it wouldnt be fair if it had to put any of that money back into the Co its ailing subsidiary It wants the people whose utility bills created that profit to pay higher bills now to bail out the Co so the Corp can avoid bankruptcy of its own Who is being unfair Meanwhile Southern California Edison also has been shipping its profits also more than billion at last report to its parent company while looking to the state for a bailout Now Gov Gray The

and scream Call Coursey at or email LNG carriage to be preserve of Indiaflag ships Lloyds List International Copyright C LLoyds List Source World Reporter TM In an attempt to cash in on the liquefied natural gas revolution Indias shipping ministry is pushing through a proposal to restrict the transportation of the gas only to companies registered in India and vessels carrying the Indian flag It would seem that the logic primarily is to ensure that Indian shipping does not get left behind in the LNG transportation race Until now the ministry has managed to get LNG ferried by energy companies on fob basis We hope that this new proposal would give further impetus to Indian bottoms says shipping secretary Michael Pinto We will do all we can to get approval from the committee of secretaries and the Cabinet Since some of the shipping contracts have already been finalised this proposal would only be made applicable to future contracts However shipping experts are extremely doubtful whether the proposal can be implemented The leading Indian shipping companies have neither the funds nor the expertise of carrying LNG and would need the assistance of foreign companies to make the ventures a success A foreign LNG carrier is not going to settle for a minority stake unless the Indian shipper is able to put up his share of the equity which would be quite a handful says Sudhir J Mulji executive vicechairman of Great Eastern Shipping Company and current president of the Indian National Shipowners Association The proposal really does not seem to be feasible For the moment just two major contracts have been signed both involving the stateowned Shipping Corporation of India SCI The first one involves SCI American power major Enron and Mitsui of Japan for the carriage of m tonnes of LNG per annum for Enrons MW mega power project at Dabhol near Ratnagiri in southern Maharashtra SCI had entered into this memorandum of understanding with MOL formerly Mitsui OSK Lines and Atlantic Commercial Finance which is an Enron affiliate However it is only a partner in the consortium with Enron holding a stake and Mitsui OSK the balance The gas will be ferried by the LNG Lakshmi brandnew cu m capacity vessel being constructed in Japan at the Mitsui Shipyard The contract is valid for years from the date of starting However the consortium is registered in the Cayman Islands which is a tax haven and the LNG vessel will carry the flag of Malta SCI has also secured the contract for carrying m tonnes per annum of LNG for the governmentowned pipeline company Petronet LNG The gas is to be ferried from RasGas of Qatar to the companys upcoming LNG terminal at Dahej in Gujarat A similar Petronet terminal but half the size of Dahej is coming up in Kochi Kerala state The transportation contract for this is to be decided later Two other major Indian shipowners who have taken a step towards LNG transportation are Great Eastern Shipping and Essar Shipping The former has formed a consortium with Indian Oil Corporation and Exmar while Essar has joined hands with Malaysia International Shipping Corporation MISC to form a joint venture dedicated to gas transportation The Dollars bn MISC the national shipping line of Malaysia is one of the worlds leading owners and operators of LNG tankers As a listed company on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange MISC has the stateowned petroleum and oil giant Petronas a Fortune company as its largest shareholder with a stake of Our memorandum of understanding has both companies holding an equal equity share in the joint venture said Essar Shippings chief executive Sanjay Mehta However at a later date we may both dilute our stakes equally in favour of a third strategic partner and continue to hold equal equity The final debtequity ratio for the acquisition of the LNG vessels will be decided by the management of the joint venture Shipping secretary Mr Pinto feels that there are many opportunities for Indian companies but is insistent that the tonnage be registered in India so that ancillary business activities in the sector are spurred We will try and secure tax benefits for the shipowners concerned since they badly need to gain the experience management and manpower training in a niche segment he said It would also help in Indian fleet expansion since tonnage has remained virtually stagnant for the last five yearsMichael

When ready the vessel will ferry m tpa of LNG from RasGas of Qatar to Enrons megapower facility at Dabhol near Ratnagiri in southern Maharashtra However to return to the Petronet deal The MOLSCI consortium won the coveted contract by quoting a charter hire rate of Dollars per day which was substantially lower than the bids of the two other competing consortia MISCEssar and ExmarGreat Eastern ShippingIndian Oil Corporation The Petronet LNG deal was the most prestigious and important LNG shipping project in the country and we were very keen to secure it says Mr Srivastava So we told our Japanese partners to quote the best possible rates A stake in the consortium formed with Enron may only be sufficient to net SCI a boardroom presence in GSC but its stake in the Petronet LNG shipping venture will allow the shipping major to exercise much more power on the latter companys board There are other issues involved If we had not emerged winners in Petronets shipping deal it would have done us a lot of harm for the other LNG shipping projects that are fast coming up in the country says Mr Srivastava We have already made tremendous headway in LNG shipping by being part of the Dabhol project and we were very keen to maintain the momentum Experts rate SCI as one of the best managed public sector enterprises and the bottom line of the company reinforces this feeling For the first nine months of the financial year SCI had a sales turnover of Rsbn Dollars m which was better than the Rsbn recorded for the corresponding nine months of the previous year The net profit zoomed from Rsm during the period April to December to Rsbn for the same nine months of While the results for the financial year ended March are still being compiled SCI officials place the sales turnover at around Rsbn and the net profit at just above the Rsbn mark While the companys tankers have produced spectacular results even the lossmaking liner division is expected to turn round the corner We have removed nearly of the nonperforming assets in the division and the balance will be chopped off in the fiscal year says Sudhir S Rangnekar director liner shipping division Recently international consultants Pricewaterhouse Coopers PwC carried out a SWOT analysis for SCI They suggested a corporate transformation of the company apart from going ahead with the information technology initiatives taken earlier The company went ahead and signed a memorandum of understanding with the ministry of shipping for the financial year whereby two new criteria will be used for judging the organisations performance A new criterion corporate transformation project implementation has been introduced in the MoU reflecting the emphasis that we are placing on enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations says Mr Rangnekar It also reflects our keenness to develop greater customer focus through process redesigning and improvement and adoption of the latest IT systems and applications

FERCS LATEST REFUND ORDERS Foster Electric Report c Copyright Foster Associates Inc About the same time that PGE Corp and Edison International announced combined writeoffs of nearly billion in unrecovered purchased power costs four major California energy suppliers reported increases ranging from percent to percent in firstquarter revenues Meanwhile FERC has issued new refund orders requiring many of these same generators to justify in overcharges during March PGE and Southern California Edison Cos WriteOffs After a long delay PGE and Edison during the middle of April confirmed what many knew was coming huge writeoffs for unrecovered purchased power costs during the year Edison announced that it was writing off billion in undercollected power costs for the year leaving the company with a billion loss for the year Edison chief John Bryson was hopeful nevertheless that a recent memorandum of understanding MOU his company signed with the state will allow Edison to recover some of those costs and help keep its Southern California Edison Co SoCal Edison affiliate out of bankruptcy Prompt implementation of the MOU can avoid the large costs of a SoCal Edison bankruptcy and make it possible for the company to restore its financial health and ability to maintain a reliable power grid said Bryson in a statement accompanying Edisons financial results Whether Brysons hope for quick implementation of the MOU will be realized is questionable Gov Gray Davis has been having a hard time finding the necessary legislative support for the proposal and to date has been unable even to find a legislator to sponsor a bill to implement the MOU Instead several state legislators are exploring alternatives including having the state buy SoCal Edisons transmission assets as well as the whole utility and turn it into a state power agency Edisons northern California neighbor PGE Corp reported a strong growth in revenues for led by the strong performance of its energy trading unit but that revenue growth was completely offset by the billion in losses incurred by its now bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric Co utility subsidiary While standard accounting rules required the utility to record a charge against earnings for unreimbursed wholesale and transition costs taking this charge does not diminish our conviction that the utility is entitled under law to recover these costs nor does it diminish our ongoing lawsuit in federal district court said PGE Corp chief Robert Glynn Generators FirstQuarter Revenue Reports In sharp contrast with PGEs and Edisons financial performance the parent companies of four of Californias largest generators reported large jumps in firstquarter revenues Enron Corp reported revenues of billion a whopping percent increase from a year earlier The company owns only a small amount of wind generation in California but sells power into the state through its Portland General Electric subsidiary and is an energy trader in the state Enrons commodity sales and service unit showed a percent increase in firstquarter earnings Reliant Energy Inc saw firstquarter earnings jump percent to billion The companys wholesale energy business unit produced million in operating income for the first quarter up sharply from the million loss the company reported a year earlier Reporting a slightly lower but still a substantial percent jump in firstquarter revenues was Dynegy Inc Of the companys billion in revenues for the period its marketing and trading subsidiary realized million in earnings nearly double the in earnings reported a year earlier The parent company reported a percent jump in first quarter earnings over the previous year Duke Energy Corp announced a percent boost in firstquarter revenues to billion led by a percent increase in earnings by wholesale energy unit FERCs Refund Order Similar to separate orders regarding January and February power sales in California FERC on issued a notice demanding that three generators justify in combined power sales during March FERC staff set a MWh proxy clearing price for the month and then applied it to the hours of Stage power alerts that were declared during March in California The staffs proxy prices for January and February were MWh and MWh respectively The clearing prices fluctuations can be attributed to changes in operating costs including fuel and emissions credits The latest refund order is the smallest of the three asking for cost support for just in transactions while the previous two orders cited a combined million in potential overcharges The three wholesale sellers being questioned by the current refund order Dynegy Power Marketing Inc Mirant California Mirant Delta and Mirant Portrero and Williams Energy Services Corp were named in the previous orders as well Once again Dynegy led the pack with the largest amount of potential refunds for March nearly Combined with the previous two orders the company is on the hook for more than

boycott help lower Californias electricity bill By MICHAEL LIEDTKE AP Business Writer Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved SAN FRANCISCO AP Theres a limit to how much people will pay for most things in life If the cost scares off enough buyers prices eventually fall So what would happen if this textbook example from Economics were applied to Californias electricity crisis What if the state officials struggling to maintain energy supplies simply refused to buy power above a certain price and accepted more blackouts this summer The question would have been absurd just a few months ago and even now the notion seems surreal given the possible consequences Inviting even more blackouts inevitably would hurt businesses and frustrate consumers threatening to further depress Californias already slumping economy the sixth largest in the world But desperate times require drastic measures according to the economists lawmakers and activists who believe the state will be better off sitting in the dark than buying electricity at any price during a summer shortage likely to produce recurring blackouts anyway Its better to use blackouts and break the wholesale energy cartel than simply to suffer them said Michael Shames executive director of the Utility Consumer Action Network a San Diego watchdog group Refusing to buy enough power to keep the lights on would be like playing with fire counters Wells Fargo Co chief economist Sung Won Sohn Blackouts arent a just matter of inconvenience or being too hot or cold They cost businesses a lot of money Buying electricity at the last minute to meet the states power needs already has cost the California government billion in the past months The state energy bill for could reach billion in money otherwise spent on education public safety and health care Shames said Faced with the prospect of a significant budget deficit some lawmakers think its time for California to take a stand against the power wholesalers many of whom are based outside the state This Tuesday the state Senate Energy Committee will consider authorizing the state to refuse to buy power above certain prices Current law requires state electricity managers to avoid blackouts by buying all available power at any cost We have been over a barrel in so many ways said Sen Dede Alpert DCoronado who sponsored SBx Maybe theres a point in the market where we just say no and go with the planned blackout strategy instead Economists give the bill little chance of succeeding Its never going to happen Its not a viable option said University of California at Berkeley Professor Severin Borenstein one of the energy experts who have studied the idea The business lost during blackouts would mean more layoffs in a state already skittish over the technology downturn and the looming Hollywood writers strike economists say Other ripple effects include diminished gasoline supplies leading to even higher prices at the pump and distribution headaches that could leave store shelves bare And some consumers the elderly and the infirm for example need power at any price Without electricity Manteca resident Betty Jarzemkoski said she wouldnt be able to help her ailing husband to get out of his motorized bed at home It would be a real hardship for us said Jarzemkoski Im on a fixed income so I hope they can figure out something to bring down prices But we need power Despite such concerns the concept of a buyers boycott hasnt been flatly ruled out at least publicly by Gov Gray Davis as he struggles to reduce the states staggering electricity bill The state is spending as much as million per day to meet Californias electricity needs and the bleeding is sure to get worse When the summer heat increases demand and tightens supplies California might spend more than billion each week state officials estimate Extended blackouts pose an even greater cost economists say When Northern California suffered rolling blackouts for several hours Jan the economic losses totaled billion mostly from lost profits and wages estimated the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp Multiply that over several weeks across the entire state and it becomes apparent why it makes more sense for California to continue buying power at inflated prices even if leaves the state with deep debts and a ruined credit rating economists argue As it is California probably wont be able to round up enough power at any price on some days this summer making some blackouts a virtual certainty The blackouts will reduce the states economic output by billion to billion according to a study released last month by the Bay Area Economic Forum The resolve of the states politicians and ratepayers would be sorely tested for a boycott to succeed much in the way that labor strikes boil down to whether workers or management can withstand more financial pain Politicians arent going to willingly turn out the lights because politicians want to get reelected said Borenstein director of the University of Californias energy institute As soon as people start losing their jobs because the power is off the public will get tired of the blackouts real quick Still Californians might tolerate an increase in blackouts if they understand why the state chose to pursue such a drastic course said Stanford economics Professor Frank Wolak who heads the Independent System Operators market surveillance committee This isnt something you could do without an enormous public relations campaign he said The campaign would have to explain that the state had no other choice but to do this because federal power regulators arent doing their job and enforcing the law against unjust and unreasonable prices The largest outofstate generators are in such robust financial shape that it might take weeks before they would feel such pain from a California boycott that they would be forced to lower prices After making record profits

Limited BOMBAY May Reuters Indian lenders to US energy group Enron Corps gasfired power plant south of Bombay have appealed to the Indian government to help end the companys row with a stateowned electricity board over pricing and upaid bills The board of Enrons Indian unit Dabhol Power Co DPC has authorised management to stop selling power to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB if a bitter dispute over pricing and unpaid bills cannot be resolved In the past half year the MSEB has defaulted on bills for electricity supplied by Dabhol which operates the worlds largest gasfired plant on the west coast of India kilometres miles south of Bombay Indian financial institutions which contributed billion towards the project in loans are pressing the government to help end the crisis a source told Reuters We have asked the government for help We are awaiting their reply the source who is employed with a large financial institution said The domestic lenders to the project are Industrial Development Bank of India ICICI Ltd Industrial Finance Corporation of India Canara Bank and State Bank of India The Dabhol Power Company DPC owned percent by Enron last month took the major step of bailing out of the billion power project citing nonpayment of bills by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB The DPC boards move sparked widespread fears that Indias image as a safe destination for foreign direct investment would be damaged POWER STRUGGLE MSEB which is a stateowned utility has been a regular defaulter on payments to DPC saying that it finds the power too costly It has also backed out on its commitment to buy more power to be produced by the projects second phase which is to begin operations later this year Last month MSEB said it had paid Dabhol Power billion rupees million for electricity it bought in March But the payment only partially resolves the total overdue amount of billion rupees million which Enron has been unable to collect even after invoking guarantees issued by the government of Maharashtra Indias most industrialised state and the federal government The state utility still owes Enron payments for power purchases in December and January The Indian government has maintained that the contract must be renegotiated and has set up a committee to do so We are concerned and would like the renegotiations to happen fast the source added The dispute has raised fears that Enron could pull the plug on the project cease providing power to the local state electricity board and perhaps even sell the plant The plant is good

trading wholesale electricity on the FrenchItalian border and was set to enter the German power market We have done some wholesale trading on the ItalyFrance border moving power from France to Italy and we are very close to doing some in Germany said director of trading Tony West in an interview with Reuters This year we will significantly increase our trading in mainland Europe we are discussing relationships with counterparties at the moment he added Innogy is building a European power trading team at its headquarters in Swindon southern England from where it already trades the UK gas and power markets FRANCE COULD BE KEY MARKET West said the company initially had expected the main focus of its European trading strategy to be Germany and the north west of the continent But the early signs were that France would also play a key role particularly as Innogy had gained access to capacity in the UKFrance undersea interconnector cable France has taken me by surprise It might be more important than we anticipated although there are clearly still issues about the speed of liberalisation said West A core of about eight companies regularly trade power in France including TXU Europe Enron and a trading alliance between Endesa and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter according to traders West said Innogy had so far concentrated on buying power in France not always from French companies and taking it to Italy via the cross border interconnector between the two countries Innogy had bought some of the megawatts available on the interconnector through recent auctions he said Its easy to trade through France the cost of taking power through to the border is minuscule although buying power in France and then selling it in France is a lot more difficult said West He said Innogy had signed grid balancing agreements with French transmission grid operator RTE Andy Duff managing director of generation and trading added France could become become important for Innogy on a retail level as well as a trading level depending on how effectively the UKFrance interconnector could be used The European market will be driven by the operation of interconnectors and transmission services as well as exchanges said Duff Innogy may look to trade on Germanys two power exchanges as well as that countrys burgeoning overthecounter market The company is in the process of signing standard trading agreements for Germany based on the terms devised by the industry group the European Federation of Energy Traders EFET FOCUS ON TRADING NOT ASSETS Duff said Innogys strategy in Europe was to focus on trading but not the acquisition of physical assets We are not going to lead with assets in Europe We will focus on trading servicestype arrangements extracting value from other companies assets Thats the main thrust of the business he said West said Innogys trading in mainland Europe would expand into natural gas as opportunities emerged The company already trades around the UKBelgium

their shares Phone companies sold billion of bonds last year to finance licenses and equipment for new mobile services British Telecom said yesterday it will sell its stakes in Japan Telecom Co and Spains Airtel SA to Vodafone Group for billion pounds British Telecom may also sell as much as billion pounds of shares to existing investors in a socalled rights offer according to Legal General Group Plc one of the companys shareholders Deutsche Telekom will sell assets such as cable television and a stake in Global One and Wind SpA Chief Financial Officer KarlGerhard Eick said last week KPN the biggest Dutch phone company said on March it plans to raise at least billion euros from asset sales to lower debt Those plans have helped shift investors perceptions of the companies creditworthiness money managers said Drastic Measures At the beginning of the year the market was assuming telecoms companies would be downgraded from singleA to triple B said Peter Harvey who helps run about billion at FC Management Drastic measures such as deeplydiscounted rights issues led investors to believe they will maintain their singleA status The gap or spread between British Telecoms sterling denominated bonds maturing in and UK fiveyear government bonds has narrowed basis points to basis points in the past month Spreads between Deutsche Telekoms percent five year euro bonds and German government debt narrowed basis points to in April Bankruptcy Swaps Fall Those shifts in sentiment are also reflected in Enrons bankruptcy swaps where prices have fallen in the past month said Simon Brooks a trader at Enron Enron prices the swaps using indexes that measure the probability of bankruptcy and the likely recovery rate in that event The price is expressed as a percentage above a benchmark interest rate such as the London interbank offered rate or Libor British Telecom bankruptcy swaps have declined to basis points from on April Enron said Bankruptcy swaps on Deutsche Telekom dropped to from while KPNs fell to from Over the same period France Telecom SAs declined to from and Telecom Italia SpAs fell to from British Telecoms bond yields may fall further relative to government debt analysts said They still offer higher yields than those of rival Vodafone Group Plc which has the same ratings though with a stable outlook While both companies have fiveyear eurodenominated bonds British Telecoms offer basis points more yield The rivals also both have bonds maturing in and Vodafones yield about basis points fewer If BT retains their rating their spreads should be probably to basis points narrower said Brian Venables head of credit strategy at WestLB Even though it has performed extremely well this year there is much greater potential for BTs debt Debt Reduction Target Both Moodys Investors Service which rates British Telecom A and Standard Poors which rates it A have those ratings on watch for further cuts after trimming them four rungs last year The companys asset sales to Vodafone are definitely positive in terms of the rating assessment said Aidan Fisher who rates British Telecom for Moodys In combination with the proceeds of a rights

off further rating cuts Before companies such as British Telecom clarified their debtreduction plans the world and his wife were underweight telecom bonds in March said Harvey at FC The investment

analysis on Bloomberg BRITEL Corp GO for BTs bonds DT Corp GO for Deutsche Telekoms bonds UKCorporates warm to charms of credit derivatives By Tom Bergin Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited LONDON May Reuters European corporates are beginning to turn to credit derivatives among the more esoteric and complex of financial instruments to hedge the risk their debtors wont pay up market participants said on Thursday Credit derivatives are insurancelike tools that allow users to hedge the risk of default on a debt They are mainly used by banks hedge funds and insurance companies to hedge or gain exposure to the risk of a bond issuer defaulting Dealers said an environment of deteriorating credit quality and a growing awareness among corporates that credit derivatives offer certain advantages over established hedging tools was behind the increasing use of the instruments The market remains small with only around a dozen nonfinancial European corporates regularly using credit derivatives to manage their credit portfolio at present But market professionals predict they will one day become as commonplace in the corporate world as other hedging tools such as interest rate swaps and currency options We see corporate use as a big growth area for credit derivatives maybe the biggest says Bryan Seyfried vicepresident of Enron Credit in London Enron Credit grew out of the efforts of energy company Enron Corp to hedge its own credit risk portfolio and now specialises in marketing credit risk management solutions to other nonfinancial corporates Ralf Lierow director of credit derivatives at Siemens Financial Services in Munich said the ability to buy and sell in a liquid market means credit derivatives offer a flexibility that established tools like credit insurance and forfaiting guarantees lack Credit derivatives were are often cheaper than the alternatives too he added This is not a trading book thing For us the credit default swap is another tool for credit risk management Lierow said HELPS OPERATIONAL UNITS DO MORE BUSINESS Siemens Financial Services acts as the centralised risk portfolio management operation for companies within the Siemens electronics and industrial group It first started using credit derivatives in July Large companies like Siemens can have hundreds of millions of dollars in receivables on their books at any time The efficiency with which these companies manage the credit risk on their receivables has an impact on their day to day business The advantage for the operative area is that they can offload more receivables and do more business Lierow said Siemens uses credit default swaps the most liquid type of credit derivatives to hedge its portfolio of debtors on a constant basis As the balance of cash owed by each name fluctuates over time the company tries to match this with default swap positions Hence if a customer fails to pay Siemens can recoup the debt from the default swap seller Other companies use credit derivatives less frequently There are occasional corporate users that have secured oneoff requirements for balancesheet management aims or to strip out the credit risk of a commercial transaction said Walter Gontarek head of global credit products at RBC Dominion Securities By hedging a country or company risk which a corporate may not be comfortable in carrying a credit derivative can facilitate a project that may otherwise be unfeasible dealers said NOT PUT OFF BY BAD PRESS Corporates adoption of credit derivatives is in spite of the negative publicity the instruments have received in recent years A number of disputes over whether protection buyers could force banks to pay up on contracts have ended up in court However traders insist that subsequent work done on contract documentation minimises the risk of such disputes in future Nonetheless a very practical concern for corporates remains in that credit derivatives documentation was designed by bankers with sovereign and corporate bonds in mind The International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA standard documentation for credit default swaps allows for a payout in relation to defaults on bond payments but not on a private debtors failure to pay We use the ISDA framework but we need it redrafted in specific ways to fit our needs You cannot take a standard contract and trade on it if you want to hedge trade receivables Lierow said These amendments add to the cost of the credit derivative Another problem that corporates face is the complexity of credit derivatives There is little experience of the instruments which are barely a decade old in the corporate world Siemens had to get its expertise from the financial markets hiring Lierow from Bankgesellschaft Berlin Clive Banks UK head of derivatives sales to buyside clients at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney said much of the effort in marketing credit derivatives to corporates involves educating them about the products and the risks involved Its about explaining credit risk management and what kind of volatility and cost having credit risk introduces he said OUTLOOK PROMISING Yet some corporates are beginning to take full advantage of their new tool Lierow said that Siemens which currently only buys credit protection planned to start acting as a default swaps seller in the coming months He said selling would facilitate better matching of protection levels to actual exposures and would enable diversification of risk away from industry sectors where the companys activities are concentrated You could improve the portfolio mix by buying protection on automotives and selling protection on pharmaceuticals he said Allegheny Energy buys three power plants Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press

their forecast of the profitability of generating electricity in the US in and beyond because power prices are expected to drop more sharply than natural gas prices starting next year The analysts cut the profit margin in natural gasfired power in to a megawatthour from MWh a difference from their last forecast in February They lowered their power price index for by and for by Thursday in a published report Their forecast is based on forward markets for electricity and gas Gas prices are remaining strong for a much longer period of time while power prices drop off senior electricity industry analyst Raymond Niles said in a telephone conference with investors As a result stock prices for power producers such as AES Corp AES Mirant MIR Calpine Corp CPN and NRG Energy NRG could peak this summer in advance of strong third quarter earnings reports the Salomon report says Investors may still shy away from asset and investmentheavy power producers if realized prices begin to reflect the decreases in power prices now projected in the forward curve the report warns After this summer the stocks of energy companies that focus more on trading will regain momentum Salomon expects These energy merchant companies such as Enron Corp ENE Williams Cos WMB Duke Energy DUK and Dynegy DYN should be able to take advantage of higher trading volume and greater volatility in power markets in nonsummer months according to Salomon We expect annual trading volumes to grow industrywide between and on average during as the billion global energy commodity market continues to open the report predicts The overall electricity price trend is national according to Salomon The report titled Power Curve expects wholesale power prices to exceed last years by in the West and by on average in the eastern US including Texas But since their last forecast the analysts lowered their forward price curve for next year and beyond in of regional power pools Interestingly the exception to that is the New York Power Pool Niles told investors For the remainder of this year however Salomon still expects power producers to beat substantially last years breakthrough results About of the spike upward in western US power prices the past six months has been from something weve never seen before in this industry political and credit risk Niles said in the conference Western merchant power suppliers are benefitting from the unholy mess in California Niles said but that wont last forever Whenever the debate tapers off and we have a resolution in sight that premium will slowly drain out of the western markets and bring down profitability for the group Niles said National calls for reregulation due to the California crisis could continue to hurt stock prices for the entire sector even though reregulation wont happen Further in so far as such calls discourage investment in generating plants transmission lines and gas pipelines they could also extend the current period of extremely high

contract Dabhol Power Company DPC said in a statement As a matter of courtesy we have agreed to meet with them next week the DPC statement said Since the purpose of our meeting is to hear out the committee and understand their thoughts we will not present any proposal DPC said it had constantly maintained that it was open to maintaining a dialogue towards resolving issues But This meeting should in no manner be construed as an open offer from DPC to renegotiate the terms of the contract it added DPC and the government of the western state of Maharashtra have been locked in a payment battle for months with the states electricity board balking at paying Enron what it considers too high a rate for electricity At present Maharashtras State Electricity Board MSEB owes the DPC of which Enron is a percent stakeholder some million for power The Maharashtra government last week announced the formation of a panel of experts to renegotiate its contract with DPC and lower the cost of power sold to MSEB LARGEST FOREIGN INVESTMENT The Dabhol project the single largest foreign investment in India consists of two phases the alreadybuilt megawatt power plant and a MW plant that is expected to be finished this year Last week Dabhols board authorised the plants managing director to issue a preliminary notice of termination of service to MSEB The notice which has not been issued

But its got its work cut out While investors were cheered by news that its US Utahbased Hunter power plant is back online after a sixmonth outage that cost the company an estimated million uncertainty over its plans for its Southern Water unit and apparent ongoing commitment to lossmaking telecoms venture Thus are seen as muddling group focus It all adds up the lack of coherent strategy quite substantial downgrades and a whole host of noncore businesses that they dont have any natural management flair or expertise in said Brian Gallagher a senior fund manager at Londonbased Gartmore Investment Management which has GBP million of Scottish Power shares in its Global Utilities Fund We have a reasonably low opinion of the company The company said Thursday that its pretax profit before goodwill amortization and exceptional items for the fiscal year ending March fell to GBP million from GBP million a year ago Adjusted earnings per share declined to pence in the fiscal year from pence in The company acknowledged profits have been hit hard by the Hunter outage competition on wholesale and retail markets in the UK and strict price controls on its regulated infrastructure businesses Although the companys shares were trading at pence after the release of Thursdays earnings results up from pence Wednesday they are down more than from pence a year ago Executives say they are restructuring the business into three targeted divisions to capitalize on its traditional strengths in generation and power supply and infrastructure and to expand its overseas activities Weve now got a trading and commercial link between generation and supply and the first thing we are doing is putting emphasis on thaton growing earnings across that value chain Scottish Power Chief Executive Ian Russell told journalists in a conference call Thursday In the US we are focused on cost cutting and on acquiring new businesses Scottish Powers move away from a full multiutility profile begun last year with its partial disposal of Thus and its withdrawal from an Internet banking venture with the Royal Bank of Scotland toward a more narrowly focused energy business mimics a trend across the industry toward greater specialization The company is also considering selling Southern Water which would allow it to focus even more closely on its power business Yet analysts and investors say they are looking for more details of the companys overall growth strategy from Russell who took over as chief executive last month and other managers The toll from months of drift is evident they said Sales Of Southern Water Thus Seen Indeed despite its efforts to chart a new road Scottish Power appears to be reluctant to acknowledge the failure of some of its noncore ventures Russell said his company remains supportive of Thus which reported a fiscal year loss of GBP million this week and has no plans to exit its remaining stake in the company Similarly he said Scottish Power hasnt yet made a final decision to dispose of Southern Water which has cut costs under its Scottish parent but is increasingly unable to cover its capital expenditure although he said the company had received a number of offers from potential buyers Although he declined to identify any of the bidders Italian energy company Enel SpA ENI has confirmed its interest Industry sources said a prompt sale of the water unit looks likely with some bids already exceeding the GBP billion at which many analysts value the companys combined assets and debt Its unclear they said how Southern Water or Thus would fit into Scottish Powers new image Scottish Power sees itself as an international energy company a source familiar with the company said In a years time he added it would be unlikely that Southern Water and Thus would be part of the company Revenues from the sale of the water unit would also help Scottish Power pursue its US expansion without adding to its gearing levels analysts and investors said Russell declined to comment on reports Scottish Power is considering buying Enron Corps Oregonbased unit Portland General but admitted the company would be a logical geographical fit with Pacificorp Analysts said Scottish Powers plans for US growth is likely to be a key part of its energy strategy We like their US strategy where theyve leveraged expertise gained in the highly competitive UK market said Gareth LewisDavies head of utilities research at Lehman Brothers in London Closer to home competition and the trend toward increased specialization in the power industry may force Scottish Power to determine whether its business strength lies in asset management or retail and generation Strategic decisions need to be made and Im not sure if they are going to make them in the near term or not said Andrew Wright UK utilities analyst at UBS Warburg in London They are pretty much involved across the value chain and I think it remains to be seen which part of the value chain they

Economy Utilities Make Own Plans for CO Curbs Entergy Sets Emissions Cap As Bush Climate Policy Remains to Be Resolved By John J Fialka Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc WASHINGTON Some major US utilities are beginning to step out ahead of the Bush administration on the climatechange issue developing their own plans for curbing emissions of carbon dioxide the manmade gas thought to be contributing to global warming Meanwhile the White House is under growing pressure to demonstrate that its plans to boost energy production can be environmentally sensitive President Bush signed an executive order requiring the federal government to conserve energy during periods of peak demand in California and other places facing energy shortages Mr Bush also said the federal government would make available power generators in case of emergencies Conservation has got to be an integral part of making sure weve got a reasonable energy policy Mr Bush said New Orleansbased Entergy Corp the nations third largest utility in terms of electricity produced said that it will will impose a limit on CO from its power plants that burn natural gas oil or coal and stay within that level of emissions for five years We understand that this is a very politically contentious subject said company Vice President Jim Mutch If other companies do their fair share now hopefully when there is a regulatory scheme there will be less of a problem By running its plants with greater efficiency improving the efficiency of its electricity and gas transmission systems and engaging in some outside CO reduction efforts such as planting trees that absorb the gases Entergy hopes to keep its overall CO emissions at million tons per year Mr Mutch said The company which derives of its power from fossil fuels will work with the New Yorkbased group Environmental Defense to make sure its efforts are effective and measurable Meanwhile a coalition of five other electric power companies is calling for a mandatory cap on CO emissions that would decline annually if the Bush administration develops a national emissions trading system that allows a company to decide which technologies to use to reduce CO and other pollutants Were basically planning on a glide path downward regarding emissions limits explained Mark Irion a spokesman for the group which includes Enron Corp and El Paso Energy Corp of Houston Calpine Corp of San Jose Calif Trigen Energy Corp of White Plains NY and NiSource Inc of Merrillville Ind Emissions trading gives companies incentives to introduce new technology Mr Irion said Under the trading scheme which is used currently to address sulfurdioxide pollution a company that reduces emissions below its target level gets trading credits that it can sell to other companies thus helping to offset the costs of new capital investment Sulfur dioxide plays a major role in acid rain The announcements come as the entire US utility industry which produces about a third of the nations manmade CO is engaged in behindthescenes negotiations with the White House energy task force headed by Vice President Cheney over how to set up a meaningful voluntary system for reducing CO nationwide Meanwhile private utilities federally owned entities such as the Tennessee Valley Authority and rural electric cooperatives are trying to develop an industry consensus on a voluntary program According to one industry official involved in both discussions who asked not to be identified one idea of interest to the task force involves voluntary contracts that power companies would make with the government calling for CO emissions cuts Once signed the contracts target reductions would become mandatory Called a soft cap program it could become part of the US position for the next round of international climatechange talks slated for Bonn Germany in July We have only recently begun to engage the administration said the official Since March when the Bush administration aroused a furor among environmental groups and European allies by announcing it was no longer interested in the Kyoto Protocol to curb climate change it has held a series of cabinetlevel seminars on climate change bringing in industry experts and a variety of government and outside scientists President Bush will need to have some outline of a new US climatechange policy by next month when he goes to Sweden for a summit with leaders of the European Union Were well aware of the calendar said one US official Tom Kuhn president of the Edison Electric Institute a trade association here that represents privatesector utilities said I think the Bush administration is definitely interested in things that they can do to address this issue He noted however that it is too early for a industrygovernment consensus on CO reduction Nobodys agreed upon specifics Bob Davis contributed to this article Metro Desk California

STAFF WRITERS Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO In a visit meant to underscore the Bush administrations heightened concern about the California electricity crisis Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham met Thursday with Gov Gray Davis in Sacramento to discuss federal energy conservation plans I think we have an approach that can result in significant savings Abraham told Davis The energy secretary said he was in California to gauge what we can do to add to what California is already doing The trip came after President Bush revealed plans for a series of conservation measures for federal buildings and military bases nationwide Those facilities in California account for of the states total energy use Today Abraham is scheduled to meet with federal officials in San Francisco to work out details of the nationwide program for more than federal buildings After meeting with Abraham at the White House earlier Thursday Bush said Were worried about blackouts that may occur this summer and we want to be a part of any solutions This administration is deeply concerned about California and its citizens Defending his response to the California crisis Bush said As I said from the very beginning of my administration well work to help California in any way we can Also Thursday Davis met with alternative energy producers in an attempt to persuade them to continue operations despite being owed more than billion by Californias private utilities Alternative energy producers including oil companies that generate electricity as a byproduct of their operations account for about of the electricity consumed in California Several have stopped producing after the utilities could no long afford to pay soaring prices for their power Davis assigned S David Freeman and former Assemblyman Richard Katz a Davis appointee to a state water board to be in charge of negotiations Davis said he hoped that the talks could be completed within a week And in a sign that major energy companies may get more involved in the California crisis Kenneth Lay CEO of the Houstonbased energy giant Enron Corp met Thursday with Davis Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg DSherman Oaks and Senate President Pro Tem John Burton DSan Francisco Meanwhile Bush on Thursday directed federal agencies to take appropriate actions to conserve energy use at their facilities In California such measures could include setting thermostats to degrees lowering lighting and turning off escalators during Stage and Stage power emergencies administration officials said Those occur when the states electricity reserves fall below and respectively and can trigger interruptions in service Bush did not set an energysaving target But the Defense Department one of the states single largest energy consumersusing about of peak demandpledged to reduce peak use by this summer and an additional by summer That would make available megawatts officials said enough to provide electricity to about homes during the summer The federal government accounts for about of total energy use across the country making it one of the nations largest energy consumers according to the Energy Department Bush also offered to make available to the state powergenerating units owned by the federal government But his efforts failed to mollify Democratic critics who renewed calls for the administration to impose price controls on wholesale electricity The generating companies are gouging California consumers while the president turns his back on us Sen Barbara Boxer DCalif said in a statement Rep Sam Farr DCarmel leader of the California Democratic congressional delegation sent a letter to Vice President Dick Cheney protesting Democrats exclusion from Cheneys meeting this week with California GOP lawmakers As we head into the high summer demand months it is unfortunate that you have decided to keep Democrats in the dark about the administrations plans to deal with the crisis Farr said Bushs conservation initiative comes after Cheney who is heading a task force on national energy policy was assailed by some critics for emphasizing production over conservation Conservation has got to be an integral part of making sure weve got a reasonable energy policy Bush said Thursday But what the vice president was saying is we cant conserve our way to energy independence nor can we conserve our way to having enough energy available Weve got to do both We must conserve but weve also got to find new sources of energy David M Nemtzow president of the Alliance to Save Energy called the directive an emergency answer to a longterm problem We need to fix the underlying problem by investing in energyefficient lighting cooling and controls he said We hope that this crisis will encourage the president to increase the budget for energy management rather than cut it by as previously proposed Political analysts said the effort was driven by concerns for not only electrons but also elections Its all about political conservation said Marshall Wittmann senior fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute Thomas E Mann senior fellow at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution agreed The administration has come to the view that just because they cant win California in a presidential election doesnt mean the Republican Party can afford to kiss off the largest state in the Union Analysts speculated that the administration came under pressure from California Republicans in Congress who worried about perceptions that the White House was not being aggressive enough in responding to the crisis As federal officials search for ways that California can avoid blackouts this summer a Woodland Hillsbased advocacy group More Power to You has suggested that the Navy hook its nuclearpowered ships to the state power grid to provide energy while in port The Navy has nuclearpowered aircraft carriers and submarines in San Diego and Washington state But Navy officials said it is not technologically feasible to use the nuclear reactors aboard the ships to provide power for the grid because most of that power goes directly to the propulsion systems Even to capture power not used for propulsion would require extensive construction on shore and retrofitting aboard ship officials said Also using ships to provide onshore power could disrupt training

and Power The government of the western state of Maharashtra has appointed a negotiating committee headed by former bureaucrat Madhav Godbole to renegotiate the estranged PPA signed by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB and DPC Enron had made opening of talks with Maharashtra conditional on the presence of Centres representative on the negotiating committee Salve would meet secretaries in the ministries of Finance Power and Law to firm up the federal governments stand on the crisis arising out of payment defaults by MSEB sources said adding that the Petroleum secretary is also likely to be included in the panel Sources said Enron appeared to be keen on solving the present impasse through negotiations judging from Corporation Chairman Kenneth Lays statement yesterday in Houston that the company had no plans to sell its stake in the billion Dabhol project PTI Enron ready to take part in PPA talk Nitin Yeshwantrao The Times of India Copyright C The Times of India Source World Reporter TM MUMBAI The Enron management has finally agreed to participate in a discussion with the Madhav Godboleled renegotiation committee setup to facilitate the restructuring of the Power Purchase Agreement PPA signed between the US power major and the state government Officials of Dabhol Power Company DPC a subsidiary of Enron alongwith their team of shareholders and lenders will arrive here on May for talks with the ninemember Godbole panel Though the DPC spokesperson was reluctant to give a confirmation a key Mantralaya official told The times of India that the team had expressed willingness for talks with the experts committee in a bid to end the imbroglio Enrons response is viewed as a welcome development to amicably resolve the controversy which had been raging for the last few weeks with the board of directors of Enron authorising its India MD K Wade Cline to serve a termination notice to MSEB The state government on its part too adopted a confrontational position by slapping a Rs crore rebate charge on DPC for defaulting on power supply However the sudden change of heart by the Enron management is largely attributed to the stand taken by its local lenders led by Industrial Development Bank of India IDBI which had recently opposed the move to pull out of the project This was in contradiction to the stand taken by the foreign lenders of the DPC who were in favour of slamming the brakes on disbursement of funds to DPC The Congressled Democratic Front government had publicly declared that it would impress upon the Enron management to renegotiate the PPA as scrapping the project would not be in the interest of both the parties Last week the state government constituted a ninemember panel of experts under former bureaucrat Madhav Godbole Godbole had written to the DPC management inviting it for talks to renegotiate the PPA on May For the delayed response from Enron the meeting has been rescheduled to May The issues which would be debated at the meeting include the separation of the LNG facility from the power plant renegotiating LNG supply and shipping agreements redefining the DPC tariff and to convert it into a twopart tariff The Godbole panel will bargain hard for removal of dollar denomination in the fixed charge component and to allow the Maharashtra government to sell power to third parties Godbole terms of reference not acceptable DPC Our Corporate Bureau Mumbai Business Standard Copyright c Business Standard The Enronpromoted Dabhol Power Company DPC has virtually ruled out negotiations with the Maharashtra governmentappointed Godbole committee to renegotiate the tariff for the power projectand perhaps set the stage for terminating the controversial billion power project In a statement released on late Thursday evening DPC said that it was prepared to meet the Godbole committee as a matter of courtesy but would not present any proposals Significantly the company said the published terms of reference of the Godbole report do not represent an acceptable basis for further discussions It also added This meeting should in no manner be construed as an open offer from DPC to renegotiate the terms of the contract The Godbole panels terms of reference are to bring down the tariff of the mw power project As a part of the agreement with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB DPC is planning to set up a milliontonne LNG facility of which only million tonne is meant for the power project The terms of reference of the Godbole panel include negotiations for delinking the LNG facility from the power plant The panel has also been armed with powers to negotiate on DPCs oftvoiced demand that it should be allowed to sell power not needed by MSEB to third parties A senior MSEB official said that We will hear out what they have to say However as long as they have armed themselves with powers to issue the termination notice nothing can be ruled out On April the DPC board at a meeting in London authorised Enron India MD Wade Cline to serve a termination notice on MSEB whenever he deemed fit Business Outlook Power failure The Independent London FOREIGN Copyright Independent Newspapers UK Limited SCOTTISHPOWER has belatedly acknowledged that electricity and water do not mix By the time the groups new chief executive Ian Russell reports his next set of results Southern Water should have safely floated off to a new owner That will leave the groups much vaunted multiutility strategy a distant if unhappy memory In fairness Mr Russell was the first at ScottishPower to grasp the nettle recognising that water customers were no more likely to buy their energy from the same place than electricity customers were to get their pensions and telephones from the same source The decision to focus on energy and energy alone has at least enabled ScottishPower to stop the rot in its core business Customer defections to rival suppliers which were running at an alarming rate six months ago have now all but stopped And shorn of trying to be all things to all households ScottishPower can exploit what it is good at The shake up in the UK power market has meant that generating assets now come cheap so we can expect to see ScottishPower adding to its portfolio south of the border It is also clearly interested in further US expansion having gained a bridgehead with the pounds bn acquisition of PacifiCorp on the West Coast The jury is still out on the PacifiCorp deal ScottishPower says cost savings are ahead of plan but then the first cuts including the previous managements fleet of company jets and helicopters are always the easiest ones More seriously PacifiCorp has been hit by the lethal combination of surging demand insufficient capacity and skyrocketing wholesale electricity prices which has left a pounds m hole in its revenues of which only a proportion can be recouped through higher domestic bills Mr Russell wants to build his way out of trouble Another megawatts of capacity are coming on stream this year in the US and more will follow But the real question is whether ScottishPower will ever achieve the necessary critical mass to stand toetotoe with the likes of Enron and EON PowerGen bought one UK supply business and one US utility then found it had run out of room to finance any further growth and capitulated to the Germans ScottishPower with pounds bn worth of debt around its neck is at a similar crossroads Mr Russell says it will just have to concentrate on doing what it does best In the hope that someone with deeper pockets notices ScottishPower survives the blackout SIMON BOWERS The Guardian Copyright C The Guardian Source World Reporter TM ScottishPower Britains largest electrical utility yesterday brushed aside US power and other problems and claimed that it was making considerable progress in reducing its exposure to shortages on the west coast of America Its US business incurred extra costs of almost pounds m in the year to March pounds m of which were caused by the breaking down of its Hunter generator plant in Utah The day closure forced the company to buy in power from other generators at a time when prices were high ScottishPower said that the Hunter plant was now repaired and had been supplying customers since last weekend The company plans to increase its generation capacity by MW or in this financial year A new plant in Gadsby Salt Lake City was the first to begin generation this week while five more are in construction The company said its profits would continue to be significantly hit by power shortages in the US for the next two months but increased generation capacity would reduce exposure by September For the year to March it posted underlying pretax profits of pounds m down from pounds m the previous year and in line with analysts forecasts However the City greeted news of a planned restructuring warmly with shares in ScottishPower closing p higher at p A spokesman said that the utility firm was confident of recovering most though not all of the pounds m costs incurred during the US power shortage through increased charges to customers The proposed increases are subject to court proceedings though most analysts consider ScottishPower to have a strong case Ian Russell who took over as chief executive in March said the balance between companys power generation and supply divisions had been out of kilter and added that in creased generation in the US was helping to redress that balance ScottishPower is thought also to be considering acquir ing US firm Enrons Portland plant quoted at around Dollars bn When we acquired PacifiCorp Scottish Powers US business we said it was a platform for further growth Mr Russell said Obviously Portland is right in our own back yard An acquisition could be funded by the proposed sale of its water business Southern Water which has proved ex pensive since the introduction of extra regulatory requirements The company said it had received several expressions of interest for the business ScottishPowers acquisition of Southern Water formed part of its disastrous attempt to establish the company as a multiutility provider supplying customers not only with power but with water fi nancial services through a joint venture with Royal Bank of Scotland and telecoms through its partly spunoff business Thus Yesterday Mr Russell who had backed these ambitious plans during his eight years at ScottishPower outlined a more modest vision for the future You have to limit what you take on he said Right now we are focusing on improving the businesses that we have got The now aborted plans to diversify across a host of utility services contributed to the loss of customers in the UK last year in ScottishPowers core business The figure has since stabilised at m Powergen the British utility that has agreed to a takeover by German power giant EON yesterday said that its pretax profits for the first three months had fallen to pounds m compared with pounds m the previous year Turnover was up thanks to expanding UK business and a three months contribution from its US acquisition LGE though regulatory price caps in Britain had held back earnings M and A April rough for merger mavens by Heidi Nasr The Daily Deal Copyright c The Deal LLC By months end deals were undone worth billion putting merger terminations on track to overtake the billion worth of deals canceled in the first quarter April is the cruelest month or so it is proving for mergerminded companies and their advisory teams On April three mergers worth billion were canceled By months end the pace had barely slowed as deals worth billion unraveled Merger terminations in the second quarter were on track to overtake the billion of the first quarter Yet the April drop compared to an average of a month in the first quarter points to a contrary trend Richard Hall a corporate partner with Cravath Swaine Moore said the decline in April was related to the overall count to date this year People are going into deals with a reoriented idea of the stock market levels Hall said A rising stock market hides a multiplicity of things Whatever is the stated reason it wouldnt surprise me if the basic problem was that people didnt want to do the deals any more with the stock market tanking The high dollar value of deals undone in April came from four big transactions Ariba Incs billion bid for Agile Software Corp FPL Group Incs billion offer for Entergy Corp Sierra Pacific Resources failed billion move for Enron Corps Portland General Electric division and financier Carl Icahns doomed million grab at Trans World Airlines Inc On the advisory side the biggest investment banking firms took the biggest hits In April it was Morgan Stanleys turn The investment bank led with only two deals canceled but worth billion the Agile deal and Entergys billion transaction the full value of which was billion including assumed debt JP Morgan came in second with two canceled deals worth billion with nearly all of that value coming from the FPLEntergy deal as well Hall said most of the failed April deals were simply too much of a stretch in a falling market What happened is that the bad times in the stock market late last year have shaken out the deals that were hard to justify without a frothing stock market he said Hall suggested that even companies where stock prices remained strong were wary of what could happen if the market continued to suffer With everyones stock price going into the slammer people went back and questioned the rationale for the deal he said The Ariba deal fell apart because of a steep drop in Aribas stock which has suffered as business executives cut back on software purchases The Ariba deal when first announced was worth billion when it broke up April it was worth only million The stock of Mountain View Calif based Ariba fell from a share to during that period The deal between Florida Power Light owner FPL Group Inc and New Orleans based Entergy highlighted just the opposite problem rising stock values in the energy sector When announced in late July the transaction was worth billion By the time it broke up April the booming utilities and energy sectors had lifted the price to billion But charges and countercharges of sloppy due diligence killed the merger The marriage would have created the largest US power distribution company In the end though FPL complained that Entergys suddenly lower financial projections destroyed our confidence in Entergys management Entergy in turn called the complaint a totally manufactured issue Companies European Companies The Wall Street Journal Europe Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Scottish Powers Profit For Fiscal Year Drops

billion project comes as India is both trying to attract new investment in power production and delivery and squabbling openly with its highest profile foreign investor Enron Corp over its Dabhol power plant The state governments electricity board has refused to pay Enrons bills saying theyre too high With this loan the World Bank said it aims to speed changes in power regulation to provide more reliable electricity to more of Indias one billion people India uses only percent the power per person the US does and the lack of reliable power is blamed for its chronic poverty By linking state utilities under this program dubbed Power Grid the World Bank says it will help states cut loose from costly power subsidies and bring cheaper electricity to more people Power Grid is moving India towards an interconnected national grid a winwin scenario for both customers and suppliers said Kari Nyman task leader for the project The growth of Power Grid and the success of state power reforms are interdependent Specifically this loan will be used to build the transmission systems to transfer power from one utilitys grid to another and help build the market so that utilities can

A Senate investigatory committees new lawyer said Thursday he is convinced power generators acted illegally to drive up Californias energy prices Meanwhile the San Joaquin District Attorneys office joined the Senate investigation into whether electricity suppliers conspired to fix electricity prices something they adamantly deny Sen Joe Dunn DGarden Grove who chairs the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market said his goal is to create a statewide network of state and local investigations into the causes behind the power shortage and spiraling cost He named plaintiffs attorney Laurence Drivon of Stockton special legal counsel to the committee Drivon will work for the committee for free spending about four days a week on the job initially Drivon said his initial review of thousands of powerrelated documents either already public or made available to the committee by the states five large generators leads him to believe it is likely there was some criminal activity He would not elaborate San Joaquin County Supervising Deputy District Attorney Franklin Stephenson said three experienced investigators from his office will help the committee probe whether there was illegal pricefixing antitrust violations or theft of public funds by public or private electric generators Stephenson said his office started its investigation April but decided to join forces with the Senate panel to avoid duplicating efforts and to get access to documents provided to the committee The California Independent System Operator which runs the states power grid has agreed to supply the committee with confidential documents under subpoena Dunn said The committee will likely subpoena other documents that generators refuse to

in on the skyrocketing electric rates in the Northwest As ratepayers throughout the West are socked with doubledigit increases in their bills regulators throughout the region are looking into suspicions that this new breed of energy companies has manipulated the overheated market to maximize profits So far there is no evidence they are doing anything illegal California Gov Gray Davis has called them pirates and plunderers The San Francisco city attorney has filed a billion lawsuit against them saying they are playing with marked cards and looking to make a quick buck at the expense of consumers The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is investigating as are state regulators in Washington Oregon and California Based on hints of manipulated energy supplies and allegations of price manipulation I think we owe it to Washington utilities and consumers to make sure the soaring prices are not the result of illegal practices Washington Attorney General Christine Gregoire said in announcing her offices antitrust division would investigate The power marketers though say theyve done nothing wrong The real problem they say is there simply isnt enough power being generated to meet demand The players include Enron Corp Dynegy Inc and Reliant Energy all of Houston Duke Energy of Charlotte NC Southern Energy of Atlanta AES Inc of Arlington Va and Calpine Corp of San Jose Calif Enrons profits were up percent in last years fourth quarter Dukes fourthquarter revenues doubled Dynegys earnings more than doubled in the fourth quarter When we hear about these stunning profit increases I think we need to investigate Gregoire said Corporate raider Charles Hurwitz also could profit handsomely His Maxxam Inc owns Kaiser Aluminum Corp which has shut down its Washington mills and under a special contract provision is reselling power on the open market for much more than it paid the Bonneville Power Administration the federal agency that sells hydropower generated at dams along the Columbia and Snake rivers Hurwitz could make half a billion dollars before the contracts expire this fall And the holding companies of two huge California utilities on the edge of bankruptcy have made billions of dollars off the West Coast electricity market through a financial juggling act Audits by outside auditors hired by state regulators showed Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric turned over billions to their holding companies money that could have been used to ease the cash crunch they now face The utilities say they were engaged in accepted business practices when they transferred the money which the parent companies used for such things as stockholder dividends and stock buybacks Is it capitalism or profiteering said Ed Mosey a BPA spokesman The very complexity of these markets allows these companies to hide in the grass A few years ago the energy industry was tightly regulated and utilities and generators were allowed to recover their costs and make a decent return on their investment But beginning with the deregulation of wholesale electricity markets in energy marketers generators independent power producers and others became major players Regulated utilities opened computerdriven trading rooms as they scrambled to find the cheapest electricity available Now electricity is sold on spot and longerterm markets traded for electricity available in other parts of the country or even swapped for natural gas Power can pass through three or four hands before you even buy it Tacoma Power Superintendent Steve Klein said The latest jolts in the Northwest market began last summer when California experienced severe shortages and prices soared Because the entire West Coast is connected by one power grid the rate shocks were felt in the Northwest and grew even more as Californias problems deepened and a winter drought prompted fears of a nearrecord low runoff in the Columbia and Snake rivers Some called it a perfect storm scenario and BPA saw the price it paid for power in January grow sixfold over the previous year We will buy from anyone who will sell to us at a reasonable prices but the problem is finding a reasonable price said BPA Administrator Steve Wright The marketers are recovering a substantial amount of money The same companies making money in California are making money in the Northwest These are forprofit companies said Mark Crisson who heads Tacoma Power These folks dont answer to a state regulatory commission and they dont answer to ratepayers They answer to their stockholders and Ive seen no effort by them to minimize prices Critics say the energy marketers have manipulated the market by shutting down generating facilities in California in an effort to restrict the supply and drive prices up According to some utility executives generating plants are usually offline percent of the time because of unforeseen problems and that an offline average of percent to percent would be considered high During some months certain California generating plants have been offline percent to percent of the time We are seeing abnormal rates Crisson said Asked whether he thought the companies were manipulating or gaming the market Crisson said I would stop short of accusing them of that but there is something funny going on The California generators and marketers say the outages have been the result of running aging plants hard in an effort to supply power in a tight market We think these allegations are a little unfair said Randy Wheeless a spokesman for Duke Energy which operates four power plants in California Despite several investigations Wheeless said his and other companies have always been cleared Were trying to feed the market not manipulate it he said There isnt any one single person or company to blame The remedy is to get more generation on line Enron doesnt own any power plants in California but sells and trades energy throughout the West Spokesman Mark Palmer

and Marathon joining hands for submission of financial bids industry sources said both the companies have decided to bid independently Moreover for all these discovered fields ONGC does not require any financial or technical support from others Reliance however is not qualified to be the operator of oil and gas fields as it does not have sufficient experience in the area On the other hand Marathon possess strong technical skills in this area and if selected can easily qualify as an operatorONGC is the biggest partner in the consortium in terms of its equity stake It has per cent with the remaining per cent shared equally between Reliance Industries and Enron Oil and Gas India However Enron is the operator of this million joint venture between Reliance and ONGC Both ONGC and Reliance have the preemption rights by virtue of being partners in the joint ventures operating these companies But this does not mean that they will get it any cheaper They will have to match the

two farreaching bills paving the way for the state to buy Californias sprawling electrical transmission grid and build and operate its own power plants The legislation aims to protect California from the crisis it faces today a nightmare of supply shortages and skyhigh power prices said the bills author Senate leader John L Burton DSan Francisco What were trying to do here is give the state some influence and control over its own destiny Burton said The idea is to provide affordable reliable energy at times we need it most One of the bills authorizes Gov Gray Davis to negotiate with Californias beleaguered utilities about a state takeover of the transmission system a transaction that could help them avoid bankruptcy By paying anywhere from billion to billion for the miles of electric wires the state would provide the utilities with cash to help relieve their mushrooming debt Some would call it a bailout Burton said I would prefer to call it an infusion of capital Davis prefers the term buyout and said any state takeover of the grid should be a moneymaker Talking with reporters after a speech in Los Angeles Davis said he hopes to announce a proposal Friday under which the state would receive the transmission system a financial stake in the utility companies and some other assetpossibly some of the utilities hydroelectric facilitiesin exchange for billions of

blackouts but by the evening hours of peak demand officials at the California Independent System Operator were optimistic that conservation and power purchases would help them dodge outages CalISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson blamed the power shortfall on a cold snap that boosted electricity consumption and on the shutdown of power plants capable of generating onethird of the states winter peak demand Four years after electric utilities were partially deregulated in California the state is caught in a tangle of skyrocketing energy prices booming demand and short supplies Battered by debt the states largest investorowned utilities lack the cash and credit to buy power themselves forcing the state to step into the electricity market For more than three weeks the state Department of Water Resources has spent an average of million a day purchasing power as negotiators work to nail down longterm power contracts under a billion program authorized by the Legislature Davis maintains that in recent weeks the state has made major progress toward solving the electricity crisis Officials have signed four very good contracts with electricity providers begun an million conservation program and embarked upon an aggressive drive to get power plants built he said In other developments Tuesday the precarious financial condition of Edison and PGE remained a top concern of utilitywatchers as a grace period granted by banks that are owed money by Edison expired We are now on a daily involuntarybankruptcy filing watch said Steven Fleishman a utility analyst with Merrill Lynch Co We believe that creditors will wait to see what plan the governor proposes but time is short Edison formally asked a group of banks for an extension of a day period of forbearance on a million default Ted Craver Edison Internationals chief financial officer said in a conference call with debt holders The banks had not yet responded he said Several electricity generators have said they are willing to wait for the utility debtrelief plan that Davis and legislators have promised in the coming days the governors spokesman Steve Maviglio said Tuesday They have signaled to us that they have patience he said Most of the action in the Capitol on Tuesday centered on Burtons two bills both of which cleared the Senate Energy Committee and will go next to the Appropriations Committee A third measure SB X by Sen Byron Sher DStanford which would provide billion in taxpayer subsidies to consumers government entities and businesses to help pay for conservation measures also passed Burton said his bill paving the way for the purchase of the transmission grid SB X is based on the concept of willing buyer willing seller and would not lead to any unilateral seizure of utility assets Although it attracted support from consumer groups skeptics say that the system is overburdened and needs an estimated billion in repairs and expansionand that it costs several million dollars annually to maintain As lawmakers debated the bill a private company quietly pressed its own bid to buy the system TransElect Inc has offered to pay billion for the grid Company Vice President Bob Mitchell was in the Capitol to pitch the idea to lawmakers most of whom are indifferent to the notion Were not convinced that a single forprofit monopoly owner of the grid gains the people a lot said Assemblyman Bill Leonard RSan Bernardino But others said they were open to proposal We certainly prefer to keep the transmission grid in the private sector where it belongs said Jamie Fisfis spokesman for Republican Assembly leader Bill Campbell RVilla Park The other Burton bill approved Tuesday SB X seeks to create a California consumer power and conservation financing authority that would build finance and run power plants alone or in partnership with private generators The new agency would be financed by the sale of up to billion in bonds which would be repaid by revenues from power sales The bill also would empower the state to take over private plants by condemnation Several other states including New York operate public generation and transmission facilities Burton said adding that they provide electricity at favorable rates Burton insisted that the agency would supplement but not take over the electricity business that traditionally has been a privatesector enterprise in California He predicted that the state would involve itself mostly in peaking generatorsportable generators about the size of bigrig truckswhose energy would be tapped during periods of short supply but high demand such as hot summers and cold winters But GOP Sens Charles Poochigian of Fresno and William Morrow of Oceanside voiced fears that the public energy agency would be too dominant and could disadvantage private generators with its power of condemnation This bill is pretty much sending a large bright red flag Morrow told Burton Lobbyists for the power generators testifying before the committee agreed that a public power authority could scare off private investors reluctant to compete with the state That type of uncertainty about the states role in this system can have the role of discouraging private capital said Mike Day a lobbyist for Enron Corp In another development Tuesday state officials working to fire up new power plants to add megawatts of electricity by this summer raised the possibility that the new generators might not be adequate to meet demand Winston Hicox director of the California Environmental Protection Agency said the gap between supply and demand could be greater than megawatts this summer given that other Western states probably wont be sending as much electricity to California and that the states own production of hydroelectric power might be low Calling conservation steps incredibly important Hicox said the state needs to cut use by at least to avoid blackouts Meanwhile the California Republican Party said it will begin airing a second radio ad today blasting Davis a Democrat for his handling of the energy crisis Unlike the first ad which ran in smaller markets on conservative radio stations the new ad will run in Los Angeles and San Francisco on mainstream stations said a party spokesman On the federal level President Bush said Tuesday that he intends to discuss Californias power needs and other energy policy issues in his talks Friday with President Vicente Fox of Mexico They will talk about improving the power plants to be able to help additional power get into the Western grid Bush told reporters aboard Air Force One on a flight back to Washington after visiting the Norfolk Va Naval Base Bush said he also intends to discuss the flow of natural gas between the two countries specifically the issue of California natural gas flowing to Mexican power plants Its conceivable that that gas will be interrupted and it will create obviously a problem for our neighbors to the south Bush said But gas can flow both ways And any gas down in Mexico that improves the Mexican situation will help America Ingram and Warren reported from Sacramento and Landsberg from Los Angeles Times staff writers Miguel Bustillo Dan Morain Rone

Outcome KRTBN KnightRidder Tribune Business News The Orange County Register California Copyright C KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News Source World Reporter TM Gov Gray Davis and top lawmakers have enlisted a small circle of energy insiders to help craft electricity bills and policies that could indirectly affect their financial interests Key parts of the billion financial plan that launched the state into the power buying business were written by investment bankers for Credit Suisse First Boston which also works for a Texas power generator Other advisers include a former Southern California Edison executive who owned stock in three independent power companies while advising the governor A third is a New York banker whose company prepared the sale of billion in securities last week for two power generators who sell electricity in California These power companies earned record profits last year selling electricity into Californias troubled market State utilities were pushed to the brink of insolvency by power prices because their billing rates were still frozen by rules that deregulated the market Now some lawmakers consumer advocates and legal scholars worry that the businessmen who have come to Sacramento to help sort out the mess are too closely tied to these same power companies and wont be able to place the interests of the state and its small electricity users first Theyve let the fox into the hen house said Peter Navarro a University of California Irvine business professor and author of The Dimming of America which predicted a national deregulation fallout The deregulation bill was drafted in large part by utility lobbyists If weve learned anything from this it should be that people with a vested interest shouldnt draft legislation No one denies that industry insiders are playing a critical role inside the Statehouse But Davis administration officials and Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg say they needed industry experts to help solve the states energy crisis I said give me the best possible experts in the investment banking world Hertzberg said Everyone who is an expert has conflicts all over the place The outcome of these energy initiatives could prove beneficial to some of the states advisers or their companies Southern California Edison vice president Larry Hamlin joined the Davis team last Thursday as the project manager for the governors new plan to speed construction of power plants statewide Hamlin has taken a twomonth leave from Edison where he was vice president of power production and operations A faster construction cycle could directly benefit the utilitys operations and generating divisions Former Treasury Secretary Robert E Rubin chairman of the executive committee at Citigroup Inc was appointed in January to advise Davis on bond financing longterm power contracts and ownership of power plants SEC filings show that Citigroups Salomon Smith Barney subsidiary works as an investment banker for several private power companies that sell electricity in California Salomon prepared for sale last week billion in securities offered by Calpine Corp and million in securities by AES Corp In addition Citigroup owned or managed billion in independent power company stocks as of September A Citigroup spokeswoman said neither Rubin nor the company would have any comment on his role Michael R Peevey a former president of Southern California Edison Co began advising the governor last June Peevey left Edison in and formed New Energy Ventures Inc a nonutility energy service provider which he sold to AES Corp in for million He now sits on the board of Excelergy a Lexington Mass provider of technology to energy companies A sworn disclosure signed by his wife Assemblywoman Carol Liu DLa Canada Flintridge shows that the couple owned between and of stock in AES Enron and Unisource all independent power companies last year The UniSource stock was purchased one month after Peevey began his advisory role Liu said in an interview that Peevey has sold all his energy stocks since she made that disclosure Dec Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said he was unaware that Peevey had continued to hold power company stocks after the appointment Neither Peevey Hamlin nor Rubin responded to requests for an interview but Maviglio said the governor has chosen the best people and is reviewing suggestions to make sure the best interests of Californians are being protected It seems natural to tap people who are the best at this and can get the job done for California said Maviglio They know that they need to separate their past and their future when it comes to helping the state Many experts applaud these choices If youre in a bind and California clearly is who better to enlist than the insiders Is it a potential conflict Yes Is it a big one Not likely said UCLA Finance Professor William M Cockrum a specialist in business ethics and a former investment banker himself Cockrum said such relationships are routine on Wall Street and investment bankers are trained to handle them What you want is a bunch of smart people who are used to dealing with economic realities Cockrum said Not everyone agrees It is a different matter when public dollars are at stake and matters of public policy of this order of magnitude are being decided said Harvard Law professor Elizabeth Warren The Legislature needs to be clear when they are getting independent advice and when they are getting lobbied Just because this is how business is always done doesnt mean its right Lawmakers have raised similar concerns saying there hasnt been enough disclosure of potential conflicts Im uncomfortable with someone who represents a stakeholder like power generators providing independent advice on which direction we should go said Sen Joe Dunn DSanta Ana These are folks out of the financial markets whose businesses may very well have a lot at stake in terms of the outcome of this crisis I dont think we can consider that to be independent advice Dunn was talking specifically about the role of Credit Suisse First Boston which worked to restructure El Paso Electric Co which went bankrupt in Today the investment firm is preparing a public stock offering for a new subsidiary of Reliant Energy of Houston called Reliant Energy Resources Securities and Exchange Commission documents show As of September the company also held or managed million worth of stock in AES Corp which owns power plants in Orange County Investment bankers usually earn between percent and percent of the amount underwritten the exact amount is not disclosed Credit Suisse First Boston declined comment other than to say Hertzberg asked its investment bankers to help and they are working for free Some of Davis appointments have been applauded For instance he tapped Los Angeles Department of Water and Power head David Freeman to lead the states negotiations for longterm contracts with power suppliers Freeman has been praised for his role at the DWP because he fought against those who wanted to sell the public utilitys own generators There is no one I would rather have negotiating for the state of California said Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg DLos Angeles He has never worked for anything other than the public This man lives and breaths and thinks about what is in the best interest of ratepayers Others sought by the governor decided on their own they had too many conflicts In January consultants from investment banker Goldman Sachs met with Davis Finance Director Tim Gage to discuss advising the governor Goldman Sachs owns J Aron a Singaporebased energy trader that supplies percent of Pacific Gas and Electrics natural gas needs According to SEC records Goldman also held or managed more than billion in power company stocks as of September of and is listed as another lead underwriter with Credit Suisse on the Reliant public offering Consumer advocates immediately began criticizing Goldman for its conflicts Goldman decided shortly thereafter that its competing business interests posed a conflict Critics worried about the role of the investment bankers said their concerns mounted when they learned that Credit Suisse was doing more than offering advice Hertzberg asked the company to craft a financing plan for the states power purchases ABX the landmark bill which put California into the longterm energy buying business included a revenue bond financing plan written by Credit Suisse Another part of Credit Suisse plan which would use the bonds to pay off utilities past debts has stalled in committee and may die there Some lawmakers say the experts have helped protect Californians For example ABX has a provision that came from a panel of bankruptcy attorneys who are advising the governor and the legislature The state was going to buy energy and then sell it to the utilities but this would have made the state an automatic party in any bankruptcy lawsuit As a result of advice from experts the state is making sure the energy gets delivered to customers but the ownership of the electricity never shifts to the utilities We learned that if we are going to go out and buy power there are very specific things we must do to protect ourselves Hertzberg said For example that if there was a bankruptcy we would have been is an unsecured creditor Their advice has been very valuable And Hertzberg said when it comes to advisors with serious conflicts the Legislature is smart enough to take the advice of experts and recognize any bias But Dunn the Santa Ana senator thinks the issue is too complex With all due respect thats nonsense Dunn said No one in this building can rise to the sophistication of the players in this market Their entire professional life is dedicated to make sure they understand how this works in all its subtletiesIn fact the advisers may believe they can step aside and provide independent unbiased advise but I dont think they can If you have lived your life in this arena you have a certain point of view By Chris Knap Kimberly Kindy and Mark Katches Register staff writer Kate Berry contributed to this report NewPower posts

Germanys cartel office and economics ministry have shown an encouraging commitment to clamping down on energy network owners who blocked access for newcomers US energy giant Enron said on Wednesday The cartel office last week charged Edis Nord over excessive grid access tariffs said Paul Hennemeyer who specialises in government and regulatory affairs at Enrons office in Frankfurt This will begin to send a signal to the market that these sorts of games have to stop and of course theres increasing pressure coming out of the ministry he told Reuters during the Eworld of energy conference and exhibition Edis a subsidiary of major utility EON has until March to respond to charges its fees are more than percent above the national market average Hennemeyer said the cartel office was doing a good job given it was badly resourced and with its role reduced to rule whether certain tariffs were anticompetitive on a case by case basis The office cannot actually set tariff levels Hennemeyer said a state regulator would be better placed to ensure competition but the preferred reliance on voluntary agreements had created reasonable conditions for wholesale power markets since their liberalisation in April If the German associations can extend these agreements to the retail market they might be able to avoid regulation he said The situation was different in gas which was deregulated in October but where market participants were dragging their feet over access terms forcing the government to start working on its own network access decree Ive made my bets that regulation in gas will come hopefully in the right way Hennemeyer said The networks are natural monopolies and the regulator should make sure the system is properly run the commodity part is different and there should be competition it should be up to supply and demand Either by design or by default I see these things mixed up a lot when they are really two separate topics GERMANY German gas market regulation inevitableAquila By Vera Eckert Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited ESSEN Germany Feb Reuters A leading German energy trader said on Tuesday failure of German gas distributors and consumers to work out terms for market deregulation means political intervention is inevitable Its not a question of if but when the economics ministry will impose measures to force the market open Joerg Spicker managing director of Aquila Energy GmbH told Reuters during the Eworld of energy conference and exhibition The experiment with negotiated instead of regulated market access in Germany has failed I think the customers are beginning to realise that they would fare better with a regulated system Negotiations among the four associations for a new network agreement to come into force by the end of September VV are still nonconclusive ahead of a top level meeting of the associations presidents on February The two sides which maintain that Germanys fragmented market nature and consensual political tradition makes voluntary negotiations the best option failed to agree on access terms to networks and storage and the priorities at times of bottlenecks These would be the minimum requirements to start free competition To date only a few shortterm delivery contracts for industrial clients have been secured by independent international traders such as Aquila Enron and local firm Trianel but these often have to be enforced by court orders or interference by the cartel authorities Thats maybe the beginnings of a market but you would not call it true competition Spicker said Aquila which had won new business in southern Germany in the first few weeks of this year was finding negotiations over pointtopoint access with sometimes up to four pipeline owners challenging given they had to be done within a short time period QUIBBLING OVER PIPELINE VALUES Spicker who attended closeddoor meetings last week through Aquilas membership of the European Federation of Energy Traders EFET said it was highly doubtful that a solution could be found on February that would pass governmental and EU scrutiny One of the most controversial points was that pipeline operators wanted to base charges on renewal costs of their facilities when many installations had long been written off Spicker said We refuse to help pay for pipelines that have already enabled the incumbents to reap profits for many decades he said The economics ministry in his view was already drawing up terms for cost structures and for the obligation to publish rates and capacity

sides to finalise an agreement on the purchase by the national power company NEPA of the power produced by the plant within two weeks The gasfired plant to be built in Kwale in Delta State and expected to cost around million dollars to build would be expected to come on stream by December Viera said The power minister Agagu told reporters he was delighted that the two sides had reached this stage and said he was confident a final deal would be signed soon It will not take long before a power purchase agreement that is acceptable to all parties could come to be because most of what could constitute stumbling blocks have actually been addressed he said He praised ENIs subsidiary for moving ahead with the project where other companies including US group Enron AngloDutch oil company Royal DutchShell and US group ExxonMobil were still in talks on proposals Finally we are on our way to actualising the first major independent power production through AGIP he said Agagu said the

Field might get involved in supplying the additional amounts of gas in the future he added Qatars Oil Minister Abdullah bin Hamad AlAttiyah said earlier this week that a final agreement between Qatar and the UAE would be signed within weeks and that previous disagreements on the transfer price of the gas between the two sides had now been resolved McClelland said Wednesday that marketing the gas in the region wouldnt be a problem Also in the long term plans are possibilities to take the gas further east to India and Pakistan Enron is already involved in a project which supplies gas from Abu Dhabi and Oman to an Indian power plant First gas from Dolphin is targetted to reach Abu Dhabi by late or early About billion to billion cubic feet per day of Qatari gas would be consumed by utilities in Abu Dhabi and the remainder would be supplied to Dubai Enrons McClelland said the Dolphin project and a natural gas venture in Saudi Arabia are two priority projects for the company in the Middle

and everything else will be settled through negotiation between Suzuki and the government The CCD decided that the valuation if Suzuki agrees should be done by three bankers of international repute one to be decided by it one by Suzuki and the third by mutual consent The entire basis for valuation indeed the entire process at each stage will be made completely transparent Shourie said This decision was one of the five options before the CCD the outcome of a series of discussions between a panel of Union government secretaries and Suzuki In addition on Monday the secretaries had another detailed discussion with financial institutions on what would be needed if the rights issue was cleared Suzukis main concern in the talks already held was to ensure we dont disinvest our share in favour of one of their competitors Shourie said adding it was a legitimate wish The CCD he said had decided on doing it this way to ensure two things One to ensure Maruti retains its competitive strength Two to ensure maximum valuation of the governments present equity in it The CCD decision aims at ensuring both he said In another development the Union Cabinet discussed the power situation in the country and the reforms in the sector The discussion took place after power minister Suresh Prabhu gave a presentation on the power sector reforms The slide presentation and the paper on the power scenario in the country provide an insight into the various mechanisms being put in place for augmenting power supply While refusing to divulge any details of the presentation Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pramod Mahajan said it focussed on the power situation To a query whether the Enron issue also came up for discussion the minister said it was only a small part of the overall discussions Power reforms and regulations Kirit Parikh Business Standard Copyright c Business Standard Power shortages scheduled power cuts and unscheduled brownouts have plagued the country for many years The process of privatisation and reforms was begun in to solve these problems Yet eight years later the situation is if anything worse than before Why is it What have we done Why has not it worked What should we do It is obvious that power shortages imply lack of capacity to generate power In turn this reflects inadequate investment in building power plants transmission and distribution network or fuel production and transport capacity It could also reflect poor operation of existing capacities In mideighties when Rajiv Gandhi became the Prime Minister he concentrated on the latter and emphasised improving load factor of thermal plants This worked for some time but the slack was more or less exhausted by early nineties Today the average load factor on thermal plants has reached per cent which is very good Since then despite some progress in further raising load factor lack of adequate investment has been the main reason for power shortages Over the last decade installed generating capacity has grown by per cent whereas power generation has grown by per cent Inadequate investment was mainly the result of the inability of state electricity boards SEBs to generate financial surpluses The main reasons for the financial sickness of SEBs are poor pricing of electricity and pilferage Most SEBs subsidise highly agricultural consumers and some also domestic consumers All have high losses due to pilferage of power disguised as transmission and distributions TD losses and also as agricultural consumption This is the fundamental reason for power shortages Unfortunately instead of tackling this main problem successive governments have tried to skirt around it Their efforts at reforms have more or less failed What have they done and why have they failed The first attempt was to attract private investors to set up generating plants The power sector was opened up for private both domestic and foreign power generators in Despite massive interest of private investors the progress has been miniscule The private generators were required to sell only to the SEBs When ones only customer is financially sick one would think twice before getting into the business The difficulties Maharashtra SEB is facing in meeting Enrons bills would make private producers think even more before they invest In fact unless the financial sickness of the SEBs is taken care of private power generators are even less likely to come now Once the reluctance of private generators was perceived the government thought of megaprojects There were and are to be large projects which would supply power relatively cheaply To reduce the price of power the government offered concessions such as no customs duty and longer tax holiday Thus the government provides the subsidy up front But here also the unreliability of SEBs as customers which may not honour bills is a problem To get around this a new public corporation called Power Trading Corporation PTC is envisaged This will buy all the power from a megaproject pay the bill how and in turn sell the power to different SEBs How would the PTC collect its dues from SEBs If it cannot presumably the central government will foot the bill The sick SEBs would have an even greater incentive to default on payment to a public corporation than to a private generator This is obvious as today the various SEBs together owe public sector corporations such as NTPC Coal India NHPC etc Rs crore Pricing and pilferage reforms are inescapable If we delay these reforms even good firms like NTPC would be dragged down by the sick SEBs The chief ministers agree in New Delhi to raise tariff for agricultural consumers but as soon as they return to state capitals they develop cold feet Only a handful of chief ministers have made some progress here To force state governments to raise the price of power the idea of state electricity regulatory commission SERC was thought of SERCs are to be independent statutory bodies and are to prescribe power tariffs If a state government wants so subsidise any particular set of consumers it has to give direct budgetary support to the SEB This roundabout way has not yet produced substantial result and progress is understandably slow as the SERCs are appointed by state governments Only three state SERCs had issued tariff orders by the end of June To deal with pilferage ie theft of power should be easy Unfortunately it is not as some of the large staff of SEBs collude in this theft Thus it was felt that if distribution is privatised the problem of pilferage can be solved Naturally the SEB unions oppose such moves The progress has been miniscule Only Orissa has fully privatised distribution Some states have privatised small parts of their system The few cases where distribution is privatised customers have not been happy as they are asked to pay higher price They pay it but do not see any improvement in the reliability of quality of supply If reforms are done properly consumers who are not subsidised at present should benefit from them Reforms should improve the efficiency of the system reduce costs and hence price for such consumers How should we carry out reforms which have such effects Privatisation of distribution is the necessary first step However it should be done in a way that does not turn the consumers away from reforms For this we should set up a process which ensures that consumers are not required to pay any more for the inefficiency of the system This requires the following First of all we should work out the minimum cost at which an efficiently working power system without pilferage would supply power to different consumers Consumers should be informed about it and made to accept that they have to pay such a price Next SERCs should not permit anyone to charge a price higher than the optimal price or the present price whichever is higher If the present price is higher it should be brought down to optimal level in a time bound schedule over two or three years The private distribution company should be given a plan of eliminating pilferage over a period of two years as per an agreed schedule The state should compensate the private distributor for pilfered power only as per the agreed schedule If the private firm eliminates pilferage at a faster pace it would make extra profit If it delays it loses money That is its incentive Such a scheme makes privatisation of distribution acceptable to consumers who should see better cheaper power with higher efficiency So deal with the main problem first DPC not to invoke central guarantee Our Corporate Bureau Mumbai Business Standard Copyright c Business Standard The Enron promoted Dabhol Power Company DPC has decided not to invoke the Central government counterguarantee for now although the Maharashtra government failed to pay the Rs crore bill for December on Tuesday DPC had invoked the state government guarantee last week when the Maharashtra State Electricity Board failed to pay the bill The last date for paying the bill as per the terms of the state government guarantee was Tuesday This is not a double default situation They have already paid the November bill and only the December bill is pending Consequently we have decided not to invoke the counterguarantee for the moment said Neil McGregor CEO and president of DPC When queried further he clarified that this did not mean that the counterguarantee would not be invoked at all The next key date is February when the January bill becomes due he added It is also learnt that DPC does not want to embarrass the state government at a time when negotiations are due to be held with the Godbole panel The Maharashtra government last week announced the formation of a panel under former Union home secretary Madhav Godbole to review the controversial power project Meanwhile DPC has said in a press statement that it has received the outstanding amount of Rs crore towards the November bill The receipt of this payment as well as the formation of the review committee are very positive signals Enron saga Powered by govt generosity Rajesh Ramachandran The Times of India Copyright C The Times of India Source World Reporter TM NEW DELHI The tariff structure of Enrons Dabhol power project was conceived in such a manner that it was inevitable that the company would invoke its counterguarantee against the Maharashtra and Union governments The Shiv SenaBJP combine came to power in Maharashtra in on the slogan of throwing Enron into the Arabian Sea Soon after it cancelled the project Later it renegotiated the deal with Enron and even gave an assurance for the second phase Meanwhile the day Vajpayee government approved the extension of the government of Indias counterguarantee on May The first counterguarantee given on September was for PhaseI of the Dabhol project with a capacity of mw After the SSBJP government cancelled the project the then finance secretary Montek Singh Ahluwalia told the parliamentary subcommittee on fasttrack projects that as of today if the power purchase agreement PPA is being revised that means the counterguarantee is not effective When Ahluwalia said this in the project was being cancelled only to be renegotiated again after Enrons Rebecca Mark visited Bal Thackeray But Ahluwalia had held that if the PPA is revised the earlier counterguarantee would not hold good Yet the Union power minister told Parliament in May that the counter guarantee held good Thus a member of the standing committee gave a breach of privilege notice against Ahluwalia for misleading the House The finance ministry on behalf of Ahluwalia replied to Parliament thus While the government of Maharashtra had announced its decision for cancellation of the Dabhol power project the PPA between MSEB and the company was not terminated That is despite the project being cancelled the agreement to purchase power from the cancelled project is valid and hence the counterguarantee stands It was then pointed out by the member who had moved the breach of privilege notice that the contract was repudiated by the Maharashtra government After renegotiation the project itself was revised There was a change in the capacity of the project the fuel to be used the capital cost tariff and change in scope after inclusion of phase II of the project which was not included earlier In reply Ahluwalia submitted that the counterguarantee had provided for amendments to be made to the PPA subject to prior written approval by the Central government Thus if Jaswant Singh as finance minister had not approved the extension of the earlier counterguarantee it would not have been valid insofar as the amendments to the PPA were concerned So the onus of the counterguarantee rests with the day BJP government which did not wait for a review before it approved the extension of the earlier counterguarantee All this was done within days when the government had not even won a vote of confidence in Parliament Again it was not a fresh counterguarantee but the extension of the earlier one despite the Maharashtra governments repudiation its renegotiation with Enron and the changed physical parameters of the project It is interesting to note what Jaswant Singh as chairman of the committee had said about the counterguarantee a year before his government gave the approval for extension Counterguaranteeing for any project is uncalled for since several independent power producers are ready to implement projects without any counterguarantee Also there appears to be no justification for giving counterguarantee only to selective fasttrack projects Tomorrow The way forward Centre signs power sector reforms MoU with Haryana Our Regional Bureau New Delhi Business Standard Copyright c Business Standard The Centre today signed a Memorandum of Understanding on power reforms with Haryana which involves hundred per cent metering of all consumers by the end of this year while a special Cabinet meeting discussed the power situation and the possible reforms in the sector In his presentation to the Cabinet power minister Suresh Prabhu said the demand for power would touch mw by the end of the th Plan It could be met only with an equal investment each by the public and the private sector he remarked The meeting was held in the backdrop of the messy Enron affair Prabhus paper on the power scenario gives an insight into power supply augmenting mechanisms The MoU was signed by the Haryana chief secretary L M Goyal and Union secretary power A K Basu in the presence of the Prime Minister A B Vajpayee Prabhu and the Haryana Chief Minister O P Chautala It is based on the state achieving specific reforms milestones including compulsory metering of electricity supply and reducing transmission losses from per cent to per cent by The state will also undertake energy audit to reduce system losses The milestones achieved Prabhu said would entitle the states to modernisation funds from the accelerated power development programme and another programme soon to be announced to improve transmission systems The Center will also take up the mw Faridabad gasbased power station for early completion Though MoU did not mean network privatisation Chautala said he was willing to raise power tariffs even for farmers India Enron review panel to begin sittings today Our Special Correspondent The Hindu Copyright C Kasturi Sons Ltd KSL Source World Reporter TM Asia Intelligence Wire MUMBAI FEB Following the payment of the November bill to Enrons Dabhol Power Company by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board yesterday a review panel headed by Mr Madhav Godbole former State official who was later a Union Home Secretary has been set up to look at all aspects of the high tariff imbroglio The panel will start its sittings from tomorrow It is expected to submit its findings within a month as stipulated by the Government The Dabhol Power Company DPC while confirming the receipt of the November dues has said it would like to enter into a dialogue with the committee after having earlier shown its willingness to consider a third party buyer for its power which the MSEB did pick up A solution to the issue the Government here expects is one in which the Centre or its undertakings in the energy sector would pick up the power entirely from the DPC This was stated by the Chief Minister Mr Vilasrao Deshmukh in a recent letter to the Prime Minister Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee The State Government is aware that the Centre is averse to such counterguarantees being uncashed as it would send adverse signals on the capacity of the country to absorb foreign direct investments The MSEB cashstarved as ever made the November payment on the basis of an improved momentary liquidity enabled by the Government which paid about the same quantum of money as was needed but under the guise of provisioning for what was set out in the annual plan and under a budgetary provision A senior official conceded that both the sum and the timing of its routing to the MSEB was a coincidence Macerich Announces YearEnd Results PR

Enron business model almost limitlessSkilling By C Bryson Hull Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited HOUSTON Feb Reuters The ink on newlyminted Enron Corp chief Jeff Skillings business cards was hardly dry on Tuesday before he outlined his intention to transform Enron into an even bigger global marketmaker The new vision is going to be From the worlds leading energy company to the worlds leading company because we believe markets are critical to every commodity Skilling told Reuters in his first interview since assuming duties as president and chief executive officer Skilling and Chairman Ken Lay over the past years transformed Enron from a gas and power company into a trading powerhouse with interests outside the energy sector on their belief that many products can be sold like commodities That business model Skilling said helped Enron outgrow its old vision of becoming the worlds leading energy company The application is almost limitless because every single business has at its heart markets he said So if weve got a better market model we can participate in a whole lot of different businesses And so Enron has as its forays into the marketing of broadband capacity data storage steel and pulp and paper have shown Skilling said Enrons success in the gas and power businesses is proof his company has the wherewithal to take on the biggest companies in wellentrenched industries Enron is an incumbent players worst nightmare Skilling Do you think Amoco liked that we were out talking to their customers about buying gas from us that we were packaging from other people No He expects similar reactions from the giants in the paper and steel industries STEADY AS SHE GOES Skilling promises things will be steady as she goes during his stewardship which began Tuesday two months after Lay named his heir apparent CEO and decided to stay on as chairman But steady only means Enrons constant flow of innovation will continue Skilling said Enron has quickly become able to remove the complex and costly infrastructure around many commodities because of EnronOnline its Internet trading site which has logged more than million in notional trades since starting months ago The real advantage of EnronOnline and a whole webbased system is that we can create additional scale and options without buying another piece of pipe another generating facility

physically work on the floor In every commodity whether its interest rates equities securities there is a battle between exchanges Skilling said The American futures exchanges are battling for market share with these new electronic approaches Electronic exchanges have the advantage of lower personnel costs and flexibility and Skilling said the succes of allelectronic trading in European markets is a harbinger of the USs trading future I think its really going to be a function of who can create the most liquidity at the lowest price and thats going to be the market system that will win Skilling

learned Tuesday Officials from the states three college and university systems urged the Legislature to provide them with extra money in the state budget to keep their higher energy prices particularly for natural gas from hurting education Its impacting students its impacting learning its impacting budgets and its impacting planning said Ray Giles of the Community College League The University of California paid million for natural gas last year and is expecting to pay at least million this year said Mike Bocchicchio UC assistant vice president for facilities UC has not decided whether to raise dormitory rates to reflect the higher cost of heating and cooling dorm rooms he said The UC dormitory system is designed to be selfsupporting he added I dont think its fair to say were just going to pass the costs along to the dorm residents said Assemblywoman Elaine Alquist DSanta Clara chair of the committee California State Universitys natural gas prices are expected to jump from million last year to million this year said Assistant Vice Chancellor Patrick Drohan Fred Harris of the community colleges chancellors office chancellors office estimated community colleges costs for electricity and natural gas will increase from million last year to million this year Giles said the effect on community college campuses has included a decreased number of evening and weekend classes and closing of libraries and other resources Assemblywoman Gloria Negrete McLeod DChino wondered how colleges located in the sweltering desert or Central Valley areas could afford air conditioning for spring summer and fall classes without additional state support They cant change nature she said The Assembly Higher Education Committee held a hearing Tuesday to learn how the energy crisis is affecting higher education The committee took no action Lawmakers are continuing to debate how the state should respond to the crisis and the budget wont be written until next June Most of Californias public colleges and universities currently have relatively low electricity rates because of longterm contracts signed with Enron Energy Services The nine University of California campuses get percent of their electricity from Enron through a contract tied to rates and lasting until UC gets the rest of its power from federal or municipal power agencies or from cogeneration plants at six campus locations said Bocchicchio California State University also has an Enron contract for its campuses said Drohan The Community College League a nonprofit corporation that represents community college districts enrolled districts with colleges in a similar Enron contract that lasts through said Giles Statewide there are locally run community college districts with campuses Some colleges and universities have been hit by higher electricity bills or power outages because they signed up years ago for the utilities interruptible programs which gave them lower rates in exchange for cutting power usage during serious shortages There have been at least such shortages since Jan Four CSU campuses and community college districts were part of those programs In some cases they chose not to cut back on power use and face fines instead officials said The interruptible programs were suspended last month by the state Public Utilities Commission On the Net UC is at CSU is at The community

sixth paragraph For more on the California electricity crisis see EXTRA GO Rosemead California Feb Bloomberg Southern California Edison Cos banks are considering a request to delay taking action against the utility for defaulting on lines of credit an executive of its parent company said We have asked the banks to extend the forbearance agreements that we have with them Ted Craver Edison Internationals chief financial officer said in a conference call with investors The banks led by JP Morgan Chase Co previously provided forbearance through today Craver said the utility and its parent dont have any indication from them yet on whether the banks will grant more time The group of banks have the right to demand accelerated payments or seek other remedies after Southern California Edison Californias secondlargest utility failed to make million of payments on maturing notes last month That produced a cross default on its lines of credit with the banks My view of the relationship with the banks is that its strong and that they are generally looking for ways to be cooperative Craver said He added he couldnt predict how they will respond Suffice it to say the utility and its parent asked for a period of forbearance similar to the past one Craver said which lasted almost a month Both the utility and PGE Corps Pacific Gas Electric also defaulted last month on commercial paper a type of moneymarket security Patience Wearing Thin The utilities ran up about billion in debt last year buying power at higher wholesale prices than they could charge customers under state laws The state is buying power on the utilities behalf and looking at other ways to deal with the past debt to keep them from going bankrupt Investors on the call asked about the timetable for proposals to address the utilities past debts Were not betting the farm on getting something by this Friday Craver said The utility had about billion in cash at the end of last week according to Craver Investors on the conference call asked Craver about a comment by a spokesman for California Governor Gray Davis who said today that power generators will be patient while they await a debt repayment plan I guess I would have to agree that the generators and creditors have been very patient Craver said Still everybodys patience gets thinner as we move forward each week No one has petitioned the utility to push it into involuntary bankruptcy Craver said and he called for continuing patience while acknowledging the pace is frustrating for everybody affected by the utilitys payment suspension Financing Unlikely Were trying to encourage people to stand still and give us time to work this thing out Craver said It is certainly not our hope nor our intent to go into bankruptcy which would only complicate attempts to arrive at solutions he added In response to a question about when the utility might be able to get financing again Edison officials on the call said issues surrounding the implementation of legislation still need addressing I dont think financing is likely to be available while there is so much uncertainty Craver said Uncertainty has arisen for example over whether the state Department of Water Resources will be paying for all the power purchases for the utilities or whether some spot purchases still might be passed along to the utilities in future bills Duke Energy Corp sued over this issue yesterday claiming the California Independent System Operator which runs about percent of the states utility grid continues to deliver electricity to the utilities without an assurance suppliers will get paid TaxExempts Paid Generators have been willing to sell power on the assumption the states credit was on the hook for those purchases Stephen Pickett general counsel of Southern California Edison said during the teleconference Edison is seeking clarification on the matter with the California Public Utilities Commission because it also believes the legislative intent was to have the state covering all the purchases Investors also asked several questions about a decision by the utility to make recent payments on taxexempt pollution control bonds The payments were relatively small and missing them would have immediately caused a broader default on all the utilitys first mortgage bonds said Ken Stewart an assistant general counsel for the utility That would raise the risk of having about billion of first mortgage bonds subject to acceleration Stewart said By contrast defaults on certain other utility debt includes various grace periods and doesnt trigger a default on other series of bonds he added Dennis Walters in Ojai California at or and Mark Lake in New York through the New York newsroom jm BN Feb GMT Acegas listed on

wants to boost the states generating capacity by megawatt s enough to light million homes by July Staff Associated Press Bloomberg News Dow Jones News Service Wall Street Journal State sees billion tab for emergency buys San Diego UnionTribune By Ed Mendel UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER February SACRAMENTO The amount the state expects to spend on emergency power has soared to billion and may continue to grow for weeks or months A request for an additional million last week was quickly followed by a request for another million this week in part because the state has begun buying power for San Diego Gas Electric The emergency purchases began Jan when Gov Gray Davis declared an emergency because suppliers would no longer sell power to two nearly bankru pt utilities Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison The state is buying power on the expensive spot market while struggling to negotiate a portfolio of longterm contracts that are expected to sharply reduce costs Davis said yesterday that more longterm contracts could be announced this week But the state does not want to obtain all of its longterm contracts immediately because prices could go down later Meanwhile the governor said he hopes that an agreement on a plan to begin paying off the billion debt of the utilities in exchange for their transmission systems and other assets will calm the market The governor intends to reach an agreement with legislative leaders on a debtrelief plan that can be presented to the utilities tomorrow setting t he stage for several weeks of negotiations As soon as the utilities indicate their assent to this plan or some modified version we can assent to everything will begin to stabilize and calm down Davis said There is no question when there is uncertainty it affects prices and we want to create the opposite some certainty predictability in what I like to call a challenge Davis told reporters and you guys call a crisis The governor said that state purchase of the transmission systems will be t he biggest part of the proposal tomorrow Other assets that have been mentione d are stock options scenic land around hydroelectric facilities and payment s from utility parent firms The state is not revealing the price of its power purchases arguing that would prevent lowerpriced bids from suppliers in the future Davis said he hopes to have a secrecy period of less than six months and may announce a schedule in two or three weeks But I definitely do not want to jeopardize the integrity of the secret bid prices he said Because if we do that we are just going to force Californians to pay more for power than they would otherwise An official of the state Department of Water Resources which owns hydroelectric facilities and is purchasing power for the state estimated last month that the state was paying million a day for power The governors emergency order last month authorized the state to dip into million in Water Resources funds The Legislature quickly appropriated million for additional power purchases and included million in t he bill authorizing longterm contracts But Feb the state Department of Finance sent the Legislature a deficiency notice saying it intended to begin spending an additional million to b uy power in days unless the Legislature objected The department issued another notice this week saying yet another million will be required because all of the previous funding is expected to be exhausted by Feb This is somewhat sooner than had earlier been anticipated due to colder weather and the inclusion of electricity purchases for the San Diego Gas Electric service area said the notice issued Tuesday The longterm contracting legislation signed early this month by Davis made SDGE eligible for the state purchases SDGE is in better financial condition than PGE and Edison but has a debt of more than million All three utilities are the victims of a failed deregulation plan The rate s they can charge customers are capped in SDGEs case by legislation after bills doubled last summer while the wholesale cost of power soared producing huge debts The longterm contracting legislation authorizes the state to issue billion or more in bonds to spread the cost of the power purchases over a period of years in an attempt to avoid a rate increase The bonds will be paid off by ratepayers through a monthly charge on their bill Money from the bonds also will be used to repay Water Resources and t he state general fund for the purchases made on the spot market In comparison the billion that the state expects to spend on power purchases so far is equal to the reserve in the billion state budget proposed for next fiscal year It is more than the total amount of money earmarked for the states mental health programs State Treasurer Phil Angelides told reporters last week that the billio n bond issue will not be ready until May He said if interim financing throug h shortterm notes is too expensive the state has billion in cash reserve s Angelides said that the longterm contracts must be obtained before the bon ds can be issued He said the average price of the contracts will determine th e total amount needed for the bond issue which could exceed billion The governor spoke yesterday while revealing more details of his plan to boost power generation in California by megawatts to avoid blackouts this summer when airconditioning drives up the demand for electricity He is proposing legislation that would provide rebates to companies that install small business generators of less than kilowatts a percent t ax credit for generators between and kilowatts and million for cogeneration wind and solar programs We are in for a struggle this summer Davis said It will test our resolve But I

Exchange LME the worlds largest nonferrous metals market said on Thursday an experimental extensi on to its openoutcry hours would continue The board looked at a whole range of issues at its February meetingI t decided that this aspect should continue but will be kept under review LME Director of Corporate Affairs Jonathan Haslam said In a move that bucked the inexorable trend in European markets away from floors and towards electronic trading platforms the LME last October introduced a trial GMT extension to its openoutcry trading hours Before then there had been a break at the end of the morning session when the floor was closed Now LME openoutcry trading hours run from to continously LME Select the exchanges screen trading system which was launched on February operates from to with the exception of a minute closure between and when the second official rings take place Traders from the LMEs ringdealing members RDMs who are entitled to trade during the openoutcry sessions said more activity has been seen during the first part of the extended period The guys on the floor have got accustomed to it now and are doing more business than they previously would have one floor trader said Others said the bulk of trade was seen after with business slackening after some minutes only to pick up from onwards when the customary afternoon rings take place There is a bit of a dead zone between and but the longer it the floor is open the better it is for the survival of the ring anoth er senior trader said EVEN LONGER HOURS UNLIKELY Last month traders from the RDMs mooted the idea of even longer trading hou rs with some seeking to begin daily floor trading from as early as GMT ending as now at GMT It the board looked at this situation in the light of a great deal of change that is taking placeWe continue to review the whole of the operation Haslam said As well as introducing an electronic trading platform to run alongside but not replace openoutcry trading and the interoffice telephone market the LME also demutualised late in and reconstituted its board Traders said another extension was unlikely as there was no unanimity among the RDMs Also such a move would meet opposition from the LMEs associate broker clearing members ABCMs These companies have all the rights of LME membership but cannot trade during the openoutcry sessions Then they largely become customers of the market and trade through the RDMs The current extension means that they ABCMs have lost a lot of their pricing power over lunch one said The RDMs are fighting the advance of

providing new incentives for environmental cleanup The Far Eastern Economic Review describes his reform s as the largest transfer of industrial property since Mao Zedong nationaliz ed industry in the s But Mr Zhus plans to bring competition to the last big holdout of the monopolists Chinas power industry have stalled Chinas old guard ha s decided to make its stand for central rule in the power sector and it has found an important Western ally Canada Under Mr Zhus plans the power industry would no longer be run as a monopoly State power companies operating hydro dams and nuclear stations would have to compete with private power companies for access to customers Consumers would need to pay for transmission costs as well as generation costs giving local power producers who dont need to ship power a great distance a major cost advantage over distant suppliers If Mr Zhu and his reformers succeed in implementing this plan Chinas multibillion dollar hydro and nuclear empires long subsidized by Canadi an taxpayers could face bankruptcy Even without these reforms being fully implemented the state power industry a bastion of central planning knows that it cannot find willing customers for power from its hydro dams and nuclear plants Chinese officials now openly doubt whether the Three Gorges dam backed by Canadas Export Development Corporation will be able to sell all its outpu t when it starts generating power in The provinces and cities slated to buy its power either already have enough power or they prefer to have the private sector build local power plants to meet future demand Other large governmentrun hydro projects face the same predicament The USbillion Ertan dam built with Canadian grants and World Bank loans has run at an annual loss of USmillion since it came online in I t too cant find enough customers Its largest prospective customer Chongqi ng municipality balked at buying its overpriced power The newly built USbillion Xiaolangdi dam again backed by Canada and the World Bank can t find customers either As the retired deputy general manager of the Three Gorges Project Corporation recently explained to China Business Times provincial governments and municipalities favour local power plants over th e central governments distant hydro dams because local plants produce lowercost power and when theyre privately owned generate local tax revenue

Steel Corporation Shakou Power Plant Company now supplies electricity to Foshan city using a megawatt oilfired combinedcycle plant financed by Hong Kong banks Knowing that large hydro coal and nuclear cannot compete with this new bre ed of cleaner and lowercost power producer the central monopolists are fighting back To prop up the uneconomic nuclear plants that Canada and Chinas domestic nuclear industry are providing Chinas State Council not only provides a host of subsidies it wants to force large power consumers to buy nuclear power To prop up the Three Gorges project a pariah that no western government would touch before Canada endorsed it with subsidies on a previous Team Canada mission the State Economic and Trade Commission announced that provincial and city authorities will have to buy electricity from the Three Gorges dam once it starts generating electricity in At the same time the government is shutting down small power plants ostensib ly for environmental reasons and forbidding electricity distribution authorities in areas served by large hydro dams to buy power from private suppliers But these successes by the old guard at subverting markets are exceptions Apart from Canada the power monopolists have few friends Should the power monopolists lose their grip to Mr Zhu as have other monopolists in Chinas economy Canadas power industry may find it has few friends

differences in the ruling alliance over the matter When asked about the state governments Rs crore payment to MSEB to clear the last installment of DPCs November bill of Rs crore Deshmukh said The amount was not paid to clear DPCs dues It is the amount payable to MSE B from the budgetary allocation It is purely at the discretion of the board as how to use its funds he clarified To a query he said we have not asked the MSEB to put a stop to DPCs payments Deshmukh reiterated that the Centre should take over DPCs project and said the state government was yet to receive any communication in

supplier You guarantee the supplier you will buy at least per cent of everything he produces In case you fail to buy up to per cent of the suppliers plant capacity then you agree to pay a penalty to the supplier The absolute quantum you have to pay is determined among other factors by the rupeedollar rate as well as the prices of certain commodities in the international market Under the terms of the contract you agree to shoulde r both these risks In case you fail to pay your supplier who incidentally is supplying only about a fifth of your total requirements the contract mortgages all your assets as well the assets of your parent company The contract also guarantees that in case you fail to pay the supplier your parent company will be forced to pay the supplier and then deduct it from the revenues due to your company As if all this is not enough the contract also stipulates that it is not governed by Indian laws and that the parent company will continue to pay th e supplier even if the contract is termed illegal invalid or unenforceable The supplier starts his operations and given the nature of the contract th e product is extremely highpriced and your company is not in a position to pay What would you do Are you stupid I would never sign a contract like that If my company even got a hint that I was contemplating signing a contract like this I would be sacked and legal proceedings initiated against me were some of t he reactions I got when I put this proposal to some of my friends from the corporate circles Why is it then that the Maharashtra State Electricity Board the Maharashtr a Government as well as the Union Government have got into such an agreement with the Enronpromoted Dabhol Power Corporation Were they all really concerned about the power situation in Maharashtra or were there other unsa id imperatives We will perhaps never get the answers to these questions but as DPC evoked the Central counterguarantee for its payment the controversial project ha s once again become the focus of media attention Last week was full of stories and discussions on the controversy from daytoday news reports to a lengthy feature in the India Business Report But the most interesting one was on India Talks on CNBC and featured Mr Har ry Dhaul DirectorGeneral of the Independent Power Producers Association an d Mr Abhay Mehta activist and author of Power Play an expose of the Enron project Anchored by Mr Paranjoy Guha Thakurta the discussion kicked off by talking about the options open to the various parties involved Mr Dhaul understandably considering his constituency was of the opinion that the first thing to do is honour the contract He believed it was possible for a ll parties concerned to come to some kind of an amicable solution Mr Guha Thakurta interrupted to ask him whether the Maharashtra Government going bankrupt by honouring the contract was an amicable solution Mr Dhauls answer was a classic case of using numbers to confuse the issue I do not know whether by adding five per cent of the capacity the Maharashtra government will go bankrupt he said Reacting to this Mr Mehta pointed out that for this additional five per ce nt capacity that Mr Dhaul talked about the MSEB would be shelling out about per cent of its revenues and once the second phase of DPC came on stream t he MSEB would be paying out close to per cent of its total revenues There is no set of conceivable economic parameters which can allow payments of th is magnitude he said Mr Mehta pointed out that what has never been appreciated is the sheer amou nt of money involved The total contract with DPC is worth billion the singlelargest commercial contract in the history of this country as Mr Mehta described it and went on to say that if one assumed a per cent annual depreciation of the rupee against the dollar as it has happened ove r the last years it meant a total outlay of hold your breath Rs crore When Mr Dhaul started to ask whether it meant that the country was not in a position to accept foreign investment of billion Mr Guha Thakurta again to his credit interrupted to say the issue was not really the quantu m of foreign investment as the terms at which it has been contracted Mr Mehta disputed the claim that DPC has invested billion or about Rs crore for a MW project Are they out of their minds Who has checked these figures he asked pointing out that internationally the norm for power projects was Rs crore per MW There is no way they ha ve invested more than billion he said Mr Thakurta with a wicked grin on his face interrupted to ask him whether he was including the million that Ms Linda Powers of Enron had said been spent on educating Indian authorities Second Mr Mehta said that almost per cent of the investmen ts has come from India from institutions such as the IDBI SBI etc We have an absurd situation when a country like Mozambique orders equipmen t from the US and the US EXIM bank gives a loan for it without any guarantees But the US EXIM Banks loans to Enron have been guaranteed by Indian institutions Mr Mehta said Mr Dhaul while eventually agreeing that power from DPC was more expensive said that the regulator in Maharashtra has made certain observations about it He said he was not worried about the merit or dispatch aspect of the issue Mr Dhaul was of course referring to the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commissions direction to the MSEB to buy power from the cheapes t available sources But the problem is that irrespective of whether the MSE B buys power from Enron or not the PPA stipulates that it still has to continue paying A point that maybe not Mr Dhaul but all citizens of Maharashtra should be worried about Mr Dhaul went on say that he shared Mr Mehtas concerns about the cost of electricity and felt that some sort of solution could be found But he lef t the critical issue unsaid Where is the money How is the Maharashtra Government going to pay the absurd amounts of money that it has contracted for May be as a wag suggested trifle cynically it is time we set up a Dabhol Relief Fund Menka Shivdasani Enron Saga Power of political will on test Rajesh Ramachandran The Times of India Copyright C The Times of India Source World Reporter TM NEW DELHI Is there a way out of the Enron imbroglio Contrary to what experts and the government say there seem several options available to t he government But to avail them would require some political will S N Roy former chairman of the Central Electricity Authority points out that just as Pakistan got a US power company to reduce its tariff by half India too should get the Enron tariff reduced When asked whether it is ready to renegotiate the power purchase agreement PPA and bring down the tariff Enron did not respond Instead a public relations agency replied that tariffs are not high Observers assert that even after ensuring a reasonable profit for Enron th e tariffs can be cut K K Govil director projects Power Finance Corporation insists The present PPA is heavily in favour of Enron The PPA should be renegotiated to get capital costs and rate of return calculated in rupees and not dollars According to Govil pegging the costs and tariffs to foreign exchange is unheard of The capacity related incentive should also go Ideally the cost of a gasbased plant should be half that of a coalfired plant But in Enrons case it is not so This too has to be rectified said Govi l The government is tightlipped but sources say the government may palm off the burden to utlilities like National Thermal Power Corporation Power Trading Corporation or Power Grid Corporation That will end the public scrutiny of the project contrary to what is happening in Maharashtra now and the account will be shared by central utilities state electricity boar ds and others Also making the round is a politically powerful industrial houses name which might broker the deal But will all this help Roy feels it would be a disaster Impossible How can the government force NTPC or PTC a commercial enterprise to buy power at Rs a unit and sell it at Rs Even at full capacity Enrons power is expected to cost around Rs a unit much higher than the NTPCs selling ra te of about Rs per unit Prasant Bhushan fighting a public interest litigation in the Supreme Court has another set of solutions Nationalise the project by an Act of Parliament paying Enron a token or fair amount as in the case of bank nationalisation Or the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commissions statutory power should be invoked to override the PPA and regulate the tariffs The Supreme Court had earlier limited the petitions scope to accountabilit y of the public servants If the SC gives full leave the project will be voided since there was much illegality involved Most importantly if a criminal investigation into the bribes is initiated enough evidence could be unearthed in three months said Bhushan Will all this deter foreign investment in India Ashok Rao convenor of national working group for power feels the bogey of foreign investment fleeing is a blackmail tactic He points out that India is a bigger power industry market than most of Europe West Asia or Latin America There is a global recession in power industry So most private power companies are ju st a front for power equipment manufacturers who have to sell their equipment in India That is why they insist there should be no competitive bidding for equipment Would it hurt much if the government synchronised peoples nee ds with investor priorities Making the power sector viable Prem Shankar Jha The Hindu Copyright C Kasturi Sons Ltd KSL Source World Reporter TM Asia Intelligence Wire The fact that Enron had to invoke the Central governments guarantee before the Maharashtra State Electricity Board finally paid its dues till November shows that both the MSEB and the Maharashtra government are comprehensively bankrupt The MSEB paid because the Maharashtra government realised that pushing the burden onto New Delhi would not get it off the hook The counterguarantee ensured that the Centre would pay Enron and deduct the mon ey from Maharashtras annual plan allocation So why did Mumbai create the confrontation If one were to go by the ranting of Maharashtra politicians it was to mak e sure that there would be no more Enrons that is no more corrupt deals with rapacious foreign investors bent upon robbing the poor people of Indi a by forcing them to pay seven rupees a unit for power But the true reason i s that the Maharashtra government was trying to shift the blame for its own lack of courage Like virtually every other State government Maharashtra lacks the courage to stop giving electricity free or nearly free to more than three quarters of its consumers This has plunged the MSEB deep into t he red because there is an obvious limit to how far the remaining paying consumers can subsidise the rest The CEO of Enron in India put this in a nutshell a few days ago when he pointed out that the MSEBs problems arose from the fact that it was subsidising per cent of its consumers and allowing transmission and distribution losses an euphemism for power theft of fully one third of the power it generated As if this was not bad enough the Government repeatedly declared an amnesty for consumers who had not paid their bills The MSEB has therefore sunk deeper and deeper into the red To cut its cost s it has bought as little as possible from Enron and that has pushed the per unit cost of Dabhol power into the stratosphere Enrons argument is unassailable Every single power utility in the world follows one basic rul e in power pricing This is to set a tariff that covers the average cost of generation for all the stations that are on line at the time When a new power plant is added or an old one replaced the much higher cost of generation from the new plant the marginal cost to the utility is absorbe d by raising the average tariff just enough to absorb the increased cost at t he margin In the case of Maharashtra since the Dabhol plant added per cent to the States total generating capacity and amounted to about per cent o f MSEBs capacity an per cent increase in average tariff or in the realisation of unpaid dues would have sufficed But although the MSEB had been increasing its average tariffs in earlier years it did not do so between and that is when Dabhol was commissioned Add to this a rise in TD losses and MSEBs average realisation actually fell aft er Dabhol came on line If Maharashtra does not want to buy Dabhols power why does it not sell th e surplus to a neighbouring State or to the National Thermal Power Corporatio n in the public sector The answer is that none of them has kept its average tariff realisation above the average cost of generation They too will add to their losses by buying Dabhol power and therefore prefer load shedding instead The difficulty that Enron is experiencing in recovering its dues has delivered the coup de grace not just to foreign but to all private investment in power projects For if it takes a dentists tongs to extract money secured by a formal central counterguarantee what will happen to projects that do not enjoy that safeguard Since public investment is capab le of adding at most MW of generating capacity a year when the country needs three times that capacity economic growth will soon slow to a snail s pace for want of power The Central government knows this Since it has been prodding the Stat e governments towards breaking up the State electricity boards into separate generation transmission and distribution companies and then privatising them But so far only one State Orissa has gone the whole way The cris is that the country therefore faces is that while at the present pace the privatisation of distribution could take as long as ten years the power crisis is already here What the country needs is a means to make the State electricity boards viable today before they are privatised So far apart from making the States bind themselves to various financial reforms in the memoranda of understanding that they have signed with the Centre as they as k for doles to tide them over their financial woes the Central Government ha s done nothing There is however a way to do this almost immediately This is to end the theft of power that is taking place in the country in the name of the farme r In sharp contrast to the privatisation of the SEBs this can be accomplishe d in at most two years While everyone knows that some of the electricity supposedly consumed by th e farmer is actually diverted to other uses most people have assumed that th e proportion diverted is relatively small This is because the rise in the share of electricity consumed by the rural sector from per cent in to per cent in seems on the face of it reasonable Not everyone has realised that in absolute terms farm consumption increase d by times And this happened when the number of electrified tubewells ha d only doubled from million to million and the land under irrigation had increased by only per cent In absolute terms therefore electricity consumption for agriculture should not have risen by more than three times The balance amounting to billion units in was in effect stole n Had the States realised only Rs per unit for this electricity it would have increased the revenue of the SEBs by Rs crores and made them solvent overnight State governments have been unwilling to raise tariffs f or agriculture for fear of hurting the farmers But the Central Government can show them a simple way of continuing to subsidise irrigation which is overwhelmingly the main consumer of electricity on the farm without encouraging wholesale diversion and theft This is to issue registration papers for every electrified pumpset in the country stating its horsepower and the land cultivated by the farmer raise the rural tariff to a flat Rs per unit or whatever the SEBs deem appropriate and offer a rebate of Rs the going rate of subsidy on the estimated maximum consumption of power per tubewell Farmers need only bring their bills to a local bank wit h which they have opened an account show their registration papers and pay the rebated amount The bill will be paid by the bank as urban electricity and telephone bills are paid today and the rebate collected by it from the government authority concerned This scheme has the added advantage that to avail themselves of the subsidy the farmers will have to install electricity meters State governments have accepted the need to do this in principle but have so far been unable to speed up its implementation Prabhu stresses supply reforms Our Economy Bureau NEW DELHI Business Standard Copyright c Business Standard Union power minister Suresh Prabhu has called for the need to shift focus from power generation to the upgradation of the distribution system so tha t generation

DEREGULATION JUST HASTENED RECKONING MIKE LEWIS PI reporter Seattle PostIntelligencer FINAL A Copyright A decade ago it seemed like a great idea Lift regulations on electrical utilities so that competition could drive down prices Deregulating the generation and distribution of power the theory went wou ld create competition among a new breed of power companies that would lower costs to consumers and unleash creativity just as deregulation of the telephone utilities did a decade before California and more than dozen other states jumped in Oregon made a small step in that direction Washington took a pass But now all three states share the burden of outofcontrol energy costs and the specter of blackout s Legislators from Sacramento to Olympia are scrambling to rein in a fullblo wn power crisis even as consumers scramble to pay ballooning power bills Theres little argument that existing deregulation has not only failed but has failed so profoundly that politicians and regulators are not talking as much about fixing it as scuttling it whole Deregulation has gotten to be such a bad word said state Sen Bill Finkbeiner a Kirkland Republican who in chaired the Legislatures Ener gy Committee which rejected deregulation Its never going to happen now at least not in the Western US How bad has the situation become Over two weeks in late November and early December the market price for a megawatt of power jumped fivefold forcin g King County to briefly shut down one of its two sewage treatment plants Some cities are turning off streetlights and the states multibilliondoll ar aluminum industry has idled some plants sometimes to sell power leaving hundreds of workers idle In Seattle the average monthly City Light bill h as jumped percent to For all of us the power crisis has become a lesson in how policies of individual states can be rendered meaningless when it comes to interstate a nd international commerce Washington didnt deregulate California did Both states pay the price As one Northwest corporate lobbyist put it dryly the next time his company needs economic protection in Olympia hell contact Sacramento Heres how it is said Ed Mosey a Bonneville Power Administration spokesman Everyone else is the tail California is the dog Gov Gary Locke who is often reluctant to publicly criticize allies such a s California Gov Gray Davis acknowledged in a recent interview that he find s it frustrating that his state decided against deregulation but still finds itself in a mess We didnt make the same decision they did Locke said But Californias effect is impossible to avoid But blaming California isnt just simplistic it also isnt entirely accurate Those who buy sell and move electricity and natural gas and the politicians who attempt to control the markets agree that Washingtons risi ng power costs are a culmination of events that began to unfold a lifetime ago in the depths of the Great Depression President Franklin D Roosevelts New Deal gave the Northwest the bargain o f a lifetime Hoping to lift the nation out of the Depression the Roosevelt administration arranged an unprecedented series of public works projects providing jobs building roads bridges and dams among other things across the nation The Works Progress Administration built the Bonneville and Grand Coulee dam s on the Columbia River the vanguard of the federal hydroelectric dams th at now feed power to the Bonneville Power Administration a selfsupporting federal authority with headquarters near Portland The BPA is the powerhouse of a region the size of Texas providing half of all electricity used in the Northwest The remainder comes from a network o f public and private utilities including giants like Seattle City Light that predate Bonneville by decades All told there are about big and small hydroelectric dams in the Northwest and a far smaller number of coal and gasfired plants In the early days the BPA dams generated so much more power than the Northwest could use that congressmen joked that even the jackrabbits could be wired up During World War II the government took advantage of the plentif ul power by building aluminum production plants in Tacoma Spokane and Vancouv er to supply the needs of aircraft makers and shipbuilders such as The Boeing Co in Seattle and Henry Kaisers shipyard in Portland After the war BPA officials and local politicians persuaded the aluminum producers to stay put promising continued lowcost subsidized power contracts recently renewed to run through For local industry cheap power has always been a selling point No raw materials used in making aluminum are found in the Northwest but shipping them here is costeffective because smelting the ore takes a lot of juice One aluminum plant consumes as much electricity as a small city In the s this newly powerful local industry secured its first major coup a federal mandate that public utilities in the region such as Seattl e City Light could buy power at the subsidized cost of production Sixty percent of that preference power stays in Washington state Oregon generally takes percent The balance goes to Idaho and Montana and any surplus can be sold at market rate This combination of natural resources federal investment and populist politics has allowed the Northwest to enjoy some of the cheapest electricit y in the nation A BPA survey showed that the average residential cost f or power in the region was cents per kilowatt hour compared with a nationwide average of cents a rate that at least until now has continued to attract industry to the region In when Seattle resident s were paying monthly electricity bills the same amount of power on the East Coast sometimes cost as much as Much of the hightech relocation up here directly was linked to cheap power said Intels director of governmental relations Richard Hall Inte l employs people at its plant in DuPont While rates have gone up recently power in the Northwest remains a good deal City Light residential customers for example pay cents per kilowatt hour for the first kilowatt hours they use in a day and cents for each kilowatt hour afterward In and the BPA completed an mile line called an intertie between The Dalles Ore and Los Angeles allowing it to market what seeme d like a neverending surplus of power to utilities in fastgrowing Californi a In BPA sold about megawatthours for use in California or about percent of all BPA power sales that year the most recent year Bonneville reported those numbers It takes about megawatts of generating capacity to serve million homes Public utilities in California are small but two giant private investorowned companies rival Bonneville in size Monopolies regulated by the state California giants Pacific Gas Electric PGE and Southern California Edison CalEd eventually grew to serve a combined million customers making them the nations two largest private utilities During the summer when air conditioners cause California power use to peak utilities there supplement their needs by turning to the Northwest which usually has electricity to spare In winter when furnaces cause demand to peak in the Northwest California plants ship surplus power north The relationship worked flawlessly for decades In fact it worked too well With the West Coast tied into one grid the easy flow of power between regions allowed the states to avoid the politically difficult chore of siti ng and building new power plants that would allow each to become selfsufficient even as the total population in the three states blossomed from million in to million today In the mids California began climbing out of a recession brought on b y deep defense cuts high unemployment and energy prices that were among the highest in the nation inadvertently driven up by state and federal regulators who feared that oil and natural gas prices would soar These officials had pushed the utilities to diversify their generation methods T he Federal Energy Regulatory Commission required that they buy a portion of their power from what were then expensive alternative sources such as wind and geothermal plants CalEd estimates that the order has cost its customer s billion over two decades California business interests began to pressure their lawmakers to deregula te the power industry allowing them to buy electricity on the open market and to force PGE and CalEd to cut rates Congress wrote the law in and t he energy commission pressured the utilities to get moving in In December the California Public Utilities Commission voted to open the states electricity industry to competition The Legislature followed with a law based on an agreement brokered with CalEd its biggest industria l customers and an association of independent power producers But the deal was based on four colossal miscalculations And those led to t he current crisis No one foresaw that Californias economy would come roaring back from recession so strongly or so quickly or that so much of the new economy wou ld depend on energyhungry computers and the plants that produce them Both factors overtaxed a system that hadnt seen a new power plant come online for nearly a decade California generates about percent of the electricity it uses relying o n imports from the Southwest and the Northwest for the rest Officials acknowledge that California has not added enough power plants to accommodat e the roughly percent annual growth in its demand for electricity To meet that each year the state has to add either megawatts of generating capacity or conserve an equal amount Regulators forced California utilities to sell their generation divisions without also requiring them to sign longterm power contracts at fixed an d presumably lower rates This put the utilities at a disadvantage because they had to buy power on the open or spot market from operators such as Houstonbased as Enron and Dynegy which have reportedly seen revenues clim b by percent in the past two years while the utilities spiraled into debt A combination of factors cut into the amount of power available on the spot market Less power has been flowing into the grid because several major California power plants have been offline for needed repairs Northwest hydroelectric dams have been operating at lower capacity as they try to avo id draining reservoirs during the drought and a failure to upgrade California s distribution system makes it hard to move surplus power to where it is needed In fact that failure to upgrade the transmission system has proven to be a problem of the same scale as the lack of new power plants Californias fir st rolling blackout was caused not by a lack of power but by a lack of free lines to move it Washington has missed blackouts because it has enough capacity to move power when needed While attorneys general in all three states are investigating accusations that some power sellers have been withholding electricity to drive up price s its unclear whether they did or whether any laws were broken With deregulation the spot market has taken on the trappings of a desperat e auction Every morning the power marketers pay what they must for whatever surplus power they can find Wholesale prices can swing wildly climbing an d falling hundreds of dollars per megawatt hour over a day of trading When Californias demand began to outstrip its supply last summer San Dieg o was hit first The Northwest barely noticed But as the problem spread the power that Bonneville and Puget Sound Energy once bought for winter coverag e wasnt there Local prices began inching up Finally and some would say most important Californias deregulation schem e included a cap on rates for consumers In fact the Legislature there force d a percent retail rate cut as part of the deal to win passage of deregulation These errors and circumstances combined with some corporate restructuring that shifted resources away from traditional lines of busines s forced Californias big utilities to amass a combined debt of billion severely limiting their ability to buy power and prompting the recent round of blackouts in Northern California Do you see the problem there asked Mosey the BPA spokesman It didnt allow the market to function It gave consumers zero incentive to conserve If you had to devise a method whereby you shot yourself in both feet you couldnt do a better job California lawmakers are trying to undo the damage They have appropriated billions of dollars in emergency funding to keep the utilities afloat while they consider a more expensive bailout and re regulation scheme that might involve turning PGE and CalEd into public utilities exactly the opposite of the intent of deregulation Deregulation was initially popular in Washington state but it never had th e same attraction in a region where most voters enjoyed cheap power thanks t o Bonneville and public utilities At the time most people wanted it Finkbeiner recalled And Id like to say we had the great foresight to pass on it but that isnt true We just couldnt agree on what to do and it didnt go anywhere After two years of debate Washington lawmakers saw there was no groundswel l of support for deregulation and they did what politicians do in such cases They dropped it in moving on to the next big issue Now obviously Im glad Finkbeiner said But Finkbeiner is once again dealing with deregulation this time as sponso r of pending legislation that asks California to drop its power rate cap a source of irritation for Northwesterners who have seen their bills zoom up while Californians have not I dont know how Governor Davis will react but it is something they hav e to do Finkbeiner said of his bill which is an entirely symbolic act Washington cannot force California to do anything even though it shares Californias pain Color Photo Photos Map Chart Caption THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Jamie Lubbar a grid resource

E WEST COAST Available only on microfilm Editorial LETTERS PAGE Denver Rocky Mountain News FINAL A Copyright Mike Rosens lesson leaves great deal unsaid Mike Rosens latest effort at providing an economics lesson to the great unwashed masses is typical of his previous efforts it is rife with errors Rosen states that there is no conspiracy of oil and gas companies at work Rosen must have forgotten about OPEC a conspiracy to maximize profits for oil producers Rosen must also have forgotten that last year Vice President Cheney who at the time was head of Haliburton Oil praised OPEC for reduci ng production Rosen must not be aware that California has sued energy companies includin g Enron and Duke Energy both of which are large contributors to President Bu sh and other conservatives for unfair business practices Rosen also blames the California electrical shortage on legislators who fix ed the price of retail electricity and limited the abilities of companies to build new power plants What he fails to state is that retail electricity prices were fixed at the request of power companies at percent of the national retail electricity price so that power companies could gouge consumers and receive a billion bailout for their stranded costs losses that power companies had suffered due to bad investments in nuclear power plants Since California private power companies had made billion from those excess prices that were charged to consumers and had used that money to provide dividends to their shareholders and purchase other power companies Further Southern California Edison SCE one of the largest private power companies in California lobbied to stop a large energy project because the project would have reduced SCEs profits Rosen infers that there is an electricity shortage in California because it does not have adequate electrical capacity for its users What Rosen fails to mention is that peak usage of electricity in California was higher in both and than it was in and that percent more electricity is used during the summer when air conditioners are running than during the winter Because of those facts the only reasonable explanation for the current shortage of electricity is the unrestricted greed of power supplier s who find it more important to maximize the returns to their shareholders by restricting supplies and raising profits than to supply necessary power to the citizens who need it Steve Waldmann Colorado Springs BUSINESS Catholic Health East signs energy supply contract Staff report Times Union Albany NY THREE STAR E Copyright

companies are throwing their weight behind storage services promising to help deliver storage capacity much li ke utilities furnish electricity But a looming market shakeout makes it more vital than ever for companies t o scrutinize providers before committing to a contract Some customers already are seeking to protect their data with servicelevel agreements SLAs that compensate them when their storage service provider fails to deliver as promised Experts also recommend examining a providers market capitalization expertise reference accounts and all the other attributes a company would typically consider when choosing a strategic IT partner Storage service providers or SSPs claim to remove many headaches of managing storage Customers dont have to invest in their own storage infrastructure and personnel so SSPs can be a cheaper and faster way to ge t started Customers buy only as much capacity as they need The cost of buying and managing a storage system was so prohibitive that Verilytics Inc signed on with StorageNetworks which charges the Web porta l builder about per month for Gbytes of storage Because they have a payasyougo model it allowed us to get in at a fair ly low entry point said Mike Harvey head of operations at Verilytics As o ur needs require we can add additional capacity Verilytics signed an SLA with StorageNetworks that specifies financial penalties for unplanned downtime based on the length of an outage In fact nearly half of companies surveyed by Dataquest say theyre willing to p ay SSPs extra for agreements that compensate them for lost revenue due to downtime or service problems Increasing numbers of customers are even demanding SLAs per application typ e Unless these storage companies are making appropriate investments so they can guarantee perapplication SLAs theyre going to meet some resistance from potential customers said Sage Research president Kathryn Korostoff The range of SSP options varies widely For example to keep data inhouse because of security or privacy concerns a company may elect to have the vendor provide remote storage management Companies pay about per month per terabyte for basic storageondemand Additional featuressuch as scheduled backup and rest ore realtime data replication and SLAs guaranteeing percent uptimeca n push costs to more than per month per terabyte That figure include s equipment maintenance floor space and personnel costs StorageNetworks quotes fees of to per month per terabyte said John Clavin executive vice president of marketing A downside to outsourcing storage is that an organization is putting valuab le digital assets into someone elses hands The data may not be adequately protected from snoops or secured against loss And what happens to the data if the SSP should suddenly go out of business No one really knows We tell our enduser clients to be very selective who they choose and we tell them to make sure they have very concrete very well defined escape clauses said Arun Taneja an analyst at the Enterprise Storage Group Brokerage firm Charles Schwab Co prefers to maintain control of its huge repository of customer data said David Sherr vice president of architectu re and planning Sherr questions the wisdom of trusting customer data to a thi rd party It would be problematic he said You need to protect the privacy of your customers data The initial SSP customers were mostly dotcoms but in recent months more Global enterprises have signed up according to a recent survey by Sag e Research The survey found that percent of businesses with fewer than employees and percent of larger enterprises outsource storage While tho se numbers are small they are significant because the category is still so new Korostoff said More than half of the companies with which StorageNetworks has contract s are large enterprises Clavin said Several companies have jumped into storage services in recent months Exodu s Communications stock

IBM and Sun ha ve storage services alliances with ASPs and other providers Even energy company Enron is getting into the business Its Broadband Services unit launched a BtoB exchange on Jan that matches excess capacity owned by SSPs with corporate storage buyers Enron has signed a deal with StorageNetworks and is negotiating similar agreements with at least six other providers said Ravi Thuraisingham Enro n s lead storage trader Many analysts see a massive consolidation on the horizon A lot of compani es have gone into this business thinking that its an easy business Taneja said The economics of running an SSP profitably arent well defined Tanej a said and the longterm cost of building and regularly upgrading a bestofclass storage infrastructure may be too onerous for many Meanwhile the amount of data that companies amass is increasing exponentially Forrester Research predicts that companies will increase the ir average online storage capacities by a factor of over the next five year s That means storage and associated administration will grow from percent o f current information systems budgets to percent in the firm estimates And the business outlook for SSPs is rosy North American businesses will spend billion on storage utilities by according to Dataquest Enterprise Storage forecasts a billion market in Members Keep Off First Enron Panel Meet The Indian

serious concern in view of their likely impact on th e momentum of reform in the power sector initiated after nearly a decade of planning privatization and unbundling of SEBs and distribution systems The attitude of the Maharashtra Government towards an agreement on Dabhol does not inspire confidence in our honesty of purpose Failure to obey the contract displays frustration lack of integrity and the untrustworthiness of the Government The Government of Maharashtra knew their contractual obligations beforehand and should have started negotiations with Enron in order to find a solution The fact that it has taken two months to appoint a committee only indicates the lack of seriousness on its part Again the formation of a committee may be rightly or wrongly construed as an attempt to delay the matter On the other hand Enron also should not ignore the power tariff structure in this country and the rate at which other public undertakings are selling power from similar naphthabased power

the Dabhol power company as an intermediary and for the NTPC to dilute the price for a large number of consumers including those outside Maharastra None of these are indicative of any effort to find a compromise between Enron and the Government of Maharashtra over the present problem or those likely to surface in future If the power from Dabhol phase II is not going to be absorbed by Maharashtr a

Competition Begins Today Terry Maxon KRTBN KnightRidder Tribune Business News The Dallas Morning News Texas Copyright C KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News Source World Reporter TM So youre mad about your electricity bill and wish you could change to another electricity company Starting Thursday a lot of Texans can tell their current electric company to get lost and the customers probably will lower their electric rates as well The state is kicking off a pilot program to see how competition in its electricity markets will work Thursday is the first day that companies will be allowed to begin signing up customers June is the first day that these power companies can begin providing electricity to customers who decide to switch The three and a half months until then will be used to market their services and sign up customers The limited test will allow percent of all utility customers to pick thei r electricity company either their current company or one of many others that have signed up to sell electricity in Texas The test is a dress rehearsal for Jan when all customers of Texas investorowned utilities companies such as TXU Electric Reliant Energ y Inc and TexasNew Mexico Power Co will have a chance to take their business elsewhere In essence its to see that all the rules and ramifications of restructuring are working properly said Terry Hadley spokesman for the Public Utility Commission of Texas If there are any bugs we want to find out before the full launch Jan State officials were already nervous about their grand experiment in free markets but the current debacle in California has them even more on edge California which partially deregulated its electricity markets several yea rs ago now has two public utilities teetering on the edge of bankruptcy and unable to pay for electricity they bought Homes and businesses have faced rolling blackouts as the state at times hasnt been able to scrape up enoug h electricity to meet demand While the Public Utility Commission and others have repeatedly said that Texas wont repeat the California experience theyre looking to the pilot program to expose any flaws For the first month the state and electric providers will concentrate on commercial customers In midMarch theyll turn their attention to home customers However Public Utility Commission chairman Pat Wood III said both residential and commercial customers may sign up beginning Thursday Commercial users must go through a lottery to be chosen and the percent will be based on total commercial electricity used Residential customers will be added on a firstcome firstpicked basis wi th the cutoff after percent of all residential customers have volunteered fo r the program A key to the Texas program is the price to beat the basic rate that the utilities can charge That price will be a percent reduction from the electric rates charged by the utilities before the pilot program begins The investorowned utilities also include Central Power Light Southweste rn Electric Power Co Entergy SESCO and Southwestern Public Service Co Other companies can charge whatever they please but as Mr Hadley noted they probably wont get too far charging more than the pricetobeat rate s of the utilities When the Texas Legislature passed Senate Bill in to start retail competition in electricity the pricetobeat rate was set up to give competitors a chance to compete against the entrenched utilities Mr Hadley said the price to beat provides other electric retailers something to work against In addition the percent reduction from the utilities current rates would be enough of a cut to provide a customer a benefit but not so low as to prevent competition he said Of course the utilities dont have their hands tied in areas outside their current monopoly territory and most plan to compete aggressively for customers For example TNP Enterprises Inc parent of TexasNew Mexico Power has created a subsidiary First Choice Power Inc to lead its fight in the electric wars Jim Niewald First Choice director of marketing said the company will use the pilot period as a learning time to test ways to compete and to market its products Were going to take a sort of moderate approach Were not going to be rea l aggressive On the other hand were not going to be sitting back totally Mr Niewald said TXU spokesman Chris Schein said the Dallasbased company sees the pilot period as a time to work out kinks and discover if there are any inherent problems in the way that electricity competition in Texas works Its important to remember that the pilot program is less of a marketing event than it is an opportunity for TXU and the rest of the state to test systems The real marketing opportunity begins Jan Mr Schein said We are treating this as an opportunity to make sure our systems are communicating with all the states systems to make the customers choosing process as seamless as possible he said While TXU will be trying to sign up customers in the parts of Texas that it doesnt now serve it also has to deal with the pricetobeat rate freeze that will keep it from offering discounts in its current service area including DallasFort Worth Central Texas and other spots TXU is hoping that its existing customers want more than the lowest price Mr Schein said in the same way that not every customer chooses a car bas ed on price If that were true Kia would be the bestselling car in the US TXU will be promoting its quality of service and a package of bundled services that it hopes will be attractive For those who care about the environment TXU will offer green power or electricity generated by wind or other nonfossil sources Also entering the fray will be Green Mountain Energy Co which sells nothi ng but green power We are looking forward to bringing Texans the opportunity to support clean er air by purchasing power made from cleaner and renewable sources Green Mountain chief executive officer Dennis Kelly said in a prepared statement One of the most powerful benefits of electric choice is the ability for people to choose how their power is made he said As more people understand that making electricity causes more air pollutio n than any other industry he continued they will look for a simple way to purchase electricity that includes clean renewable sources like wind sun a nd hydropower Enron Corp the Houston energy giant has three companies that will compet e for customers in the deregulated world Two of its subsidiaries will target large customers Enron Power Marketing Inc will sell to wholesale

so weve created specialized businesses for what the market needs Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said For big customers Enron can afford realtime pricing that charges less for offpeak periods more for

Administration Cheney Does Heavy Lifting And Bush Rides Agenda Taste f or HorseTrading A Lot of Pain in the West By Jeanne Cummings Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc WASHINGTON George W Bush had barely celebrated his belated presidential victory when he was hit by the energy crisis in the West In a series of telephone calls to Mr Bushs Texas ranch before Christmas Utah Gov Michael Leavitt spent hours raising the alarm with the presidentelects top aides A supply squeeze had sent utility bills soarin g not just in California but in neighboring states as well with the prospect of bigger spikes in the months ahead How Mr Bush went on to handle the crisis the first big challenge of his presidency offers some early clues to how his White House will function H e has leaned heavily on Vice President Dick Cheney to handle the details Tha t allowed Mr Bush to stick doggedly to his chosen public message and shielded the president from some difficult policy choices Even Mr Leavitt never insisted on speaking directly to the new president who was busy nami ng his cabinet Mr Bush bent his freemarket limitedgovernment principles to accommodate a crisis but so far by only a little He offered a single twoweek extension of Mr Clintons executive order directing suppliers to sell power to nearl y bankrupt California utilities While turning to national issues Mr Bush remained open to a statelevel problem offering his former gubernatorial colleagues a sensitive ear And he worked hard to use unexpected events to help buttress his arguments for his policy agenda Just as he has used the economic slowdown to garner support for his taxcut agenda he hopes to use the Western energy crisis t o win political support in Congress for his controversial agenda of expanding exploration into environmentally sensitive areas in Alaska and the Rocky Mountains Such exploration might not yield energy for years or yield much power at all especially of the sort California needs But its a pet project of a White House where the president and vice president are both veterans of the oil industry Winning the necessary support for exploration is part of the challenge of drafting a comprehensive energy bill which a team of top aide s led by Mr Cheney is working to produce within to days The energy problem has shadowed Mr Bush throughout the first month of his presidency It commanded his private attention every day of his first week in office even as he was publicly unveiling educationreform proposals More recently he has received regular briefings from Mr Cheney who is consulting key members of Congress and energy experts The matter will move front and center today when the president makes his first foreign visit to Mexico where he is expected to discuss expanded naturalgas exploration an d trade with Mexican President Vicente Fox Quesada At the same time Mr Cheney will be back in Washington convening the first working meeting of th e various cabinet secretaries whose departments will be affected by a nationa l energy bill Some top Republicans believe the energy crisis could cast an even larger cloud over Mr Bushs first year than the softening economy especially i f the continuing supply squeeze leaves Western consumers facing new price increases this summer as widely predicted We recognize that this is a challenge we will be faced with at least through the summer Were obviousl y monitoring it very closely says Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham The problem has its roots in Californias energyderegulation bill signed by former GOP Gov Pete Wilson As part of the negotiations over the bill the states utilities agreed to buy power on shortterm contracts making them vulnerable to wholesaleprice swings The law also capped consumer bills which meant rising fuel costs couldnt be passed along to t he users The situation became critical last year when naturalgas prices spiked upwa rd at the same time that hot summer weather and a booming economy increased usage and low rainfall depleted the regions hydroelectric power Californi a soon began gobbling up any available power in the Western regions electric grid which drove wholesale rates skyhigh and wound up increasing the utility bills of consumers in neighboring states Idaho residents for instance saw their bills rise by while California users still benefit ed from retailprice caps So Gov Leavitt wasnt the only Western governor trying to get the new president to focus on the issue Wyoming Gov Jim Geringer raised it on Jan when he and Mr Bush were standing together in the pasture parking lot o f the Bush ranch awaiting the arrival of other Republican governors invited to a Bushsponsored barbecue The issue was also discussed later among all the governors but only in broad terms participants say Three days later Clinton administration officials convened the first meeti ng of all the parties involved in the California crisis To provide a voice fo r Mr Bushs team Clinton aides invited the presidentelects friend and fellow Texan Kenneth Lay head of Houstonbased Enron Corp As the largest trader of gas and electricity in North America Enron has profited from the energy crisis During the campaign Mr Lay donated more than to the GOP according to the Center for Responsive Politics A second meeting was held four days later and the rough outlines of a solution began to emerge but time had run out on the Clinton team The onl y question left was how to handle an executive order to keep the lights on in California On the Wednesday before Inauguration Day Gene Sperling Mr Clintons top economic adviser and his Bush counterpart Lawrence Lindsey sat down for a final discussion in a secondfloor office at the White House They agreed t o one last Clinton order that would reach by three days into the Bush term The goal was to give the Bush team some breathing room The next day Mr Bush and his top advisers settled into the Blair House in Washington to put the finishing touches on his inaugural speech But their work was at times interrupted by discussions about the energy crisis That night Mr Lindsey arrived and briefed the president on his meeting with Mr Sperling On Inauguration Day Mr Bush received a congratulatory call from Californi a Gov Gray Davis who had stayed in Sacramento because of the crisis In tha t call Davis aides say the Democratic governor made his first direct pitch to Mr Bush for an extension of the Clinton executive order forcing energy sal es to California utilities While the two men diverge politically they had worked together on issues affecting border states Last June Mr Bush was one of three US governors who joined six Mexican governors at a dinner hosted by Mr Davis in Sacramentos Crocker Art Museum Their shared experiences as state leaders made Mr Bush sympathetic to Mr Daviss reque st for extra time to get a recovery bill through the state legislature On Sunday night Mr Abraham the new energy secretary called Mr Davis to hear another pitch and the two men spoke again on Monday the first offici al working day of the Bush administration While Mr Davis was sounding out Mr Abraham Mr Lindsey met with Mr Bush in the Oval Office and recommended that he grant the extension The strongest argument in favor of issuing the order Mr Lindsey says was Mr Bushs belief that the federal government should help states solve their own problems Later that day while Mr Bush was highlighting education reform Mr Lindsey Mr Abraham Commerce Secretary Donald Evans Treasury Secretary Paul ONeill and Christine Todd Whitman director of the Environmental Protection Agency began sorting out the administrations shortterm and longterm responses to the crisis On Tuesday Mr Bush discussed energy with his economic policy team which included Messrs Cheney and Lindsey Chief of Staff Andrew Card Deputy Chi ef of Staff Josh Bolten and top aides Karen Hughes and Karl Rove Mr Bush to ok a seat in front of the Oval Office fireplace while his aides settled in on small couches The energy crisis had to be managed on two fronts Mr Bush told the group Shortterm they had to do what they could for California But an equally important objective needed to be development of a comprehensive policy for the country because of the broad economic implications of the crisis he said They weighed setting up a cabinetlevel task force an idea that Messrs Bu sh and Cheney appeared to have already discussed privately The two men often confer each morning before or after the regularly scheduled nationalsecurity briefing They also chat throughout the day as they come and go from meetings As the group hammered out the details of which agenci es needed to be represented on the task force it was not lost on anyone that the energy crisis in the West may also be an opportunity to build support a nd a sense of urgency for their national energy agenda Mr Bush tested the political waters the next day in the Cabinet Room durin g a meeting with bipartisan leaders from Capitol Hill according to Nevada Democrat Sen Harry Reid This time it was the president who raised the subject and Western lawmakers jumped at the call for stronger leadership a nd action on the issue The conversation didnt go into specifics though because we would have gotten into an argument over Mr Bushs support for drilling in Arctic National Wildlife Reserve recalls Mr Reid an ardent opponent of that proposal and a staunch supporter of expansion of renewable energy On Friday the White House was teeming with educators lawmakers governors and citizens who had come to witness the transition to a new administration After a public event hosted by Mr Bush to highlight education four governors Messrs Leavitt and Geringer Arizonas Jane Dee Hull and Idahos Dirk Kempthorne slipped into Mr Cheneys tiny West Wing office to talk about energy The room smelled of fresh paint and the glasses were so new that they lacked the presidential seal For nearly an hour Mr Cheney probed the governors about how the crisis was affecting their states and constituents None of the governors brought the issue up with Mr Bush The governors decision to seek out Mr Cheney rather than intrude on Mr Bushs choreographed agenda created an awkward moment the following Monday when Mr Bush announced the creation of the Cheneyled energy policy group Cant think of a better man to run it than the vice president Mr Bush said Were very aware in this administration that this situation in California is beginning to affect neighboring states Western governors cam e to see the vice president he said and then rushed to add and they ca me to see me as well Since that announcement Mr Cheney has taken over the job of creating an energypolicy bill and Mr Bush receives regular updates from Mr Lindsey including a session held last night just before the presidents trip to Mexico But the potential political and economic ramifications of the energ y crunch on the new administration are as layered as the problem itself And as consumers face the full cost of the crisis pressure will become enormous o n Mr Bush to wade deeper into it Administration officials worry that high energy costs could prompt consumer s to cut household budgets and persuade factories to begin layoffs The soft landing that the Bush administration is counting on could become a hard on e and threaten the government surpluses Mr Bush must have to sustain his tax cut and other domestic initiatives As Mr Bush himself warned when he unveiled his national energy policy during a September campaign stop in Saginaw Mich Our nation has had three recessions in the last generation and each one was tied to an energy shock The Western energy crisis also will continue to test the balance between Mr Bushs commitment to open markets and his sympathy for the plight of a fell ow governor The decision to extend the Clinton forcedsales order was a very difficult call Mr Lindsey says in part because the help provided to California came at the expense of the utility customers in other Western states several of which are governed by Mr Bushs close Republican colleagues This was not a costless extension Mr Lindsey says Theres a lot of pain in the West for having done the twoweek extension But the supply crunch that drove up wholesale costs this winter may only ge t worse as temperatures warm in the West and residents from California to New Mexico turn on their air conditioners Republican officeholders wary of th e sort of political backlash that helped cost one California Congressman his seat last November are pressing for further federal intervention Alaska Sen Frank H Murkowski the powerful chairman of the Senate Energy and National Resources Committee says a marketbased cap on wholesale prices m ay be needed for a transitional period But Mr Bush is flatly rejecting the idea of price caps A shortterm dela y of a needed solution he says The idea is also anathema to Mr Cheney whose first White House tour during the Ford administration was dominated b y an energy crisis made more complex by President Nixons policy of price controls Nasdaq Chairman Frank Zarb who served as Mr Fords energy czar and worked with Mr Cheney and other aides while crafting an energy policy says the price controls were just a dumb idea In a recent interview Mr Lindsey said even a temporary cap on natural gas or electricity is not something hed recommend Anyone who looks at the history of price caps would have to suspect one that was socalled temporary he says But adhering to freemarket principles could yet become a drag on Mr Bush s popularity warns former US Sen Bennett Johnston a Democrat Mr Bush on ce considered for energy secretary If the administration takes no action and prices remain high he says people will start trying to find somebody to blame John Fialka contributed to this article Generators No Plans To Build PeakingPwr Plants In Calif Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc This article was originally published Thursday By Jessica Berthold OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow Jones Major electricity suppliers with experience building power plants in California said Thursday they have no plans to construct new peaking units in the state for operation by summer Their position raises questions about whether Gov Gray Davis will be able to get megawatts of new power on Californias grid by July a target he announced last week Davis plan offers incentives to generators but it also leaves key issues unsettled creating uncertainty in the market And time is short If the ne w plants are to come on line construction will have to begin by midMarch Were not going to be able to have any peakers this summer said Mark Palmer spokesman for Enron Corp ENE Its not possible physically and theres no market that would allow plants to be profitable Davis plan calls for megawatts of additional generation to come on line in the state by July Roughly half of that power will come from large plants now under construction and from easing environmental restrictions thus allowing plants currently off line to run as long as operators buy emission credits The other half will come from peaking generation units typically small units designed to run only during periods of high demand The state Independent System Operator has contracts for construction of MW wort h of peakers The governor hopes to get MW more through an emergency order cutting the permit process from four months to days But generators say cutting permit time is not enough of an incentive for generators to build in the state While the governors announcement about streamlining the approval process appears attractive on the face of it there are still problems of creditworthiness and regulatory uncertainty said Richard Wheatley spokesman for Reliant Energy REI We have to allocate our equipment for projects which will have the greatest potential to succeed We dont have a ny projects that could be on the ground in California this summer Generators Fear They Wont Recover Investment Generators say they are wary of investing more capital in part because the state Department of Resources would likely be signing the contracts for the MW of emergency power and theyve been burned once already by the DW R Generators thought the DWR was covering the states entire net short electricity needs in recent weeks But last week the agency said it has no t been paying for power it deemed unreasonably priced That means the bills g ot passed to the states two investorowned utilities which havent paid thei r power bills in weeks due to cash and credit problems Another problem say generators is that they dont know what rate of retur n they can expect from the peakers The governors order says the peaker powe r must be sold only to the DWR and at a reasonable rate but that rate has not been defined Exactly how the state determines reasonableness is the key question said Tom Williams spokesman for Duke Energy DUK Williams added that Duke wouldnt build peakers for the summer because the company already has enough risk in that market right now If the state could guarantee a workable market for power this summer generators would rush to build in the state because theyd know they could recover their costs said Enrons Palmer But with the states history of price caps generators simply see to much uncertainty he added A Mirant Corp MIR spokeswoman said the company had not announced any pla ns to build new peakers Calpine Corp CPN said it was still considering its options but planned to concentrate this summer on larger generation projec ts already under way in California ISO Peaker Program Also In Jeopardy The ISO peaker program which has MW of projects due on line by summe r and currently in various stages of completion is also in jeopardy due to generators concerns they wont be paid enough to cover their investment said an ISO spokesman who helps manage the peaker program Credit concerns are a real issue among generators at this point said Bob Theaker ISO manager of reliability contracts The way our tariff authoriz es us to pay generators we would levy an uplift on people who serve load through the ISO grid in essence it comes down to the utilities Theaker said the governor is still looking into ways that generators would be paid for their peaker contracts given that the utilities are unable to pay A lot of projects are in suspended animation right now as people wait to s ee how they will get paid Theaker said We dont know how far the governors discussions have progressed but its got to be resolved soon because the development and building of these projects requires a month lead time Theaker added that midMarch would be the latest that construction could begin or resume if the state expected to see any power from peakers by June By Jessica Berthold Dow Jones

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ruling FERC says the ISO cant waive a requirement that PGE and Edison be creditworthy Suppliers say that backs up their argument that the state already buying a third of the power the strapped utilities customers use must take responsibility for lastminute power buys the Independent System Operator makes to fill gaps in Edisons and PGEs supplies The ISO conten ds the ruling backs up their argument that they can keep billing Edison and PG E for the emergency power they buy from the wholesalers regardless of the utilities ability to pay for it The

But it may be a hard sell south of t he border EVELYN IRITANI TIMES STAFF WRITER Los Angeles Times Home Edition C Copyright The Times Mirror Company When President Bush meets today in Mexico with President Vicente Fox he wi ll deliver the same message he did to Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien la st week in Washington Lets share energy Bush wants a hemispheric energy policy that although only vaguely define d so far would foster the seamless flow of oil natural gas and electricity among the three nations and reduce barriers that limit foreign access to energy resources It is a goal that Chretien embraces but that presents Fox with big practica l and constitutional problems And the White House initiative faces opposition from other quarters as a result of Californias power debacle which is now drawing blame for soarin g energy prices in Canada and Mexico as well as the United States It has sparked a global reassessment of energy deregulation and could turn America s energy industry into the latest target for antiglobalization forces The energy companies could easily become a poster industry for the message that if globalization means a market economy then thats bad news said Gary Hufbauer a trade analyst at the Institute for International Economics in Washington As the worlds biggest single consumer of energy the US has a point of view that to some outsidersespecially in energyproducing countries such as Mexico and Canadais purely one of selfinterest Critics liken the USl ed deregulation effort to economic imperialism disguised as free trade where the US forces other countries to open their energy markets to powerful American firms that then siphon off the energy for SUVdriving electricitygobbling Americans We now have a continental energy market largely run by American corporatio ns that is based on a model of increased consumption and the premise that wel l never run out of energy said Maude Barlow chairwoman of the Ottawabas ed Council of Canadians that countrys largest publicinterest group In his first few weeks in office Bush has used Californias electricity shortage as ammunition to promote the need for a longterm energy policy centered on greater development of oil and natural gas One element would have oil gas and electricity flow more freely within North America So far the former Texas oilmans plans for a continental energy market hav e been long on rhetoric and short on details USCanada trade in energy is already largely unfettered with Canada sending billion in energy products south in And US energy firms are major players in Canada We are in the business of selling them oil and gas and electricity Chretien said after meeting with Bush But as its own energy reserves dwindle and its appetite grows the United States has a lot to gain from reducing barriers everywhere to trade in oil gas and electric power an economic enterprise valued at between billi on and trillion worldwide That is why Washington over the years has sought to open up energy markets through pacts such as the North American Free Trade Agreement and the World Trade Organization Previously energy services such as oil production and electricity transmission were not part of trade agreements because those areas were largely controlled by governmentowned monopolies But today at least countries are in some stage of energy deregulation or privatization according to Robert Michaels a deregulation expert at Cal State Fullerton Deregulation advocates argue that tearing down these barriers will foster investment in infrastructure in energyrich but undeveloped countries speeding the construction of power systems They point out that nearly billion people around the world dont even have access to electricity or other forms of commercial energy But the California experience has changed attitudes everywhere Energy analyst Lawrence Makovich of Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Cambridge Mass has been traveling the globe urging anxious governments n ot to turn their backs on energy deregulation because of Californias failed deregulation scheme We are at a very critical point here Makovich said Are we going to continue and fix this market and get things right or retreat back toward government control and regulation Trade agreements such as the WTO establish rules on how markets should be liberalized and the proper role of government A US proposal to add energ y services to the WTO trade pact for example would require countries to do away with excessive tariffs on drilling equipment and prohibit preferential treatment for domestic firms in bidding for oil concessions or getting acce ss to electrical grids There are reasons why historically these energy markets were set up as integrated monopolies because they knew security of supply was essential t o any modern economy said Ellen Gould an economist in Vancouver Canada w ho served on the board of BC Hydro British Columbias publicly owned utility You cant have the lights go out But you cant introduce market forces unless youre prepared to see a little blood Political and economic tensions over energy in the NAFTA region especially in Canada illustrate the obstacles facing the Bush initiative Under NAFTA Canada agreed to reduce government intervention and ensure a more stable flow of energy across the border in exchange for increased acce ss to the much larger US market That included a pledge not to give Canadian customers preferential treatment by charging them less than foreigners and to maintain exports at a certain level even if Canada was experiencing a shortfall or price surges at home Since then Canadas exports to the United States have jumped dramatically Canadas share of the US natural gas market has tripled to Throughout Californias energy crisis Canadian producers and governments i n resourcerich provinces have enjoyed a windfall because of the resulting price runups But in Alberta which in January became the first Canadian province to deregulate electricity a sharp spike in gas and electricity prices has triggered a consumer and business backlash Energy has become a hot issue i n an upcoming provincial election and the government has provided hundreds o f millions of dollars in energy rebates to unhappy customers Even the provinces largest manufacturers have pronounced electricity deregulation a mistake Steven Shrybman a trade attorney in Ottawa believes Canada signed onto a pact that undermined its sovereignty while allowing the United States by getting more oil and gas from Canada to reduce its dependence on oil from the Middle East and lessen the likelihood of going to war to keep its cars and heaters fueled From the American point of view Shrybman says I regard these provisions of NAFTA as an alternative to the Iraq war In Mexico the constitution requires that natural resources remain under domestic control The country was exempted from most of NAFTAs energy marketopening provisions That has made foreign firms wary of investing in Mexicos energy sector You cant have any foreign ownership and yet they want investment and jointventure partners said Enrons Hillings Theres an awful lot of ga s right around the TexasMexico border thats never been developed Meanwhile Mexico cant even meet its own burgeoning demand for gasoline or electricity By some estimates Mexico needs to invest billion in energ y including natural gas to feed new power plants money that Fox has said wil l have to come from outside investors US energy firms are already building power plants in Baja California and other parts of Mexico but nearly all t he output is needed in Mexico itself Sergio Rivas an economist at Primer Enfoque an energy consulting firm in Mexico City predicted that Fox will have trouble persuading Mexicans suffering brownouts themselves that they should provide energy to their wealthier northern neighbors People would ask How is it possible we are thinking to supply electricit y to the United States when we dont have enough for our own consumption Rivas said In the political sense this issue is very very complicated BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX

Reporter of The Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc BUENOS AIRES While many Argentines were still nursing hangovers on New Years Day Buenos Aires Gov Carlos Ruckauf was holding a news conference His urgent message to the nation Im going to be the next president Never mind that Argentinas sitting president Fernando de la Rua was just a year into his fouryear term Mr Ruckauf was once again reveling in his ro le as the selfappointed spokesman for victims of a painful recession widely blamed on Mr de la Rua Governor of a state comprising more than a third of the countrys populatio n and total output Mr Ruckauf has struck a chord with beleaguered Argentine s by sounding off about surging crime and stubbornly high unemployment He ha s also sided with local businesses against foreign competitors and freetrade deals and with consumers against aspects of the countrys sweeping privatization program The strategy has paid big dividends for the yearold governor In recent opinion polls he ranked twice as popular as Mr de la Rua and had a higher positive rating than any other politician on the national scene But certain positions have increasingly put Mr Ruckauf at odds with multinational companies operating in Buenos Aires state Last month his administration ordered the state legislature to review a million waterdistribution contract held by Azurix Corp which is majorityowned b y Houstons Enron Corp following a contract dispute Mr Ruckauf crossed swords with WalMart Stores Inc of Bentonville Ark recently when his government backed a law that greatly restricts the size of new hypermarkets a move seen as an effort to protect local retailers Observers tend to view Mr Ruckaufs morepopulist platforms as a vehicle f or the governors political ambitions rather than the product of deeply held beliefs Before becoming a firebrand governor Mr Ruckauf was a lowprofil e sidekick as vice president to former President Carlos Menem who was a confirmed believer in free markets Analysts note that Mr Ruckauf regularl y courts foreign investors to buy the states global bonds and appointed a former Argentine ambassador to the US Diego Guelar to nurture highleve l contacts with US officials Hes a total pragmatist says political analyst Rosendo Fraga In terms of Mr Ruckauf making major policy changes he says theres a low probability that hell do it Mr Ruckauf has also drawn the ire of some within his own Peronist party which ceded the presidency to Mr de la Ruas Alliance party in December Party chief Mr Menem along with several other Peronist governors a re believed to have their eyes on the presidential race And many were jarred when Mr Ruckauf attacked his opponent in the gubernatorial race for being proabortion in an appeal to the partys ultraconservative wing Abortion is generally outlawed in the largely Catholic country and typicall y isnt raised as an issue in political campaigns But the governors noholdsbarred message is resonating strongly with ordinary Argentines who quickly soured on their new president when he fail ed to bring fast economic relief In almost daily declarations Mr Ruckauf ha s called for a crackdown on youth violence sweeping tax cuts and increased funding for small and mediumsized businesses He has attacked Brazil Argentinas partner in the regional trade pact Mercosur for robbing jobs from Argentina And he recently led an appeal to the national government fo r a social aid package to accompany the nearly billion financial packag e led by the International Monetary Fund in December I make proposals that are absolutely clear Mr Ruckauf said recently Opponents say Mr Ruckaufs popularity surge is just a blip on the screen that will disappear when the economy bounces back as it shows some signs o f doing So far though enthusiasm for Mr Ruckauf hasnt been mitigated by the fac t that he hasnt actually managed to cut crime and that unemployment has stuc k close to He also hasnt taken the fall for his states worsening finances Late last year Standard Poors downgraded the provinces forei gn and localcurrency debt SP analyst Diana Mondino says

Vilasrao Deshmukh that the terms of reference for the Godbole committee must include a review of the Dabhol power project Mr Patil told The Times of India News Service that the terms should also provide for reviewing all clearances given to the project and examining all the relevant laws and notifications Mr Patil a former minister of the Peasants and Workers party and a respect ed politician is a staunch opponent of the project He has demanded the scrapping of phase II of the project saying that it is exploitative and wou ld imposes a severe burden on the states finances and the consumers Mr Patil is of the view that the second phase can be scrapped as the agreement with Enron violates several provisions of the Contracts Act Some experts feel that phase II would be so deleterious to the state and the consumers that it would be more acceptable to bear the costs of scrapping i t The Godbole committee will make recommendations not only on the Dabhol powe r project but also on two other major proposed private sector projects of Reliance at Patalganga and Ispat group at Bhadrawati The Maharashtra state electricity board had signed power purchase agreement s for both the projects during the Shiv SenaBJP administration However the MSEB told the government that it would find it difficult to absorb the high volume of additional power The Ispat project has a capacity of MW and Reliance MW Besides if the proposed MW plant of BSES comes up at Saphale near Palghar it would further create problems wrt cost of purchasing power fo r the MSEB sources said Ideally BSES should be ready to give a crosssubsi dy to MSEB sources said Sources said the BSES was making a lot of profit sin ce it catered to a large number of affluent consumers in Mumbai While they take away the cream we are forced to cater to the rural areas at a low pri ce and suffer losses the sources said A senior official said the state electricity board should also benefit from Mumbais affluence The board has protested to the government against the proposed BSES plant a t Saphale BSES must compensate MSEB the sources said BSES has submitted another proposal for a MW coalbased unit at Nandgaon near Amravati It should not even be discussed until BSES meets its obligations by paying standby charges for the Dahanu plant the sources said Meanwhile MSEB has launched a major drive to disconnect power supply to

Times of India Copyright C The Times of India Source World Reporter TM MUMBAI The Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB has started tighteni ng its grip on defaulters and power theft in the wake of the Enron crisis The drive has already borne fruit with revenue collections rising and cases of power theft in the wane Making this claim a top MSEB official said that the government would have to decide the fate of the DPC project at the political level and not depend on the Godbole committee for solutions Speaking to TOINS on the condition of anonymity he said that over the past few months MSEB had shown better recovery the collection in January was Rs crore against Rs crore in December It is expected to be around Rs crore in February Also electricity lines of more than defaulte rs were being disconnected on a daily basis Generation too has shown considerable improvement Plant load factor PLF of MSEBs generation plants has achieved a peak capacity of per cent which is a national record he stated The main problem was MSEBs tariff structure he said The official pointed out that crore of MSEBs consumers were subsidised ie nine out of every ten enjoy receive power at concessional rates He however pointe d out that despite these shortcomings MSEB continued to be one of the most efficiently run SEBs in the country The official conceded that power thefts continued to be a major cause of th e losses and also accepted the fact that there existed a nexus between power pilferers and some MSEB personnel He revealed that nearly MSEB officer s had been punished for turning a blind eye on power thefts The official said the Rajadhyaksha committee appointed some of years ago b y the former Shiv SenaBJP government to review Maharashtras power situation had strongly recommended metered power supply all over the state Neither this recommendation nor other important recommendations have been implemented Describing agriculturists demand for power as a subsidyinduced demand the official said it had been observed that electric motors were left running even after the required amount of water w as drawn This was happening simply because power was cheap he said India State Pays Bills to Enron But Electricity Crunch Persists John Elliott Special to the International Herald Tribune Friday February BOMBAY The Indian state of Maharashtra has paid Enron Corp million i n overdue bills from a troubled power project temporarily easing tensions with the US company But the payment of the bill came only after Enron intensified the standoff with the state calling in the federal government and it resolves none of the issues that prompted the dispute Meanwhile a severe energy shortage i n India continues to worsen The confrontation was prompted by increases last year in the price of power from the Enron plant which was begun in amid a backlash of nationalis t sentiment against the big outside investor The state government called in December for Enrons entire billion megawatt project in Dabhol to be renegotiated for a second time and stopped paying its bills That provoked the company last month to demand payment of overdue bills It invoked a central government guarantee intended to reassure skittish foreig n investors The power minister Suresh Prabhu who comes from Maharashtra stepped in a nd on Monday the state government paid the million due We spoke to the state government and they have made their payment Mr Prabhu said Now both sides need to talk and we need to solve this situation While the million November payment was finally made Enron says it is still owed additional payments from the project The Enron project is part of a much wider problem There is a national shortage of power amounting to about percent at peak periods but virtually bankrupt state electricity distribution boards throughout the country can neither pay their bills nor provide financial guarantees for builders of new power projects Given the financial health of the state electricity boards we shall very soon reach a state of no return if we do not take corrective measures Mr Prabhu said adding that new generation transmission and distribution projects costing more than billion would be needed in the next year s Mr Prabhu has two immediate aims One is to solve the Enron dispute and salvage what is left of Indias reputation as a destination for foreign investment At the same time he is pushing the state electricity boards to revise their finances For example percent of the Maharashtra boards power is sold below cost some of it is virtually free and onethird of its revenues disappear in theft and other distribution losses Analysts suggest Enron and its bankers might be willing to discuss revising some of the Dabhol deal if they believed that the board which is both its customer and a partner in the project had sufficient revenues to be able t o pay its bills on time For that to happen the state government would have to introduce changes that reduce subsidies implement a tougher rate structure and strengthen bill collection The state government however is riven wit h political divisions and some leftist parties plan statewide demonstration s next month where they will call for the project to be scrapped The problem is urgent because Dabhols second phase is due to be commission ed in two stages in July and August adding at least million a month to th e bills that Enron sends to the board Then in January liquefied natural ga s will begin to flow from Abu Dhabi and Oman under contracts that have alread y been finalized The state will find it difficult to meet these deadliness on its own One solution being discussed is for the state to call off its dispute with Enro n over the existing phase of the project and pay all outstanding bills At th e same time it would demand renegotiation of phase two with the aim of reducing Enrons rates and offloading some of the project to the central government The projects bankers which include Citibank Bank of America ANZ Grindla ys and ABNAMRO would then come under pressure to reduce financing charges possibly by reducing interest payments and rescheduling debt in US dollar s to Indian rupees Enron would also be asked to reduce standing charges whi ch are imposed irrespective of how much electricity the company produces and currently cost million a month Meanwhile Enron which is refocusing on more developed economies is reviewing its other projects in India It has canceled a joint ventur e with Calcuttabased Ispat Industries for a gasbased power project at an Ispat steelworks

television media recently has now spilled over into cyberspace A number of USbased nonresident Indian NRI academics and professionals have come together and formed a group Enron Action that runs a we bsite wwwaltindianetenron The site carries an emotional call for transparency for accountability for that lost promise called a democracy And as the name suggests it has extensive information on the chronology of events legal suits filed in the past and most interestingly a section that suggests a way out fro m the current mess that Maharashtra and the central government find themselves in The crux of the NRIs argument scrap the project as according to their estimates Maharashtra will end up paying a whopping billion Rs crore to Dabhol Power Company DPC The NRIs say that under international law the Maharashtra State Electricit y Board MSEB can bypass its insane obligations to the DPC only if an Indian court rules that the DPC agreement the Power Purchase Agreement PP A and the agreements surrounding it was in violation of Indian law Indeed a court case to this effect filed by Prayas an NGO has been rejected by the Maharashtra High Court an appeal against this dismissal filed by CITU and A Mehta is pending before the Supreme Court says the group Explaining the background of the imbroglio the NRIs group says that under the laws in force when the PPA was signed the agreement required mandatory economic and technical clearance from a statutory body the Central Electricity Authority CEA constituted for this very purpose The grou p says that the CEA did issue a technical clearance to the DPC power plant but explicitly refused to issue the economic clearance Instead the regulatory body observed that the economic issues had been looked into by t he Ministry of Finance which found them satisfactory The website further claims that petitioners in this court case have contend ed that the DPC deal never received the mandatory economic CEA clearance A mandatory CEA clearance was the legal safeguard against signing PPAs at exorbitant rates As this clearance was never received the petitioners conclude that the Dabhol PPA has no force in law The group believes th at this argument is persuasive and has hoped that the Supreme Court will as well And the NRIs are putting their money in what they believe is the truth A week ago they ran an advertisement in an Indian daily on the controversy Headlined each of you owes Rs lakh to Enron the ins ert claims that the Maharashtra government has been unable to pay DPC Rs billion But it has entered into a contract which obligates it to pay Rs trillion over the next years Predicting a collapse in the states finances the NRIs believes that Maharashtra will have no money for roads drinking water projects irrigation education or primary healthcare Juicy tidbits from wwwaltindianetenron Enron deal signed without competitive bidding Project supplies electricity at twice the cost of MSEB World Bank

their electricpower company Deregulation is expected to attract close to power companies including newcomers from outside Texas who will compete for a slice of the residential commercial and industrial market Customers can sign up for the trial program by contacting one of the companies and requesting service Service will begin June and serve as a test for the broader electricity deregulation that begins next year Supporters say deregulation say it will provide more competition and lower prices for consumers Utilities are already jostling for position and consumers attention An official with New Power Co a joint venture of Enron IBM and America Online said the company might offer one or two months free to some residential customers Houstonbased Shell Energy a unit of Royal DutchShell Group said it woul d give a years worth of electricity free to Don Gallagher of Houston the first residential customer to sign up for its service Ive only won piddling things I had a close miss on the Texas Lottery once This is pretty neat said Gallagher a selfemployed contractor who spent on electricity for his squarefoot house last year Gallagher said the money hell save might go for a car for one of his teenage daughters or for new carpeting Itll get spent Most analysts expect the utilities will be most aggressive in courting larg e business customers Because a commercial customer is higher volume theres more potential revenue than going after a lot of residential customers said Terry Hadley a spokesman for the Public Utility Commission And if youre a business paying a lot more than a residential customer for power youre going to be more active in shopping around The state deregulation law will allow big investorowned utilities such as TXU Corp the ability to compete for customers beyond their traditional hom e territories but they also must cut their hometurf rates by percent State officials expect Dallasbased TXU Electric to eventually lose percent of its North Texas customer base Spokesman Chris Schein said the company expects to more than offset its losses by adding customers in Houst on home of rival Reliant Energy and other Texas cities The pilot program will be open to percent of the states electricity user s Residential customers can sign up on a firstcome firstserved basis If demand among business users exceeds percent as is expected participatio n will be determined by a lottery The trial run is designed to test the electric grid and computer systems th at will be used to link power producers and customers who have never before

Risks Seen For Suppliers By Mark Golden Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc NEW YORK Dow Jones The biggest of all power bills for Californias two main utilities comes due March billion for December realtime purchases It represents an enormous amount of fourth quarter revenue at risk for suppliers to the utilities via the California Independent System Operator Some independent generators like Calpine Corp CPN and western utilities did much in December to reduce their exposure to the cashstrapped California utilities Other generators and trading companies like Enron Corp ENE Williams Cos WMB and Mirant Corp MIR increased their exposure by buying power for the ISO from Northwest utilities that had stopped selling directly to the ISO due to credit concerns We entered into contracts with utilities and third parties like Enron and avoided selling to those that had questionable credit Calpine Executive Vice President Tom Mason told Dow Jones Newswires Thursday at an industry conference in New York Some of these folks were willing to take on that risk PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas Electric Co will owe billion for its December realtime market purchases through the ISO the company said Thursday Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edisons bill will come to million according to a person familiar with the billing Barring a legislative solution to the states energy crisis within the next two weeks the utilities are expected to pay little of their March bill Earlier this month Pacific Gas Electric paid about of its November ISO bill of million and Southern California Edison paid none of its bill for million As reported Calpine Avista Corp AVA New Century Energies Inc NCE and the British Columbia provincial utility BC Hydro are among those companies that aggressively reduced exposure to the California utilities and ISO by December Calpine still has some exposure for the fourth quarter but its comfortable enough with that exposure that it didnt take reserves against its earnings as some other companies did Mason said Some Suppliers Stepped Into Middle As Prices Soared After colder temperatures moved in Dec wholesale power prices in the Northwest shot up to as high as a megawatthour up from MWh in late November The ISOs volume of purchases increased as well to meet higher demand for electric space heating and it started paying a large credit risk premium on top of the regular market prices From Dec until Dec when the US Department of Energy ordered all historical suppliers to the ISO to deliver available electricity directly companies that were willing to take on more California utility credit risk could buy Northwest power at an average price of about MWh and deliver it to the ISO for about MWh Making that deal for business days on MW supply for example would come to million of profit in the event of payment but million in losses in the event of nonpayment Enron chairman Ken Lay confirmed that the company stepped in to buy power from companies that wouldnt sell to the ISO and then sold that power to the ISO at a premium We make markets in California and elsewhere Lay said Thats what we do Williams said Thursday that it too bought power for the ISO in addition to delivering all available power it owns inside California Because of the ISOs desperate need for power from Northwest outofstate state sources when those historic sources dried up for the ISO Williams was one of the companies that stepped in and we did it at a reasonable margin said Tim Thuston Williams managing director of government relations This wasnt profiteering Power traders said that Mirant which is the recently spunoff unregulated division of Southern Co SO also was buying from Northwest utilities and selling to the ISO in the first half of December Specifically I cant say if we bought from Northwest utilities and sold to the ISO Mirant spokeswoman Jamie Stephenson said In general we bought and sold power nationwide The sleeving of power sales as it is called by power marketers stopped in the second half of December after the Department of Energy issued its emergency order InState Producers Enron And TransAlta Owed Most On the receivable side of the March bill Dynegy Inc DYN and partner NRG Energy NRG Enron Mirant Reliant Energy REI TransAlta TTA Williams BC Hydro and the Los Angeles Department of Water Power are owed the most tens of millions of dollars each according to a person familiar with the billing Instate energy producer Duke Energy DUK says it limited its spot sales to the ISO All of the companies declined to say how much money they are owed for December but Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley pegged Reliants bleed rate to the two utilities conservatively at about million a day before the California Department of Water Resources started buying electricity in place of the utilities Williams said it doesnt expect any material creditworthiness issues in the fourth quarter Ultimately we expect to collect all the money thats due to us Williams Thuston said when asked if nonpayment for its sales to the ISO in the event of a utility bankruptcy would be material Weve been operating in good faith to be part of the solution in California and we assume that the governor and legislature are going to do what they said they were going to do Mirant has taken reserves against the possibility of nonpayment but Stephenson wouldnt say how much the reserves are By Mark Golden Dow Jones Newswires Christina Cheddar contributed to this article

Economy Utilities Make Own Plans for CO Curbs Entergy Sets Emissions Cap As Bush Climate Policy Remains to Be Resolved By John J Fialka Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc WASHINGTON Some major US utilities are beginning to step out ahead of the Bush administration on the climatechange issue developing their own plans for curbing emissions of carbon dioxide the manmade gas thought to be contributing to global warming Meanwhile the White House is under growing pressure to demonstrate that its plans to boost energy production can be environmentally sensitive President Bush signed an executive order requiring the federal government to conserve energy during periods of peak demand in California and other places facing energy shortages Mr Bush also said the federal government would make available power generators in case of emergencies Conservation has got to be an integral part of making sure weve got a reasonable energy policy Mr Bush said New Orleansbased Entergy Corp the nations third largest utility in terms of electricity produced said that it will will impose a limit on CO from its power plants that burn natural gas oil or coal and stay within that level of emissions for five years We understand that this is a very politically contentious subject said company Vice President Jim Mutch If other companies do their fair share now hopefully when there is a regulatory scheme there will be less of a problem By running its plants with greater efficiency improving the efficiency of its electricity and gas transmission systems and engaging in some outside CO reduction efforts such as planting trees that absorb the gases Entergy hopes to keep its overall CO emissions at million tons per year Mr Mutch said The company which derives of its power from fossil fuels will work with the New Yorkbased group Environmental Defense to make sure its efforts are effective and measurable Meanwhile a coalition of five other electric power companies is calling for a mandatory cap on CO emissions that would decline annually if the Bush administration develops a national emissions trading system that allows a company to decide which technologies to use to reduce CO and other pollutants Were basically planning on a glide path downward regarding emissions limits explained Mark Irion a spokesman for the group which includes Enron Corp and El Paso Energy Corp of Houston Calpine Corp of San Jose Calif Trigen Energy Corp of White Plains NY and NiSource Inc of Merrillville Ind Emissions trading gives companies incentives to introduce new technology Mr Irion said Under the trading scheme which is used currently to address sulfurdioxide pollution a company that reduces emissions below its target level gets trading credits that it can sell to other companies thus helping to offset the costs of new capital investment Sulfur dioxide plays a major role in acid rain The announcements come as the entire US utility industry which produces about a third of the nations manmade CO is engaged in behindthescenes negotiations with the White House energy task force headed by Vice President Cheney over how to set up a meaningful voluntary system for reducing CO nationwide Meanwhile private utilities federally owned entities such as the Tennessee Valley Authority and rural electric cooperatives are trying to develop an industry consensus on a voluntary program According to one industry official involved in both discussions who asked not to be identified one idea of interest to the task force involves voluntary contracts that power companies would make with the government calling for CO emissions cuts Once signed the contracts target reductions would become mandatory Called a soft cap program it could become part of the US position for the next round of international climatechange talks slated for Bonn Germany in July We have only recently begun to engage the administration said the official Since March when the Bush administration aroused a furor among environmental groups and European allies by announcing it was no longer interested in the Kyoto Protocol to curb climate change it has held a series of cabinetlevel seminars on climate change bringing in industry experts and a variety of government and outside scientists President Bush will need to have some outline of a new US climatechange policy by next month when he goes to Sweden for a summit with leaders of the European Union Were well aware of the calendar said one US official Tom Kuhn president of the Edison Electric Institute a trade association here that represents privatesector utilities said I think the Bush administration is definitely interested in things that they can do to address this issue He noted however that it is too early for a industrygovernment consensus on CO reduction Nobodys agreed upon specifics Bob Davis contributed to this article Metro Desk California

STAFF WRITERS Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO In a visit meant to underscore the Bush administrations heightened concern about the California electricity crisis Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham met Thursday with Gov Gray Davis in Sacramento to discuss federal energy conservation plans I think we have an approach that can result in significant savings Abraham told Davis The energy secretary said he was in California to gauge what we can do to add to what California is already doing The trip came after President Bush revealed plans for a series of conservation measures for federal buildings and military bases nationwide Those facilities in California account for of the states total energy use Today Abraham is scheduled to meet with federal officials in San Francisco to work out details of the nationwide program for more than federal buildings After meeting with Abraham at the White House earlier Thursday Bush said Were worried about blackouts that may occur this summer and we want to be a part of any solutions This administration is deeply concerned about California and its citizens Defending his response to the California crisis Bush said As I said from the very beginning of my administration well work to help California in any way we can Also Thursday Davis met with alternative energy producers in an attempt to persuade them to continue operations despite being owed more than billion by Californias private utilities Alternative energy producers including oil companies that generate electricity as a byproduct of their operations account for about of the electricity consumed in California Several have stopped producing after the utilities could no long afford to pay soaring prices for their power Davis assigned S David Freeman and former Assemblyman Richard Katz a Davis appointee to a state water board to be in charge of negotiations Davis said he hoped that the talks could be completed within a week And in a sign that major energy companies may get more involved in the California crisis Kenneth Lay CEO of the Houstonbased energy giant Enron Corp met Thursday with Davis Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg DSherman Oaks and Senate President Pro Tem John Burton DSan Francisco Meanwhile Bush on Thursday directed federal agencies to take appropriate actions to conserve energy use at their facilities In California such measures could include setting thermostats to degrees lowering lighting and turning off escalators during Stage and Stage power emergencies administration officials said Those occur when the states electricity reserves fall below and respectively and can trigger interruptions in service Bush did not set an energysaving target But the Defense Department one of the states single largest energy consumersusing about of peak demandpledged to reduce peak use by this summer and an additional by summer That would make available megawatts officials said enough to provide electricity to about homes during the summer The federal government accounts for about of total energy use across the country making it one of the nations largest energy consumers according to the Energy Department Bush also offered to make available to the state powergenerating units owned by the federal government But his efforts failed to mollify Democratic critics who renewed calls for the administration to impose price controls on wholesale electricity The generating companies are gouging California consumers while the president turns his back on us Sen Barbara Boxer DCalif said in a statement Rep Sam Farr DCarmel leader of the California Democratic congressional delegation sent a letter to Vice President Dick Cheney protesting Democrats exclusion from Cheneys meeting this week with California GOP lawmakers As we head into the high summer demand months it is unfortunate that you have decided to keep Democrats in the dark about the administrations plans to deal with the crisis Farr said Bushs conservation initiative comes after Cheney who is heading a task force on national energy policy was assailed by some critics for emphasizing production over conservation Conservation has got to be an integral part of making sure weve got a reasonable energy policy Bush said Thursday But what the vice president was saying is we cant conserve our way to energy independence nor can we conserve our way to having enough energy available Weve got to do both We must conserve but weve also got to find new sources of energy David M Nemtzow president of the Alliance to Save Energy called the directive an emergency answer to a longterm problem We need to fix the underlying problem by investing in energyefficient lighting cooling and controls he said We hope that this crisis will encourage the president to increase the budget for energy management rather than cut it by as previously proposed Political analysts said the effort was driven by concerns for not only electrons but also elections Its all about political conservation said Marshall Wittmann senior fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute Thomas E Mann senior fellow at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution agreed The administration has come to the view that just because they cant win California in a presidential election doesnt mean the Republican Party can afford to kiss off the largest state in the Union Analysts speculated that the administration came under pressure from California Republicans in Congress who worried about perceptions that the White House was not being aggressive enough in responding to the crisis As federal officials search for ways that California can avoid blackouts this summer a Woodland Hillsbased advocacy group More Power to You has suggested that the Navy hook its nuclearpowered ships to the state power grid to provide energy while in port The Navy has nuclearpowered aircraft carriers and submarines in San Diego and Washington state But Navy officials said it is not technologically feasible to use the nuclear reactors aboard the ships to provide power for the grid because most of that power goes directly to the propulsion systems Even to capture power not used for propulsion would require extensive construction on shore and retrofitting aboard ship officials said Also using ships to provide onshore power could disrupt training

sorted out DPC wants the negotiations to be short and decisive and if all the parties are willing an agreement wont be difficult he added The project has been mired in financial disputes since its main customer the Maharashtra State Electricity Board has failed to pay several of its bills Dabhol has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power Critics object to Dabhol charging rupees INR a kilowatthour for its power compared with INRKWh charged by other suppliers The state government has asked the committee to try to negotiate a revised agreement within a month The committees goal is to lower the power tariff and allow the sale of excess power to the federal government or its utilities A restructure of the DPCs stakeholding may also be on the agenda As reported the negotiating committees first meeting with the DPC management scheduled for Saturday has been postponed until GMT May at DPCs request DPC Must Run Plant At Full Capacity Pachauri Pachauri said that it is in DPCs interest to run its plant at full capacity and maximize sales Their sales wont be maximized unless the price is attractive They really need to bring down the cost to the consumer Our brief is very clear We have to sit down with them and identify a strategy by which the Dabhol project can be viable for everyone he said This will involve a complete financial engineering of the DPC Youd need to restructure the project debts and bring down the interest rates on debts to the current levels in the market he added The DPC project the largest single foreign investment in India has a debtequity ratio of Pachauri said Dabhol should agree to charging between INR and INRKWh This is a reasonable range and should be acceptable to everyone he said He said if Enron decided to pull out of

RENEGOTIATING COMMITTEE Asia Pulse c Copyright Asia Pulse PTE Ltd MUMBAI May Asia Pulse Enronpromoted Dabhol Power Company today said it had agreed to meet the Godbole committee as a matter of courtesy and this should in no manner be construed as an open offer from DPC to renegotiate the terms of the contract In a statement issued here tonight the US energy major made it clear that the purpose of the meeting with the nine member renegotiating committee was to hear out the panel and understand their thoughts and not present any proposals Furthermore the published terms of the Godbole report did not represent any acceptable basis for further discussions it said adding the company constantly maintained that it was open to a dialogue towards resolving issues Earlier the state government sources told PTI that a team of senior officials from Enron headquarters in Houston is slated to attend the first Godbole renegotiations committee meeting now to be held on May The panel deferred its meeting from May as in a formal communication DPC requested the state government for a suitable date other than the stipulated one they said However the multinational is yet to send a

the ministries of Finance Power and Law to firm up the federal governments stand on the crisis arising out of payment defaults by MSEB sources said adding that the Petroleum secretary is also likely to be included in the panel Sources said Enron appeared to be keen on solving the present impasse through negotiations judging from Corporation Chairman Kenneth Lays statement yesterday in Houston that the company had no plans to sell its stake in the billion Dabhol project PTI Enron ready to take part in PPA talk Nitin Yeshwantrao The Times of India Copyright C The Times of India Source World

Agreement PPA signed between the US power major and the state government Officials of Dabhol Power Company DPC a subsidiary of Enron alongwith their team of shareholders and lenders will arrive here on May for talks with the ninemember Godbole panel Though the DPC spokesperson was reluctant to give a confirmation a key Mantralaya official told The times of India that the team had expressed willingness for talks with the experts committee in a bid to end the imbroglio Enrons response is viewed as a welcome development to amicably resolve the controversy which had been raging for the last few weeks with the board of directors of Enron authorising its India MD K Wade Cline to serve a termination notice to MSEB The state government on its part too adopted a confrontational position by slapping a Rs crore rebate charge on DPC for defaulting on power supply However the sudden change of heart by the Enron management is largely attributed to the stand taken by its local lenders led by Industrial Development Bank of India IDBI which had recently opposed the move to pull out of the project This was in contradiction to the stand taken by the foreign lenders of the DPC who were in favour of slamming the brakes on disbursement of funds to DPC The Congressled Democratic Front government had publicly declared that it would impress upon the Enron management to renegotiate the PPA as scrapping the project would not be in the interest of both the parties Last week the state government constituted a ninemember panel of experts under former bureaucrat Madhav Godbole Godbole had written to the DPC management inviting it for talks to renegotiate the PPA on May For the delayed response from Enron the meeting has been rescheduled to May The issues which would be debated at the meeting include the separation of the LNG facility from the power plant renegotiating LNG supply and shipping agreements redefining the DPC tariff and to convert it into a twopart tariff The Godbole panel will bargain hard for removal of dollar denomination in the fixed charge component and to allow the Maharashtra government to sell power to third parties Godbole terms of reference not acceptable DPC Our Corporate Bureau Mumbai Business Standard Copyright c Business Standard The Enronpromoted Dabhol Power Company DPC has virtually ruled out negotiations with the Maharashtra governmentappointed Godbole committee to renegotiate the tariff for the power projectand perhaps set the stage for terminating the controversial billion power project In a statement released on late Thursday evening DPC said that it was prepared to meet the Godbole committee as a matter of courtesy but would not present any proposals Significantly the company said the published terms of reference of the Godbole report do not represent an acceptable basis for further discussions It also added This meeting should in no manner be construed as an open offer from DPC to renegotiate the terms of the contract The Godbole panels terms of reference are to bring down the tariff of the mw power project As a part of the agreement with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB DPC is planning to set up a milliontonne LNG facility of which only million tonne is meant for the power project The terms of reference of the Godbole panel include negotiations for delinking the LNG facility from the power plant The panel has also been armed with powers to negotiate on DPCs oftvoiced demand that it should be allowed to sell power not needed by MSEB to third parties A senior MSEB official said that We will hear out what they have to say However as long as they have armed themselves with powers to issue the termination notice nothing can be ruled out On April the DPC board at a meeting in London authorised Enron India MD Wade Cline to serve a termination notice on MSEB whenever he deemed fit Business Outlook Power failure The Independent London FOREIGN Copyright Independent Newspapers UK Limited SCOTTISHPOWER has belatedly acknowledged that electricity and water do not mix By the time the groups new chief executive Ian Russell reports his next set of results Southern Water should have safely floated off to a new owner That will leave the groups much vaunted multiutility strategy a distant if unhappy memory In fairness Mr Russell was the first at ScottishPower to grasp the nettle recognising that water customers were no more likely to buy their energy from the same place than electricity customers were to get their pensions and telephones from the same source The decision to focus on energy and energy alone has at least enabled ScottishPower to stop the rot in its core business Customer defections to rival suppliers which were running at an alarming rate six months ago have now all but stopped And shorn of trying to be all things to all households ScottishPower can exploit what it is good at The shake up in the UK power market has meant that generating assets now come cheap so we can expect to see ScottishPower adding to its portfolio south of the border It is also clearly interested in further US expansion having gained a bridgehead with the pounds bn acquisition of PacifiCorp on the West Coast The jury is still out on the PacifiCorp deal ScottishPower says cost savings are ahead of plan but then the first cuts including the previous managements fleet of company jets and helicopters are always the easiest ones More seriously PacifiCorp has been hit by the lethal combination of surging demand insufficient capacity and skyrocketing wholesale electricity prices which has left a pounds m hole in its revenues of which only a proportion can be recouped through higher domestic bills Mr Russell wants to build his way out of trouble Another megawatts of capacity are coming on stream this year in the US and more will follow But the real question is whether ScottishPower will ever achieve the necessary critical mass to stand toetotoe with the likes of Enron and EON PowerGen bought one UK supply business and one US utility then found it had run out of room to finance any further growth and capitulated to the Germans ScottishPower with pounds bn worth of debt around its neck is at a similar crossroads Mr Russell says it will just have to concentrate on doing what it does best In the hope that someone with deeper pockets notices ScottishPower survives the blackout SIMON BOWERS The Guardian Copyright C The Guardian Source World Reporter TM ScottishPower Britains largest electrical utility yesterday brushed aside US power and other problems and claimed that it was making considerable progress in reducing its exposure to shortages on the west coast of America Its US business incurred extra costs of almost pounds m in the year to March pounds m of which were caused by the breaking down of its Hunter generator plant in Utah The day closure forced the company to buy in power from other generators at a time when prices were high ScottishPower said that the Hunter plant was now repaired and had been supplying customers since last weekend The company plans to increase its generation capacity by MW or in this financial year A new plant in Gadsby Salt Lake City was the first to begin generation this week while five more are in construction The company said its profits would continue to be significantly hit by power shortages in the US for the next two months but increased generation capacity would reduce exposure by September For the year to March it posted underlying pretax profits of pounds m down from pounds m the previous year and in line with analysts forecasts However the City greeted news of a planned restructuring warmly with shares in ScottishPower closing p higher at p A spokesman said that the utility firm was confident of recovering most though not all of the pounds m costs incurred during the US power shortage through increased charges to customers The proposed increases are subject to court proceedings though most analysts consider ScottishPower to have a strong case Ian Russell who took over as chief executive in March said the balance between companys power generation and supply divisions had been out of kilter and added that in creased generation in the US was helping to redress that balance ScottishPower is thought also to be considering acquir ing US firm Enrons Portland plant quoted at around Dollars bn When we acquired PacifiCorp Scottish Powers US business we said it was a platform for further growth Mr Russell said Obviously Portland is right in our own back yard An acquisition could be funded by the proposed sale of its water business Southern Water which has proved ex pensive since the introduction of extra regulatory requirements The company said it had received several expressions of interest for the business ScottishPowers acquisition of Southern Water formed part of its disastrous attempt to establish the company as a multiutility provider supplying customers not only with power but with water fi nancial services through a joint venture with Royal Bank of Scotland and telecoms through its partly spunoff business Thus Yesterday Mr Russell who had backed these ambitious plans during his eight years at ScottishPower outlined a more modest vision for the future You have to limit what you take on he said Right now we are focusing on improving the businesses that we have got The now aborted plans to diversify across a host of utility services contributed to the loss of customers in the UK last year in ScottishPowers core business The figure has since stabilised at m Powergen the British utility that has agreed to a takeover by German power giant EON yesterday said that its pretax profits for the first three months had fallen to pounds m compared with pounds m the previous year Turnover was up thanks to expanding UK business and a three months contribution from its US acquisition LGE though regulatory price caps in Britain had held back earnings M and A April rough for merger mavens by Heidi Nasr The Daily Deal Copyright c The Deal LLC By months end deals were undone worth billion putting merger terminations on track to overtake the billion worth of deals canceled in the first quarter April is the cruelest month or so it is proving for mergerminded companies and their advisory teams On April three mergers worth billion were canceled By months end the pace had barely slowed as deals worth billion unraveled Merger terminations in the second quarter were on track to overtake the billion of the first quarter Yet the April drop compared to an average of a month in the first quarter points to a contrary trend Richard Hall a corporate partner with Cravath Swaine Moore said the decline in April was related to the overall count to date this year People are going into deals with a reoriented idea of the stock market levels Hall said A rising stock market hides a multiplicity of things Whatever is the stated reason it wouldnt surprise me if the basic problem was that people didnt want to do the deals any more with the stock market tanking The high dollar value of deals undone in April came from four big transactions Ariba Incs billion bid for Agile Software Corp FPL Group Incs billion offer for Entergy Corp Sierra Pacific Resources failed billion move for Enron Corps Portland General Electric division and financier Carl Icahns doomed million grab at Trans World Airlines Inc On the advisory side the biggest investment banking firms took the biggest hits In April it was Morgan Stanleys turn The investment bank led with only two deals canceled but worth billion the Agile deal and Entergys billion transaction the full value of which was billion including assumed debt JP Morgan came in second with two canceled deals worth billion with nearly all of that value coming from the FPLEntergy deal as well Hall said most of the failed April deals were simply too much of a stretch in a falling market What happened is that the bad times in the stock market late last year have shaken out the deals that were hard to justify without a frothing stock market he said Hall suggested that even companies where stock prices remained strong were wary of what could happen if the market continued to suffer With everyones stock price going into the slammer people went back and questioned the rationale for the deal he said The Ariba deal fell apart because of a steep drop in Aribas stock which has suffered as business executives cut back on software purchases The Ariba deal when first announced was worth billion when it broke up April it was worth only million The stock of Mountain View Calif based Ariba fell from a share to during that period The deal between Florida Power Light owner FPL Group Inc and New Orleans based Entergy highlighted just the opposite problem rising stock values in the energy sector When announced in late July the transaction was worth billion By the time it broke up April the booming utilities and energy sectors had lifted the price to billion But charges and countercharges of sloppy due diligence killed the merger The marriage would have created the largest US power distribution company In the end though FPL complained that Entergys suddenly lower financial projections destroyed our confidence in Entergys management Entergy

more reliable electricity to more of Indias one billion people India uses only percent the power per person the US does and the lack of reliable power is blamed for its chronic poverty By linking

boycott help lower Californias electricity bill By MICHAEL LIEDTKE AP Business Writer Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved SAN FRANCISCO AP Theres a limit to how much people will pay for most things in life If the cost scares off enough buyers prices eventually fall So what would happen if this textbook example from Economics were applied to Californias electricity crisis What if the state officials struggling to maintain energy supplies simply refused to buy power above a certain price and accepted more blackouts this summer The question would have been absurd just a few months ago and even now the notion seems surreal given the possible consequences Inviting even more blackouts inevitably would hurt businesses and frustrate consumers threatening to further depress Californias already slumping economy the sixth largest in the world But desperate times require drastic measures according to the economists lawmakers and activists who believe the state will be better off sitting in the dark than buying electricity at any price during a summer shortage likely to produce recurring blackouts anyway Its better to use blackouts and break the wholesale energy cartel than simply to suffer them said Michael Shames executive director of the Utility Consumer Action Network a San Diego watchdog group Refusing to buy enough power to keep the lights on would be like playing with fire counters Wells Fargo Co chief economist Sung Won Sohn Blackouts arent a just matter of inconvenience or being too hot or cold They cost businesses a lot of money Buying electricity at the last minute to meet the states power needs already has cost the California government billion in the past months The state energy bill for could reach billion in money otherwise spent on education public safety and health care Shames said Faced with the prospect of a significant budget deficit some lawmakers think its time for California to take a stand against the power wholesalers many of whom are based outside the state This Tuesday the state Senate Energy Committee will consider authorizing the state to refuse to buy power above certain prices Current law requires state electricity managers to avoid blackouts by buying all available power at any cost We have been over a barrel in so many ways said Sen Dede Alpert DCoronado who sponsored SBx Maybe theres a point in the market where we just say no and go with the planned blackout strategy instead Economists give the bill little chance of succeeding Its never going to happen Its not a viable option said University of California at Berkeley Professor Severin Borenstein one of the energy experts who have studied the idea The business lost during blackouts would mean more layoffs in a state already skittish over the technology downturn and the looming Hollywood writers strike economists say Other ripple effects include diminished gasoline supplies leading to even higher prices at the pump and distribution headaches that could leave store shelves bare And some consumers the elderly and the infirm for example need power at any price Without electricity Manteca resident Betty Jarzemkoski said she wouldnt be able to help her ailing husband to get out of his motorized bed at home It would be a real hardship for us said Jarzemkoski Im on a fixed income so I hope they can figure out something to bring down prices But we need power Despite such concerns the concept of a buyers boycott hasnt been flatly ruled out at least publicly by Gov Gray Davis as he struggles to reduce the states staggering electricity bill The state is spending as much as million per day to meet Californias electricity needs and the bleeding is sure to get worse When the summer heat increases demand and tightens supplies California might spend more than billion each week state officials estimate Extended blackouts pose an even greater cost economists say When Northern California suffered rolling blackouts for several hours Jan the economic losses totaled billion mostly from lost profits and wages estimated the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp Multiply that over several weeks across the entire state and it becomes apparent why it makes more sense for California to continue buying power at inflated prices even if leaves the state with deep debts and a ruined credit rating economists argue As it is California probably wont be able to round up enough power at any price on some days this summer making some blackouts a virtual certainty The blackouts will reduce the states economic output by billion to billion according to a study released last month by the Bay Area Economic Forum The resolve of the states politicians and ratepayers would be sorely tested for a boycott to succeed much in the way that labor strikes boil down to whether workers or management can withstand more financial pain Politicians arent going to willingly turn out the lights because politicians want to get reelected said Borenstein director of the University of Californias energy institute As soon as people start losing their jobs because the power is off the public will get tired of the blackouts real quick Still Californians might tolerate an increase in blackouts if they understand why the state chose to pursue such a drastic course said Stanford economics Professor Frank Wolak who heads the Independent System Operators market surveillance committee This isnt something you could do without an enormous public relations campaign he said The campaign would have to explain that the state had no other choice but to do this because federal power regulators arent doing their job and enforcing the law against unjust and unreasonable prices The largest outofstate generators are in such robust financial shape that it might take weeks before they would feel such pain from a California boycott that they would be forced to lower prices After making record profits

Limited BOMBAY May Reuters Indian lenders to US energy group Enron Corps gasfired power plant south of Bombay have appealed to the Indian government to help end the companys row with a stateowned electricity board over pricing and upaid bills The board of Enrons Indian unit Dabhol Power Co DPC has authorised management to stop selling power to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB if a bitter dispute over pricing and unpaid bills cannot be resolved In the past half year the MSEB has defaulted on bills for electricity supplied by Dabhol which operates the worlds largest gasfired plant on the west coast of India kilometres miles south of Bombay Indian financial institutions which contributed billion towards the project in loans are pressing the government to help end the crisis a source told Reuters We have asked the government for help We are awaiting their reply the source who is employed with a large financial institution said The domestic lenders to the project are Industrial Development Bank of India ICICI Ltd Industrial Finance Corporation of India Canara Bank and State Bank of India The Dabhol Power Company DPC owned percent by Enron last month took the major step of bailing out of the billion power project citing nonpayment of bills by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB The DPC boards move sparked widespread fears that Indias image as a safe destination for foreign direct investment would be damaged POWER STRUGGLE MSEB which is a stateowned utility has been a regular defaulter on payments to DPC saying that it finds the power too costly It has also backed out on its commitment to buy more power to be produced by the projects second phase which is to begin operations later this year Last month MSEB said it had paid Dabhol Power billion rupees million for electricity it bought in March But the payment only partially resolves the total overdue amount of billion rupees million which Enron has been unable to collect even after invoking guarantees issued by the government of Maharashtra Indias most industrialised state and the federal government The state utility still owes Enron payments for power purchases in December and January The Indian government has maintained that the contract must be renegotiated and has set up a committee to do so We are concerned and would like the renegotiations to happen fast the source added The dispute has raised fears that Enron could pull the plug on the project cease providing power to the local state electricity board and perhaps even sell the plant The plant is good

The Democratic National Committee issued the following today Dick Cheney began dropping hints this week as to what the Bush energy policy will look like and it is long on oil and short on conservation But something was missing from the coverage of Cheneys announcement not just who benefits from the Bush plan but whos writing it as well Photo cgibinprnhDCF Its hard to understate the influence big donors and highranking executives have with the Bush Administration Take Tom Kuhn for example one of the energy executives who came calling when Bush was thinking about actually following through on his pledge to limit carbon dioxide levels Kuhn a top Bush fundraiser also served on Bushs Energy Department transition advisory team and still enjoys access to the highest reaches of the Bush White House Not surprisingly then the Big Oil Bush Administrations energy policy could not make Bushs huge donors and the special interests in the energy business any happier Since the energy industrys problems are Bushs problems the first things on Bushs hit list are the environmental regulations that keep Big Energy in check and our country clean With an energy executive running around the West

EDT UK INTERVIEWInnogy starts trading power in mainland Europe By Stuart Penson Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited LONDON May Reuters British utility Innogy said on Thursday it had started trading wholesale electricity on the FrenchItalian border and was set to enter the German power market We have done some wholesale trading on the ItalyFrance border moving power from France to Italy and we are very close to doing some in Germany said director of trading Tony West in an interview with Reuters This year we will significantly increase our trading in mainland Europe we are discussing relationships with counterparties at the moment he added Innogy is building a European power trading team at its headquarters in Swindon southern England from where it already trades the UK gas and power markets FRANCE COULD BE KEY MARKET West said the company initially had expected the main focus of its European trading strategy to be Germany and the north west of the continent But the early signs were that France would also play a key role particularly as Innogy had gained access to capacity in the UKFrance undersea interconnector cable France has taken me by surprise It might be more important than we anticipated although there are clearly still issues about the speed of liberalisation said West A core of about eight companies regularly trade power in France including TXU Europe Enron and a trading alliance between Endesa and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter according to traders West said Innogy had so far concentrated on buying power in France not always from French companies and taking it to Italy via the cross border interconnector between the two countries Innogy had bought some of the megawatts available on the interconnector through recent auctions he said Its easy to trade through France the cost of taking power through to the border is minuscule although buying power in France and then selling it in France is a lot more difficult said West He said Innogy had signed grid balancing agreements with French transmission grid operator RTE Andy Duff managing director of generation and trading added France could become become important for Innogy on a retail level as well as a trading level depending on how effectively the UKFrance interconnector could be used The European market will be driven by the operation of interconnectors and transmission services as well as exchanges said Duff Innogy may look to trade on Germanys two power exchanges as well as that countrys burgeoning overthecounter market The company is in the process of signing standard trading agreements for Germany based on the terms devised by the industry group the European Federation of Energy Traders EFET FOCUS ON TRADING NOT ASSETS Duff said Innogys strategy in Europe was to focus on trading but not the acquisition of physical assets We are not going to lead with assets in Europe We will focus on trading servicestype arrangements extracting value from other companies assets Thats the main thrust of the business he said West said Innogys trading in mainland Europe would expand into natural gas as opportunities emerged The company already trades around the UKBelgium

improved their ability to pay back debt in recent weeks making their bonds a buy investors said Sentiment seems to be changing said Anna LeesJones who helps manage about billion pounds billion of corporate bonds at MG Investment Management Ive been building up my telecoms position all year British Telecoms year eurodenominated bonds sold in January yield about basis points more than government debt down from a record in March Contracts that pay out if the company goes bankrupt have also fallen in the past month according to Enron Corp which trades the derivatives Bond yields and bankruptcy derivatives have also declined for Deutsche Telekom and Royal KPN NV after the companies said they would sell assets to pay down debt that has pushed their credit ratings to record lows and weighed on their shares Phone companies sold billion of bonds last year to finance licenses and equipment for new mobile services British Telecom said yesterday it will sell its stakes in Japan Telecom Co and Spains Airtel SA to Vodafone Group for billion pounds British Telecom may also sell as much as billion pounds of shares to existing investors in a socalled rights offer according to Legal General Group Plc one of the companys shareholders Deutsche Telekom will sell assets such as cable television and a stake in Global One and Wind SpA Chief Financial Officer KarlGerhard Eick said last week KPN the biggest Dutch phone company said on March it plans to raise at least billion euros from asset sales to lower debt Those plans have helped shift investors perceptions of the companies creditworthiness money managers said Drastic Measures At the beginning of the year the market was assuming telecoms companies would be downgraded from singleA to triple B said Peter Harvey who helps run about billion at FC Management Drastic measures such as deeplydiscounted rights issues led investors to believe they will maintain their singleA status The gap or spread between British Telecoms sterling denominated bonds maturing in and UK fiveyear government bonds has narrowed basis points to basis points in the past month Spreads between Deutsche Telekoms percent five year euro bonds and German government debt narrowed basis points to in April Bankruptcy Swaps Fall Those shifts in sentiment are also reflected in Enrons bankruptcy swaps where prices have fallen in the past month said Simon Brooks a trader at Enron Enron prices the swaps using indexes that measure the probability of bankruptcy and the likely recovery rate in that event The price is expressed as a percentage above a benchmark interest rate such as the London interbank offered rate or Libor British Telecom bankruptcy swaps have declined to basis points from on April Enron said Bankruptcy swaps on Deutsche Telekom dropped to from while KPNs fell to from Over the same period France Telecom SAs declined to from and Telecom Italia SpAs fell to from British Telecoms bond yields may fall further relative to government debt analysts said They still offer higher yields than those of rival Vodafone Group Plc which has the same ratings though with a stable outlook While both companies have fiveyear eurodenominated bonds British Telecoms offer basis points more yield The rivals also both have bonds maturing in and Vodafones yield about basis points fewer If BT retains their rating their spreads should be probably to basis points narrower said Brian Venables head of credit strategy at WestLB Even though it has performed extremely well this year there is much greater potential for BTs debt Debt Reduction Target Both Moodys Investors Service which rates British Telecom A and Standard Poors which rates it A have those ratings on watch for further cuts after trimming them four rungs last year The companys asset sales to Vodafone are definitely positive in terms of the rating assessment said Aidan Fisher who rates British Telecom for Moodys In combination with the proceeds of a rights sale that would meet the target they set themselves this year thats quite a lot to achieve in a month period British Telecom has said it wants to slash its billion pounds of debt by a third and fend off further rating cuts Before companies such as British Telecom clarified their debtreduction plans the world and his wife were underweight telecom bonds in March said Harvey at FC The investment firm has since raised its holding of telecom bonds to neutral from underweight relative to its benchmark he said Bond yields were trading very much out of line to the rest of the market said LeesJones

analysis on Bloomberg BRITEL Corp GO for BTs bonds DT Corp GO for Deutsche Telekoms bonds UKCorporates warm to charms of credit derivatives By Tom Bergin Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited LONDON May Reuters European corporates are beginning to turn to credit derivatives among the more esoteric and complex of financial instruments to hedge the risk their debtors wont pay up market participants said on Thursday Credit derivatives are insurancelike tools that allow users to hedge the risk of default on a debt They are mainly used by banks hedge funds and insurance companies to hedge or gain exposure to the risk of a bond issuer defaulting Dealers said an environment of deteriorating credit quality and a growing awareness among corporates that credit derivatives offer certain advantages over established hedging tools was behind the increasing use of the instruments The market remains small with only around a dozen nonfinancial European corporates regularly using credit derivatives to manage their credit portfolio at present But market professionals predict they will one day become as commonplace in the corporate world as other hedging tools such as interest rate swaps and currency options We see corporate use as a big growth area for credit derivatives maybe the biggest says Bryan Seyfried vicepresident of Enron Credit in London Enron Credit grew out of the efforts of energy company Enron Corp to hedge its own credit risk portfolio and now specialises in marketing credit risk management solutions to other nonfinancial corporates Ralf Lierow director of credit derivatives at Siemens Financial Services in Munich said the ability to buy and sell in a liquid market means credit derivatives offer a flexibility that established tools like credit insurance and forfaiting guarantees lack Credit derivatives were are often cheaper than the alternatives too he added This is not a trading book thing For us the credit default swap is another tool for credit risk management Lierow said HELPS OPERATIONAL UNITS DO MORE BUSINESS Siemens Financial Services acts as the centralised risk portfolio management operation for companies within the Siemens electronics and industrial group It first started using credit derivatives in July Large companies like Siemens can have hundreds of millions of dollars in receivables on their books at any time The efficiency with which these companies manage the credit risk on their receivables has an impact on their day to day business The advantage for the operative area is that they can offload more receivables and do more business Lierow said Siemens uses credit default swaps the most liquid type of credit derivatives to hedge its portfolio of debtors on a constant basis As the balance of cash owed by each name fluctuates over time the company tries to match this with default swap positions Hence if a customer fails to pay Siemens can recoup the debt from the default swap seller Other companies use credit derivatives less frequently There are occasional corporate users that have secured oneoff requirements for balancesheet management aims or to strip out the credit risk of a commercial transaction said Walter Gontarek head of global credit products at RBC Dominion Securities By hedging a country or company risk which a corporate may not be comfortable in carrying a credit derivative can facilitate a project that may otherwise be unfeasible dealers said NOT PUT OFF BY BAD PRESS Corporates adoption of credit derivatives is in spite of the negative publicity the instruments have received in recent years A number of disputes over whether protection buyers could force banks to pay up on contracts have ended up in court However traders insist that subsequent work done on contract documentation minimises the risk of such disputes in future Nonetheless a very practical concern for corporates remains in that credit derivatives documentation was designed by bankers with sovereign and corporate bonds in mind The International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA standard documentation for credit default swaps allows for a payout in relation to defaults on bond payments but not on a private debtors failure to pay We use the ISDA framework but we need it redrafted in specific ways to fit our needs You cannot take a standard contract and trade on it if you want to hedge trade receivables Lierow said These amendments add to the cost of the credit derivative Another problem that corporates face is the complexity of credit derivatives There is little experience of the instruments which are barely a decade old in the corporate world Siemens had to get its expertise from the financial markets hiring Lierow from Bankgesellschaft Berlin Clive Banks UK head of derivatives sales to buyside clients at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney said much of the effort in marketing credit derivatives to corporates involves educating them about the products and the risks involved Its about explaining credit risk management and what kind of volatility and cost having credit risk introduces he said OUTLOOK PROMISING Yet some corporates are beginning to take full advantage of their new tool Lierow said that Siemens which currently only buys credit protection planned to start acting as a default swaps seller in the coming months He said selling would facilitate better matching of protection levels to actual exposures and would enable diversification of risk away from industry sectors where the companys activities are concentrated You could improve the portfolio mix by buying protection on automotives and selling protection on pharmaceuticals he said Allegheny Energy buys three power plants Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press

their forecast of the profitability of generating electricity in the US in and beyond because power prices are expected to drop more sharply than natural gas prices starting next year The analysts cut the profit margin in natural gasfired power in to a megawatthour from MWh a difference from their last forecast in February They lowered their power price index for by and for by Thursday in a published report Their forecast is based on forward markets for electricity and gas Gas prices are remaining strong for a much longer period of time while power prices drop off senior electricity industry analyst Raymond Niles said in a telephone conference with investors As a result stock prices for power producers such as AES Corp AES Mirant MIR Calpine Corp CPN and NRG Energy NRG could peak this summer in advance of strong third quarter earnings reports the Salomon report says Investors may still shy away from asset and investmentheavy power producers if realized prices begin to reflect the decreases in power prices now projected in the forward curve the report warns After this summer the stocks of energy companies that focus more on trading will regain momentum Salomon expects These energy merchant companies such as Enron Corp ENE Williams Cos WMB Duke Energy DUK and Dynegy DYN should be able to take advantage of higher trading volume and greater volatility in power markets in nonsummer months according to Salomon We expect annual trading volumes to grow industrywide between and on average during as the billion global energy commodity market continues to open the report predicts The overall electricity price trend is national according to Salomon The report titled Power Curve expects wholesale power prices to exceed last years by in the West and by on average in the eastern US including Texas But since their last forecast the analysts lowered their forward price curve for next year and beyond in of regional power pools Interestingly the exception to that is the

western US power prices the past six months has been from something weve never seen before in this industry political and credit risk Niles said in the conference Western merchant power suppliers are benefitting from the unholy mess in California Niles said but that wont last forever Whenever the debate tapers off and we have a resolution in sight that premium will slowly drain out of the western markets and bring down profitability for the group Niles said National calls for reregulation due to the California crisis could continue to hurt stock prices for the entire sector even though reregulation wont happen Further in so far as such calls discourage investment in generating plants transmission lines and gas pipelines they could also extend the current period of extremely high

Company and Dynegy Canada midstream assets An additional million of equity is expected to be sold in the coming months to pay down shortterm debt and complete the permanent financing The improvement in Rating Outlook primarily reflects NBPs demonstrated commitment to undertake conservative longterm financing and operating strategies Future acquisitions at the partnership level are expected to be financed debtequity so as to maintain financial flexibility and a stable credit profile Moreover management has shown a strong bias to minimize commodity price risk as it expands its nonregulated gas

of a government panel formed to renegotiate a troubled billion power project in western India But the willingness to meet the panel next week should not be construed as an offer to renegotiate the contract Dabhol Power Company DPC said in a statement As a matter of courtesy we have agreed to meet with them next week the DPC statement said Since the purpose of our meeting is to hear out the committee and understand their thoughts we will not present any proposal DPC said it had constantly maintained that it was open to maintaining a dialogue towards resolving issues But This meeting should in no manner be construed as an open offer from DPC to renegotiate the terms of the contract it added DPC and the government of the western state of Maharashtra have been locked in a payment battle for months with the states electricity board balking at paying Enron what it considers too high a rate for electricity At present Maharashtras State Electricity Board MSEB owes the DPC of which Enron is a percent stakeholder some million for power The Maharashtra government last week announced the formation of a panel of experts to renegotiate its contract with DPC and lower the cost of power sold to MSEB LARGEST FOREIGN INVESTMENT The Dabhol project the single largest foreign investment in India consists of two phases the alreadybuilt megawatt power plant and a MW plant that is expected to be finished this year Last week Dabhols board authorised the plants managing director to issue a preliminary notice of termination of service to MSEB The notice which has not been issued

investment missteps and unexpected disasters UK verticallyintegrated utility Scottish Power SPI is hoping a new strategy to streamline its businesses will signal a more focused period for the company But its got its work cut out While investors were cheered by news that its US Utahbased Hunter power plant is back online after a sixmonth outage that cost the company an estimated million uncertainty over its plans for its Southern Water unit and apparent ongoing commitment to lossmaking telecoms venture Thus are seen as muddling group focus It all adds up the lack of coherent strategy quite substantial downgrades and a whole host of noncore businesses that they dont have any natural management flair or expertise in said Brian Gallagher a senior fund manager at Londonbased Gartmore Investment Management which has GBP million of Scottish Power shares in its Global Utilities Fund We have a reasonably low opinion of the company The company said Thursday that its pretax profit before goodwill amortization and exceptional items for the fiscal year ending March fell to GBP million from GBP million a year ago Adjusted earnings per share declined to pence in the fiscal year from pence in The company acknowledged profits have been hit hard by the Hunter outage competition on wholesale and retail markets in the UK and strict price controls on its regulated infrastructure businesses Although the companys shares were trading at pence after the release of Thursdays earnings results up from pence Wednesday they are down more than from pence a year ago Executives say they are restructuring the business into three targeted divisions to capitalize on its traditional strengths in generation and power supply and infrastructure and to expand its overseas activities Weve now got a trading and commercial link between generation and supply and the first thing we are doing is putting emphasis on thaton growing earnings across that value chain Scottish Power Chief Executive Ian Russell told journalists in a conference call Thursday In the US we are focused on cost cutting and on acquiring new businesses Scottish Powers move away from a full multiutility profile begun last year with its partial disposal of Thus and its withdrawal from an Internet banking venture with the Royal Bank of Scotland toward a more narrowly focused energy business mimics a trend across the industry toward greater specialization The company is also considering selling Southern Water which would allow it to focus even more closely on its power business Yet analysts and investors say they are looking for more details of the companys overall growth strategy from Russell who took over as chief executive last month and other managers The toll from months of drift is evident they said Sales Of Southern Water Thus Seen Indeed despite its efforts to chart a new road Scottish Power appears to be reluctant to acknowledge the failure of some of its noncore ventures Russell said his company remains supportive of Thus which reported a fiscal year loss of GBP million this week and has no plans to exit its remaining stake in the company Similarly he said Scottish Power hasnt yet made a final decision to dispose of Southern Water which has cut costs under its Scottish parent but is increasingly unable to cover its capital expenditure although he said the company had received a number of offers from potential buyers Although he declined to identify any of the bidders Italian energy company Enel SpA ENI has confirmed its interest Industry sources said a prompt sale of the water unit looks likely with some bids already exceeding the GBP billion at which many analysts value the companys combined assets and debt Its unclear they said how Southern Water or Thus would fit into Scottish Powers new image Scottish Power sees itself as an international energy company a source familiar with the company said In a years time he added it would be unlikely that Southern Water and Thus would be part of the company Revenues from the sale of the water unit would also help Scottish Power pursue its US expansion without adding to its gearing levels analysts and investors said Russell declined to comment on reports Scottish Power is considering buying Enron Corps Oregonbased unit Portland General but admitted the company would be a logical geographical fit with Pacificorp Analysts said Scottish Powers plans for US growth is likely to be a key part of its energy strategy We like their US strategy where theyve leveraged expertise gained in the highly competitive UK market said Gareth LewisDavies head of utilities research at Lehman Brothers in London Closer to home competition and the trend toward increased specialization in the power industry may force Scottish Power to determine whether its business strength lies in asset management or retail and generation Strategic decisions need to be made and Im not sure if they are going to make them in the near term or not said Andrew Wright UK utilities analyst at UBS Warburg in London They are pretty much involved across the value chain and I think it remains to be seen which part of the value chain they

Missing link by Claire Poole The Daily Deal Copyright c The Deal LLC Buying Illinova gave Dynegy a key piece in a puzzle for trading energy anywhere anytime When Chuck Watson decided to take his company beyond natural gas trading he changed its name to Dynegy Inc and took as its logo a tangram a sevenpiece puzzle that can be assembled in thousands of ways Buying utility Illinova Corp in February gave him a piece for delivering such flexibility The Illinova acquisition was probably the most welltimed and best conceived buy of the year raves Jeremy Butler an analyst at Value Line Publishing Inc ReportCard DYNEGY ILLINOVA Stock Price A Profitability B Strategy A Braintrust B Culture B Competitive Position A Overall A Why Besides providing electricity to customers in a squaremile area in Illinois Decatur Illbased Illinova also had recently received regulatory approval to transfer its coal and gasfired generating plants megawatts in all to an unregulated subsidiary as part of the states deregulation of its electricity industry Thanks to soaring energy prices as well as to million to million in overall earnings estimated or achieved from optimizing Illinovas generation assets and improving its operating efficiencies Dynegy is seeing the effects of the deal on its bottom line Illinova has been extremely accretive to earnings said M Carol Coale an analyst at Prudential Securities in Houston Last year in fact Dynegys revenues nearly doubled to billion while its net earnings almost tripled to million or per diluted share as a result of the billion Illinova deal In the first quarter Dynegys net earnings jumped Investors have been amply rewarded Dynegys stock took off last year jumping to per share making it the second best performing stock in the Standard Poors Since the Illinova deal was announced June Dynegys stock has skyrocketed an astounding from to One of those happy investors is San Franciscobased oil and gas giant Chevron Corp which owns about of Dynegy For Watson who formed Dynegy in the late s out of Houston energy company NGS Corp where he was CEO and chairman the success of the Illinova deal underscores his quest to take power and trade it anywhere he wants anytime he wants at any price he wants Thats why he dubbed the company Dynegy a hybrid name taken by combining dynamic with energy If energy prices stay high and Dynegys traders continue to make winning bets analysts expect the companys net earnings per share to increase another this year to million or per share But Dynegy hasnt been immune to the power crisis afflicting California where it coowns four power plants with NRG Energy Inc of Minneapolis that generate megawatts of capacity Indeed since the crisis began Dynegys been defending itself against allegations that its overcharging for power The California situation has hurt Dynegy in other ways too On April for example its stock fell to after utility Pacific Gas Electric Co a unit of PGE Corp filed for bankruptcy Dynegy provides power to the California market as a wholesaler but not to PGE directly Dynegy has also been quibbling recently with another teetering California utility Sempra Energys San Diego Gas Electric which claimed April that Dynegy ordered it to shutter some of the facilities the utility sold it in but that it still operates because it doesnt think it will get paid Dynegy denied the charge Dynegy did not instruct SDGE to shut down generating units nor did we suggest that we would not make power available to creditworthy buyers Stephen W Bergstrom Dynegys president and COO wrote in a letter to SDGE Chairman and CEO Stephen Baum Dynegy has tried to downplay its exposure to the states power woes Its repeatedly pointed out to the press that its stake in the four power plants in California only represents of its total generating portfolio of megawatts or about Analysts however estimate Dynegys exposure in California could give its earnings a haircut of as much as this year Even so Dynegys stock has recovered to a recent Illinova has created some volatility to Dynegys stock because of the addition of power generation to its business Prudentials Coale said But overall its been a great deal While keeping most of Illinova management in place Dynegy made the companys chairman president and CEO Charles Bayless a nonexecutive director of the combined entity Dynegys also marketing and trading all of Illinovas megawatts of output Theyve streamlined power generation and traded around the assets while keeping the distribution business in a sweet spot said John Olson an analyst at Sanders Morris Harris in Houston Illinova meanwhile solved a big investorrelated problem for Dynegy Before the merger only of Dynegys shares were available to the public As part of the deal Watson convinced two of Dynegys strategic partners British Gas plc and Nova Chemicals to sell their combined stake for approximately million in cash and shares of a new convertible preferred stock It also issued million shares after the deal closed Those moves increased Dynegys float to more than of the shares outstanding which led money managers to flood in The companys market capitalization has since tripled to billion Operationally in its effort to focus on power generation trading and marketing Dynegy has been dumping some of its midstream assets such as processing plants and pipelines particularly in the midContinent region The idea now is to increase Dynegys socalled merchant power capacity or the electricity it sells wholesale to anyone who needs it to megawatts by through acquisitions new construction and asset management agreements As a result Watson has become what some are calling an acquisitions hound Hes already acquired some facilities On Jan Dynegy completed the purchase of two power plants in the Hudson River Valley the megawatt Roseton power plant in Newburgh NY and the megawatt Danskammer plant nearby from various area utilities for million Banc of America Securities llc advised Dynegy on both purchases Dynegy has had trouble picking up other power plants however Witness the deal it announced Nov to acquire megawatts worth of electricitygenerating assets in Nevada from Renobased Sierra Pacific Resources for million The deal got scotched April when Nevada regulators spooked by its nextdoor neighbors power crisis repealed the states electricity deregulation plan and put a moratorium on all power plant sales in the state Dynegy estimated the acquisition would have added cents per share to earnings Still since the Illinova merger the total generating capacity built or acquired by Dynegy now exceeds the total capacity added through the merger That includes megawatts of new natural gasfired generation facilities in Georgia Kentucky and Louisiana that are expected to begin commercial operation by June just in time for summer Like its crosstown rival Enron Corp Dynegy has also expanded via acquisitions into broadband telecommunications Dynegy also competes with Houstonbased Reliant Energy and Charlotte NCbased Duke Energy Both Enron and Dynegy see a big opportunity in broadband given that there are few other suppliers and that managing its movement is akin to whats involved with natural gas or electricity In August Dynegy announced it was acquiring Aurora Colobased Extant Inc a privately held developer of telecom solutions for million in cash and stock It completed the deal in September Then in November Dynegy announced it was acquiring privately held Iaxis Ltd a Londonbased telecom that owned and operated an mile fiberoptic network throughout Europe for almost million Dynegy completed the deal in March Dynegy is now developing a mile fiberoptic cable network in the US that it will link to Iaxis network in Europe It hopes its broadband unit which lost million in the first quarter will be profitable by the second half of Still Dynegy has differentiated itself as the antiEnron because among other things it continues to buy power plants rather than sell them Enron meanwhile has been trying to dump its hard assets such as Portland General Electric in Portland Ore Enron CEO Jeff Skilling a polished former McKinsey Co consultant just wants to be a gobetween and not just in energy but in broadband pulp and paper and metals while Dynegys Watson a scrappy former commodities

Asian Wall Street Journal Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Indias electricity shortage cant be solved without a new approach Indias power problem is back on the front burner because global generating giant Enron is threatening to turn off the lights at its Dhabol plant and walk away from a contract with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board In an effort to collect million owed for electricity already supplied the American company has invoked central government guarantees and declared a political force majeure but without much success So technically India is facing a sovereign default after which Enron would spend years battling through the courts to get compensation for the billion project Of course everyone knows thats not going to happen After more brinksmanship from both sides in the coming days they will have to sit down and negotiate a settlement Some of the problems with Enron are unique to that particular arrangement but in its basic outline the saga epitomizes a flawed attempt to deal with Indias power problem narrowly defined a shortage of generating capacity The country suffers constant blackouts due to a supply shortage of about and even more during times of peak demand In the early s the central government sought to solve this shortfall by opening the doors to private investors like Enron But this proved to be a mistake because power distribution is controlled by the state governments they run it as a system of wealth redistribution rather than a business California recently made the earthshattering discovery that a lack of market pricing at the consumer level leads to disaster But Indias state electricity boards or SEBs proved that long ago they have long been bankrupt and often default on payments to private generators As a result most of the big names in power have now pulled out of India Yes the country does need to worry about generating capacity Its estimated that in the next years demand will more than double with an additional megawatts needed but only half of that is likely to be built That could increase the shortfall during peak demand to a frightening prospect But the first order of business is to reform distribution There is a debate now about how to give state governments the right incentives to reform their SEBs These owe almost billion to central governmentowned generators and mines from whom they buy much of their power and coal In the recently passed budget New Delhi included a provision to forgive this debt as long as the state governments commit to either privatizing their SEBs or putting a floor on electricity prices Electricity meters would actually be installed to measure power usage but subsidies would still be allowed many customers wouldnt pay enough to cover the true cost of that power Still this would be big progress by Indian standards if it happened Many farmers currently get their power for free and over of power generated is stolen something the SEBs euphemistically call transmission and distribution losses As a result the electricity boards average a return on investment of negative However New Delhi is offering quite a big carrot and not much stick After a March meeting between the prime minister and state leaders Rajnath Singh the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh said quite clearly that he wouldnt hike energy charges for farmers The reason is obvious he faces elections next year and free power has become an entitlement that no politician lightly takes away Chief ministers will likely sign on to New Delhis plan in order to get debt relief but will backslide on implementation The only thing that will make the states serious about reform is a hard budget constraint which is the opposite of what the government is offering One way to provide it would be to hand over the centrally owned power generators and mines to the states They would then have to figure out how to keep the system running If they still chose not to charge for electricity they would have to find the money for power generation from other parts of their budgets Another reform some have suggested is to pass a national law which legalizes private power producers Some states allow companies to have their own captive power plants to maintain supply when the public grid fails But these are typically not permitted to sell their power outside of the parent company If larger plants that could supply several industrial firms were legalized the states would come under greater pressure to reform The private power suppliers could cherrypick the best customers those willing to pay for reliable power leaving the state to subsidize the freeloaders This would also have the benefit of quickly boosting the countrys power supply since captive plants already have about megawatts of unused capacity New Delhi is still trying to reform the countrys power market by fiat This means years of political wrangling while a growing economy is strangled by a shortage of electricity Instead the wouldbe reformers could let the power of the invisible hand push the state governments in the right direction INDIA Foreign funds plough money into Indian shares By Anurag Sood Reuters English

hunting for better returns in emerging Asia According to Lipper Asia Ltd a Reuters global funds data company investments by the biggest fund investors in Asia soared to billion in the JanuaryMarch

percent the IMF estimates percent the Asian Development Bank percent and the Indian central bank percent Ajit Ranade economist at ABN AMRO Bank says Indias large domestic economy resilient to the global slowdown could pull more funds into the country But a blizzard of stock market scandals which revealed share price manipulation has unnerved some foreign investors Weak regulation is a part of an emerging market risk but that does not rule out caution said an India strategist at a foreign brokerage Analysts say foreign fund flows are unlikely to be influenced much by events such as the Enron controversy where the US energy giant is threatening to pull out of its billion power project in the western Indian state of Maharashtra Enron is Indias single biggest foreign direct investor They say factors that influence foreign portfolio investments are different from the considerations that drive longer term direct investments The Indian governments decision to hike foreign funds

the coalition or supportive of the Democratic Front Government today thrashed its effort to renegotiate the power purchase agreement PPA with the Enron sponsored Dabhol Power Company The least cost option was to initiate a judicial probe into the deal which was replete with fraud and seek the scrapping of the project they said This view was made public after the parties Peasants and Workers Party the CPIM the Janata Dal Secular the Samajwadi Party and others met here and decided to press the demand at a meeting of the coordination committee of all parties including the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party on May Its scheduled meeting for today was put off as the Chief Minister Mr Vilasrao Deshmukh was away electioneering in the South These parties worried about the huge unpayable DPC bills had been demanding a probe under the Inquiries Commissions Act but today upped the ante saying we are convinced of fraud in the agreement with DPC The renegotiation Mr N D Patil who leads the Left grouping and heads the allparty coordination panel said is not what we want we dont want it at all He and Mr Prabhakar Sanzgiri CPIM said we no longer suspect it We are convinced of malfeasance Along with Mr Pradhyumna Kaul of the AntiEnron Campaign they told a press conference that the moment fraud was proved the PPA could be annulled and the huge liquidation penalties can be avoided The demand was to scrap the mw phase II take over the mw Phase I and initiate a probe The Godbole Committee report has provided enough grounds though Phase I was a reality and Phase II only an eventuality Even a small criminal probe would put any arbitration decision sought by the DPC on hold The lobby pressing for scrapping the PPA said an FIR against the Maharashtra State Electricity Board under the provisions of Section of the Electricity Supply Act would suffice as there were enough grounds to prove that the entity or persons concerned had played games at one time or the other It cited bloated projections of energy demand in Maharashtra provided by the MSEB to DPC to justify the work on the Phase II which is now under stress following lenders reluctance to provide funds till the issue is sorted out When asked why Mr Deshmukh preferred renegotiation and trimming of power tariff to a probe Mr Patil said that is his view For their part the parties would press for change

Sons Ltd KSL Source World Reporter TM Asia Intelligence Wire THIRUVANANTHAPURAM MAY The Maharashtra Chief Minister Mr Vilasrao Deshmukh today advised the State to handle the Enron issue cautiously and refrain from committing the mistakes made by his State Addressing a press conference here today Mr Deshmukh said the Maharashtra Government was treading carefully on the Enron issue and it hoped to renegotiate the power tariff with the US company Mr Deshmukhs observations assume significance in the context of the running controversy regarding the Kannur Power Project which had been denied permission by the LDF Government Mr Deshmukh said that Enron had written to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board that it was ready to renegotiate the power tariff provided the Government of India made a formal request He said the renegotiation would start as soon as the Union Government handed over the formal letter asking for a renegotiation Mr Deshmukh pointed out that the basic issue in Enrons Dabhol project was related to the power tariff The foreign exchange rate was fixed at Rs a dollar at the start of the project But now it had gone up to Rs a dollar thereby pushing the cost of power up He indicated that the renegotiations would focus on this aspect as well The Maharashtra Government had proposed renegotiation on the basis of the Godbole Commission recommendation He was confident that the Enron would agree to renegotiate the tariff in the interests of the Maharashtra Government and its own interests In reply to a question Mr Deshmukh said the Enron project had been a major drain on his States finances but it had overcome all problems by handling them very carefully He said the Maharashtra Government would extend all support to the UDF if it were to come to power to process the various parameters relating to the Kannur project so that it did not commit the same kind of mistake as Maharashtra did He however made it clear that his Government welcomed foreign direct investments but not at the cost of the States interests Mr Deshmukh attacked the Centre for not using the various options available under the WTO agreement to come out with a balanced importexport policy Asked for his comments on Mr Sharad Pawars statement that the NCP was considering joining the Peoples Front Mr Deshmukh made it very clear that his partys alliance with the NCP was confined to Maharashtra alone The alliance with the NCP is a post election affair as part of the attempts to unite all secular forces The Congress had fought the NCP and several other parties which are now part of the Congressled Government But the alliance had been formed in order to keep the BJPShiv Sena combine out he said Asked how his party could accept the NCP which had an alliance going with the BJP in Meghalaya Mr Deshmukh said the Congress NCP ties were confined to Maharashtra If the NCP creates any problems in Maharashtra the alliance would end he said Mr Deshmukh attacked the CPIMled LDF for its five year misrule which had left the State virtually bankrupt The credibility of the LDF is so low that the people would not vote for it The CPIMled Left parties would be defeated

of action on its LNG shipping deal for the Dabhol Power Company DPC The controversy surrounding the Enronpromoted DPC and the apprehension raised by the lenders to the LNG shipping project has made the three shipping promoters of Greenfield Shipping Company take stock of the situation A final view on the LNG shipping deal will depend on what Enron decides on the power project per se and not just

Unlike in the case of other ships LNG ships do not have a secondary market since these are acquired against specific longterm contracts In case of any eventuality Greenfield Shipping Company would

the tariff in its own interest as well as that of the State Government Our Bureau Let Enron Exit ADITYA CHATTERJEE POOJA KOTHARI The Times of India Copyright C The Times of India Source World Reporter TM FOR years Enron tried to woo Indian policymakers who couldnt seem to decide whether the Dabhol project was a good idea or not Today the boot is on the other foot and it seems to be pinching Enrons management is keen to stop investing in huge capitalintensive plants around the world In keeping with this strategy and no doubt exhausted by its ceaseless crisis management in India Enron is mulling a pullout But both the Centre and Maharashtra government want to renegotiate the power purchase agreement and have entrusted this responsibility to the Madhav Godbole panel Is Enron really as indispensable as the authorities seem to think it is Financially no Indeed if the only way to continue the project is on the present terms then it makes better sense to simply scrap it After all its better to amputate a gangrenous limb than to let the problem spread further A little arithmetic will make this amply clear If the Dabhol Power Company DPC does scrap its agreement with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board the Centre will have to cough up a sum of Rs crore a penalty amount of Rs crore for one years electricity bill and million as termination fees which works out to Rs crore at an assumed exchange rate of rupees to one dollar This is a onetime payment and the figure of Rs crore is corroborated by a recent statement by Union power secretary A K Basu Now if India were to continue with the present arrangement it would end up paying at least Rs crore per year for the next years to DPC On the other hand what would happen if the project were scrapped Well very simplistically India would save Rs crore Rs crore multiplied by years But things arent quite that simple because that money could earn interest while inflation would mean that Rs crore after years would not have the same value it would have today To get around this problem financial experts use a concept called net present value which discounts future earning streams as well as inflation to evaluate the attractiveness of a project If we use a discount rate of per cent then the value of the amount India would save by scrapping the Dabhol project works out to Rs crore over three times the amount India would have to pay today if the agreement with DPC is terminated Indian financial institutions FIs and banks which have lent money to DPC are actively lobbying to prevent such an eventuality But how badly would they be hit Well FIs led by Industrial Development Bank of India have provided loans of million and million in two phases This brings their total exposure to million Rs crore at an exchange rate of Besides State Bank of India also underwrote the maximum portion of a million crossborder loan and has an exposure of about million Rs crore Thus the cumulative exposure of Indian banks and FIs in DPC works out to around Rs crore However since only per cent of this amount has been disbursed so far the net exposure of Indian lenders amounts to Rs crore Since the Indian lenders are not covered by any counterguarantee their bottomline would be hit if Enron backs out The government being a majority stakeholder in most of these institutions would also be affected But even if all these loans are taken into account and added to the onetime payment of Rs crore the total cost to the government would be Rs crore still lower than Rs crore Thus the termination option will prove less costly for the nation than proceeding on the present terms What will happen to the assets and the plant did we hear you ask Well the government can sell it to private players and renegotiate the cost factor with them this time hopefully after doing a costbenefit analysis A sale of assets would also lessen the load on the government Who knows the government may actually manage to sell the ownership of DPC at a premium to another private sector player Of course fears have been raised that cancelling the project might cost us foreign direct investment since Enron is the biggest investor in India so far After all Brazil raised billion and China billion last year in comparison with Indias measly billion But theres another way of looking at the problem what does India really have to lose In short its a case of losing what you dont even have in the first place Many developing nations which were pushed into signing expensive power projects by multinationals have successfully renegotiated their contracts with no serious financial consequences Many nations simply did not have the money to pay for the inflated bills some refused to pay even after losing international arbitration awards while others like Costa Rica declared that the contracts signed with independent power producers like Enron have no legal status or are bad in law In July the Hungarian parliament declared that a PPA signed with multinational RWE was unconstitutional and void In August the Croatian government tore up a PPA signed between Enron and a previous government The contract was considered to be unaffordable and was allegedly signed in suspicious circumstances Enron subsequently abandoned the original agreement In September the Philippines took a decision to not renew financially crippling contracts with IPPs Controversy has accompanied the Dabhol project from the start In August the finance ministry had written to the power ministry that the size of the potential liability for a megawatt plant was around Rs crore per year The department of economic affairs had also warned that the risk of counterguarantees being invoked was not unreal given that state electricity bills had been defaulting in payments Caution was thrown to the winds then The least India can do now is ask for a renegotiation But does the Indian government have the courage to go eyeballtoeyeball with Enron and not blink first Scrapping the power purchase agreement involves a onetime payment of Rs crore However India would save over Rs crore by doing so There would be a net saving even after writing off FI loans to Dabhol Power Company IDBI whose life is it anyway Tamal Bandyopadhyay Business Standard Copyright c Business Standard On April a terse oneline announcement by the finance ministry gave the acting chairman and managing director of Industrial Development Bank of India IDBI S K Chakrabarti a threemonth extension The government was generous enough not to keep the CMD as well as the institution waiting till late evening which it normally does for the fax message from North Block But the acting IDBI chief may be asked to step down even in three weeks if the government is able to identify his successor He has been reappointed for a period of three months or till a regular CMD takes charge whichever is earlier Could there have been a better way to insult the countrys largest financial institution and its chief First the government planned to merge the Industrial Finance Corporation of India IFCI which is on the brink of collapse under the burden of ballooning nonperforming assets with IDBI to make them sink together Unable to push through the proposal in the face of stiff resistance put up by IDBI the government now appears to be keen on leading the countrys premier financial institution to its grave alone This not by giving an extension to the existing acting chief but by failing to identify his successor and thereby continuing the uncertainty at the top Nothing can move in an organisation when the CEO himself does not know how long he will survive Indias financial institutions have been repositioning themselves by going shortterm both on the assets as well as the liabilities sides But for that transformation to take effect they need leaders with a longterm tenure at the helm To understand this lets look at whats happening at ICICI another financial institution in the country that is breathing down on IDBIs neck and threatening to overtake it K V Kamath CEO and managing director of ICICI got a second fiveyear term seven days ahead of the expiry of his first term on March Once his second term is complete Kamath will have ended up running the show at ICICI for a decade ICICI does not only give its chief a long term to steer the ship but also grooms talent to take over the institution in due course Kamath was groomed by his predecessor N Vaghul In turn he is now grooming Nachiket Mor to succeed him Mor a former senior general manager of ICICI has recently been shifted to ICICI Bank as an executive director in charge of wholesale banking He is likely to be made the managing director of the bank when the present incumbent H N Sinor steps down next year Eventually he will take over the mantle from Kamath in by which time his stint at the bank will have given him enough operational experience in addition to his treasury management and other skills Given the circumstances IDBI is fighting a losing battle It will not be surprising if it goes the IFCI way with an uncertain leadership unable to steer a demoralised overstaffed ship becalmed by the apathetic bureaucracy of the North Block This is despite its tremendous brand value in project financing and widespread corporate relationships Carved out of the Reserve Bank of India by an Act of Parliament in IDBI has business relations with virtually every corporate house in India But that is not helping it tide over the crisis because the key to any financial intermediarys success at this juncture is how it handles its resources both currency as well as human In an ideal situation the cost of funds should be lower while the cost of human resources should be marketdriven In IDBIs case it is the reverse its cost of funds is on the higher side in the absence of aggressive treasury operations and it is not allowed to pay marketdriven salary to its employees The net result There has been an exodus of talent from IDBI and the institution is struggling to stay afloat just when recession has prompted corporations to cut back on their borrowings IDBIs sanctions and disbursements have been falling and nonperforming assets increasing It is sitting on piles of cash but finding deployment avenues hard to come by Two former chiefs of IDBI S H Khan and G P Gupta spent a large chunk of their tenure and energy pleading with the finance ministry to delink IDBIs salary structure from that of the Reserve Bank of India but without success Small wonder that Chakrabarti who became acting chairman on February for a threemonth term has singled out the low morale of the staff as his prime concern He wants to address this on a war footing The Centre has now successfully demoralised him by offering him another uncertain term Former finance minister Manmohan Singh accepted Khans argument on marketdriven package he reportedly wanted a pay scale for his employees that was higher ICICIs but could not do anything about it P Chidambaram repeated Singhs failure on this front and Yashwant Sinha too thinks the proposal is not worth considering because it will have a ripple effect in the industry For instance RBI employees will immediately demand their pound of flesh The finance ministry refuses to see the point that the countrys central bank is not a commercial organisation and does not have to compete with ICICI When three successive finance ministers failed to address IDBIs problems the institution went for soft options It ended up appointing three consultants for restructuring in six years First Booz Allen Hamilton in followed by M B Athreya in and finally Boston Consulting Group The third consultant BCG is yet to submit its report While Booz Allen Hamilton charted out the roadmap for diversification and suggested that the institution spread its wings overseas and tap new business opportunities the Athreya panel said it must convert itself into a bank and the governments stake should come down without delay Over the last few years the institution has been planning its conversion into a bank and blaming the economy for its indifferent performance even as ICICI has been going full steam with new initiatives ICICI Bank is also exploiting synergies with its parent to the hilt while IDBI Bank seems to be embarrassed about ackowledging its pedigree Its not that everything is great at ICICI Over the past few years the institution has lost some senior executives ISec managing director Kishore Chaukar left to join the Tata group ICICI senior general managers Anando Mukherji joined Enron and N J Subaiah took charge at Centurion Bank which he subsequently left The industry suspects the quality of ICICIs assets and is not comfortable with the scorching pace of growth Even the wellpaid ICICI executive cadres find the pace of work is too much to handle and complain of fatigue In private they hate the mad rush for excellence And yet there is a method in ICICIs madness It has trimmed the flab with two successive voluntary retirement schemes branched out into consumer loans in a big way and transformed treasury operations into an art The finance ministry would do well to explore the possibility of divesting the governments stake in IDBI to ICICI Instead of pumping in Rs crore as recapitalisation funds into IFCI it can simply let it die and sell its assets to other banks and financial institutions IDBIs bulk and the brand name in project financing would combine well with ICICIs growing retail presence and unbridled aggression The combination would be formidable enough to give the State Bank of India a run for its money Of course a whole lot of issues need to settled before the process takes off like trimming the flab in IDBI and delinking it from the RBI pay structure et al IDBI merging with ICICI may sound like an absurd dream but it is certainly a better option than merging IFCI with IDBI If Reliance is willing to bid for staterun oil majors HPCL and

fund manager comment By Andrew Callus LONDON May Reuters Scottish Power Plc announced a restructuring on Thursday reflecting plans for expansion in the United States and a tighter power sector focus in its British home market Britains largest power utility was reporting a decline in pretax profits before exceptional items and goodwill for the year to March to million pounds million from million a year ago But its shares rose percent to pence on some good news on costs and power generation in the United States where plant breakdown and high prices have hit earnings and investor sentiment Hunter a power station in Utah came back on line on Thursday after a day breakdown that cost million a day and helped deliver percent sector shareprice underperformance over the period New US plants are also coming on stream The profit figure was in line with analysts forecasts hit by UK regulation the Hunter outage and high US power prices They are keeping those costs down in the United States said one sector analyst There were stories out there they were going to be worse than they have been saying and it wasnt The breakdown at Hunter part of the UK groups PacifiCorp acquisition was unusually costly because power had to be bought in to replace the megawatts MW of lost capacity while power prices in the region were very high Even with Hunter back up PacifiCorp has more customer demand than plant to supply it so high wholesale prices will continue to be a problem The new structure unveiled on Thursday consists of a US division including PacifiCorps regulated and unregulated businesses a UK division covering generation and energy supply in Britain and a third infrastructure division which includes power systems and Southern Water in the UK and create a link between US and UK infrastructure businesses NEW US PLANT Chief Executive Ian Russell told reporters by telephone the Hunter power plant was now reconnected to the grid and would reach full operating capacity within a few days He was also upbeat about prospects for expanding generation in the United States where Scottish Power aims to have new plants with an extra MW or percent of current capacity on stream this year He announced that the first of these a MW plant at Gadsby in Salt Lake City Utah began producing on Thursday as well Another MW plant being built in Oregon will be onstream in a month or so Russell said PORTLAND Scottish Power confirmed it was still looking at the possible sale or refinancing of its Southern Water business in Britain and Russell said there had been a number of expressions of interest for the business worth about billion pounds but we are some way away from a conclusion He also said he was still looking for a further US acquisition but would not confirm reports he was in talks with US power trading group Enron Corp about buying its Portland Oregon power arm When we acquired PacifiCorp we said it was a platform for further growth obviously Portland is right in our own back yard he said Frankly were still very busy with PacifiCorp and for the time being thats what we are focused on Investors have been concerned about the groups dealmaking plans given the weak market for UK water infrastructure assets and volatility in the US market There is still a bit of deal risk there amidst worries they may sell Southern Water too cheaply said one fund manager who is underweight in the stock CEO Russell said the threeway restructuring would help the group sharpen our focus on improving shareholder value and capture opportunities in the US western power markets PacifiCorp contributed operating profit of million pounds after the impact of the Hunter outage compared to million pounds four month contribution a year earlier The groups million poundsayear threeyear UK cost saving plan was on track at the end of its first year Russell said Finance director David Nish expressed continuing support for Thus its spunoff startup telecoms business in which it still holds just over percent Thus is still lossmaking and has been struck by general investor disaffection with telecoms companies and concerns about how it would secure future funding But Nish said Scottish Power had no plans to do anything other than be supportive of the company additional reporting by Sonya Dowsett Distractions interfere with key growth questions Financial Times May By Andrew Taylor in London Cynics claim that Scottish Powers legal action launched this week to rewrite a long term electricity supply contract was more about distracting attention from the groups poor results than a realistic bid to cut costs This judgment is a little harsh Scottish Power would benefit considerably if it could renegotiate the deal that requires it to buy threequarters of Scotlands nuclear output The British Energy contract is worth obn bn in the next four years Shareholders could do with some distraction Scottish Power by its own admission has had a tough year which will be confirmed today when it publishes results for Ian Russell who took over as chief executive in March may even indulge in the new boys practice of including the cost of further forseeable bad news in the figures making any subsequent improvement appear greater His biggest problem will be to convince the City that he is capable of developing an effective strategy to change the groups direction now it has abandoned plans to become a multiutility The group no longer believes adequate returns can be earned from developing a growing range of products to sell to its more than m customers The investment required to develop national brands win new customers and retain old ones is too high in an increasingly competitive UK retail sector it says Mr Russell who as Scottish Powers former finance director was closely associated with the previous policy has already withdrawn from joint ventures with Royal Bank of Scotland to provide financial services and with Thus to provide telecommunications The group is also discussing the future of Southern Water its south of England utility which Enel the Italian statecontrolled energy group is interested in buying Crossselling electricity and gas to Southern Water customers let alone other products has been disappointing it admits The group plans to concentrate on developing its energy interests in the UK and US But these also have their difficulties Some of the biggest problems involve PacifiCorp bought months ago in a deal worth about obn including debt The price is looking more expensive following big rises in US electricity wholesale prices PacifiCorp has not been as badly affected as some US electricity groups But it has faced problems because of a power station breakdown in Utah that forced it to buy higher priced electricity from other generators to meet customer demand The failure of a MW generating unit at its Hunter power plant in November has cost the group m om a day since One piece of good news for shareholders today will be the timing of its return to service this month Another positive note is that PacifiCorp is negotiating higher retail prices with US state regulators to offset increased generation charges It also has about MW of its own new power plant due to start production this year In the UK the group is facing increased competition for retail electricity and gas sales particularly in the household market It has also had to absorb big price cuts imposed on its power distribution side by Ofgem the industry regulator The shares which fell p on Wednesday to p have fallen by more than per cent against the FTSE All Share Index since December when the PacifiCorp offer was announced So where does the group go from here It made its reputation in the s as a shrewd acquirer of UK utilities Southern Water for obn and Manweb the northwest of England electricity supplier for obn Effective cost cutting increased value particularly at Manweb The group was also one of the first electricity companies to string telecommunication lines along its electricity pylons The sale of a per cent stake in Thus which operates the telecoms network raised obn in Financing further UK and US acquisitions will be challenging Thus shares have fallen from p a year ago to p on Wednesday night Scottish Power has net debt of some obn with interest thinly covered three times by earnings before tax and interest It has been talking with Enron about buying Portland General its Oregonbased electricity utility The group might need to sell Southern to cover the purchase price of about bn including debt Buying in the UK may be even harder Scottish Power has been outbid recently for regional electricity suppliers by the deeper pockets of large continental European utilities

there with the Enrons and Reliant Energies of the world the other power generators that sell electricity to the utilities is a company called National Energy Group It has power plants in states and controls a natural gas pipeline to Northern California And its owned by PGE Corp the parent company of PGE Co Try to keep up with me here PGE Co is the company that has been so devastated by Californias energy deregulation debacle Its the company to which you are writing monthly checks that are beginning to resemble your mortgage payment It is the company that for decades was guaranteed a profit by the rates set by the states Public Utilities Commission It is the company that said it lost billions before it declared bankruptcy last month Poor PGE Co PGE Corp on the other hand is squatting in tall cotton as my daddy used to say The Corp received more than billion from the Co from according to a PUC audit But the Corp says it wouldnt be fair if it had to put any of that money back into the Co its ailing subsidiary It wants the people whose utility bills created that profit to pay higher bills now to bail out the Co so the Corp can avoid bankruptcy of its own Who is being unfair Meanwhile Southern California Edison also has been shipping its profits also more than billion at last report to its parent company while looking to the state for a bailout Now Gov Gray The Generator Davis wants the taxpayers of this state to pay billion to Southern California Edison for that utilitys transmission system But as far as I can tell Edisons rate payers already paid to build maintain and operate that system with rates set by the PUC that guaranteed that company a profit Now were being asked to buy what those ratepayers built I know that PGEs and Edisons accountants and

and scream Call Coursey at or email LNG carriage to be preserve of Indiaflag ships Lloyds List International Copyright C LLoyds List Source World Reporter TM In an attempt to cash in on the liquefied natural gas revolution Indias shipping ministry is pushing through a proposal to restrict the transportation of the gas only to companies registered in India and vessels carrying the Indian flag It would seem that the logic primarily is to ensure that Indian shipping does not get left behind in the LNG transportation race Until now the ministry has managed to get LNG ferried by energy companies on fob basis We hope that this new proposal would give further impetus to Indian bottoms says shipping secretary Michael Pinto We will do all we can to get approval from the committee of secretaries and the Cabinet Since some of the shipping contracts have already been finalised this proposal would only be made applicable to future contracts However shipping experts are extremely doubtful whether the proposal can be implemented The leading Indian shipping companies have neither the funds nor the expertise of carrying LNG and would need the assistance of foreign companies to make the ventures a success A foreign LNG carrier is not going to settle for a minority stake unless the Indian shipper is able to put up his share of the equity which would be quite a handful says Sudhir J Mulji executive vicechairman of Great Eastern Shipping Company and current president of the Indian National Shipowners Association The proposal really does not seem to be feasible For the moment just two major contracts have been signed both involving the stateowned Shipping Corporation of India SCI The first one involves SCI American power major Enron and Mitsui of Japan for the carriage of m tonnes of LNG per annum for Enrons MW mega power project at Dabhol near Ratnagiri in southern Maharashtra SCI had entered into this memorandum of understanding with MOL formerly Mitsui OSK Lines and Atlantic Commercial Finance which is an Enron affiliate However it is only a partner in the consortium with Enron holding a stake and Mitsui OSK the balance The gas will be ferried by the LNG Lakshmi brandnew cu m capacity vessel being constructed in Japan at the Mitsui Shipyard The contract is valid for years from the date of starting However the consortium is registered in the Cayman Islands which is a tax haven and the LNG vessel will carry the flag of Malta SCI has also secured the contract for carrying m tonnes per annum of LNG for the governmentowned pipeline company Petronet LNG The gas is to be ferried from RasGas of Qatar to the companys upcoming LNG terminal at Dahej in Gujarat A similar Petronet terminal but half the size of Dahej is coming up in Kochi Kerala state The transportation contract for this is to be decided later Two other major Indian shipowners who have taken a step towards LNG transportation are Great Eastern Shipping and Essar Shipping The former has formed a consortium with Indian Oil Corporation and Exmar while Essar has joined hands with Malaysia International Shipping Corporation MISC to form a joint venture dedicated to gas transportation The Dollars bn MISC the national shipping line of Malaysia is one of the worlds leading owners and operators of LNG tankers As a listed company on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange MISC has the stateowned petroleum and oil giant Petronas a Fortune company as its largest shareholder with a stake of Our memorandum of understanding has both companies holding an equal equity share in the joint venture said Essar Shippings chief executive Sanjay Mehta However at a later date we may both dilute our stakes equally in favour of a third strategic partner and continue to hold equal equity The final debtequity ratio for the acquisition of the LNG vessels will be decided by the management of the joint venture Shipping secretary Mr Pinto feels that there are many opportunities for Indian companies but is insistent that the tonnage be registered in India so that ancillary business activities in the sector are spurred We will try and secure tax benefits for the shipowners concerned since they badly need to gain the experience management and manpower training in a niche segment he said It would also help in Indian fleet expansion since tonnage has remained virtually stagnant for the last five yearsMichael

Lloyds List International Copyright C LLoyds List Source World Reporter TM With the Shipping Corporation of India taking a major stake in the Petronet LNG Indias maritime industries a high profile SHIRISH NADKARNI ON the final Thursday of March there was a celebration in NeDelhi involving the four members of the consortium that had bagged the Dollars m liquefied natural gas transportation contract of Petronet LNG It is the Japanese custom to celebrate an event like this and only the consortium members and their officials were invited to the function says KM Joseph director bulk carriers and tankers with the Shipping Corporation of India SCI which has a equity stake in the winning partnership The other members of the consortium are Japans MOL formerly Mitsui OSK Lines NYK Line and K Line and the contract involves ferrying m tonnes per annum of LNG from the Middle East to Petronet LNGs terminal at Dahej in Gujarat Two LNG carriers will be involved in the deal each capable of carrying cu m of gas and expected to cost Dollars m each The vessels are to be constructed at Daewoo Shipbuilding Yard in South Korea This was Indias second major LNG transportation deal and SCI the public sector shipping monolith which owns roughly half of the countrys oceangoing fleet of vessels has a stake in both of them as does MOL MOL is a professionally managed company whose cultural ethos is similar to ours says the goateebearded Prabhat Kumar Srivastava SCIs chairman and managing director Our relationship is based on total transparency and trust and we therefore feel comfortable with them There may well be more such tieups in the future The earlier deal was also sealed with MOL which has a stake in a joint venture named Greenfield Shipping Company GSC with US energy major Enron holding the remaining equity The three members will have joint ownership of the cu m LNG carrier LNG Lakshmi now under construction at the Mitsui Heavy Industries shipyard in Japan When ready the vessel will ferry m tpa of LNG from RasGas of Qatar to Enrons megapower facility at Dabhol near Ratnagiri in southern Maharashtra However to return to the Petronet deal The MOLSCI consortium won the coveted contract by quoting a charter hire rate of Dollars per day which was substantially lower than the bids of the two other competing consortia MISCEssar and ExmarGreat Eastern ShippingIndian Oil Corporation The Petronet LNG deal was the most prestigious and important LNG shipping project in the country and we were very keen to secure it says Mr Srivastava So we told our Japanese partners to quote the best possible rates A stake in the consortium formed with Enron may only be sufficient to net SCI a boardroom presence in GSC but its stake in the Petronet LNG shipping venture will allow the shipping major to exercise much more power on the latter companys board There are other issues involved If we had not emerged winners in Petronets shipping deal it would have done us a lot of harm for the other LNG shipping projects that are fast coming up in the country says Mr Srivastava We have already made tremendous headway in LNG shipping by being part of the Dabhol project and we were very keen to maintain the momentum Experts rate SCI as one of the best managed public sector enterprises and the bottom line of the company reinforces this feeling For the first nine months of the financial year SCI had a sales turnover of Rsbn Dollars m which was better than the Rsbn recorded for the corresponding nine months of the previous year The net profit zoomed from Rsm during the period April to December to Rsbn for the same nine months of While the results for the financial year ended March are still being compiled SCI officials place the sales turnover at around Rsbn and the net profit at just above the Rsbn mark While the companys tankers have produced spectacular results even the lossmaking liner division is expected to turn round the corner We have removed nearly of the nonperforming assets in the division and the balance will be chopped off in the fiscal year says Sudhir S Rangnekar director liner shipping division Recently international consultants Pricewaterhouse Coopers PwC carried out a SWOT analysis for SCI They suggested a corporate transformation of the company apart from going ahead with the information technology initiatives taken earlier The company went ahead and signed a memorandum of understanding with the ministry of shipping for the financial year whereby two new criteria will be used for judging the organisations performance A new criterion corporate transformation project implementation has been introduced in the MoU reflecting the emphasis that we are placing on enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations says Mr Rangnekar It also reflects our keenness to develop greater customer focus through process redesigning and improvement and adoption of the latest IT systems and applications

FERCS LATEST REFUND ORDERS Foster Electric Report c Copyright Foster Associates Inc About the same time that PGE Corp and Edison International announced combined writeoffs of nearly billion in unrecovered purchased power costs four major California energy suppliers reported increases ranging from percent to percent in firstquarter revenues Meanwhile FERC has issued new refund orders requiring many of these same generators to justify in overcharges during March PGE and Southern California Edison Cos WriteOffs After a long delay PGE and Edison during the middle of April confirmed what many knew was coming huge writeoffs for unrecovered purchased power costs during the year Edison announced that it was writing off billion in undercollected power costs for the year leaving the company with a billion loss for the year Edison chief John Bryson was hopeful nevertheless that a recent memorandum of understanding MOU his company signed with the state will allow Edison to recover some of those costs and help keep its Southern California Edison Co SoCal Edison affiliate out of bankruptcy Prompt implementation of the MOU can avoid the large costs of a SoCal Edison bankruptcy and make it possible for the company to restore its financial health and ability to maintain a reliable power grid said Bryson in a statement accompanying Edisons financial results Whether Brysons hope for quick implementation of the MOU will be realized is questionable Gov Gray Davis has been having a hard time finding the necessary legislative support for the proposal and to date has been unable even to find a legislator to sponsor a bill to implement the MOU Instead several state legislators are exploring alternatives including having the state buy SoCal Edisons transmission assets as well as the whole utility and turn it into a state power agency Edisons northern California neighbor PGE Corp reported a strong growth in revenues for led by the strong performance of its energy trading unit but that revenue growth was completely offset by the billion in losses incurred by its now bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric Co utility subsidiary While standard accounting rules required the utility to record a charge against earnings for unreimbursed wholesale and transition costs taking this charge does not diminish our conviction that the utility is entitled under law to recover these costs nor does it diminish our ongoing lawsuit in federal district court said PGE Corp chief Robert Glynn Generators FirstQuarter Revenue Reports In sharp contrast with PGEs and Edisons financial performance the parent companies of four of Californias largest generators reported large jumps in firstquarter revenues Enron Corp reported revenues of billion a whopping percent increase from a year earlier The company owns only a small amount of wind generation in California but sells power into the state through its Portland General Electric subsidiary and is an energy trader in the state Enrons commodity sales and service unit showed a percent increase in firstquarter earnings Reliant Energy Inc saw firstquarter earnings jump percent to billion The companys wholesale energy business

firstquarter revenues was Dynegy Inc Of the companys billion in revenues for the period its marketing and trading subsidiary realized million in earnings nearly double the in earnings reported a year earlier The parent company reported a percent jump in first quarter earnings over the previous year Duke Energy Corp announced a percent boost in firstquarter revenues to billion led by a percent

generators justify in combined power sales during March FERC staff set a MWh proxy clearing price for the month and then applied it to the hours of Stage power alerts that were declared during March in California The staffs proxy prices for January and February were MWh and MWh respectively The clearing prices fluctuations can be attributed to changes in operating costs including fuel and

The three wholesale sellers being questioned by the current refund order Dynegy Power Marketing Inc Mirant California Mirant Delta and Mirant Portrero and Williams Energy Services Corp were named in the previous orders as well Once again Dynegy led the pack with the largest amount of potential refunds for March nearly Combined with the previous two orders the company is on the hook for more than

its stake in the troubled billion Dabhol power project in western India the energy giants chairman said on Tuesday Were not in any discussion right now on selling the plant Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay told reporters after the companys annual meeting He did not say whether the company planned to sell the project in the future Enron has said in the past that it is unlikely to sell the plant until its payment disputes are resolved The lenders have sent the government of India a letter indicating the various things both the government of Maharashtra and the government of India need to do to come back into compliance with the contract The Houstonbased company and the government of the western state of Maharashtra have been locked in a payment battle for months with the states electricity board balking at paying Enron what it considers too high a rate for electricity The fight is also now with the national government of India which is contractually bound to cover defaulted payments by Maharashtra but has since changed that position At present Maharashtras State Electricity Board MSEB owes the Dabhol Power Plant of which Enron is a percent stakeholder some million for power The Dabhol project the single largest foreign investment in India consists of two phases the alreadybuilt megawatt power plant and a MW plant that is expected to be finished this year The second phase could be finished later if the payment issue remains unresolved Lay said The construction activity is being scaled down so it is impacting operations but its still not too late to stop any damage from that if the governments step up and honor the contracts he said Last week Dabhols board authorized the plants managing director to issue a preliminary notice of termination of service to MSEB The notice which has not been issued would be the first step for Enron to pull out of the project Both governments have a few more weeks to respond to the letter from the creditors Lay said Enron has already declared political force majeure a legal maneuver that allows a party to break a contract because of situations beyond their control such as coups or civil war India can illafford the very public fight Dabhol has become Lay said It sends a very bad signal to the rest of the world as to the difficulties of investing in India which is not what India needs right now Lay said India needs a lof of foreign investment if the country expects to build up its infrastructure he said Indian Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha on Monday told Reuters there is no need for us to think that because there is a problem with Enron it is necessarily going to act as a dampener to foreign direct investment Centre spikes plan to fix Enron Vinu Lal The Times of India Copyright C The Times of India Source World Reporter TM MUMBAI This one would have turned the table in favour of Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB only if the Centre had not opposed it Even before the Dabhol Power Company DPC board meeting that took place in London on April MSEB was readying with a termination notice intended to be slapped on Enron just in case But both the Union ministries of power and finance struck down MSEBs termination notice plan Sources confirmed that the board was legally advised to prepare a termination notice citing contractual default and that the MSEB chairman Vinay Bansal had duly signed the notice But in a marathon meeting between Union minister of power Suresh Prabhu and finance minister Yashwant Sinha on April MSEB officials were advised not to act in haste as it would precipitate the issue However sources added that if MSEB had slapped the notice first then the liquidated damages payable by the board would have been considerably less visavis the situation prevailing now where Enron has authorised the management to issue termination notice It is still not clear why the Centre spiked the boards plan to issue a termination notice since they had a valid point in issuing the same citing the penalty of Rs crore for misdeclaration of power If Enron cites nonpayment as a default they are also liable to face termination for defaulting by misdeclaring their plants capacity sources added Interestingly on April Mr Prabhu was advised by the Shiv Sena leader Bal Thackeray on the issue where he was requested not to dump the project on Maharashtra Since the project has sovereign guarantee of the Indian government it was mandatory that the Union ministries of finance and power to clear the proposal of issuing a termination notice The Cabinet subcommittee of the government of Maharashtra which met thrice recently had finalised the notice under Schedule of the power purchase agreement where the contracted party Enron has not obliged to PPA conditions citing the penalty issue When contacted Vinay Bansal refused to comment on the issue where the Centre scuttled MSEBs plans Legal sources associated with the board confirmed that under Section of the power purchase agreement MSEB had prepared a termination notice in retaliation to the drastic steps Enron was resorting to after payment defaults Indias Dabhol Pwr Co Naphtha Supply

Newswires Maharashtra Electricity Board unamused by new Enron demand Mahesh Vijapurkar The Hindu Copyright C Kasturi Sons Ltd KSL Source World Reporter TM Asia Intelligence Wire MUMBAI MAY The Enronsponsored Dabhol Power Company DPC appears to have adopted a twintrack approach threaten withdrawal by terminating the power purchase agreement PPA and simultaneously asking the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB to activate some features of the same accord Just days before its board of directors met in London and authorised the local management to decide when the PPA should be terminated the DPC asked the MSEB to operationalise the escrow agreement This sources said was a bid to confuse issues by sending contradictory signals An unamused MSEB shot off a letter saying the DPC by invoking its rights under a force majeure clause enabling it to suspend the PPA could not now ask for operationalising the escrow agreement It had to be either of the two options not both Under an amended and restated accord signed in March specific revenue collection centres of the MSEB were identified and collections from these would have to be lodged into a separate account in an identified bank the cover had to be times the monthly billing of the mw phase II Already the escrow for Phase I is operational with revenue circles of the MSEB committed to the DPC to meet its billing So far despite the controversy surrounding the bills they have not been encashed even once Curiously enough there had been according to well placed sources some informal even if feeble suggestions that the DPC may go slow on the activation of the second phase of the project which the State says does not come within its ability to digest the burden If so why did it want the escrow to be operationalised The MSEB had to point out following this demand that DPC could not have the cake and eat it too It could not invoke the force majeure clause then threaten to have the PPA terminated and at the same time ask for activation of this feature of the PPA At the London meeting of the Board this issue was neither listed nor discussed The escrow agreement as designed requires fresh infusion of funds through allocation of more regions of the MSEBs revenue network to meet shortfalls since the tariff is forever mounting or remains high and as the Godbole Committee pointed out a situation where virtually all of MSEBs revenues would be required to be escrowed to meet DPC payments That would leave little for wages and fuel let alone additional power purchase from any source and the Godbole panel wanted it cancelled Was it therefore a demand for operationalisation of the agreement to see what steps the MSEB and the Government would take PPA to be terminated in May Even if DPC decides to issue notice terminating the PPA it would not be earlier than midMay since IDBI which leads the consortium of Indian lenders guaranteeing the provisions made by the foreign lenders had asked for a threeweek freeze on any decision by the company IDBI which voted against authorising the local management to issue a notice terminating the PPA at its London meeting suggested that by that time the renegotiation could commence even as members of the consortium led by it were consulted given their very high exposures The IDBIled consortiums cover of around Rs crores to lenders abroad makes it a major player in the events that would unfold in the near future Its stand has been in sharp contrast to the overseas financiers who were dismayed at the nonpayment of bills by the MSEB in time the disputes and the controversy surrounding the project They are more inclined towards withdrawing from the project Close between and per cent of the debt on the billion project has come from foreign lenders The Indian component also leads to serious concerns as those of their foreign counterparts It is unlikely that the DPC board can take any decision independent of the wishes or inclinations of the lenders In effect the IDBI told the board Give us some time we will come back Now that the Madhav Godbole Committee has been expanded with the addition of the MSEB Chairman the State Government and also a nominee of the Union Finance Ministry negotiations could commence but the DPC which has adopted a blow hot blow cold attitude would have to respond The Maharashtra Chief Minister Mr Vilasrao Deshmukh has said that the moment the Centre nominates its representative we will write to the DPC to come for renegotiations The DPC response would indicate the course it wants to take terminate the deal or enter into talks Sinha hopes sanctions will be lifted soon Sridhar Krishnaswami The Hindu Copyright C Kasturi Sons Ltd KSL Source World Reporter TM Asia Intelligence Wire WASHINGTON MAY The Finance Minister Mr Yashwant Sinha has expressed confidence that the United States will lift the economic sanctions against India as quickly as possible Mr Sinha here for the last few days to attend the Spring Meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund had a number of bilateral meetings with his counterparts from around the world including the US Treasury Secretary Mr Paul ONeill The sanctions figured at the meeting with Mr ONeill but only at the latters instance He himself mentioned the issue of sanctions Mr Sinha told reporters at a press conference at the Indian embassy here Indias views have been very clear We have said from day one that the sanctions hurt US interests more than they hurt Indian interests and the fact that they are raising it with us is an indication of their keen desire to be able to do away with it as quickly as possible he said During a meeting here last month with Mr Jaswant Singh the Secretary of State Gen Colin Powell raised the issue Mr Sinha said his meeting with Mr ONeill reflected a substantial measure of the commitment and interest of the Republican administration and the desire to pursue the outlines of the Vision Statement as it related to economic and financial matters Mr ONeill accepted the invitation to visit India later this year to attend the second of a series of Cabinetlevel forum meetings first of which was held in Washington last year Mr Sinha said the Enron imbroglio did not figure in any of his meetings here but the subject of foreign direct investment did In fact the Minister had brought it with Mr ONeill and explained the present situation Mr ONeill was said to have been satisfied and Mr Sinha said the Enron problem was well understood here and the issue was not a dampener to foreign investment in India Concern at violence against minorities In another development the US Commission on international religious freedom has flayed India the BJP for the disturbing increase in violence against religious minorities and called on the Bush administration to take steps to pressure New Delhi into pursuing those responsible for violent acts against religious minorities The violence is especially troubling because it has coincided with the increase in political influence at the national and in some places the State level of the Sangh Parivar a collection of exclusivist Hindu nationalist groups of which the current ruling party the Bharatiya Janata Party is a part the Commission said in the section on India The Commission said its perception came from a number of sources including an extensive examination of the situation in India testimony from Indians of various religious hues experts academics and through personal interviews of victimised groups Its efforts to travel in an official capacity to India had been scuttled by the Government there the Commission said Apart from the friction between Muslims and Hindus and the contributing causes to these over the years the Commission said the violence against Christians increased dramatically in India since Particularly troubling are the continued reports that religious institutions are being pointedly desecrated by militant groups groups that several Christian leaders describe as associated with the Sangh Parivar it said Though the BJPled Government was not directly implicated many accused it of hesitating to prosecute persons or groups responsible in the process building a climate where extremists believed violence against religious minorities would go unpunished Though the worst of the extremist groups do not have official power they are closely aligned with those in power and are seen by human rights organisation to be deliberately encouraging an environment of increasing hostility towards religious minorities the Commission said It also mentioned the suggestion that the tension between the ruling BJP and members of the Sangh Parivar was partly behind the Governments reluctance to pursue the perpetrators of sectarian violence It also made suggestions to the Bush administration on how to deal with India first of them being that the administration should persistently press India to pursue perpetrators of violence against religious groups The Bush administration has been called upon to press New Delhi to oppose attempts to interfere with or prohibit ties between religious communities in India and any government efforts to regulate religious choice or conversion The US should pressure New Delhi to allow official visits from government agencies concerned with human rights including religious freedom and that New Delhi should also be asked to allow visits from non governmental human rights organisations and groups concerned with religious freedom The Commission also called on the US to allocate funds from its foreign assistance programmes for the promotion of education on religious tolerance and inclusiveness in India Neither State nor MSEB has

attention was drawn to the dispute between MSEB and Enron with both treatening to serve termination notices on each aother for breaking contractual agreements The government was of the view that the

world community also feels that there should be a new trade round We have our point of view with regard to the agenda for the new trade round I dont think we have diluted that stand or that position

for agricultural subsidies which is many times their total overseas development assistance Sinha said if the agricultural market could be opened to exports from developing countries including India they would benefit greatly So there is a general feeling that a new trade round should take place but on the basis of an understanding about what the agenda and the outcome will be That is something in regard to which developing countries will lay a very important role he said When asked that many people were of the view that the rupee may go down to to the US dollar Sinha said he had heard that

purchase agreement with Enron We agreed that we will nominate a Government of India representative on this negotiating team We also agreed that neither of the two sides Enron and Maharashtra should take any precipitate action and that we should negotiate and find a negotiated solution to this problem Sinha said He said I personally feel there is no reason for us to think that because there is

growth rates especially in the G economies US Japan EU Sinha told reporters after the close of the IMFs Spring meetings adding that a slowdown in the world economy will have an impact on our exports because these are the markets which are our major markets for exports But he said that the slowdown has not had as negative of an effect on India as it has had on other developing nations in Asia because the Indian economy is largely dependent on domestic demand While the slowdown in the world economy will also have some impact on India it may not be as large as other East Asian countries Sinha said his government will work to create an environment where fresh investment becomes attractive which he said would take place when the parliament passes his reformoriented budget for It passed the lower house on Wednesday Well have to encourage demand and to various measures which have been continuing from the past and which I have enumerated in this years budget he said adding that when demand picks up investment climate improves Domestic investment will also take place and so will foreign investment He said the dispute between Enron Corp and the government of Maharashtra state is not expected to cause foreign investors to think twice about investing in India I dont think because there is a problem with Enron it is necessarily going to act as a dampener to foreign direct investment he said Sinha said he raised the issue in an April bilateral meeting with Treasury Secretary Paul ONeill who appeared satisfied with Sinhas suggestion that Enron and the Maharashtra government should hold negotiations to ensure the continuation of the bln usd project which Enron is on the verge scrapping Sinha added that ONeill accepted his invitation to visit New Delhi at an unspecified date later this year as part of bilateral cabinet level forum initiated under President Bill Clinton in And he said that ONeill raised the issue of US sanctions against India which have been in place since India conducted nuclear tests in May Sinha said that he did not raise the issue with ONeill because our views have been clear Sanctions hurt US interests more than they hurt Indias interests He said that ONeills raising of the issue demonstrated a willingness on the part of the Bush administration to move toward lifting the sanctions cbdtr U Houston U Houston forum focuses on minority education UWire c Copyright UWire All Rights Reserved By Ken Fountain The Daily Cougar U Houston HOUSTON Increasing access to higher education for members of Houstons minority communities will be one of the most critical challenges facing the citys business and civic leaders said a panel of such leaders at a forum held Monday on the University of Houston campus Who Will Lead was the topic of the discussion for the Elizabeth D Rockwell Distinguished Leadership Forum which was cosponsored by the Bauer College of Business Rockwell is a winner of the UH Distinguished Alumna Award and is an executive of CIBC Oppenheimer Corp Demographic trends indicate that Texas and Houston will within a few years be comprised of a minoritymajority population meaning that the different minority groups combined will outnumber Caucasians The speakers agreed that ensuring young people from those backgrounds gain the education necessary to enter the increasingly hightech workforce is a matter of economic survival for the region Theres nothing more important in our community right now said Kenneth Lay chairman of the board of Enron the Houstonbased natural gas supply company that Fortune magazine has named the Worlds Most Innovative Company for the last six years Some progress is being made Some programs have been shown to be pretty effective Lay said They have significantly increased the graduation rates of minority members from high school the percentage going on to college and the percentage getting out of college Lay noted that less than percent of Hispanics in Texas graduate from college That is a time bomb waiting to blow us all up unless we solve that problem he said adding that a large number of Hispanics particularly male who drop out of high school eventually go to prison We spend about a year keeping them in prison but yet we cant spend maybe or a year trying to get them educated while theyre in high school he said John Mendelsohn president of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center concurred I think its very important that a city of this size have major university power to take the kids that do make it into college and educate them and move them into the leadership roles and join our workforce as leaders Mendelsohn said I applaud UH President Art Smiths attempts to bring the University of Houston to a higher level he added in reference to the Smith administrations advocating of the Texas Legislature to create a Texas Excellence Fund The fund would help the University achieve the status of a Tier I research university I think its critically important for the fourth largest city in the United States to have a school like this join the jewel we have of Rice University which is small and one of the very best in the world but cant produce the number of welleducated youngsters that this public university can Mendelsohn said Joseph Pratt a faculty member of the Bauer College of Business and executive director of the UH Scholars Community pointed out from the audience that the University has several such programs to encourage young people from minority communities to pursue higher education The Scholars Community is an oncampus program designed partially to increase retention of college students from underprivileged backgrounds The other members of the panel were Ben Love retired chairman and chief executive officer of Chase Bank of

Jackson Opens Houston Project Office Houston Chronicle InvestingMONEY A Slamarama For The New Economy Money Magazine Enron CEO Skilling Reinvents Company Unnerving Investors New York Enron CEO Skilling Reinvents Company Unnerving Investors Published in May issue of Bloomberg Markets Houston May Bloomberg A year ago Enron Corp CEO Jeffrey Skilling put up a banner in the lobby of his companys Houston office tower that welcomed visitors to The Worlds Leading Energy Company Skilling has now decided that the companys tag should be more ambitious The Worlds Leading Company the banner says today Its no shock that even the CEO isnt sure how to describe Enron for its a company swept by constant change In the s Skilling transformed a regulated gaspipeline company into the largest competitor in the business of trading energy mainly natural gas and electric power Now Skilling is pushing the company into Internet trading of all sorts of things paper products plastics metals fiberoptic bandwidth commercial credit pollution emission controls and even weather derivatives All of this morphing unnerves investors and some of the companys ventures may not be growing as fast as Enron says according to analysts and industry insiders They say the company is overstating the value of the new businesses its entering Some investors are increasingly concerned about a lack of clarity regarding where the company is going and what exactly it does now Owning Enron is a bit of a leap of faith said John Hancock Advisers Inc mutual fund manager Greg Phelps who invests billion in utility stocks and doesnt own any Enron I want to buy a stock where I have absolute certainty about the business and direction its headed Exuding Nervous Energy Skilling a man who exudes nervous energy and speaks in rapidfire bursts says his track record should ease investors concerns In the first quarter of Enrons profit from operations rose percent to million as revenue almost quadrupled to billion Enron shares have soared more than fold since the start of the decade four times the gain of the Standard Poors Index Enrons shares have dropped percent this year closing at on April Enron isnt merely a trading company Skilling says Its a logistics concern that ties together supply and demand for any given commodity and then figures out the most costefficient way to deliver that commodity to its destination Skilling who joined Enron in after leading McKinsey Cos energy and chemical consulting practices is unapologetic about moving the company in so many different directions In five years well be a different company he said Were not finished reinventing ourselves Billion in Assets Enron owns billion in assets including miles of pipeline that span states and transport percent of all of the natural gas consumed in the US The company owns an mile fiberoptic network in the US and controls power plants and other energy projects in countries on four continents Pinpointing what Enron does isnt easy Some businesses are simple to grasp In Enron won billion in energy management contracts from such giant corporations as OwensIllinois Inc and International Business Machines Corp The bulk of Enrons money percent of revenue and more than fourfifths of profit in came from wholesale energy operations and services what it calls the financialization of energy Cloaked in Secrecy This is largely the gas and electricity trading business it pioneered Enron cloaks the details of that business in secrecy citing competitive reasons which makes its breadandbutter activities as difficult to understand as the abstract Joan Miro lithograph that looms behind Skillings desk Enron keeps a lot of facts close to the vest said Andre Meade an analyst at Commerzbank Capital Markets That makes constructing earnings models a real challenge Even many of Enrons employees are shielded from the intricacies of Enrons business Signs in stairwells and on office walls forbid employees from freely moving around the building into trading rooms and other offlimits areas For now Wall Street is betting that behind closed doors Skilling and company will figure out how to extend Enrons trading prowess into fastgrowing industries Of the analysts who track Enron of them rate the stock a buy Enron traded at times earnings on April Thats exactly double the priceearnings ratio of for rival Duke Energy Corp the biggest US utility owner and energy trader and percent higher than the SP s April multiple GE of the New Economy Enron is uniquely positioned to be the GE of the new economy said Merrill Lynchs Donato Eassey This isnt a management team to bet against With analyst expectations so positive some longtime Enron holders are selling stock Especially with its high valuation the stocks risky and I dont see much upside said Timothy Ghriskey senior portfolio manager at Dreyfus Corp which controls funds that sold about million Enron shares at the end of If they fail to deliver for one reason or another things could get ugly Enron says its sales will swell to at least billion Analysts and investors say there are several trouble spots that could slow its growth Trading Broadband Bandwidth At a lateJanuary meeting in Houston Skilling told analysts and investors and dozens of others hooked in via the Web that Enrons biggest immediate opportunity is its plan to trade broadband bandwidth space on the fiberoptic networks that zip voices data and images around the planet Skilling says that based on discounted cash flow Enrons broadband business is worth billion or a share Thats a hefty valuation considering the business lost million on million in revenue in Enron has already hit a major roadblock in part of its broadband plan delivering videos over its own highspeed fiberoptic network In March Enron and Blockbuster Inc broke off a planned year venture to deliver movies and other content directly into customers homes Enron says Blockbuster didnt provide the quantity and quality of movies needed to deliver the service Enron and Blockbuster Disagree Blockbuster has a different take Blockbuster wanted out of the deal basically because we had a lack of confidence in Enron said Karen Raskopf Blockbusters vice president of corporate communications Specifically Blockbuster maintains that Enron couldnt handle technical issues such as protecting the copyright of the films that were to be distributed Maybe Enron could have worked those details out Raskopf said but we decided there were plenty of other carriers out there that were more sophisticated technically Several analysts and industry executives say that Enrons broadband business isnt worth anywhere near the valuation that Skilling talks about I dont want to be disrespectful because Enrons made remarkable progress from its days as a regulated pipeline said Leo Hindery Jr former CEO of Global Crossing Ltd which like Enron has a nationwide fiberoptic network But theyre way out of their league in the telecommunications business The valuation numbers they throw around are laughable theyll be a bit player at best California Energy Crisis The California energy crisis is likely to derail ongoing efforts to deregulate electricity markets in about states and could slow the opening of markets in several Asian and European countries as well analysts and consultants say eliminating future profit streams Not so says Skilling Deregulation is here to stay despite the problems in California he said adding Deregulation doesnt cause problems Stupid deregulation does Besides he said Enron merely trades and doesnt produce power in California The companys biggest business is in the wholesale market serving utilities and big industrial suppliers not retail customers Japan and Europe Are Opening Up Plus wholesale markets in Japan and Europe are rapidly opening up California wont nick us he said Critics charge that Enron which doesnt reveal its California financial results has been reaping huge profits during the crisis California has been a feeding frenzy with every trading company in the world feasting on it and Enron is the biggest and shrewdest of them all said Michael Shames executive director of the Utility Consumers Action Network Doubters wonder whether Enron can succeed in new businesses like fiber I dont think this industry is going to evolve as swiftly as Enron believes it will said Rod Woodward a telecom services industry analyst at consultancy Frost Sullivan Inc Skilling brushes off such skepticism People who throw stones at us dont keep me up at night he said I worry about whether the air conditioner will blow and knock out our computer servers Proving Naysayers Wrong Skilling contends hes proved the naysayers wrong once before In at the Colorado ski resort of Beaver Creek in his first presentation to energy analysts and investors Skilling outlined his plan to transform Enron from an asset based pipeline company into a trading company I basically laid out our trading model for them said Skilling The crowd yawned They didnt get it I was brilliant So we went out and proved we were right Skillings intensity permeates Enrons headquarters In the lobby about employees wait in line for a Starbucks coffee jolt at pm In the companys elevators TVs blare with messages to maximize revenue There arent many private offices in Enrons headquarters building most floors are open to encourage communication between workers Of the few walls that are around many are write and wash to encourage extemporaneous diagramming Skillings office is filled with toys a mini basketball hoop Koosh Ball rackets for his two sons Hes divorced and also has a daughter Mile Bicycle Ride Hes working himself into shape so this spring he can lead about employees on a mile bicycle ride from Austin to Houston for charity He says he hates his th floor office with its foot ceilings mahogany paneling and sweeping views of the nations fourthlargest city Its too quiet and too removed from any action he said So hes moving to the seventhfloor trading room of a story tower being built across the street from Enrons current headquarters Even on vacations Skilling doesnt kick back Every year the Pittsburgh native and Harvard Business School graduate takes important customers on a trip This isnt the sedate corporate golf outing to Augusta National or Pebble Beach Skilling leads such jaunts as a sevenday trek through the Australian outback and a thousandmile dirt bike expedition in Mexico If I cant bust up a couple bikes I dont really want to go he said GungHo Atmosphere That sort of gung ho atmosphere is a far cry from Enrons early days in when it was formed by the billion merger of InterNorth and Houston National Gas and became the largest naturalgas pipeline company in the US The industry was in the midst of great upheaval as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission began deregulating the gas pipeline business Until then the business could have been the poster boy for overregulation By federal law companies that owned pipelines could sell gas only to a handful of gas and electric utilities along their routes If there were a big freeze in Chicago or a heat wave in Atlanta for instance pipelines couldnt reroute their supply to meet demand In Chairman Kenneth Lay retained Skilling who was then a consultant at McKinsey to help spot opportunities as the business deregulated Government Loosens Rules Over the next few years as the government slowly loosened rules Skilling put together a plan to buy natural gas reserves and package them for sale at various prices to any number of customer specifications fixed prices floating prices with minimum and maximum caps guaranteed increases in supply if temperatures soared or plummeted Both Enron officials and outside analysts say that companies would save as much as percent of their cost of buying gas and Enron would profit from the trades and from packaging other lucrative services such as futures and swaps contracts that companies use to hedge their energy costs There was a lot of initial resistance said Skilling who joined Enron permanently in August Enron engineers had no concept about what we were trying to do They wanted to see the gas It was like trading pork bellies and asking to see the pigs Big Trading Floors With Lays backing Skilling pressed ahead He ripped out walls and built big trading floors to foster interaction At first the business grew slowly through phonebased trading desks In the early days wed sit on our hands a lot said Keith Hannon who was in Enrons power business and is now president and chief operating officer of Enrons broadband unit It took a while to find buyers and sellers and convince them what we could do In the late s Enron extended its gastrading business to electricity The US government encouraged competition in via the Energy Policy Act About half of the states began enacting laws or rules to let electricity generators compete for retail customers on price which opened the door for Enron to replicate its buyandsell gas trading model for electricity In April as Internet mania began sweeping through even oldline corporations John Sherriff head of Enrons European operations and Greg Whalley who was head trader at the time decided to take another look at using the Internet to boost trading volumes Torpedoes Previous Efforts Skilling had torpedoed previous online efforts fearing the complexity of trading energy online and concerned that opening up the system would expose Enron to too much risk So wellknown was his aversion to risk that the team of employees that created EnronOnline didnt even tell Skilling about it until two weeks before it was ready to launch It isnt a typical businesstobusiness exchange that brings buyers and sellers together to negotiate trades At EnronOnline which cost million to put together Enron does all of the buying and selling A trader with gas to market sells it to Enron which then finds a buyer for the fuel Enron either finds a way to deliver the gas or ships it through its own pipes That system enables Enron to skim a profit at every stage of the transaction buying selling and transporting the commodity in addition to packing on lucrative services such as swaps options and forwards Competitors say that energy buyers wont be satisfied with a site that allows them to buy from only one supplier EnronOnline A market is buyers sellers and speculators said Harvey Padewer president of Duke Energy Group which oversees Duke Energys nonutility business EnronOnline is Come buy from me and that isnt a market Skilling counters that Enrons results speak for themselves In its first full year of operation EnronOnline completed transactions with a total value of billion and its European business posted a threefold increase in power trading and a fourfold gain in gas trading Enrons trading and risk management business did especially well last year with revenue up percent and profit up percent because of wide price swings in California and other markets this past winter Those swings prompt energy buyers and sellers to try to lock in prices which Enron does with futures forwards and other financial instruments Volatility is what a trader like Enron thrives on said Merrill Lynchs Eassey Volatility Brings Competitors The volatility also brought in scores of competitors Last July six of Enrons biggest rivals including Duke and El Paso Energy Corp bought stakes in the Intercontinental Exchange as part of a plan to take business from EnronOnline Entergy Corp a New Orleans power company and Koch Industries Inc a closely held refiner and gas pipeline owner formed an energytrading venture in April Other companies including Bloomberg LP parent company of Bloomberg News and BayCorp Holdings Ltd owner of a New Hampshire utility have developed electronic marketplaces for energy Room For Everyone Skilling says theres room for everyone The total wholesale gas and power market in North America Europe and Japan will grow to trillion over the next several years from billion today according to Enron estimates Only about percent of that market has deregulated said Skilling So we still have more than half of the market to go I think a lot of that will be transacted online While the competition is catching up in the business that Enron pioneered the company is forging ahead into new opportunities such as weather People laugh when they hear about us and I hate that said Gene Taylor marketing director of Enrons weather risk management business Weve processed transactions since and have been profitable in each of the last three years Weather brokers at other companies say that Enrons claims sound reasonable This past autumn for example an executive at Bombardier Inc a Montreal aerospace company that also makes snowmobiles did an Internet search for weather trading and found Enron Bombardier was offering customers who bought new snowmobiles by October a refund if total snowfall in their area was less than half of the average of the prior three years Bombardier Example Enron collected money from Bombardier for each snowmobile sold and paid premiums in March so Bombardier could refund customers in lowsnowfall areas Enron has doubled to the size of its weather trading staff and has tripled to the number of meteorologists plucking talent from places like the Weather Channel to grow the business Taylor says his analysis of earnings reports reveals that the bottom lines of percent of all publicly traded companies are somehow affected by weather I see no reason why anyone should wear weather risk when they hedge away things like currency fluctuations Taylor said By bringing weather trading online we have a big opportunity to bring in hundreds of companies and process thousands of weather trades Other major players in this business include Southern Co Aquila Inc and Koch Energy Trading FiberOptic Broadband Opportunity Skilling says weather is a sideshow compared with Enrons biggest business opportunity fiberoptic broadband the hairthin glass tubing that transmits data at the speed of light Until now telecommunications carriers ATT and Level Communications Inc among them had sold bandwidth in fixedrate monthly contracts locking buyers into paying for capacity they didnt always need Enron can offer customers only as much bandwidth as they need and on short notice In October for example Enron signed a threeyear pact to manage the fiberoptic needs of i Technologies Inc a Dallasbased Internet software company Under the deal terms of which werent disclosed Enron will provide i with the capacity to link its headquarters with offices in Parsippany New Jersey Tokyo Brussels and Mumbai and Bangalore India on an asneeded basis Enron will use its own network as well as other unspecified network providers Where Profits Will Come From Skilling expects to profit in the broadband business in other ways as well He hopes Enrons trading system will sell more service through its own network which covers miles a small portion of the miles of fiber in the US He also expects to make money on the spread between buy and sell prices for the bandwidth as well as on related activities like risk management If successful Enron says the business could prove to be a gold mine The global broadband market will expand to as much as billion in from billion in Skilling says and he estimates it could generate billion in annual operating profits in five years Aggressive Estimates Those estimates are too aggressive several analysts consultants and industry executives say especially since at least different fiberoptic networks span North America alone and excess capacity has driven prices down about percent in a year I give them credit for trying to change the market but theyre spreading a lot of misinformation said Chris Lemmer executive director of broadband trading and risk management at rival Williams Communications Group Inc in Tulsa Oklahoma Lemmer says Skilling is looking at the entire broadband universe wholesale retail and residential services when he projects industry growth Its unlikely Lemmer charges that Enron can get a healthy slice of each of these disparate businesses Competitors like Lemmer say that Enron isnt being realistic and that its lack of expertise in the business is showing This isnt the gas business where you can stick pipe in the ground and leave it there for years said Lemmer In this business infrastructure continually changes and Enron seems to be ignoring that because it interferes with the propaganda theyre trying to spread Billion Value For Business So far the results dont seem to justify Skillings billion value for the business Though Enron says the number of broadband trading transactions in the first quarter of has risen to from just in the same period a year ago the business isnt yet profitable In the fourth quarter the broadband business reported a million loss on revenue of million They really have to post the numbers and show that the broadband business is going somewhere said Commerzbank analyst Meade Company History A glimpse at company history reveals that Enron doesnt always deliver what it promises A case in point is the companys October purchase of Wessex Water Plc of the UK for billion in cash and assumed debt Enron officials spoke of the water business in much the same way they now talk about broadband Its a fragmented international market worth billion a year and Enron could extend its expertise to this business and win a huge share of that market Lay tapped Enron vice chairman Rebecca Mark one of the most prominent women in US business as chairman and CEO of Azurix Corp an Enron subsidiary that was supposed to win projects to repair build or buy governmentowned water systems Mark cut a distinctive figure in the maledominated industry wearing spike heels and miniskirts as she traveled the globe negotiating complex energy projects Azurixs performance never matched expectations The company was spun off in an initial public offering at a share in June The stock rose to a high of in August and then plunged all the way down to by October Executive Quits That prevented Azurix from using its stock for acquisitions as the company had originally planned Mark quit in August and resigned from Enrons board An Azurix official says Mark plans to be a private investor in other water businesses In December Enron bought back Azurix for million or a share Skilling says hes learned lessons from Enrons struggles helping him create what he describes as the prototype stcentury corporation Its part of the learning curve he said I think our legacy will be that we proved you can build a business on intellectual capital not physical assets A selfdescribed business history buff Skilling argues that the era of corporate success based on gathering assets is over He says modern companies that try to emulate J P Morgans assembling of US Steel or Harold Geneens buying spree to form ITT are making a mistake Exxon Mobil Merger He cites in particular the creation of Exxon Mobil Corp and DaimlerBenz AGs crossborder acquisition of Chrysler Corp Mergers like ExxonMobil were good ideas to cut costs but theyll run out of opportunities and we wont he said Thats because he argues Enron isnt tied to its assets in the same way as a big integrated company If youre stuck with a whole bunch of concrete that you cant move youre in trouble he said Only about percent of Enrons billion in assets is tied up in plants and equipment and Skilling says hes willing to sell anything anytime Skilling says hed rather spend money retaining good people who are easily shifted around to new businesses Were brainpower intensive Skilling said When Enron created its broadband business for example it moved people mainly from Enrons energytrading units into the new division in the space of a week Skilling Not Shy Skilling doesnt shy away from voicing his opinions publicly In December he stunned the crowd at Arthur Andersen LLPs annual Energy Symposium in Houston by predicting the demise of Exxon Mobil an enterprise with billion in profit in and BP Amoco Plc the third largest publicly traded oil company He said that integrated oil companies ones that drill for oil and natural gas transport and refine it and sell the resulting fuels to consumers cant possibly be the lowcost provider and producer in all of their businesses The odds of that are zero he said We have a marketplace now that can provide virtual integration getting all those components quicker and cheaper These big companies will topple over from their own weight Soon after that speech Skilling was promoted to CEO as Lay stepped aside Lay who remains chairman said the best time for succession to occur was when the company is doing well Fine Judgments Theres always the danger that Skilling will misjudge which industries are ripe for Enrons Internet trading platform and that some of Enrons biggest initiatives like its muchballyhooed plans to shake up the broadband business wont meet their lofty expectations There are heightened competition and the possibility for unfavorable changes in the regulatory environment to worry about as well Skilling says his new job and the challenges that come with it wont change too much the way he operates Ill probably have to be a little less blunt he said For all of Enrons grand plans that might be this former pipeline companys biggest pipe dream Adam Levy in Atlanta or kl International World Watch Compiled by David I Oyama The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc THE

California Could it happen in your state this summer We put the question to Kenneth Lay chairman of Enron North Americas largest marketer of electricity and natural gas An early supporter of deregulation Lay has testified before Congress on numerous occasions advocating deregulation Q What went wrong in California A They didnt deregulate They tried to but they never got there California was halfway in between The wholesale market was deregulated but prices for customers were fixed and fixed in a way that competitors could not compete for customers without losing money Q Do you still think deregulation is a good idea A We think complete deregulation with consumer choice and competition will result in the lowest prices and the best alternatives for consumers including a lot of innovations Q Are there other deregulated states that may run into problems A The New England states arent nearly as competitive There is a good chance they will have problems this summer It could be a power crisis or their consumers will not end up with the benefits that customers in places like Pennsylvania get New York will probably be very tight But it moved very quickly after last summer to buy turbines I am told they will be generating electricity by this summer so New York well may avoid a serious problem Q Will we see blackouts in other states besides California this summer A The most vulnerable area this summer is California And because of that other western states will be vulnerable to problems The West is probably the most interconnected electricity reliability area in the country WIND ENERGY PROJECT Caribbean Update Copyright Gale Group Inc All rights reserved COPYRIGHT Caribbean Update Inc In early February the National Congress approved the decree for the Enron Wind

to be a drastic move even for powerhungry companies DG offers tantalizing possibilities to investors who can stomach the risk of an emerging technology One things for sure the energy shortage isnt going away The US power grid is facing an alarming supply and demand imbalance According to Scott Sitzer an economist at the Energy Information Administration US consumption of electricity increased at a percent annual rate between and while capacity rose just percent a year For the next years the agency forecasts demand growth of percent per year which will require at least megawatts of additional capacity to satisfy But only megawatts worth of power plants have been approved for construction over the next five years according to John Hammerschmidt portfolio manager and energy analyst at the topperforming mutual fund company Turner Investment Partners And supply isnt the only problem quality matters too Even a onesecond interruption in power can wreak havoc on data centers which require reliability The US baseload power grid can only offer three nines reliability or percent which means in one year youll be down an average of eight hours says Hammerschmidt The digital

dont think they will get hyped to ridiculous valuation levels he says because theyre competing against the cost of a kilowatthour One of his favorites is Active Power ACPW which is down percent from its week high Active is a leader in flywheel technology which Hammerschmidt sees as better than batteries for backup before a generator kicks in which can take seven or eight seconds Unlike batteries which need to be replaced flywheels need no maintenance and basically last forever he says He also likes the fact that Active has a marketing agreement with Caterpillar the No manufacturer of diesel generators So when you buy a generator from CAT theyll try to sell you a flywheel he explains The numbers are staggering when you look at all the generators now hooked up to batteries Hammerschmidt

Computer Systems NCS a leading Singaporeheadquartered systems and network integrator is scouting for Indian partners to form strategic alliances to address the booming Asian services market This initiative is expected to kickstart the Asian Ecosystem to steamroll the new economy In this connection NCS chief KC Lee is in India to meet prospective technology companies for such partnerships He will be meeting a few key infotech companies located in Bangalore New Delhi and Mumbai The objective of these strategic alliances will be to leverage the technical skills of the Indian companies and then showcasing the combined offerings in Singapore Lee said He says NCS a part of the reputed Singapore Telecom on its part will bring in its expertise in the areas of banking finance infrastructure and egovernance besides the marketing activities The idea is to use Singapore as a test care point and roll out the offerings that are made in India According to Lee India has a strong brand name in IT services and Singapore offers a better marketing platform and the proposed alliances offer a winwin situation to both Once this model is successful in Asia NCS plans to extend it to Europe and USA Nothing stops us from going to Europe and the US Lee added In India over the last twoandahalf years NCS has executed a few key projects in the areas of banking finance large corporates and service

to provide over b assistance to India Business Line The Hindu Copyright C Kasturi Sons Ltd KSL Source World Reporter TM Asia Intelligence Wire NEW DELHI April AFTER a spell of deceleration in lending following sanctions on India in the last couple of years in the last decade the Asian Development Bank ADB is all set to make good by extending over billion by way of its Country Assistance Programme to India in the next four years Disclosing this to newspersons here a senior official from the Manilabased regional development bank Mr Klaus Gerhaeusser said that for the current year the Banks lending to India would be of the order of billion including million to earthquake affected Gujarat to million for power sector in Madhya Pradesh and an additional million for private sector participation in infrastructure million for western corridor of the Prime Ministers Golden Quadrilateral highway project and million for West Bengals Metro Rail Project Mr Gerhaeusser said that from to India would get on average billion a year so that the mediumterm country assistance to India would reach billion beyond He said the ADB officials held intensive discussion with Indian Government officials both at the Centre and in the States during the last two weeks to wrap up the Banks Medium Term Lending Programme covering fouryear period He said the States under focus from the Banks point of view include Madhya Pradesh Gujarat and Kerala though during the current visit of the Bank mission exploratory talks were initiated with the newlyformed State Government of Chhattisgarh Besides these States other States keen on getting lending from the ADB include Tamil Nadu and Karnataka he said adding that the Bank enters into comprehensive dialogue with the respective States about the sector in which loan was being made so that reforms in this sector and overall macroeconomic position of the State could be thoroughly reviewed to make the future project lending to them sustainable Alongside he said the Bank discusses the tax reform expenditure management debt management including restructuring and reform of Stateowned enterprises He said one of the mandates of this mission is to discuss with State governments to what extent they are committed to undertake reforms and sustain them so as to qualify for continued future assistance from the Bank On the loan assistance programme he said traditionally the Bank supported power sector in States but now it was extended to the Centre also Discussions are ongoing with Power Finance Corporation to leverage reform in other reformminded States particularly given the importance of power sector in rural electrification he said Once the National Highway Development Programme NHDP is through by the Bank would start dialogue with the National Highway Authority of India NHAI for assisting the Golden Quadrilateral highway corridor programme in which the Bank could provide technical assistance in the form of capacity building for executing agency to prepare project preparation and logistics management Mr Gerhaeusser said He said the Banks offer of assistance for West Bengal in the highway corridor programme was mainly due to sub regional considerations given the strategic location of the State in that area Asked about whether the Enron tangle would have any effect on the Banks assistance to power sector lending programme in India Mr Gerhaeusser said that we do not like to comment on this issue The Government of Maharashtra and the Central Government were dealing with this He however said that the Bank undertakes power sector programme with the State Government concerned only after thoroughly satisfying itself with various parameters of the concerned States commitment to reform in the sector To a query about how much component of over billion loan assistance to India would comprise soft loans being extended from the Banks Asian Development Fund ADF Mr Kazu Sakai Programme Manager of India at ADB said that last year negotiations for fresh pledge to ADF were over Unfortunately both India and China were not to get this assistance So all the assistance for India would be from the Banks Ordinary Capital ResourcesOCR bearing market related interest To a specific query about the Banks commitment to extend loan for restructuring Indian Railways Mr Gerhaeusser clarified that the Expert Committee on Restructuring of Indian Railways had not completed its final report and there was a delay of one and a half year He said that assuming that report would be ready within the next few months it would be discussed thoroughly by all the people concerned and it is premature to talk about assistance in terms of big loans for restructuring Railways he added Our Bureau India Enron

cover citing financial constraints The project which is yet to achieve financial close is awaiting the Governments decision on the matter The Energy Review Committee headed by Dr Madhav Godbole had recommended in its interim report that all PPAs with IPPs be deferred and they also be made public Neither of the two IPPs Reliance Patalganga and Ispat Bhadravati are today contractually structured to meet the needs of intermediate and peaking load in either MSEB or Maharashtra allowing these IPPs to proceed as currently structured will only result in a problem similar to DPC re emerging in

Industrial Deve lopment Bank of India IDBI have asked the Centre to honour its counterguarantee and pay Rs crore for the December bill immediately to end the impasse over the billion Dabhol Power Company DPC project in Maharashtra In a letter to finance secretary Ajit Kumar despatched on Saturday the domestic lenders said the Centre must immediately step in to defuse the crisis and save them from posting irreparable losses if Enron walks out of the project This is possibly the first instance of onshore lenders moving the finance ministry to save a project This is unprecedented As a lastditch attempt the financial institutions are putting pressure on the Centre to save the project and their money said a source in the ministry The lenders suspect that DPC may eventually declare itself bankrupt as the company had hinted at roping in a bankruptcy lawyer at last weeks meeting in London against the backdrop of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB having defaulted on its payments The MSEBs payment of Rs crore under protest has not helped its cause much as DPC will classify the payment as a contingent liability in its balance sheet and may declare itself insolvent if MSEB continues to pay up this way pointed out an institutional source At the London meeting the bankruptcy law issue was raised even though DPC did not clearly spell out its future course of action on this The Indian lenders persuaded DPC not to go ahead with its proposal to terminate the power purchase agreement PPA against the stiff resistance of the foreign lenders But they have merely bought a threeweek reprieve In case the issues are not sorted out within three weeks the situation may worsen as the EPC contractor Bechtel may pull out if DPC fails to pay up The EPC contractor may serve the pull out notice in June The government must resolve these issues on a warfooting said another source familiar with developments The lenders letter to the finance ministry has listed a host of issues ranging from the delay in giving technical clearance for pollution control to DPC to honouring the Centres as well as the Maharashtra governments counterguarantees It has categorically said if the

Portlandsources By Andrew Callus Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited LONDON April Reuters Scottish Power Plc has held talks with Enron Corp about buying its Portland Oregonbased power utility Portland General a good geographic fit for the British groups existing US arm PacifiCorp industry sources said on Monday Its an obvious one and yes there have been discussions said one source speaking after the official breakdown last week of energy trader Enrons talks to sell Portland to Nevadabased utility Sierra Pacific Resources Corp PacifiCorp operates in six US states including Oregon and has its headquarters in Portland the state capital Utility holding company Sierra had been preparing to pay about billion for Portland and assume billion in debt But the deal ran into trouble as the US West Coast power crisis unfolded earlier this year and talks were officially called off last Thursday Reports that Britains biggest utility may step in for Portlands customer base and megawatts of generating capacity surfaced at the weekend in Britains Observer newspaper PacifiCorp faces its own power crisis fallout including million a day buyingin costs resulting from the failure of one of its generators The problems have helped depress Scottish Powers share price to a point where it now registers five percent UK sector underperformance over the past two years And analysts said Portland has a significant exposure to current high US power prices with only about megawatts of its own generating capacity but megawatts of peak demand to satisfy US utility acquisitions are always fraught with regulatory difficulties and in this case an additional regulatory complication is that Portland owns a decommissioning nuclear power station COST SAVING OPPORTUNITIES Nevertheless Scottish Power has said it intends to expand further in the US to exploit opportunities for merger cost savings in a highly fragmented market The groups English rival National Grid Group was able to take out percent of New England utility EUAs cost base by merging it with neighbouring power group NEES last year Its current weak share price and lack of cash after the PacifiCorp buy has hindered development but in March it made clear it might sell its UK water business Southern Water The proceeds are earmarked for acquisition purposes and industry sources have put the price sought at billion pounds billion Enel of Italy has confirmed an interest On Monday Scottish Power was tightlipped We do not comment on market speculation said a spokesman But analysts said Portland was an obvious choice given that it serves mainly the city of Portland and its surrounding area in the middle of one of PacifiCorps key markets Its hard to see them finding a better company to buy in terms of geographic fit and potential cost savings said Peter Atherton of Schroder Salomon Smith Barney who released a note last week pointing out the opportunity But he is wary of the move On the surface selling Southern Water and acquiring PGE Portland would appear attractive for SPW said the research note However the loss of Southern Waters predictable earnings profile would at least short term put pressure on earnings and dividend cover Scottish Power will face questions about Portland and Southern Water at its annual results presentations on Thursday this week Analysts predict pretax profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items of million pounds for the year to March down from million a year earlier Lower wholesale prices and regulatory price cuts on retail and distribution in the UK will more than offset the effect of a complete full year contribution from PacifiCorp which only fed into Scottish Powers profits for four months in the previous year A change to accounting practices which alters the way deferred taxation is treated will also account for about million pounds of the profit fall analysts said with higher telecoms losses also a factor

Himendra Kumar Dow Jones Newswires Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved SURVEY ENERGY UTILITY REVIEW US edges closer to new energy policy The recent power crisis in California has raised American awareness of the situation and the Bush administration seems to be more committed to the problem writes David Buchan Financial Times Apr By DAVID BUCHAN The US is striving towards some kind of energy policy When it eventually gets one the impact on the rest of the world will be considerable The longterm health of the worlds biggest economy depends on resolution of its domestic energy problems It also has an impact on the market and climate generally as the worlds biggest importer of oil and emitter of greenhouse gases The US is also home to the worlds largest private energy sector but also has a government prone to use energy as a weapon of foreign policy Through sanctions Washington has kept its own companies out of certain oilproducing countries and tried to keep others out too The only absolutely clear thing about the Bush administrations national energy policy is that it wants one That itself is a change Like governments in other industrialised countries Washington has steadily retreated from the energy sector It has moved from tight administration fixing natural gas prices for example to loose regulation shared in electricity with states and local governments The US has a Strategic Petroleum Reserve created after the s oil shocks and actually used it last year In extremis the US is also willing to go to war for oil as it showed in the Gulf conflict years ago But the general sentiment was that the marketplace would provide a solution and that energy problems like bad weather and economic cycles to which they are related could be relied on to fade away This complacency has been blown away by the California power crisis last years runup in world oil prices partly due to US gasoline and heating oil shortages and the arrival in the White House of a president and vicepresident with a background in Texan oil The Texasbased oil and gas industry tends to see the crisis as primarily one of supply In the past years according to the American Petroleum Institute US oil output has fallen from m barrels a day to m bd This is despite the fact that companies now drill deeper to an average of feet compared to feet in cheaper average well cost of Dollars compared with Dollars in real terms in and better a per cent success ratio compared with per cent in During the same period imports both crude and refined product have risen from m bd to just over m bd Natural gas output has not fallen off to the same degree But nor in a sense can it Environmental factors have driven up demand for gas faster than for oil Unlike oil it cannot be imported by sea except in the liquefied form that still accounts for only per cent of US gas consumption After the trough in activity companies spurred on by higher gas prices are now pressing every available rig into service for drilling in the US and Canada But they are having to run hard just to stay in place Mark Pappa Houstonbased chief executive of EOG formerly Enron Oil and Gas and now one of the most active drillers in North America explains why We are now getting gas out of the ground faster than we can find it because technology in accelerated extraction is advancing faster than in seismology he says As a result the rate at which production declines as a share of the base is rising from an average annual decline rate of per cent in to per cent in In the Gulf of Mexico decline rates can go up to per cent a year says Mr Pappa So the industry is eyeing federal land The federal government owns onethird of US land but where years ago per cent of this was available for drilling leases now only per cent is The industry hopes with reason that the Bush administration will reverse this trend However this will not be easy The administrations plan to open up part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ANWR to drilling has stirred strong opposition There are obstacles elsewhere too While the federal government owns and could in theory lease the entire outer continental shelf for drilling in practice California blocks exploitation of the Pacific while Florida even under Governor Jeb Bush the presidents brother insists on keeping the drillers away from both its coasts Companies would also like to make fuller use of what leases they have says John Seitz president of Anadarko His company currently North Americas most active driller on m acres is doubling operations in the Rockies but often has to dismantle rigs temporarily during the wildlife breeding and tourist seasons If access to resources is a problem so is the infrastructure to get it to market A new report produced jointly by the Baker Institute in Houston and the Council on Foreign Relations in New York points out how deregulation was initially smoothed by surplus capacities along the entire energy chain accumulated in the days of governmentsubsidised industry and falling demand The excess capacity existed in refineries tankers pipelines rigs and of course in power generation It allowed expansion of energy use without significantly affecting underlying costs says the report The surplus capacity has largely vanished under the impact of deregulation the accompanying price volatility that has made new investment risky and quite separate pressures from environmental regulation Take oil refineries Twenty years ago the US had of them with a combined capacity of m bd and overall utilisation of per cent Last year the country had refineries with a m bd capacity that was per cent used It is the same story with the nuclear reactors that provide per cent of US electricity Not a single new nuclear plant permit has been issued since the year of the Three Mile Island accident But reregulation is to blame for another handicap the proliferation of regional gasoline standards complicating refining and logistic problems and frequently causing local shortages and prices spikes A single standard was never going to suffice in so large a country with for instance milehigh Denver requiring a less volatile fuel than lowlying Houston But states and cities have increasingly used the Clean Air Act and the replacement of lead in fuel to demand that the oil companies provide them with differing cocktails of gasoline and diesel to suit their environmental needs The upshot is that the oil companies are now asked to provide more than different fuels California the northeast and the upper midwest require gasoline reformulated to be more oxygenated and less smelly Atlanta demands a lower sulphur and less evaporative fuel than the rest of Georgia and garages in the two halves of the city of St Louis because they are in two different states have to sell different types of gasoline The standards are unenforceable in the sense that drivers cannot be confined to a certain zone simply by virtue of what they carry in their tank But this has not lessened local authorities enthusiasm for them In this area as in that of electricity infrastructure it is hard to see what the Bush administration can do to prevent such balkanisation without riding roughshod over states rights Equally difficult but even more pressing is to forge a single electricity transmission network to carry the huge amounts of power that are being traded across the country by commodity energy brokers such as Enron and Dynegy The federal authorities have slender means at their disposal While it has sole authority over the natural gas trade and network the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Ferc has to share supervision of electricity trade with states which themselves have sole power to rule on the siting of power plants and lines Deregulation has made the latter task harder In the days of local monopolies people knew that at least a power plant however ugly in their backyard would be serving their needs But in todays world of competitive longdistance power trading the plant could be lighting cooling or heating the other end of the country Nonetheless Ferc realises it has to be more of a bully to preach the right model for US power even if that means treading on state sensibilities We were overly deferential to Californias rules and market design says one Ferc official US companies hope President Bush will give them a freer run at foreign as well as domestic oil The US has trade and investment bans on eight countries of which Iraq Iran and Libya are Opec members and a fourth Sudan a growing oil producer The upshot according to Cambridge Energy Research Associates may be to reduce the production capacity of the three sanctioned Opec producers by m bd That in turn makes the world market tighter than it would otherwise have been to the obvious detriment of such a big oil importer as the US US companies clearly fret more at the unilateral sanctions on Iran and Libya than the multilateral United Nations embargo on Iraq which also restricts their competitors It may also be time for the US to recognise not only how outdated the notion of energy independence at home is but also the wisdom of cloaking its foreign energy policy in a more multilateral guise The Baker InstituteCouncil on Foreign Relations report suggests ways this might be done The US could take a less confrontational line towards Opec on prices set Russia an example by signing the European energy charter treaty that governs energy trade and transit and adopt a hemispheric approach to energy relations with Canada and Mexico Copyright The Financial Times Limited SURVEY ENERGY UTILITY REVIEW Move to build a stronger base on alternative cleaner power ECONOMICS OF ENERGY SUPPLY RENEWABLE POWER by Matthew Jones Recent figures indicate that up to there was more than MW of installed windpower capacity around the world the majority of which was in Europe and mainly in Germany Denmark and Spain Financial Times Apr By MATTHEW JONES Earlier this year Shea Homes the tenth largest house builder in the US struck a deal with solar cell manufacturer AstroPower to make solar power a standard feature in new homes in San Diego California With a shortage of electricity in California and rolling blackouts sweeping the state Shea had spotted a market for environmentally friendly homes in which the owners could take control of their own power generation This relatively modest move which Shea hopes to extend to a further homes in the next months is one indication of the way in which new energy technologies are becoming more mainstream In the US Europe and to a lesser extent Asia manufacturers of solar cells wind turbines fuel cells and microturbines are reporting booming sales AstroPower has already sold all of the cells it can make for this year Robin Batchelor manager of Merrill Lynch Investment Managers new energy technology fund says the growth is being driven by environmental pressure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and concerns about power quality and reliability from centralised generation systems in some parts of the world The California power crisis has raised awareness of some of these technologies and at the same time has allowed manufacturers to demonstrate that they work On top of this many countries around the world are offering fiscal incentives to build green power plants and improvements in the technology are bringing the costs more into line with conventional power generation Windpower is leading the way so far The most uptodate industry figures show more than MW of installed capacity around the world at the end of Of this per cent was installed in Europe mainly in Germany Denmark and Spain per cent in North America and the remaining per cent largely in the AsiaPacific region Photovoltaic or solar cells are further behind because of relatively higher equipment costs About MW of capacity had been installed at the end of in countries belonging to the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development A recent report by Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein the German banking group forecasts that both wind and solar power generating capacity will grow by per cent a year in the next five years to MW and MW respectively Longer term figures produced by Royal DutchShell the AngloDutch oil group show solar power overtaking wind in and becoming the worlds overall largest source of electricity by Fuel cells which convert hydrogen to electricity heat and water vapour through an electrochemical reaction are still at a relatively embryonic stage but are developing rapidly Manufacturers such as Ballard Power Systems of Canada and Fuel Cell Energy FCE of the US have in recent months begun to make the transition from pilot projects to first commercial sales Ballard which specialises in fuel cells for the transportation market has signed an agreement to supply cells for public buses in European cities FCE produces larger fuel cells for the stationary power market It is expected this summer to win a contract to supply fuel cells to Connecticut under an agreement with Enron the US energy group The pace of deployment of fuel cells into the transport market is currently uncertain and will depend on the motor and oil industries agreeing what fuel to use as a source of hydrogen The ideal solution is to use pure hydrogen gas but oil companies argue that this requires a lot of storage capacity and would mean building a new fuel infrastructure around the world at vast expense Other solutions are being developed including the use of methanol or ordinary petrol from which hydrogen can be produced onboard the vehicle via a reformer Industry observers are more confident about the market for stationary fuel cells According to a study published in March by Allied Business Intelligence an independent US researcher global electricity generating capacity from fuel cells will grow from just MW in to MW by The countries expected to take the lead are the US Germany and Japan Microturbines are seen as an intermediary step towards fuel cells allowing efficient smallscale generation of electricity from a variety of more traditional fuels including natural gas propane diesel kerosene and methanebased gases sourced from landfill or wastewater sites Growth in sales has accelerated in the last year driven in large part by the California energy crisis Capstone one of the leading manufacturers saw its microturbine sales more than triple last year and has a backlog of orders for Some in the energy industry believe the surge in the use of new energy technologies may now be under threat following the refusal by the US to ratify the Kyoto agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions Recent policy statements by the new Bush administration indicate it is more focused on developing fossil fuels and solving the immediate energy shortages than increasing the use of alternative energy forms However the European Union appears to be gathering enough support to push ahead with the agreement without the US In spite of his stand against Kyoto president Bush has also agreed to extend fiscal incentives for electricity generated from wind power and biomass for another three years a move that has been greeted favourably by the markets

research venture at Bell Gurion University in Israel The proposed activities could include design construction and testing of multifunctional technological plants for the production of magnesium and its alloys electrical furnaces for the production of magnesium alloys with components of highly different densities including alloys with special characteristics facilities for the continuous casting of thin sheets or bands of magnesium alloys A THIRD PARTY POWER STATION We have all seen the debate on the critical state of energy supply here in Australia and recently in the USA The price and availability of reliable energy is critical to our proposal There is no power station near Woodsreef There is a lowlevel availability to Barraba We have held extensive discussions with suppliers governments State and Federal and with industry experts The refinery requires an electricity supply of between MW and MW base load and the Board has determined that experienced energy corporations will be invited to propose a build own and operate scenario with GTR as the base contract Any surplus would be offered in the growing Australian national electricity market Local businesses and local government shires in the region have been canvassed with a view to creating a supply regime GTR has received a written offer from Enron Australia one of the worlds largest energy traders and producers to act as the trader of both electricity and a magnesium metal hedge We have had positive discussions on this and will move towards a more defined outcome as a part of our planned bankable feasibility study TARGETED REVENUE STREAMS At this early stage of assessment and given the immaturity of the current global market unknown growth cycle and competitive response from plastics and other substitutes it is very difficult to assess the revenue streams and associated costs We are therefore refraining from making definitive claims Our assembled investigation and discussions with industry participants indicates a potential revenue stream in the hundreds of millions of dollars per annum In support of this we have focused on the history of the aluminium industry as a major pointer of the possible future values Magnesium metal and its alloying properties indicate a high potential for application in the industry sectors described in the opening paragraphs of this document This coupled with the impetus of environmental regulatory frameworks across the globe demanding reductions in weight and greenhouse emissions underlies our confidence in GTLs vision outlined above Published material including that of the Light Metals Action Agenda background paper on aluminium magnesium and titanium issues published by the Department of Industry Science and Resources of the Australian Government values the revenue generation for the Australian aluminium industry at over AUD billion annually Among other things this publication says the magnesium industry is at a stage of development where key players are represented by a number of magnesium metal projects as with aluminium end users are likely to become key players as increased demand for light metals drives growth Nov Further the publication says according to one analyst rising demand for light weight automotive components could see world magnesium production increase from its current level of thousand tonnes to million tonnes

MillerBakewell Reason for Report Whats Happening This Week In Utilities Issue To Watch Puhca Repeal o Tuesdays decision by the US Senates Banking Committee to repeal o PUHCA is the first stage in a lengthy process which could take well into the autumn or longer to complete o The political commitment to change is much stronger than previously the Committee voted underlining the bipartisan support The risks lie in the repeal legislation getting bogged down especially with measures designed to resolve the California supply crisis o The Public Utilities Holding Companies Act dates back to and has been the utility industrys equivalent of GlassStegall in imposing rigorous restrictions on corporate activity involving US utilities o PUHCAs narrow definition of a utility has acted as a deterrent Even water utility assets are classified as nonutility in its criteria of fit and proper ownership of US electric and gas utilities Thus Scottish Powers entry into the USA was via the nonPUHCA registered PacifiCorp Now its being linked with Enrons Portland General o Indeed Eon has clearly stated that PUHCA has increasingly shaped its attitude towards investing in European water assets In

NEW DELHI Dow Jones Indias Maharashtra State Electricity Board is hopeful of renegotiating its power purchase agreement with the US energy major Enron Corps ENE Indian unit Dabhol Power Co MSEB Chairman Vinay Bansal said late Sunday The billion megawatt Dabhol project has been mired in financial disputes after MSEB its main customer failed to pay several of its bills The project has the largest single foreign investment in India The Dabhol project has been in trouble since December when the government of Maharashtra state where the Dabhol project is located said the company charged exorbitant prices for electricity and thus demanded a new price agreement Meanwhile the board of Dabhol Power at its meeting in London April had authorized DPCs managing director to proceed with a preliminary move toward terminating its troubled joint venture power project in western India We are at a point of renegotiating the power purchase agreement with Dabhol Power Co A committee has been constituted with the government of India participation I am hopeful of a positive outcome Bansal told Dow Jones Newswires in a telephone interview He said he hadnt heard anything from DPCs management on the preliminary termination notice Its true that the DPC board has authorized the companys managing director to issue a preliminary termination notice I am not sure why when or whether he will use it Bansal said The preliminary termination notice is the first of three steps that end in the abandonment of the project agreed to by investors when the joint venture was formed Bansal said that if the preliminary notice of termination is issued by the DPCs managing director there will be a sixmonth suspension period in which the two sides will be negotiating to remedy the defect If the dispute cannot be resolved even after the negotiations the final termination takes place Thereafter MSEB or a third party may buy the Dabhol unit The compensation price will be decided by the arbitrator whose decision will be based on which of the two parties has defaulted Bansal said Enron India spokesman Jimmy Mogal refused to comment on the DPC boards decision when reached by Dow Jones Newswires saying it was an internal company matter Indian lenders present at a meeting with foreign financial institutions in London on April have said they favor renegotiation of the DPCMSEB power purchase agreement Under a counterguarantee agreement the federal government is obliged to pay Enron when MSEB defaults Enron invoked that guarantee in February marking the first time in Indian history that a company has invoked such a federal guarantee when the state utility said it couldnt afford to pay Dabhol But before the federal government stepped in the state government paid million in outstanding bills Since then the state power utility has confirmed that all pending bills have been paid However a dispute over payment of million for December and January bills is pending For its part MSEB says it wants the power bills to be offset against a billion rupee INR fine it levied on Dabhol for what it said was the nonsupply of power for intermittent periods between October and the end of January Several political parties had earlier demanded the project be scrapped since the costs had increased to INR from INR per unit agreed to six years ago for electricity generated by the megawatt naphtha plant Enron has maintained that work will be completed by years end on the megawatt liquified natural gas plant Houston Texasbased Enron has a stake in Dabhol Power and is the projects largest shareholder Other shareholders include the MSEB with and General Electric Co GE and Bechtel Enterprises XBTL with each By Himendra Kumar Dow Jones Newswires India Enron pullout could put Indian lenders in a spot Business Line The Hindu Copyright C Kasturi Sons Ltd KSL Source World Reporter TM Asia Intelligence Wire MUMBAI April DABHOL Power Companys DPC overseas lenders have a guarantee cover of about Rs crore from the IDBIled consortium of Indian lenders If the Enronsponsored project is terminated the Indian lenders will have to incur the additional burden over and above the funds they have already sunk in This is in addition to the Union Governments guarantee of about Rs crore to overseas lenders Sources said according to the agreements between the overseas lenders the Indian financiers and the Government the total payout in the event of termination would not be less than the entire foreign debt Of the total debt of close to billion about per cent has been already disbursed by lenders of which per cent has been lent by overseas entities If the blame of termination finally comes to rest on any Indian entity the penalty payable to Enron would amount to about Rs crore Irrespective of the payments to be made to Enron promised returns on premature termination the foreign lenders are secured by the word of domestic financial institutions and not just the Central and State Governments Sources said this is one of the major reasons Indian lenders are opposed to premature termination of the project apart from their loans being unsecured At the DPC board meeting in London IDBI had voted against the resolution to initiate termination The sources said Enron wants to see some concrete and positive signals from the Government within about three weeks that it is serious about the project A positive signal according to them would mean a commitment that phase II would continue on schedule and the power produced would be lifted completely It also wants the first phase to be up and running at full steam without hindrance However even if foreign creditors have to be paid off it is unlikely to be in a single settlement Domestic lenders may have to negotiate some kind of an arrangement to repay the foreign debt in tranches Another possibility albeit a remote one is that the new entity that takes over the project will also take over the foreign debt Meanwhile the expert panel to be formed for renegotiation of the power purchase agreement will include all members of the Godbole Committee a State Government official said It will also include one member each from the Union Finance Ministry the Central Electricity Authority the State Finance Ministry and the Chairman of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board He also said the State Government will appoint the arbitrator before May Archana Chaudhary Dinesh Narayanan Enron not interested in completion of Dabhol project Press Trust of India Limited c PTI Ltd Mumbai Apr PTI The US energy major Enronpromoted Dabhol Power Company DPC has said it is not interested in completing the USD three billion power project in western Indian state of Maharashtra following nonpayment of dues by the state electricity board MSEB and federal governments refusal to honour the Rs billion counterguarantee In DPCs board meeting held in London on April Enron India Managing Director K Wade Cline and DPC President Neil McGregor made it clear they were not very keen for completion of the project as the management felt that both the state government and the Centre Indian Government were undermining the gravity of the situation a senior state government official who attended the meeting told PTI here Sunday Cline told the DPC directors that since the state government had not shown any serious interest in dissolving the imbroglio DPC and its international lenders were not in favour of continuing the project When contacted DPC spokesperson refused to comment The fate of DPCs MW project which is per cent complete hangs in balance since the Indian financial institutions FIs led by IDBI have stopped funding the debt portion of the project with around per cent of the USD billion worth total disbursement already pumped in Naturally we have stopped disbursement as we think that it is indeed a lossmaking proposition as of now If MSEB begins paying we would go ahead with our funding as well an IDBI official said According to the IDBI official this very stand adopted by Indian lenders has upset the DPC management and Enron top bosses in Houston as well In the meeting Cline had informed that DPCs foreign lenders had put up a condition before the company that they would cough up the required USD million only if Indian FIs fulfill their debt component the official added Other than the issuance of termination notice to MSEB another issue that rocked the heated meeting was Godbole review committees strong stand on separating the USD million Liquified Natural Gas terminal from Dabhol project On what basis has Godbole committee asked for renegotiation of the LNG facility do they have any international expertise in purchase of this particular fuel Cline had questioned the MSEB representatives in London He asked whether the highpowered panel had ever consulted any expert before commenting on take or pay clause of the LNG contract which is mandatory feature worldwide In its recommendations made public two weeks ago the Godbole panel had recommended renegotiation of the five million tonnes LNG terminal facility and DPCs shipping agreements with Oman LNG and ADGAS The ministry for Petroleum and Natural Gas should examine the feasibility of integrating Dabhol facility within the broad plans of LNG imports into India and also necessary pipeline investments in this

week on lending Indias Power Grid Corp million as part of a billion package to finance reform and development in the countrys power sector The total amount of money with everything included is about billion a bank spokeswoman told Reuters The multilateral lenders board meets on Thursday to vote on its contribution to the package that has three central elements two related to efficiency and distribution and a third to Power Grids diversification into telecommunications Part of the World Bank loan if approved will go to support the first phase of laying fiberoptic cables across the Power Grid network the spokeswoman said India threw open its longdistance telecommunications sector last August and Power Grid which has a network of miles km of transmission lines plans to provide endtoend bandwidth services The loan package is unusual in that it would be granted directly to the stateowned power distribution utility rather than to the sovereign government of India The government is however guarantor to the program The bank spokeswoman declined to speculate on whether the boards decision would be influenced by the crisis brewing in Indias power sector with US energy company Enron Corp ENEN The bank is engaged at the national level and the state level in power reforms broadly the spokeswoman said declining to comment specifically on Enron and the questions that its potential pullout from India raised about reform in the mainly staterun power sector Houstonbased Enron took a major step on Wednesday toward bailing out of an almost complete billion power project on the west coast of India in a bitter dispute over pricing and unpaid bills The dispute threatens to undermine already weak foreign private investor confidence in direct investments in India which totaled just billion last year a fraction of Chinas billion The World Bank would make any loan to Power Grid on its usual repayment terms of years with five years grace with an interest rate at an unspecified margin above the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR The spokeswoman said other lenders in the program included Germanys Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau KfW with up to million and domestic Indian institutions If passed by the banks Washingtonbased board next week the World Bank loan agreement would then be signed in India by representatives from the bank in Delhi Power Grid and government officials The funds would then be available for draw down within days UK Scottish Power mulls Portland bid paper Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited LONDON April Reuters Scottish Power is

scrutiny when the company reports results next week Scottish Power could not be immediately reached for comment India Save Dabhol project Business Line The Hindu Copyright C Kasturi Sons Ltd KSL Source World Reporter TM Asia Intelligence Wire THE DECISION OF the Dabhol Power Company board at its meeting in London on Wednesday to authorise the Managing Director to issue a notice of termination on the contract to sell MW of power in India is important for the message it sends to New Delhi the Maharashtra Government and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board Closing down the project would be a real option at the right time In the normal course especially in view of all that has happened over the past few months including DPC invoking the political force majeure clause in the power purchase agreement it would have been no surprise had a final decision on termination been taken at the board meeting itself That this has not happened means the project can still be salvaged and this should now become the focus of all the parties But this will not be easy not merely because of the defects in the PPA from the Indian standpoint that is but also because of the bad blood unnecessarily created between the two sides To take but one example The MSEB went ahead to clear its March bill to DPC under protest despite an earlier communication after the payment of the February bill from the Enron India Managing Director Mr K Wade Cline that the company would not and will not recognise any payments made as being under protest The MSEBs reported response was that it was not taking any notice of this stand because Mr Wade Clines letter had no legal standing adding we will continue to pay our bills under protest Let them dispute it This is no way to engage in a dispute as it detracts from the main effort to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution and instead focusses on ephemeral and secondary issues that have little bearing with the core problem Now that the focus will once again shift to India from London hopefully both sides will try their best to arrive at a settlement which actually means they will have to climb down from their positions One the MSEB cannot be expected to continue paying through its nose for power which it does not even consume not merely because this is unfair and unjust but also because the Board simply does not have the funds Further if it does not make any sense for the MSEB to be part of such an arrangement even if it is of its own making it makes even less sense for the Maharashtra Government and the Centre to be penalised for a widelyacknowledged infirmity in the PPA As for DPC being the hardnosed investor it is it cannot but be aware of the financial untenability of certain aspects of the PPA In such a situation provided the principal promoters like Enron Corporation want to continue operating in India of which one is not very certain the sensible perhaps even ethical course would be to agree to an amended PPA which would at least be equitable to the two sides The central point in the issue is that the MW power project to be completed by the yearend is an asset to the nations infrastructure implying at once that letting it go to seed is no option at all At the same time the DPC promoters must be allowed to make their money not on the scale allowed by the existing onesided and patently unfair PPA but at a level which will make the PPA seem a fair document in keeping with the norms applied to such projects This means the PPA will have to be renegotiated a path already accepted by the Indian side but on which DPC is yet to make its stand clear Admittedly top DPC officials have let it be known that they are willing to talk preferably with the Centre So all may not be lost visavis the Dabhol power plant India Systemic changes needed for SEBs says Prabhu Business Line The Hindu Copyright C Kasturi Sons Ltd KSL Source World Reporter TM Asia Intelligence Wire NEW DELHI April THE Union Power Minister Mr Suresh Prabhu has informed the Lok Sabha that systemic changes need to be introduced and institutionalised if the chronically sick State electricity boards SEBs were to be restructured on an enduring basis Responding to the concern expressed by the senior Congress leader Mr Madhavrao Scindia during question hour Mr Prabhu said that the outstanding dues of the SEBs were a staggering Rs crore The Government has constituted an expert group to recommend measures for onetime settlement of outstanding dues of the SEBs towards Central public sector understandings as also the dues from the Central public sector units to State power utilities The expert group headed by the Planning Commission member Dr Montek Singh Ahluwalia would submit its report before the end of this month It would suggest a strategy for capital restructuring of SEBs including the provision of structural adjustment loans so as to enable them to tide over the present financial crisis make them operationally viable and improve their credit rating He agreed with Mr Scindia that the onetime solution for outstanding dues should be an alltime solution and there should not be any recurrence of this problem in future Tracing the genesis of the problems of the SEBs to the difference in the cost of energy generation and the cost of tariff which entails a loss of Re per unit Mr Prabhu said this year the power stations would be generating billion units That is why restructuring of the SEBs on a permanent basis was a must The Minister said that the Government was working on a package Accordingly all the consumers should be metered and all the distribution centres would be treated as profit centres and all the SEBs would have to give a projection of their performance before the year begins When Mr Scindia drew the Ministers attention to a point on the liabilities of the Enron company which he described as damaging the interest of the country the State Government and the power company resulting in massive confusion Mr Prabhu clarified that the agreement was between the State Government of Maharashtra and the Enron company and the Centres role is limited in giving counterguarantee to the guarantee provided by the State Government He said a Standing Committee has been constituted under the Ministries of Finance Power and Law and the Petroleum and Natural Gas would also be roped in to resolve the tangle Sops for shipping urged When Mr Rajaiah Malayala and Mr PC Thomas demanded sops for the indigenous shipping industry which has been facing rough weather the Minister of Shipping Mr Arun Jaitley said that the Finance Minister has responded to the concern of the shipping industry while moving the Finance Bill on Wednesday As the domestic shipping industry has to improve its competitiveness globally efforts would continue to be made with the Department of Revenue to ensure that the domestic shipping industry does not get bogged down by harsh tax regime He conceded that in most countries the shipping industry was operating on a zerotax regime Fasttrack courts In response to a question by Mr Chandra Bhusan Singh Mr Jaitley who is also the Minister of Law Justice and Company Affairs said that to clear the huge pendency of cases in the various courts in the country it is proposed to set up courts on a fasttrack basis Our Bureau India Enron not to affect India ratings SP Business Line The Hindu Copyright C Kasturi Sons Ltd KSL Source World Reporter TM Asia Intelligence Wire MUMBAI April INDIAS sovereign rating would remain unaffected by aggravation of the Enron dispute according to international rating agency Standard Poors The ratings are unaffected because the issues with Dabhol Power Company DPC are not about a default on debt This is a technical distinction but an important one The Government incurs many types of liabilities but we do not consider all of them to be debt for our purpose Mr Joydeep Mukherji Head of Sovereign Ratings SP told Business Line in a mailed reply A counterguarantee backing the Maharashtra guarantee on the State Electricity Boards obligation to pay Dabhol is not debt as far as our ratings go he said With the Enronsponsored DPC teetering on the brink many quarters feared that it would seriously impair foreign investor sentiment and international rating agencies would downgrade the country Mr Mukherji agrees that the issue would hit sentiment Our rating is a judgement on the ability to pay debt fully and on time It is not an indication of profitability or a view about investment prospects The Enron episode will certainly hurt foreign investor sentiment but that is separate from a debt rating he said Enron is about the only foreign investor left in the countrys power sector Many players such as Cogentrix and Powergen have already exited their respective ventures With that backdrop Mr Mukherji said At a broader level not about the rating itself the episode is very bad for India Regardless of the merits of the Dabhol case it sends a clear and negative signal to potential foreign investors going beyond the energy sector India has lots of consumers farmers and industries willing to pay lots of money for reliable guaranteed power supply Many Indian and foreign groups are eager to set up plats to provide that power and make a profit It should have been a winwin situation for all sides Instead the only result after a decade of reform is that loadshedding is as bad as ever and most private investors in power have packed up and left in bitterness However a view that projects such as Dabhol power are not viable in a country with low resources and paying capacity is gaining currency Some analysts ask when utilities in California where delinquency levels are close to zero could not afford the power sold by independent producers such as Enron what chances of survival does MSEB have Dinesh Narayanan Maharashtra to appoint Godbole to lead renegotiations with DPC Press Trust of India Limited c PTI Ltd Mumbai Apr PTI The government of the western Indian state of Maharashtra has decided to appoint former bureaucrat Madhav Godbole who had recently reviewed Dabhol Power Companys DPC Power Purchase Agreement PPA with Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB to lead the expert team for renegotiating the PPA following the US energy majors threat to terminate the agreement An official order would be issued on Monday and the experts committee would have to consider the recommendations and terms of reference put forth by the Godbole Review Committee state government sources said here Saturday Sources said no timeframe had been set but it will all depend on the other side DPC also participating in resolving the imbroglio Godbole has been chosen to head the renegotiation team as he knows each and every minute detail of the mw project they said adding at least two of the five members of the Godbole panelDeepak Parekh and E A S Sharmawould be nominated on the renegotiations committee Sources said MSEB chairman Vinay Bansal and the countrys National Thermal Power Corporations representative would also be included in the panel On Friday state Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh had categorically stated that he was hopeful of renegotiating the PPA even though Enron was contemplating serving of notice terminating power supply to the state He maintained that termination of PPA between DPC and MSEB would be harmful to both and that Enron should not take any harsh decision in the matter THROUGH ASIA PULSE The BS Weekend Power play over Dabhol Pradeep Raje and S Ravindran Business Standard Copyright c Business Standard As Vinay Bansal chairman of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB walked into a board meeting of the Enronpromoted Dabhol Power Company DPC in London on Wednesday April he had reason to be happy The other person who had reason to smile was the Maharashtra energy secretary V M Lal Bansal and Lal are on the DPC board by virtue of MSEB holding a per cent stake in it Why should they be smiling when the chief item on the agenda was to authorise Enron managing director Wade Cline to serve a preliminary notice terminating the contract for the Dabhol power project a contract signed in and renegotiated in Well for the simple reason that two days earlier the clique of lenders to the project had advised Enron not to terminate the contract Fortified with the knowledge that Enron couldnt possibly go against the advice of the lenders the BansalLal duo assumed the board agenda was almost infructuous Indeed the lenders had made a strong case against the termination of the contract noting that since per cent of the construction was already over no purpose would be served by precipitating matters Even the foreign lenders whose loans are covered by the central government counterguarantee were persuaded by the Indian lenders Industrial Development Bank of India IDBI ICICI and the State Bank of India that the bankers primary business was to invest money in a project that would return revenue streams over a period of time and not simply to recover their principal invested Preliminary reports of the lenders meeting suggest the foreign lenders who were initially planning to pack their bags and escape the uncertainties of the project saw merit in the argument that they might lose a significant chunk of their India exposure at one go Fresh investment avenues are not coming up and the foreign lenders didnt want to be left out of the India pie After all in the business of global banking it is only association with existing projects that begets fresh opportunities But despite the lenders posturing and wellintentioned advice for the Enron representatives on the DPC board the latter wasnt one to give up so easily especially after venturing this far just to show its displeasure with the way matters were progressing DPC has all along argued that it has a watertight contract and that MSEB should honour its obligations under the contract It was only after the state government refused to honour its guarantee and even the central government seemed to side with the Maharashtra government rather than honour its own counterguarantee that DPC decided to pull the trumps in its contract It had to make a point if MSEB and the local governments werent willing to pay up what was due they would have to pay up all the penalty clauses for termination of the contract So despite the lenders advice the board chose to let the sword hang tantalisingly closer to MSEBs head It authorised Enron India managing director Wade Cline to serve the notice as and when he deemed fit If the Indian side was talking tough all this while to force DPC to accept its stand on renegotiating a lower tariff the latter had dangled the threat of phenomenal penalties if the government strayed off the course charted in the power purchase agreement As the resolution was carried through the MSEB chairman and energy secretary realised their bluff was called The smiles vanished But they still put up a brave front Speaking from London MSEB officials denied that they had been checkmated This does not mean that they will issue the notice immediately Cline has only been authorised to do so they said But they did admit that the situation had not been defused in spite of the fact that the government had made some conciliatory moves Just before the DPC board meet the Union government had announced on April that a committee comprising representatives of the state government MSEB and nominees from the Centre would be set up to renegotiate the power purchase agreement with DPC to get lower tariffs In retrospect lenders say Enron seems to have realised that they had no option but to sit with the state government and thrash out fresh tariffs After all it couldnt afford to let payments being held up for months on end Moreover if MSEB was not drawing enough power from the MW Phase I of the project claiming financial inability to service the purchases what is the guarantee that it would draw power when the larger MW Phase II comes up Putting up capacities when the goods dont sell doesnt make sense So to salvage the investment Enron realised that it had little option but to renegotiate with the state government Then it simply became a matter of fortifying positions ahead of the negotiations In short it is trying to convey that it will negotiate but it better be a deal that satisfies the Houston Texasbased company The problem as far as the DPC is concerned is the high tariff it charged the MSEB These have been as high as Rs per unit at times Critics of the project consisting of politicians bureaucrats and NGOs have said that this is crippling MSEB The fixed cost alone for the first phase of MW is Rs crore per month This means that MSEB has to pay DPC Rs crore whether it buys power or not This fixed charge will rise to Rs crore per month when the second phase is commissioned by December For the MSEB which rakes in around Rs crore per month the prospect of paying out Rs crore to one supplier is a nightmare What does the immediate future offer In the next few weeks expect Enron and the negotiating committee to open direct parleys There will be hard bargaining on both sides By deciding to to send its nominees into the renegotiating committee the Government of India has made it clear that it is taking the issue very seriously Earlier the government was content to treat it as a fight between the state government MSEB and DPC But the fact that unpaid bills were being claimed from its own account through the counterguarantee clauses seems to have forced the Centre to be much more careful in what the two sides agree on Indeed the central government has just realised what a mess it had got itself into It had sided with MSEB when it decided not to honour the counter guarantee invoked by DPC for the December bill of Rs crore But that got the Centre embroiled in an arbitration proceeding over this amount And above all the central government being the sovereign cannot be seen as being so petty as to wriggle out of its obligations One false move and the entire worth of the Centres word would be laid to waste Playing on that Enron is trying to show that any renegotiations on its part are in the nature of mercy concessions since it has a valid signed contract no one messes with it What this means is that there is no way the state government MSEB and the Government of India can shy away from their obligations of paying the DPC bills MSEB owes at least Rs crore to DPC for December and January Indeed DPC made it clear to the Godbole committee that nothing was sacred However it would negotiate at a common forum which consists of all the three other affected parties MSEB the Maharashtra government and the Union government This concern of DPC has already been met The issue of what is to be renegotiated still remains The Godbole committee itself had laid out the extent of concessions for each of the parties to the deal and had warned that unless the entire package is agreed upon this round of negotiations will end like the previous round held in The committee said The renegotiations will be a complete failure and will only end up complicating matters further These recommendations are well known and documented now However for the record the Godbole panel has recommended splitting the liquefied natural gas LNG project from the power project DPC has set up a million tonne LNG terminal of which only million tonne is for the power plant However the entire cost of the LNG facility has been loaded on to the power project If this recommendation is accepted it will first bring down the cost of the power project Then it will eliminate the need for MSEB to buy about million tonne of LNG whether it wants it or not This in turn will relieve MSEB of an annual burden of million The excess LNG could be marketed to other players which are mushrooming The Reliance and Essar groups as well as Petronet LNG are keen to set up LNG terminals in western India It has also said that the equity return for the DPC tariff be defined in rupees than in dollar terms This will insulate the tariff from exchange rate fluctuations It further adds that this tariff should be benchmarked to the lowest cost of power supply from other gasbased plants in the world The committee has recommended that the sale of power be allowed to others apart from MSEB This is possible only if the tariff is brought down to rates comparable with other producers Central utilities like the National Thermal Power Corporation NTPC and the Power Trading Corporation besides power companies like BSES and Tata Power have already made it clear that they are not keen on buying DPC power at the current rates BSES and Tata Power charge their customers only between Rs to Rs per unit The least cost DPC power works out to Rs per unit What happens if the renegotiations fail and Enron decides to pull out of the project Will it mean the end of foreign direct investment in a sector which is starved of funds There has been little investment in the power sector over the last decade due to the poor financial health of the state electricity boards The health of these boards has in fact deteriorated over the last decade when reforms have been launched Unless this basic problem is addressed there will be little investment coming into this sector says R V Shahi CMD of power major BSES This is a point of view that is echoed in the Godbole committee report which is otherwise quite critical of DPC The report warns The committee would like to state strongly that none of the solutions espoused for independent power projects in general and DPC in particular is tenable without the reform of MSEB especially its distribution business The day MSEB reforms and its finances are in order Bansal and Lal will smile more often India waits for a rediscovery Paran Balakrishnan Business Standard Copyright c Business Standard Has India slipped off the world map once again Or is it about to be rediscovered now that times are turning tough and inventories are piling up in the international marketplace Six years ago international bankers and corporations couldnt get enough of India In everyones mind India was the Promised Land with a gigantic population that was hungering for everything from electricity to televisions and Black Label whisky Foreign investors bought the GDRs of companies like Garden Vareli and Arvind Mills that were selling extraordinary growth stories The world has altered beyond recognition since then The foreign investors discovered the harsh truth that a gigantic market by itself doesnt always add up to huge sales Many investors burnt their fingers buying GDR issues in companies that soon became terminally ill The enthusiasm for India ebbed gradually but it returns from time to time India became the flavour of the season about one year ago when hitech fever was at its frenzied peak Suddenly investors decided that India was logging on to the world and would soon be a good bet once again Businessmen like Azim Premji were written about in magazines around the world and it was hard not to notice Indias hitech revolution Plenty has happened since then and its a safe bet that anyone who invested in the Indian stock market one year ago must have lost money if he didnt get out in doublequick time What about the giant investments that everyone predicted would flow into India A few years ago former finance minister P Chidambaram told an audience in London that foreign investment in India would easily touch billion by It hasnt even touched half that amount in and theres certainly no sign that it is about to pick up sharply The fact is that brokers analysts and the global corporations are a bit tired of India This country is a rickety and rumbunctious democracy and it suffers from a degree of unpredictability that foreigners find baffling The stock market had just begun to pick up when the Tehelka tapes threw it off course once again The body blow came after bull operator Ketan Parekh was arrested and accused of manipulating the market Says one Londonbased broker You never know what to expect It is just one thing after another On another front the signals are getting mixed by the continuing travails of Enron and the Maharashtra government As everyone knows the worlds power position has changed unimaginably and companies like Enron have discovered that there are electricity shortages in places like California Suddenly their enthusiasm for the developing world has waned rapidly Nevertheless foreign money is still pouring into the stock markets As the Dow Jones Index and the Nasdaq grind to a halt it is clear that there wont be super profits in these markets for several years to come Suddenly with the index at Mumbai looks a better bet The market is almost certainly undervalued and there are definitely bargains to be had Back in the mids growth in the United States had slowed to a halt and the giant corporations decided that they had to get to Europe and South East Asia where growth was ticking along at a comfortable pace Come the s and the action has shifted back to America It is extremely likely that the wheel is about to turn once again and this time countries like China and India could be in sharp focus Does it matter what foreign businessmen think about India The answer is definitely yes Foreign money has changed the balance of power on the Bombay Stock Exchange And the globe has shrunk with email and swifter jet travel And with the WTO policing the world India must learn to play by the rules of the game It must learn to look like a star

over unpaid debts owed to a United States power conglomerate is casting a cloud over Indias foreign investment hopes After a year battle the countrys largest direct foreign investor is ready to retreat but the Indians could be the longterm losers Texasbased Enron this week took a big step toward abandoning an almostcomplete US billion project in India The board of Dabhol Power the Indian subsidiary of Enron met in London on Wednesday and authorised the companys managing director to issue a preliminary notice to terminate the project which has been billed as the worlds largest naturalgasfired power plant The Times of India reported The board has given powers to the management to issue the pretermination notice But the meeting unanimously felt the need of the hour was not to terminate the project but to initiate a renegotiation process Vinay Bansal chairman of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB was quoted as saying by the newspaper The notice is the first of three steps that could end in the abandonment of the US billion project A sixmonth reconciliation period would follow any move by Dabhol to issue the termination notice Mr Bansal said In the past six months the MSEB has defaulted on bills for electricity supplied by Dabhol which operates another plant kilometres south of Bombay Late on Thursday the MSEB said it had paid Dabhol Power billion rupees about HK million for electricity it bought in March But the payment only partially resolves the total overdue amount of billion rupees which Enron has been unable to collect even after invoking guarantees issued by the government of Maharashtra and the federal government The state utility also owes Enron payments for power delivered in December and January Neither government is willing to foot the bill for a project which has proved expensive and hugely unpopular Yet failing to meet obligations with Enron threatens to reinforce the image of India as a poor investment climate making it harder for the nation to raise the huge sums needed to improve its infrastructure Ironically Enron was once viewed as playing a lead role in sparking infrastructureinvestment led growth A decade ago the company offered to build a string of power plants after India rolled out the red carpet to multinationals The country needed to add megawatts of generating capacity a year to meet demand that was growing at per cent to per cent annually However years of socialism had left the nation with a network of moneylosing staterun utilities incapable of paying the estimated billion rupees per year development cost The governments reluctance to reform the domestic power sector meant few domestic companies were willing to build plants Enron and a swarm of other foreign energy companies offered to fill the void Enron quickly struck a deal in the early s to build a plant in Maharashtra a contract renegotiated after a state election brought to power a new government which claimed the terms were too generous and the result of alleged kickbacks Through the deal Enron became the largest foreign investor in the country accounting for per cent of total direct foreign investment in India since The massive project proved hugely unpopular Its power cost more than that from stateowned plants as a result of the rupees depreciation against the US dollar and partly due to the rise in the cost of naphtha the original fuel source At its peak operating rate the plants output cost about rupees per kilowatt hour However because of the payment dispute with the state power board it is running at only per cent of capacity and charges rupees per kilowatt hour more than three times the rate of other suppliers Many Indians believe the Enron contract has bankrupted the state power board and threatens to wreck the shaky state budget if the contract is not renegotiated We dont want Enron They can go and sell their power elsewhere state finance minister Jayant Patil said last month The MW first phase of the project began operating in May and later this year the second phase is due to come on line tripling output to MW That is forcing both sides to toughen their positions as next year the amount owed by the state will more than quadruple to more than US billion a year under the year contract The nasty dispute seems certain to cripple efforts to attract other foreign investment India attracted just US billion in direct foreign investment last year China with a roughly comparable population and an economy twice the size of Indias attracts times more Enron not needed at all says NGO Manjiri Damle The Times of India Copyright C The Times of India Source World Reporter TM PUNE Prayas the consumer watchdog body on electricity has told the energy review committee headed by Dr Madhav Godbole that the costly Enron power project was not needed to meet the energy requirements of the state and that the very legality and clearances given to the project were questionable Prayas was invited by the Godbole committee which is reviewing the controversial project and other private power projects that are coming up in the state to make a submission on the Enron issue The nongovernmental organisation NGO stated that the energy demand of the state was million units MU in fiscal which was expected to go up to MU in fiscal Possible generation from the existing plants would be MU and hence there would be no need to add capacity The state may suffer a peakhour shortfall of to MU which could be mitigated by exploring other options like purchase of captive energy from industrial units Prayas added The NGO told the committee that the MSEBs own generation could be maximised through a series of steps Quality of coal supplied to the MSEBs thermal plants could be improved by blending imported coal thereby generating an additional MW Utilisation of Urans idle capacity could yield another MW Power could also be procured from Tata BSES captive industrial plants and cogeneration by sugar factories On proposed options regarding Enron Prayas stated that the sale of Enron power outside Maharashtra would not be possible because other states would not afford it Besides there would be major legal and contractual problems as well the NGO has said About other private power projects like Bhadrawati Reliance and other liquid fuelbased projects coming up in the state Prayas advised that the government and the MSEB should ensure cancellation of all power purchase agreements PPAs Statewide stir against Enron from March A Staff Reporter The Times of India

TALWAR BADAM Associated Press Writer Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved DABHOL India AP Workers in yellow helmets scramble up steel girders to fit pipes into place for the worlds largest natural gasfired power plant to be completed off Indias western coast this year by American energy giant Enron Corp But miles away in Bombay government officials say they cannot afford the electricity that Enron is now providing from a naphtha plant at the site and they expect the electricity generated by liquefied natural gas will cost even more Enron is simply unaffordable said Padamsinh Patil energy minister for the state of Maharashtra which includes Bombay The state cannot afford the power so we take less power but still have to pay Enron huge amounts India needs power during the ApriltoOctober hot season the nation had a daily shortfall of nearly megawatts of electricity according to the Center for Monitoring the Indian Economy Enrons naphtha and gas plants at Dabhol will together be able to generate about megawatts but politicians have trouble with the price Aging coal and gasfired plants that have been depreciated can charge about two rupees cents per kilowatt hour while Enrons naphtha plant has been charging to cents Everyone wants to use us to blame for the systemic problem that the state electricity boards in this country sell power for less than it costs them to generate or buy power said K Wade Cline president of Enron India Despite the protests Cline believes that the billion project Indias biggestever foreign investment will go on line at the end of An advantage for Enron and the major complaint against it is a unique contract that requires the federal government to pay up in case of default by Maharashtra Another grievance is that the Enron deal requires Maharashtra to pay for electricity even if it doesnt use it Enron invoked the federal guarantee in February when the state utility said it could not afford to pay Dabhol Power Corp Houstonbased Enrons Indian subsidiary But before the national government stepped in state officials paid million in overdue bills Enron says it is owed million for power delivered in December and January The February power bill has already been paid and Krishna Rao member of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board said Wednesday the March electricity bill was being paid The state bailout drew attention to the Enron deal with opponents again raising questions about the cost to be borne for foreign investment and development The debate comes as the government in New Delhi tries to reduce subsidies and sell off stateowned enterprises Enron says federal payment guarantees were essential because few foreign companies were willing to invest when India began opening its economy in the early s Who wanted to come to India at that time Very few companies did said Cline We came along with some others and said were willing to invest because we think India has a bright future Preparing for that future workers at Dabhol clamber around inside an LNG tank that could fit three jets stacked one atop another They weld a steelreinforced dome while others outside drill concrete blocks for the milelong jetty where the LNG tanker Laxmi meaning wealth in Hindi is scheduled to dock in November Enron says LNG is the cleanest and most economical fuel but Bombay politicians have their doubts They point at electricity prices that have increased fourfold which Enron attributes to the rise to the jump in oil prices and a depreciation of the Indian rupee Opponents of the project say the government should have invested in its own power plant instead of tying up with a foreign company Were not against foreign companies but the Enron project is a sure pill for Indias financial collapse said Pradyumna Kaul an antiEnron activist It will bankrupt the nation Both sides should agree to a separation and abort the contract now Enron believes a crackdown on power theft and reduction of waste in transmission and distribution would generate enough money to pay for Dabhols electricity A state governmentappointed committee agreed and this month called for reform of the state power utility that defaulted on its payments to Enron But the fivemember panel also insisted on lower tariffs and urged renegotiating the price agreement Enron chief executive Jeffrey Skilling likened the India situation to the power woes being felt in California The utility offers a fixed rate to their customers and the wholesale costs of electricity have gone up like they have in the US he said from Enron headquarters in Houston The distribution company is having a liquidity squeeze identical to what you have with Pacific Gas Electric Meanwhile at Dabhol managers are moving to the next phase training workers to man tug boats to guide that first LNG tanker into port When you first go into these villages with helicopters bulldozers theyre nervous as any of us would

large part because of investor pessimism toward the companys nascent highspeed Internet unit Just as Enron shares were inflated by speculative enthusiasm for Enron Broadband Services Inc they lost considerable gas when investors realized the unit would not be profitable for a couple of years said Jeff Skilling Enrons president and chief executive Meanwhile the stock prices of Enron competitors Duke Energy Corp Dynegy Inc Reliant Energy Inc and El Paso Corp seen doubledigit percentage growth for the year thanks to volatile natural gas and electricity prices an essential ingredient for profits in the energytrading business Enrons success as a buyer and seller of power contracts helped shield its own stock for a while Skilling said but the weak Internet unit left them feeling a little bit like a duck in a pond And there are still a lot of hunters around that pond with a lot of ammo left The only way to resuscitate Enrons stock price now Skilling said is to improve earnings The Houstonbased company has done just that Its wholesale electricity trading operations fueled a percent growth in net profit during the three months ended March But a recent spate of negative news about the company has kept investors jittery In March Enrons attempt to sell its Portland General Electric Co unit to Reno Nevadabased Sierra Pacific Resources fell apart and its exclusive year videoondemand partnership with Blockbuster Inc was called off Enron also has been dogged lately by difficulties collecting money from customers in India where a utility has defaulted on nearly million in payments and in California where the companys exposure to the bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric Co is about million The deflated valuation of Enrons stock however is most directly linked to its moneylosing broadband unit People ascribed a lot of value to the units business plan said Dennis Higgins an energy analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Enron Broadband Services delivers speedy Web services over its nationwide fiberoptic network and sells bandwidth as a commodity to telecommunications firms such as BellSouth Corp and Qwest Communications International Inc It lost million in the first quarter but Skilling said the whollyowned subsidiary is gaining traction though it would not be profitable for another two or three years Financial analysts now either ignore the Internet services division when discussing Enrons outlook for and early or they go out of their way in research reports to highlight reduced expectations for Enron Broadband Ronald Barone an energy analyst at UBS Warburg put a positive spin on the collapse in broadband valuation in a recent research note The downward revision of some highly aggressive price targets well above were healthy steps in getting this once top performer back on track to delivering solid shareholder returns he said Barone still says Enrons stock will reach this level only it will take months instead of months The companys firstquarter profit was million as it swapped electricity and natural gas contracts at a time when low supplies and high demand drove up energy prices nationwide The stocks of Enrons competitors have chugged along since April but Enron shares have fallen about percent The Williams Companies Inc which also invested heavily in telecommunications has also been a weak performer on Wall Street compared to its rivals remaining basically unchanged since a year ago Donato Eassey an energy analyst at Merrill Lynch said Enrons shares are due for a turnaround predicting that the floodgates are going to open At a time when the United States is short on supplies of natural gas and electricity and demand is on the rise few companies are bettersuited than Enron to help folks deal with those high prices Eassey said As for the onceballyhooed broadband unit he said Itll be icing on the cake if it comes back On the Net End advance for release weekend editions April

set to stay high LNG seems to be back in fashion Financial Times BusinessFinancial Desk Section A While a Utility May Be Failing Its Owner Is Not By By RICHARD A OPPEL Jr and LAURA M HOLSON The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company Pacific Gas and Electric the giant California utility may have just made one of the largest bankruptcy filings in history but it has been a banner year for the rest of its parent company the PG E Corporation In Bethesda Md far from the energy crisis in California another PG E subsidiary National Energy Group earned million last year and ranked as the nations thirdlargest power trader Compensation for the units executives soared Many investors now believe that the subsidiary just a decade in the making is by itself worth more than its yearold utility sibling How did National Energy get so big so fast By using cash partly generated by its sister utility to buy unregulated power plants in the Northeast expand tradingfloor operations and sell power across the country The exact numbers are in dispute but much of Nationals Energys profits last year came from California Most other large utilities have done the same thing over the past decade building national or even global power companies from roots in local monopolies But nowhere is the success of these unregulated businesses more of an issue than in California where PG Es investments may be challenged in bankruptcy court Still such transfers of assets were fundamental to deregulation plans in two dozen states and they were encouraged by federal rules designed to build a new wholesale marketplace in electricity And today the offspring of the nations utilities dominate that market after industry leader Enron Eight of the nations largest power marketers are affiliates or spinoffs of regulated utilities controlling about percent of power trading It is largely these unregulated power producers and traders whose sales of power in California have prompted accusations by state leaders of price gouging and demands for the price caps that federal regulators took their first halting steps toward embracing last week The profitability of the utilities unregulated operations is becoming clear as companies report earnings for the first three months of the year For example Reliant Energy reported that operating income at its unregulated wholesale energy business soared to million in the first quarter or percent more than at its regulated utility which serves Houston This week Reliant expects to spin off its unregulated businesses through an initial public stock offering that would put a market value on the new company of as much as billion more than the rest of Reliant A number of other major utility companies have spinoffs or trading and generation units that now earn nearly as much as or more than their core utility operations These include Duke Energy in Charlotte NC Sempra Energy of San Diego the Southern Company in Atlanta the Constellation Energy Group in Baltimore and Utilicorp United in Kansas City Mo In some places the growth of the unregulated businesses continues to raise questions of fairness particularly where utilities have been permitted to transfer plants to the new units at deep discounts to their market value Critics say that ratepayers whose bills paid for the plants construction should benefit more when the plants are sold In Florida a commission on energy deregulation formed by Gov Jeb Bush has proposed permitting such transfers on the grounds that they are needed to create a new wholesale marketplace Opponents including the Florida Municipal Electric Association which represents utilities owned by local governments say the plan would produce a billion windfall that should go to ratepayers In California some creditors of Pacific Gas and Electric have signaled that they will want the bankruptcy court in San Francisco to review parent PG Es efforts to keep its unregulated businesses out of creditors reach And the California Public Utilities Commission is investigating whether PG E and Edison International whose Southern California Edison utility unit is also near insolvency have improperly transferred cash to their parents and to unregulated sister companies A recent audit ordered by the commission showed that Pacific Gas and Electric transferred billion to PG E from to Most of that went to dividends and stock repurchases but million was invested in other subsidiaries primarily its National Energy Group unit Southern California Edison transferred billion to its parent company between and November a separate audit showed Edison International invested billion in its unregulated Mission Group subsidiaries during the same period Executives of the companies say the transfers were proper Audits have shown that we followed the rules and didnt do anything wrong said PG Es chief executive Robert Glynn We did not ask consumers in California to support any of the losses that occurred in those businesses when we started them up he said Now forcing the unregulated units to support their ailing sister utility he said would be no different than calling up shareholders and saying The California electric bills are pretty high send some money in so we can give it back to them Loretta Lynch the president of the utilities commission took a different view Should we look backward she asked and say Hey wait a minute that corporate structure profited by all of our power payments to them in the past and they should participate in helping us through to get to a solution in the future The cornerstone deal of PG Es unregulated energy business was struck four years ago when it acquired the hydroelectric and fossilfueled generation plants of New England Electric System for billion PG E is now one of the largest generators in the Northeast operating plants that can light up to five million averagesized homes While California officials say Pacific Gas and Electrics woes have been caused at least in part by market manipulation by outofstate generators the Justice Department has been investigating possible market abuses involving PG E and two other companies in New England Mr Glynn said that PG E had done nothing wrong and that the company has responded to Justice Department requests for information Overall PG Es National Energy Group has power plants in states and others under development or construction that include one in Athens NY that is expected to begin supplying electricity to New York City in It also operates an energy trading operation in Bethesda and controls a natural gas pipeline into Northern California To Wall Street the utility companies investments in unregulated businesses were a necessary survival tactic as investors demanded fastergrowing profits The stock market was going like gangbusters and the utilities returns of percent werent cutting it said Richard Cortright a utility analyst at Standard and Poors the bond rating agency Moreover as deregulation loomed industry executives saw no choice but to make new investments It looked like the utility opportunity was going to start shrinking Mr Glynn said Consumer groups question whether utilities would have invested more in improving basic service if they had not had the option of putting money elsewhere Mike Florio a lawyer with The Utility Reform Network a consumer group in San Francisco cited findings last year by state regulators that from to Pacific Gas Electric spent nearly million less on maintaining electric and gas facilities than had been factored into its rates Separately in the utility agreed to pay about million to settle charges that consumers were endangered because it failed to trim trees near highvoltage power lines Several hundred million dollars didnt get spent for maintenance and that ultimately falls to the bottom line as profit Mr Florio said Mr Glynn said the utility had always spent appropriate sums on maintenance coming within onehalf of one percent of the amount built into rates over a year period In the big picture he said it was hard to see how PG E had been a winner in deregulation even before its utilitys humiliating bankruptcy If you look at what happened the net of it was a loss Mr Glynn said because the value leaked out on the regulated utility side faster than we were able to build it on the nonregulated side

last Thursday Reports that Britains biggest utility may step in for Portlands customer base and megawatts of generating capacity surfaced at the weekend in Britains Observer newspaper PacifiCorp faces its own power crisis fallout including million a day buyingin costs resulting from the failure of one of its generators The problems have helped depress Scottish Powers share price to a point where it now registers five percent UK sector underperformance over the past two years And analysts said Portland has a significant exposure to current high US power prices with only about megawatts of its own generating capacity but megawatts of peak demand to satisfy Nevertheless Scottish Power has said it intends to expand further in the US to exploit opportunities for merger cost savings in a highly

western state of Maharashtra following nonpayment of dues by the state electricity board MSEB and the federal governments refusal to honour the Rs billion counterguarantee In DPCs board meeting in London on April Enron India managing director K Wade Cline and DPC president Neil McGregor made it clear that they were not very keen to complete the project because management felt that both the state government and the the federal government were undermining the gravity of the situation a senior state government official who attended the meeting told PTI Cline told the DPC directors that since the state government had not shown any serious interest in dissolving the difficult situation DPC and its international lenders were not in favour of continuing the project When contacted the DPC refused to comment The fate of DPCs MW project which is per cent complete hangs in the balance since the Indian financial institutions FIs led by the Industrial and Development Bank of India IDBI have stopped funding the debt portion of the project with around per cent of the US billion worth of total disbursement already pumped in Naturally we have stopped disbursement because we think that it is indeed a lossmaking proposition If the State Electricity Board begins paying we will go ahead with our funding as well an IDBI official said CHAMBER CHIEF CALLS FOR PRIVATISATION OF INDIAS POWER SECTOR REFORMS Asia Pulse c Copyright Asia Pulse PTE Ltd NEW DELHI April Asia Pulse Confederation of Indian Industry CII has demanded depoliticisation of power sector reforms to enthuse and encourage private investment even as it said that the Enron controversy would not impact future investments in the sector We need to depoliticise tariff fixation and set up a strong and independent regulator without interference from state governments Sanjeev Goenka President CII told PTI There are lessons to be learnt from Enronthe premise on which the agreement was based was faulty We should not have had a counterguarantee clause in the agreement he said Expressing confidence that the issue would be resolved soon Goenka said even if Enron decides to pull out it will have no impact on private investment in the sector He said no fresh investments have come in because of Enron Investments will come only if investors are confident of getting viable returns Blaming poor confidence and low returns for lack of private sector investment in power sector Goenka said the present policy of cross subsidisation had placed an extra burden on the power companies and rendered them uncompetitive Goenka said the state electricity boards SEBs should be privatised and restructured to improve distribution and cut transmission losses In reference to privatisation of stateowned BALCO the CII chief said the centre should play a more agressive role in pursuing disinvestment Autonomy to states is meant for local governance it is the centre which is to govern the country he quipped M and A Fleet

President James Wolfensohn has said his organisation did not have a magic formula for regional contracting in power projects and renegotiation of contracts like Enronpromoted Dabhol Power Company in Maharashtra may not be needed in future as public opinion is more alert to details of the contracts Wolfensohn made the remarks when an Indian correspondent asked him at a news conference whether the World Bank could aid developing countries to negotiate the right kind of contracts to avoid the kind of problems now confronting the DPC I think we have been helpful with a lot of the Governments in terms of rationalizing the power issue It is not just pricing The issue is also line transmission losses which have been tremendous in many of the countries he said I dont think we have a magic formula for regional contracting said Wolfensohn adding but I would say it has come into prominence more in recent years on both negotiation of contracts and on the establishment of pricing US analysts have noted that Dabhol rates and the Pakistani rates are very much higher than even in the United States where labour is much more expensive What he sees going on today the World Bank chief said is a much more transparent and vigorous and active process in terms of public opinion That never happened five or ten years ago So thanks to public opinion it is correcting itself In Business

Investor Time to sail Indira Vergis Business Standard Copyright c Business Standard Indias largest shipping company Shipping Corporation of India SCI has been attracting growing interest from analysts of late The main reasons include higher freight rates and the strong possibility of the government offloading its stake in SCI this financial year The government holds per cent of SCI stock and is aiming to divest upto per cent Indeed the plans for disinvesment are being viewed as a powerful trigger that can send its stock price soaring Swinging fortunes The shipping industry holds all the promise and perils of a cyclical industry When it comes to growth prospects for shipping companies much hinges on the level of activity in world trade and shipping tonnage Nearly per cent of Indias external trade moves by sea Major products transported include crude oil petroleum products iron ore steel and grains Mighty force With its army of ships in its fleet boasting million tonnes in dead weight tonnage dwt staterun SCI represents a powerful force in the Indian shipping industry It accounts for nearly per cent of the countrys total operating tonnage Sailing behind are private competitors like GE Shipping Essar and Varun Shipping Ships can be broadly classified into tankers and bulk carriers Tankers include crude carriers carrying crude oil product carriers for transporting other liquid cargo like petroleum products and chemicals carriers Bulk cargo carriers move dry cargo like ores and grains As on April crude carriers made up nearly per cent of SCIs gross registered tonnagegrt while product carriers accounted for around per cent Bulk carriers took up nearly per cent Better times ahead After weathering stormy waters in the past few years the shipping industry seems ready to chart higher growth in calmer climate propelled by higher freight rates Over the past year freight rates have climbed on an average per cent in the tankers market to around Similarly in the dry bulk segment the Baltic Freight Index the most widelywatched global indicator of spot dry bulk rates is still floating at levels after having peaked at levels in September While it has slipped from the levels a year ago analysts expect the index to remain perched around these levels For many these are signs of better fortunes for shipping companies like SCI We expect freight rates to stay firm in probably just marginally lower from current levels says PKSrivastava chairman and managing director SCI Restructuring helps SCI has also made some restructuring efforts It includes attempts to prune business segments seen to be a drag on company profits like the liners division Over the past year the company has found buyers for vessels half of them liners This definitely helps them improve profits and cash flows says Deepak Agrawal analyst at kotakstreetcom The selling of old ships however is a recurring theme in shipping operations These sales not only improve cash flows but also lift some burden off operating costs In SCIs case it accounts for nearly per cent of the sales This cash can also be employed in the tanker business Agarwal adds In another step SCI is also thrashing out the details of a voluntary retirement scheme for employees It has more than employees on its roster In addition heeding consulting house Pricewaterhouse CoopersPwC recommendations it is also turning to information technology to improve operational efficiency However PwCs suggestion that SCI be split into three separate companies has been rejected by the government The restructuring moves are having a positive impact on the company says Agarwal Winds of change Experts say that certain emerging global trends will also influence future operations of SCI For one international maritime laws can lead to a supply dip in large carriers like tankers The International Maritime Organisation IMO regulations could see the supply of tankers coming under slight pressure agrees Agrawal The IMO has asked the global shipping industry to gradually phase out single hull tankers and embrace newer double hull tankers seen as more environmentconscious As scrapping of old design tankers gathers pace the nature of shipbuilding will ensure that they wont be replaced immediately Industry sources say that it takes roughly three years to build and operate large carriers like tankers The impending imbalance in tanker demand and supply also seems reason enough for some to believe that freight rates for the segment will remain pegged at higher levels Besides production pattern changes in Indias oil industry a major client for the shipping sector are also engineering changes in some segments Improved oil refining capacity in the country is already signalling declining demand for product tankers carrying petroleum products On the other hand demand for crude tankers is slated to rise as demand for crude surges to feed increased refining capacity India imports nearly per cent of its total requirements of crude oil In SCI was the countrys largest carrier of crude bringing in per cent of the total requirements of the staterun and joint venture oil companies There is also growing evidence that more consumers are shifting smaller breakbulk cargoes into containers Industry watchers say that this rate of containerisation of cargo is set to quicken Container shipping forms slightly more than half the worlds cargo shipping yet currently forms just under three per cent of SCIs grt It is a very important segment for us next only to the LNG segment says Srivastava Howeverhe adds we are looking more at alliances in this segment and not additional capital expenditure here The brightest spot One opportunity that experts forecast will be a revenuegrosser for the Indian shipping industry in the coming years is the budding demand for natural gas With demand expected to far outstrip local supplies the government is already considering legislation for the transportation and import of liquefied natural gasLNG SCI with its Mitsui OSK Linesled consortium has already edged ahead of rivals in this arena by clinching a million deal with Petronet LNG to build and operate two LNG carriers by It has also formed a joint venture with US energy giant Enron Corp and Mitsui for a vessel to transport LNG from the Middle East to Enrons subsidiary Dabhol Power Company by the end of But the current imbroglio over whether Enron wants to continue operations in India or pull out does put a question mark on the contract Besides in a bid to strengthen fleet size SCI has also placed orders worth Rs crore to build four Aframax tankers in South Korea and an LR tanker in Cochin In fiscal we are looking at acquiring ships says Srivastava While the company has a stash of Rs crore in reserves it often turns to domestic and international financial markets to finance its fleet expansion Recently it raised million Rs crore in external commercial borrowings at basis points above the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR In fiscal total debt for the shipping firm stood at Rs crore Financials The benefits of restructuring accompanied by buoyant freight rates were reflected in SCIs financial performance last year For the nine months ending December operations generated Rs crore in sales jumping per cent from the yearago period But net profit zoomed a mindboggling per cent to Rs crore from Rs crore in the same period last year Cost cutting measures contained total expenditure It rose just per cent to Rs crore from Rs crore Operating margins added basis points to per cent from per cent Slicing costs further were declining interest payments at Rs crore compared to Rs in the same period last year Depreciation costs rose marginally from Rs crore to Rs crore But lower interest and depreciation figures did translate into a hefty tax bill of Rs crore double the figure it paid in the yearago period In fiscal return on net worth stood at per cent Valuations An overwhelming chunk of shares in the hands of the government has often deterred investors from trading in SCI stock Yet the stock remains noteworthy since it has turned in a better performance than the benchmark BSE Sensex Over fiscal while the Sensex sunk per cent SCIs stock handed out a stunning per cent return to shareholders Starting out at Rs in March it more than doubled to Rs twelve months later And thats still per cent off the year high of Rs witnessed in February Analysts continue to remain positive on the stock Significantly at Rs the stock quotes at just around half its book value of Rs Trading at just six times its earnings the share still offers good value Godbole to head DPC renegotiation panel Renni Abraham MUMBAI Business Standard Copyright c Business Standard With the Madhav Godbole committee along with a central government representative to conduct the renegotiation in the Dabhol Power Company DPC project for effecting reductions in the latters power tariffs and restructuring the Power Purchase Agreement PPA the ball is now in the power majors court The Godbole committees recommendations with regards to the renegotiation process were arrived at unanimously an aspect that its chairman confirmed to Business Standard on Sunday Godbole however stated that he was yet to receive any official intimation of his appointment on renegotiating team Maharashtras energy minister Padmasinh Patil however confirmed that the Godbole Committee would renegotiate the DPC project and said The chief minister would be announcing the names officially on Monday We are now hopeful of a speedy negotiation process to resolve the DPC imbroglio Godbole when asked how long the renegotiation process would take said I would have to see the stand taken by Enron on the issue of renegotiations before commenting on this issue With the government deciding to sustain the resolution process with the same team Godbole Committee the recommendations made by it would for all purposes set the benchmark for the renegotiation process Godbole told Business Standard As far as the restructuring of the PPA and other recommendations made by the committee with regards to the DPC project are concerned there was unanimity among all the members The committees report notes The exact terms need to be agreed between the contracting parties but in the committees opinion unless the negotiations proceed on these broad guidelines and various parties make concessions of this magnitude the ultimate result is likely to be as infructuous as the earlier renegotiations in The concessions recommended by the committee include the seperation of the LNG facility It is critical that the cost of this facility be distributed over its entire capacity and not just over the amount sold to the power plant the LNG facility be seperated into a distinct facility whose capital costs are reflected in the fuel charge not as take or pay but only in proportion to the extent of fuel regasified for power generation compared to the total regasification capacity Also recommended are renegotiation of the LNG supply and shipping agreements converting the tariff into twoparts removal of all dollar denomination in the fixed charge component and financial restructuring of DPC and cancellation of escrow agreement amongst other things Meanwhile president of Enron Indian Wade Kline when contacted offered no comments on the DPC issue Industrial Management ENERGY DENMARK INHERITS THE WIND The tiny country now leads the world in windmill technology By William Echikson in Ringkobing Denmark with Janet Ginsburg in Chicago Business Week B Copyright McGrawHill Inc Gabled redbrick farmhouses dot the gently rolling green fields of the Jutland peninsula on Denmarks west coast Its a scene straight out of a Hans Christian Andersen fairy taleexcept for one prominent feature Rising stories are spaceage white towers topped with giant threebladed propellers that span feet Windmills have been part of Denmarks landscape for centuriesbut not like these and never with so much economic impact Many of our farmers make more money out of power generation than farming says Johannes Poulsen managing director of Vestas Wind System Vestas leads a cluster of companies that have made tiny Denmark population million the worlds top producer and exporter of windmills For Denmark wind power is a fairy tale come true Not only does the wind industry supply about of Denmarks power but Danish companies currently control about of the billion global windmill market and their share is increasing Whats more the market itself has been growing by to a year since the late s creating a tidy windfall for the manufacturers Vestas for example has seen its stock rise twentyfold in three years Revenues grew by last year to million and profits hit million Wind is the great energy success story of the last decade says Roderick Bridge an analyst at HSBC Investment Bank in London FLAWED POLICY The US could have played a bigger role American companies began to build the first generation of truly modern windmills in the early s armed with Carterera tax credits aimed at promoting green energy The credits got the industry off the ground but the policy was flawed Both the Federal government and California offered tax credits only for the installation of windmills not for operating and maintaining them So when the windmills broke down they were often simply left to rust After energy prices fell and funding for wind programs under Ronald Reagan contracted the US gave up its lead in wind technology It was Uncle Sam that birthed the industry then lost it to the rest of the world laments James Dehlsen founder of US turbine maker Zond Corp which was sold later to Houstonbased Enron Corp Denmarks public policy has been more consistent and was better conceived from the start The government chose to pay windmill owners abovemarket prices for their power subsidizing upkeep and investment in new technology The original California system encouraged doctors and dentists to buy wind turbines says Vestas Poulsen but our wind producers have much more of an incentive to care whether they work Another difference From the beginning Danish windmill makers knew they needed to export Our small home market gives us no choice says Per Hornung Pedersen chief financial officer at the secondlargest Danish producer NEG Micon This early export focus gave the Danes a leg up on big competitors in Germany and Spain Wise technology choices helped the Danes build on the generous government support While US manufacturers working with aerospace technology concentrated on lightweight materials that were efficient but fragile Danish companies started off as heavyduty farm machinery makers The original Danish turbines were more than twice the weight of comparable American turbines and proved much more durable recalls Birger T Madsen managing director of Denmarkbased BTM Consult a leading wind power consultancy Gradually the Danes improved the efficiency of their devices Where early models were outfitted with kilowatt generators todays models can churn out as much as of megawatts enough to power homes Larger and megawatt machines are under developmentsome of them destined for offshore environments where the wind is reliable but storms waves and salty conditions demand unprecedented ruggedness And improvements in computerized control systems are helping turbines squeeze out more watts from the wind more efficiently The best windmills now can produce a kilowatthour of electricity for about centshalf the cost of five years ago and approaching the price of power generated by gasfired plants Still the wind business must overcome some giant hurdles starting with political risks In the US a tax credit for wind power comes up for congressional renewal this December at a time when President George W Bush is pushing for a cut in federal funding for renewable power and conservation programs And even though wind power is increasingly cost competitive many wouldbe windmill operators in both the US and Europe still need subsidies to win longterm financing So if the tax credit isnt renewed the Danes largest market could blow away LITTLE SECRET Critics contend that the subsidies themselves are a problem They argue that wind power will never prove its merit until the artificial tax credits and price supports on both sides of the Atlantic are removed The Danish government pays more than million to wind generators every year Partly as a result of those high subsidies the Danes pay the highest rates for electricity in the world argues Brian OConnell author of a book critical of renewable energy policies Skeptics have other objections as well Birds sometimes get chopped in the turbines And people who live near wind farms often say they are an eyesore But the biggest problems are intrinsic Windmills only produce when the wind is up and for now there is no way to store the surplus electricity Until that issue is resolved BTM Consult figures wind systems could supply a maximum of about a third of global electricity demand Thats much more than now but with solar and other renewables lagging far behind the difference would still have to be made up by fossil fuels At least some of winds liabilities may eventually be solved Powerstorage technologies are in development in laboratories around the world And while the US has officially repudiated the Kyoto Protocol which called for dramatic cuts in carbon emissions other governments are likely to encourage more wind power as part of the effort to reduce greenhouse gases The European Union for one has set targets for a fivefold growth of renewable energy by Worldwide the Danes face growing competition from ABB The giant SwedishSwiss power company recently announced a novel type of gearless windmill that converts turbine rotation to energy by means of a magnetrun transformerless highvoltage generator Since the gearbox is often a source of trouble ABBs gearless device could make a big splash in the market Nevertheless many analysts believe the Danes have a comfortable edge NEG Micon recently raised million in fresh financing and is expected to report a profit for Its stock has more than tripled over the past year yielding a market cap up to billion Vestas market cap is billion and privately held companies report soaring sales Already the windmill business has revived rural Jutlands economy which previously struggled along on shipbuilding fishing and farming When the shipyard in the town of Ringkobing went broke in Vestas converted the facilities to make windmills Now its expanding the site and has doubled its workforce to in the past five years All the shipyard workers got jobs here says Vestas welder Thomas Knudsen Wind power may look like an anachronism But its gaining ground more quickly than other renewable sources It may well turn

Business Week EU Copyright McGrawHill Inc When President Bush discarded the Kyoto Protocolan international agreement to cut emissions of carbon dioxide and other globalwarming gaseshe blamed the decision on a slowing US economy and an energy crisis The idea of placing caps on CO does not make economic sense for America Bush said on Mar Some of the worlds largest companies disagree DuPont for example has already made substantial cuts in its greenhousegas emissions and says it will continue to do so despite the Administrations reluctance The announcements around Kyoto dont change our resolve says Paul Tebo corporate vicepresident for safety health and environment at DuPont Why Because the companys environmental program pays off in enhanced shareholder value says Tebo You cant measure this to the penny but it is very real Corporate reputation is a very valuable part of our company GOOD SENSE DuPont is not alone On Apr the Business Roundtable proposed various solutions to the globalwarming problem in a report titled Unleashing Innovation The Right Approach to Global Climate Change Earnest W Deavenport chairman and chief executive of Eastman Chemical Co who chaired the Business Roundtables environment task force said the report represents the business communitys interest in being part of the solution to concerns about global climate change Increasingly corporations are deciding to join efforts to curb global warming because the strategy makes good business sense Others include BP Amoco Royal DutchShell Ford and General Motorsall companies that would be expected to fight limits on greenhousegas emissions Until recently these four companies were members of the Global Climate Coalition a group formed to oppose mandatory limits on greenhouse emissions All have pulled out BP and Shell arent stopping with that gesture They have joined two dozen other companiesincluding Alcoa Enron GeorgiaPacific and Toyotain a new group called the Pew Center on Global Climate Change The center brings companies together to search for solutions to the globalwarming problem I think they are convinced that at one time or another there will be regulation of greenhouse gases because this is a real problem says Pew Center President Eileen Claussen Its difficult to know whether the companies will keep their resolve when the time comes to act on their pledges to cut emissions Some of them however have already begun to act BP and Shell for example have each established internal emissionstrading schemes The idea is to reduce emissions more than necessary where it is economical to do so creating emissions permits to be sold to other units within the company If emissions trading among companies becomes a reality BP and Shell unlike their competitors will already know how to use it to their advantage The Big Three auto makers have likewise jumped ahead of regulators with a game of oneupsmanship to boost vehicle mileage Ford Motor Co took the lead in when it publicly promised to improve the fuel economy of all its SUVs by over five years General Motors Corp promised to beat Fords improvements And DaimlerChrysler has just joined the game saying it will meet or beat any Ford SUV fueleconomy gains These moves represent a significant change in corporate behavior So far it has been mostly promises But if those promises arent kept environmental groups which are watching very closely will do their best to stage a public flogging The Bush Administration with its narrow view of the worlds energy problems sees boosts in oil exploration and production as nonnegotiable goals Cheap energy is good for the economy and boosting supply is one way to help bring down prices But the Administration has given no hint that it perceives global warming as a serious problem And such a stance carries a risk While some uncertainty remains about the consequences of global warming the overwhelming evidence suggests that the phenomenon is real The probusiness

Report And the Winners Are Six European Schools Rank Among Worlds Top MBA Programs By Ronald Alsop and Edward Taylor Staff Reporters The Wall Street Journal Europe Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Six European institutions rank among the worlds best business schools in a new Wall Street Journal survey of corporate recruiters In a result thats sure to surprise many business schools and students alike ESADE of Spain INSEAD of France and IMD of Switzerland beat such elite American institutions as Columbia University the University of California at Los Angeles and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology The other European schools in the top are London Business School of the UK and Instituto de Empresa and IESE of Spain The Tuck School at Dartmouth College the worlds first graduate school of business ranks No in the Journals first survey of MBA recruiters Darmouth beat out such institutions as Harvard University Stanford University and the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania Recruiters who rated the schools in an online survey praised Dartmouths small collegial MBA program for producing general managers who make loyal team players For more on Dartmouth see the story on page Close behind Dartmouth in second and third place were two other small MBA programs with fewer than fulltime students Carnegie Mellon Universitys Graduate School of Industrial Administration and Yale Universitys School of Management Both received high marks for their students teamwork strengths and analytical and problemsolving skills The rankings are based on a survey conducted last fall by Harris Interactive Inc in which recruiters rated schools they knew from firsthand experience The survey reached people in the field doing the actual recruiting the heads of business units line managers and others not just the humanresources executives stationed at corporate headquarters Each school was ranked on factors that influence a recruiters decision to visit a particular campus and hire a particular graduate such as the careerservices office the core curriculum and students leadership potential and teamwork skills In addition a schools final ranking took into account its mass appeal based on the number of recruiters who rated it Theres no question that all of the schools in the study offer quality MBA programs But The Wall Street JournalHarris Interactive study of MBA programs is the only major survey that focuses exclusively on the opinions of recruiters the buyers of MBA talent Consider it a consumers ranking of MBA programs with results that differ considerably from those in other businessschool guides The MBA programs outside the US made a strong showing in the survey representing nearly of the ranked business schools Thats especially impressive because of the recruiters rated only US schools selected nonUS schools only and selected both American and nonUS schools The MBA degree an American creation is being offered by more universities and their graduates appeal to multinational companies seeking managers with a strong international perspective Canada claims the highestranked nonUS school the University of Western Ontario in nd place while the six European schools are joined by one in Mexico and a second one in Canada Theres a very good showing of nonUS schools in the survey says Joy Sever a senior vice president at Harris Interactive For some of the schools it may have been the first time they had been approached to participate in a ranking Moreover she says peoples assumptions about whats best needs to be thought about in a different way given that several European schools outranked some American heavyweights Indeed the one of the biggest surprises of the survey is the mixed reviews garnered by the big prestigious business schools Some of the titans including Northwestern the University of Chicago and Harvard ranked in the top But Wharton placed only th and Columbia University MIT and Stanford finished much further down in the rankings Recruiters complained that graduates of some of the most prominent schools expect too much too soon in terms of salary and position and are difficult to retain for very long Not a single school in the Western US made it into the top The toprated school in the West the Haas School of Business at the University of California Berkeley placed st In fact recruiters say they have stopped visiting some of the California schools especially Stanford because their graduates are simply unwilling to leave the sunshine and Silicon Valley behind Business schools in California also lagged behind the other schools on students leadership potential their general management point of view and recruiter satisfaction with the careerservices office What school is best depends on the recruiters needs says recruiter Laura Barker Morse at venturecapital firm Atlas Venture The Bostonbased recruiting principal has recruited for earlystage technology companies in the US and Europe for more than years choosing students from Harvard Stanford MIT Berkeley Wharton Columbia and INSEAD because they met certain needs We want to be helpful to our fast growing companies So for a strong technology and business orientation in Europe we tend to go to INSEAD which uses the casestudy method patterned after Harvard Ms Barker Morse says But for European companies we also go out of our way to get to know the Europeans who attend US schools What set the top schools apart from the rest For one thing they significantly outscored the others on five specific attributes teaching analytical and problemsolving skills recruiters past success with the quality of graduates hired from that school the schools preparation of students for the New Economy graduates strategic thinking and chemistry or general good feelings about the school Many of the topranked schools also received high scores for their graduates communication and interpersonal skills which nine out of recruiters said they consider very important Jeff Puzas a manager at the consulting firm PRTM in Washington DC has recruited at both Harvard and Carnegie Mellon and believes Carnegie Mellon has the edge in analytical and technical skills while graduates of Harvard excel in interpersonal communication Interpersonal skills are like a sixth sense and have been highly underrated as a differentiating factor for students says Mr Puzas a Carnegie Mellon graduate Most of what I do every day as a management consultant has to do with interpersonal skills not my IQ The need for companies to effectively communicate with clients means Elena Florez Spanish recruiting coordinator for American Management Systems Inc in Madrid recruits mainly from IESE the International Graduate School of Management in Barcelona and Instituto de Empresa in Madrid In Spain not many people speak English so we need people who can understand the language and culture she says Being small clearly was a virtue for many of the business schools in the survey Half of the top schools and of the top report fulltime MBA enrollments of fewer than students In general recruiters say they find graduates of small MBA programs more collaborative and personable than their counterparts at large schools Paolo Raffaelli key account manager at Guidant Corp a US developer of cardiovascular products says smaller schools like Switzerlands IMD with a class size of around students offer a more intimate studying environment This allows faculty to observe each student more closely he says As one survey respondent remarks about Switzerlands IMD theres a real focus on getting students a great job that is a really good fit Another respondent Julie Hamrick president of Ignite Sales a fouryearold Internet marketing firm in Dallas has visited business schools of all sizes But we find time and time again betterprepared students at the small schools theyre less theoretical more handson she says They also seem more teamoriented and its critically important that you can rely on every member of the team in a startup like mine Adds a recruiter who has hired students from IMD Small is clearly stronger Ms Hamrick scouts for MBA talent at her alma mater Southern Methodist University which ranked ninth in the survey and has a fulltime MBA enrollment of She also has recruited at Dartmouth with fulltime students and found that in many ways it epitomizes the smallschool environment The studentfaculty ratio is to team projects figure heavily in the curriculum and many students live in campus dorms and belong to school hockey teams and ski groups in remote snowy Hanover New Hampshire You have to get along at a small business school like Tuck theres no place to hide says Bill Sones a consultant for a software company in Boston who received his MBA degree from Yale in The student and alumni networks are very closeknit at Dartmouth and Yale Students arent out for No as much you dont have to watch your back But a small class size can sometimes work against a school Lucy Barry head of recruitment for Londonbased strategy consultants LEK Consulting recruits more people from Fontainebleaubased INSEAD than IMD in Lausanne Its a numbers game says Ms Barry We are more likely to find a candidate at a school with a larger class size particularly if there are a large number of recruiters INSEAD has nearly MBA students in Fontainebleau and Singapore The businessschool survey included an academics section in which recruiters nominated schools they considered exceptional in certain fields of study Three schools placed first in two different academic disciplines Wharton for accounting and finance Stanford for ecommerce and entrepreneurship and Harvard for general management and strategy But academic reputation had surprisingly little bearing on recruiters overall rankings of the schools Faculty and curriculum were among the leastsignificant factors in the survey That helps explain why some of the academic starts didnt dazzle recruiters and didnt necessarily receive a top ranking In the finer academic institutions virtually of the faculty are PhDs says Jack Bragin of the recruiting firm Michael Page International Inc But students can benefit from professors who are more streetwise and have more realworld experience Many recruiters said they find it especially difficult to compete for graduates from some of the academic elite That may change amid the economic slowdown as the job market eases But at the time of the survey respondents complained that they often came away from the elite schools emptyhanded because of graduates unrealistic salary and career expectations They also criticized the graduates for having arrogant attitudes and said they find few team players at some of the prestigious schools Recruiters are clearly ambivalent about schools like Harvard which they overwhelmingly name as the MBA program with the most competitive environment They see it as the gold standard of business schools but the largest number think of arrogance when asked what first comes to mind when they hear the Harvard name Even so when recruiters were asked which school they would choose to get an MBA degree Harvard ranked third in number of mentions Harvard graduates I have interviewed are discernibly different from other Ivy League graduates more wellrounded entrepreneurial and worldy says Mr Bragin But you have to deal with their excessive expectations about what their MBA degree will get them Some seem to expect to be CEO within two years Kristin Gandy associate recruiter for Enron Corp was disappointed with her visit to MIT last year She recalls that about half the students on her interview schedule failed to show up and didnt bother to call or write a letter of apology We didnt have a good fall season at MIT and werent at all pleased with the results Ms Gandy says But she adds the school seems to be changing for the better this year under its new careerdevelopment director Indeed Jackie Wilbur the new director says MIT students will now lose recruiting services if they miss interviews MITs Sloan School of Management ranked th in the survey and received its lowest scores for its careerservices office value for the money spent on the recruiting effort and companies success in retaining its graduates Richard Schmalensee the Sloan Schools dean is sympathetic to recruiters frustrations but he doesnt apologize for his students selectivity You can make the argument that our students are expensive and hard to keep Mr Schmalensee says But if they werent Id have a problem with that People who like to take risks and are looking for challenging work are drawn to MIT Tim Butler director of MBA career development programs at Harvard believes recruiters too quickly blame the schools for their low recruiting yield or their inability to retain the graduates they do hire The real issue often is the attractiveness of the company and its ability to develop their careers and keep them interested he says Companies think only of pay as a way to keep employees They need to think more creatively of how to excite these top performers The Rating Criteria Recruiters rated business schools and their students on these attributes School Attributes The careerservices office at that school The past success recruiters have had in terms of the number of graduates they have hired from that school The past success theyve had with the quality of graduates they have hired from that school The core curriculum A particular specialty that is offered at that school The faculty The students average number of years of work experience The willingness of the schools students to relocate to the job location recruiters require The longterm success recruiters have had with students hired from the school The success they have had retaining students hired from the school The schools success in preparing students for the New Economy

right Fred Vogelstein Reporter Associate Paola Hjelt Fortune Magazine Time Inc Copyright Visit the folks at Boeing these days and if theyre not too busy fending off chagrined Seattleites theyll talk your ear off Theres just a good chance that the conversation wont be about planes Dont misinterpret this The past year has been kind to the thlargest company in the world Revenues fell but earnings and operating margins were surprisingly strong And while every stock big and small seemed to crater Boeings shares are up some since April of last year But just building planes isnt doing it anymore at Boeing Demand for jets is slowing as airlines consolidate and competition from Airbus is pressuring margins So whats got Boeing execs really fired up lately You guessed it the Internet Whos going to buy a jet online you may ask Who knows Who cares respond Boeing execs Thats not why theyre consumed with the Internet Boeing doesnt want to be the Amazoncom of the aerospace industry What Boeing wants to do is rethink its business It needs to build planes faster and for less money More significant it needs to get into less cyclical highermargin businesses like aircraft maintenance The math here is pretty simple Boeing earns margins building planes It can make more than margins servicing them Theoretically at least the Internet will make doing all this easier in other cases it will make it possible Whats happening at Boeing is hardly new A handful of corporate executives like John Chambers Larry Ellison Kenneth Lay Michael Dell and Jack Welch have understood the power of the Internet for years Its why virtually no paper changes hands at Cisco its why Oracle could even claim to have saved billion a year its why Enron has been able to transform itself from a lowmargin natural gas supplier to a highmargin energytrading firm its why Dell has no stores and no inventory and its why GE can boast it will more than double pretax earnings in the next few years The difference today is that the stakes are much higher Embracing the Net when the economy was booming and few competitors understood the technology was one thing Then failure could be repositioned as a learning experience Now with recessionnot stock optionsthe dominant topic at cocktail parties there is little room to screw up Investors are demanding fiscal discipline and so technology budgets are tightening expected to grow just to this year down from last year At the same time the pressure on corporations to develop a Net game before their competitors do is only growing Its a scary combination At a recent conference Merrill Lynch CEO David Komansky said he couldnt remember a time at least in his business when there was such an enormous premium on being right The pressure isnt keeping them from trying Even with tech spending slowing when it comes to using the Web to make operations more efficient few CEOs are scaling back according to Chuck Phillips a Morgan Stanley analyst who regularly surveys chief information officers Ralph Szygenda GMs CIO brags that hes cut GMs tech spending by in five years to billion and still made a billion investment in ebusiness For companies just now gearing up theyre lucky The Net has been with us long enough that a handful of lessons are emerging Looking at Boeings Internet strategy is particularly instructive It may be the most ambitious of any major corporation yet True GE and the automakers too are using the Internet to run their core businesses better But talk to Boeing execs and youll find that everything at the company is being reexamined from how it interacts with its customers and suppliers right down to whether plane making should be its core business The goal is to change the entire fabric of the company Part of the reason for the overhaul is that for such a hightech operation Boeing until recently was a pretty backward place Sure the company liked to think it knew more about building planes than anyone in the world but good luck trying to get your hands on that information after the planes were built Much of its extensive knowledge about aerospace design and manufacturing was locked in giant paper binders or in one of incompatible procurement computer systems The only people who could find it were people who knew where to look Even until the middle of last year suppliers could be making the same part for a handful of Boeing divisions and because of the distinct procurement computers get different contracts A big chunk of the work is finished but theres still more to do Many small parts like brackets which connect overhead bins to the fuselage are still designed and manufactured from scratch every time Right now if you wanted to look inside Boeing to see if another division had manufactured a part with the specs you needed you cant do that says CIO Scott Griffin Digitizing the data is already helping to solve the problems Even better its helping trim costs Boeing generates a billion pages of paper a year building planes In two years Griffin wants to have cut that by to There are costs in printing paper in managing it in shipping it he says None of this has anything to do with building a plane Its evil he says like inventory The hope to run Boeing as efficiently as Cisco where memos invoices engineering drawingsvirtually everythinghappen over the Net instead of on paper Eventually as Boeing goes down this road Webifying the company will help ease entry into new lines of business and increase sales To compete in the maintenance market Boeing is arming its crews with wireless devices that connect to the companys databases If a crew member wants to consult the manual while on the tarmac he can do so without having to drive back to the hangar This summer Boeing is going to begin purchasing airplane production parts online from its suppliers Standardizing and reducing the number of parts has helped boost margins on planebuilding to from in Last month for the first time Boeing conducted an online reverse auction for natural gas which it uses to heat many of its plants It got the gas cheaper and sealed the deal in a few hours instead of several weeks And the company is increasingly giving its customers the easy access to Boeing information they crave On myboeingfleetcom customers can now research design and maintenance issues for almost all of the airlines commercial fleet and order many of the parts they need The upshot Online sales of Boeing spare parts are up more than and where Boeing once retained some employees just to handle faxes and phone calls from its customers it now does the same work with people The ultimate payoff for Boeing could be huge But its strategy is fraught with risks Think about it In maintenance one of Boeings big competitorsGEis also one of its biggest customers More broadly Boeing is spending millions of dollars to get its employees to change the way they work And people dont like to change the way they do anything For Griffin or any of Boeings senior executives implementing all this isnt particularly glamorous work Not like say buying or turning around companies Webifying is an expensive disruptive unsexy management challenge When Boeing started on its reengineering four years ago costs skyrocketed and at first productivity dropped Its like fixing subway tracks a necessary evil that when completed goes largely unnoticed Look at whats happened to Nike Last year the company decided to automate its entire supply chain so that when retailers ordered shoes they could do it on the Nike site The hope was that the system would automatically take payments deliver the shoes and when supplies dropped notify the manufacturers in Asia The reality was that Nike wound up with too much inventory in some models and not enough in others Earnings for the quarter ended Feb fell as a result Analysts believe the problem will take the rest of the year at leastto correct This is what we get for our million wondered Nike Chairman Phil Knight What makes Boeings strategy even riskier is that theres no guarantee that success will lead to a lasting competitive advantage Charles Schwab is learning that right now It revolutionized the brokerage industry in early when it started allowing clients to research buy and sell stocks online By mid that experiment had proven so successful that big brokerage firms were quaking For a few weeks Schwabs market cap exceeded Merrill Lynchs even though Schwab had onefifth its sales That isnt so anymore Merrill and the other big firms launched their own electronic trading products soon after and today Merrills offerings are as sophisticated as Schwabs Schwabs market capitalization is now less than half Merrills So whats a big ol corporation to do Here are four lessons Grab the lowhanging fruit first The conventional wisdom among consultants and other reengineering cognoscenti is that in order to truly leverage a business on the Internet one has to follow Boeings lead and rethink the business model from the top down Otherwise says Ray Lane a partner at Kleiner Perkins and the former No at Oracle the process stalls as yearold department heads who think they know everything get caught in turf battles He may be right But most companies dont have the stomach for that kind of risk Indeed the nearbilliondollar cargo operations of United and American airlines are taking a different tack Theyve started small teaming up with a new Dallas company called NextJet to offer businesses and consumers doortodoor sameday package delivery On domestic flights a huge percentage of passenger planes cargo space goes unused Airlines have long sold this excess space but it was up to the sender to get the package to the airport find the right flight and arrange to have the package picked up at the destination NextJet created software that trolled reservation systems figured out the quickest way to route packages and worked with couriers for delivery American and United simply rebranded NextJets system and stuck it on their Websites The result United started offering the service in early March and says that in the first three weeks it scored steady customers with zero marketing We had everyone from architects and lawyers needing to get documents across the country by days end to parents on vacation sending house keys to their lockedout teenage children says Jim Hartigan who runs the United Cargo operation At a pop each package is like having an extra passengerand you dont have to feed the cargo or give it legroom Soon United will market the service more aggressively to corporate customers Hartigan says he can see doubling the size of Uniteds cargo business using the Net But starting small helps his team understand the pitfalls of the business without too much risk Dont get fixated on the technology Certainly the right hardware and software are important to be successful But they are catalysts not solutions says Adrian Slywotsky a consultant at Mercer Management in Boston Webifying a business is about getting employees to work more efficiently he says And that has everything to do with good management and little to do with technology Not that many CEOs get it To this day most start with the technology rather than the business issues he says Lisa Harris the CIO at Staff Leasing a billion Florida company that acts as the HR department for small to medium sized businesses says her company learned that lesson the hard way It spent millions on an online system two years ago with the idea of using the Net to offer customers hour selfservice HR support backed up by a call center to answer more complicated questions The only trouble was that operators in the call center were being evaluated based on how many calls they answered As a result they didnt encourage clients to use the Website but rather to continue calling with their questions The solution Staff Leasing began evaluating callcenter operators not just on volume of calls answered but on errors generated In addition the company started handing operators bonuses for every account they moved to the Web It was BF Skinner meets the Web Operators could do things the old way make a mistake and get penalized or they could get a bonus for doing things the new way They quickly fell in line Then another problem cropped up Once customers became comfortable using the Web to handle basic HR needs the only questions they had for the operators were questions most couldnt answer Difficult dilemmas had previously been handled by specially trained HR consultants Solution Fire some callcenter operators retrain others and hire more consultants Today with of Staff Leasings customers using the Web the company has cut million a year in expenses A good lesson says Harris but one that took too long to figure out When we started the project it was strictly an infotech operation she says It wasnt until a year later that it became a project sponsored by the entire business Its not about cutting out the middleman Two years ago the chief benefit of a Web strategy was in allowing manufacturers to bypass distributors and reach out directly to customers But today middlemen seem if anything to be thriving Most early attempts to eliminate distributors have failed What happened The Internet enabled manufacturers to sell directly to customers but it didnt teach them how to sell It turned out that their distributors lengthy relationships with their customers werent easily broken In most markets middlemen are the basis of trust to do the transaction says Michael Nevens a consultant at McKinsey Co in Palo Alto Calif Look at the resale market for semiconductors he says When manufacturers have excess chips they dont want to advertise that because it drives the price down but they still want to sell them Meanwhile chip buyers want to be sure the chips they are getting are of good quality Who solves that problem A middleman both parties trust In the computer hardware business for example there were a flood of online catalog companies like Buycom which were convinced that the Internet would quickly kill off the salesman and that the only way to compete was on price Computer retailing giant CDW wasnt one of them Instead it embraced its middleman status and made big investments in staff not just technology to pull it off In CDW started bulking up growing from salesmen to nearly by the end of last year The result a record year for revenue growth and earnings To make this strategy work CDW made sure that salesmen got a commission even when the sale went through the Internet Small and mediumsized businesses need efficiency but there also are certain situations where you just need to talk to someone says Jim Shanks CDWs CIO Sure a large percentage of our business comes unassisted through the Web but the majority of the business is one where a customer gets educated and then calls the account manager Dont reject plans with hardtomeasure results Department store and advertising pioneer John Wanamaker once noted that half his advertising was wasted he just didnt know which half Its a cute way of saying that while advertising works its bottomline benefit is hard if not impossible to measure Some Internet initiatives are going to be like that too The smart companies will pursue them Fidelity Investments for example last year began offering Web based k administration for small companies Its been an instant hit The program added companies last year Historically its been hard for small companies to have k benefits because administrators charged too much or in Fidelitys case didnt offer them at all because they were too expensive to operate Whats in it for Fidelity Well the program was expensive to set up isnt profitable and doesnt generate big fees But ek isnt being measured by how much money it makes Its about taking a small risk on a technology that might prove to be essentialboth to getting into a new market and to discovering new tools for existing customers I had this same discussion in the early s when we went after the middle market says Steve Elterich president of Fidelity eBusiness At that point no one was offering k services to them Thats now our most profitable market segment Why A lot of those companieslike Microsofthave grown into very very big companies Digesting all this change wont be easy The Internet isnt just some passing management fad but a fundamental shift in the way Americans and the world conduct business Indeed some consultants like Don Tapscott still believe its impact will be as profound as the impact of the corporation itself more than a century ago It wont happen fast but it will happen For those whose first inclination is to bury their head in the sand at least until the economy picks up Resist Now is the time to look around and learn from those who have already made their mistakes REPORTER ASSOCIATE

Lee Raymond Tries to Prove Bigger Is Better Published in May issue of Bloomberg Markets Irving Texas April Bloomberg Exxon Mobil Corps Hoover Diana drilling platform floats in the sapphireblue barracudafilled waters of the Gulf of Mexico about miles off the coast of Galveston Texas The platforms three decks provide more than acres of living and working space as it taps the more than million barrels of oil and gas trapped in two adjacent fields feet below This massive project cost billion a sum only an oil company with assets by the barrelful can afford Thats a point Lee Raymond Exxon Mobils chairman and chief executive has made repeatedly as he faces the toughest challenge of his career convincing investors that his billion acquisition of Mobil Corp on November was a good idea that bigger really is better Raymond has weapons to make his case The marriage of Exxon Corp and Mobil Corp created a behemoth with billion in assets including oil and gas fields in countries and territories on six continents refineries that sell about million gallons of fuel a day in countries and service stations worldwide This should be his moment With Internet and dotcom stocks in decline investors are looking harder at the value Big Oil companies provide theres an oilpatch veteran in the White House and those pesky environmentalists are in retreat Stellar Balance Sheet Raymond can point to a stellar balance sheet as well Last year Exxon Mobil squeezed out of those formidable assets a profit of billion which was more than double the year earlier and a record for a publicly traded company Revenue increased percent to billion also a record For the first quarter of this year revenue rose percent to billion and profit climbed percent to billion The Irving Texasbased enterprise is now by far the largest publicly traded company on earth in terms of revenue and profit Past revenue title holder General Motors Corp brought in billion in and WalMart Stores Inc s No had sales of billion Royal DutchShell Group the No publicly traded oil company earned billion from revenue of billion and No BP Amoco Plc earned billion from revenue of billion For further comparison the No through No US oil companies Chevron Corp Texaco Inc Conoco Inc and USXMarathon Group had combined earnings of billion from combined revenue of billion Not Much Enthusiasm Investors havent shown much enthusiasm for Exxon Mobil this year The companys stock price on April is up percent for the year its shares have still traded at a discount to the Standard Poors Index which it has outperformed for years since If Exxon Mobils priceearnings ratio were to rise to the SPs level of from its recent level of the companys shares would cost up percent BP trades at times earnings Chevron at times and Texaco at Twenty one of the analysts who follow Exxon Mobil rate the company a buy Investors question whether Exxon Mobil can sustain its performance if oil and gas prices fall About percent or billion of Exxon Mobils profits came from the sale of oil and gas prices of which rose percent and percent respectively year over year Refining Business The companys refining business brought in billion its chemical business earned billion and the remainder came from such operations as mining Some critics such as Enron Corp CEO Jeff Skilling say the company might be better off if it broke into its component parts Investors seem to agree Shares of Houstonbased EOG Resources Inc the former exploration and production arm of Enron more than tripled last year and shares of San Antoniobased refiner Valero Energy Corp rose percent Is it the best way to play energy No said Charles White of Avatar Associates which manages a little more than billion and counts Exxon Mobil shares as one of its largest holdings For instance if you wanted an exploration company and were willing to do the research and trade often youd be better off with EOG Apache Corp or Devon Energy But if youre just looking for a big company Exxon Mobil is the bellwether Other Critics Other critics including Michael Carpenter Citigroup Incs head of investment and corporate banking have labeled Exxon Mobils successful first full year a fluke The only companies in the world that make more money than we do today are a couple of oil companies that got lucky with high oil prices Carpenter told analysts in January Citigroup the biggest US financial services company earned billion last year With such critical shots aimed at his company Raymond often finds himself on the defensive He counters by pointing to the contributions that big projects like the Hoover and Diana fields will make down the line By the Hoover Diana operation could produce about barrels of oil and million cubic feet of gas a day At current prices that translates into more than billion of sales a year Protected From Price Fluctuations Raymond also proclaims that his company will make money irrespective of prices The detractors or the critics can say weve benefited from high oil and gas prices and theres no question that is true But thats not really the way we analyze the business he said Instead of saying Given a price heres what were going to do we went to the other side and said Lets accept that we cannot forecast the price so what can we do Thats a much more challenging task Oil and gas prices may actually have to fall for Exxon Mobil to prove itself When Exxon agreed to buy Mobil oil prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange were hovering around a barrel the lowest levels seen since the Great Depression The merger was supposed to create a company with an inventory of projects large enough and efficient enough to withstand those types of prices Per Barrel In its first full fiscal year as a company oil prices averaged more than a barrel It hasnt been tested on the low side Buying Mobil was just one of many steps Exxon has taken in the past decade or so to switch from focusing on growth to focusing on controlling costs Raymond cites the cost savings that the company has reaped following the merger Exxon Mobil has raised its mergerrelated savings estimate percent to billion a year in part by intending to cut jobs by New technology is integral to the costcutting effort Raymond who used to be with Exxons research group in Houston often refers to Exxon Mobil as the NASA of the sea Exxon Mobil spends more than million a year developing proprietary technology for everything from stronger steel so pipelines can take gas out of remote places like Alaska to platform designs for fields deeper than Hoover and Diana Deepwater Fields Because it can cost million to million to drill a single well at deepwater fields such as Hoover and Diana William Drennan the companys head geosciences researcher focuses on ensuring that few dry holes get dug He spends much of his day standing in front of a seamless foot screen in a blackedout room in Houston that looks like a miniaturized IMAX theater The auditorium contains stadiumstyle seats with large tables for note taking On the tables are D glasses that when worn turn the image on the screen into a hologram Drennan can then virtually walk through a map of an oil reservoir and working with his fellow scientists determine where wells should be drilled Last year advances in drilling methods and reservoir mapping helped Exxon Mobil cut to cents its cost to find a barrel of oil down from in Selective Investments Raymond says cost cutting is important because it forces Exxon Mobil to be more selective in its investments than its peers are A bad investment decision could be around for more than years he said In August he offered analysts a chart showing that from to BP wrote off billion worth of projects Shell wrote off billion and Exxon Mobil wrote off none If you look around youll see all of our competitors have had massive writeoffs Raymond said And what amazes me is that when that happens the investment community cheers and I kind of wonder Were they cheering when those investments were made Raymonds been applying his brand of frugality at Exxon since joining the company as a production research engineer in Tulsa Oklahoma in soon after receiving a PhD in chemical engineering from the University of Minnesota A native of Watertown South Dakota who attended the University of Wisconsin as an undergraduate Raymond moved up the ladder with Exxon in the US Venezuela and Aruba Exxon Nuclear He became president of Exxon Nuclear Co in and moved to New York in when he was named executive vice president of Exxon Enterprises a company that had principal responsibility for Exxons investments outside the areas of petroleum chemicals and minerals About that time oil companies cash rich from high prices and in the hopes of diversifying profits were making acquisitions in businesses they knew little about Exxon sold office equipment Mobil owned discount retailer Montgomery Ward The strategy reached the height of silliness when Gulf Corp later acquired by Chevron considered buying Ringling Brothers and Barnum Bailey Circus Analysts werent much more impressed with Exxons forays beyond oil They were especially turned off by Exxons billion purchase of Reliance Electric Co a Clevelandbased manufacturer of motors and electrical communications and weighing equipment in EnergySaving Device The company hoped to profit from technological developments contained in an energysaving device for electric motors the technology eventually proved to be commercially unfeasible By Raymond had been named president and director of what was then called Esso InterAmerica Inc with responsibilities for Exxons operations in the Caribbean and Central and South America so Reliances downfall wasnt his problem He was named a senior vice president and director of the corporation in Exxon sold Reliance for billion in in a leveraged buyout by a management group and what were then Citicorp Capital Investors and PrudentialBache Securities Inc That same year Exxon sold Exxon Nuclear and its share of the companys Rockefeller Center headquarters in Manhattan It would move to its current headquarters in Irving Texas in One year later Raymond became president of Exxon Corp He was named chairman and chief executive of Exxon Corp in April succeeding Lawrence Rawl who was about to reach the companys mandatory retirement age of Dark Suits White Shirts Raymond a man who favors dark suits white shirts and red ties has earned a reputation for handson management When he bought Mobil for example he and now retired Mobil head Lucio Lou Noto hammered out most of the details on their own waiting until due diligence to call in advisers Raymond said the ultimate lesson he learned in the years before he took control of Exxon is that efficiency is king for large companies If youre the most efficient competitor on a large scale then its axiomatic in my mind that youre going to end up over time with a very sound financial result and a very strong cash flow and a high return on capital employed which is what the objective of Exxon Mobil is Raymond said Return on Capital Exxon Mobils return on capital employed an industry measure of how effectively a company manages its capital was percent last year the highest in the industry Shells return was percent and BPs was percent according to the companies From to Exxon alone generated a return on capital employed of percent beating BP and Shell which each returned percent I believe they will continue to have the best returns on capital employed which ensures their premium valuation said Denis Walsh of Bostonbased State Street Corp Exxon Mobils fourthlargest shareholder State Street as of December held about million Exxon Mobil shares Under Raymond Exxon Mobil has focused on capital discipline It is one of just seven public corporations worldwide with AAA credit ratings by both Standard Poors Ratings Services and Moodys Investors Service it can therefore borrow money at about percent or less Net Debt At the end of Exxon Mobil had billion in net debt which included billion in debt and billion in cash Thats about percent of its total capital compared with an average of percent for the SP percent at other major oil companies and percent for the oil industry analysts say In its entire year history Exxon Mobil has never been more able to deploy technology throughout its system say analysts Thats because when Exxon merged with Mobil it also restructured the company Instead of only rolling Mobils assets into Exxons existing corporate structure Raymond and Noto decided to set up an entirely new company organization changing from dozens of regionalbased business units into global businesses Five divisions based in Houston find and produce oil and gas Chemical and coal operations are also based there And four divisions based in Fairfax Virginia make and sell fuels New Ideas Across Old Boundaries The new structure is designed to promote new ideas across old boundaries Stephen Hart who manages Exxon Mobils Baytown Texas refinery said one of the first steps in that process dubbed cold eyes involved sending Mobil employees through his plants to see how they would do things differently The refinery North Americas largest can process barrels of crude oil daily It was like Christmas being able to find out how each other did things Hart said I know guys who have wanted to get into Baytown for years Sharing best practices doesnt always work During one of the coldeyes tours former Mobil employees identified what they thought was a way to reduce the maintenance time on Baytowns catalytic cracker a plant used to make gasoline to days from days Hart says that due to unrelated issues they werent able to complete the maintenance that fast How To Be Attractive Still the effort continues You have to be the lowestcost producer to be attractive in this business Hart said One of the powers of Exxon and Mobil coming together is weve now got the best brains in chemistry refining engineering et cetera to figure out how to be the leader in every product we produce Jim Guerra an Exxon employee for years said employees are linked by a former Mobil tool called BestNet an intranet message system Before the advent of BestNet if he had a problem with a catalytic cracking unit he was supposed to call a regional central engineer on the phone and ask for advice This could take up to a day if the engineer was in the field Now Guerra and employees like him use BestNet to post questions and instantly receive answers from colleagues around the world who have wide experience Efficient Deepwater Drilling Efficient deepwater drilling will be crucial to the companys financial future Although oil and gas companies have begun to explore only half the known deepwater basins theyve already found the equivalent of more than billion barrels of oil and over billion more barrels remain to be found Exxon Mobil leads the industry in deepwater prospects with nearly blocks worldwide that cover more than million acres an area the size of France Next year the company plans to tap two fields near Hoover and Diana called Marshall and Madison that hold another million barrels moving the company toward an ambitious goal of boosting worldwide production percent a year through The company is also involved in nine other Gulf of Mexico discoveries in waters deeper than feet that are currently producing or advancing toward development The companys geologists expect these fields to hold more than billion barrels of oil and gas Balance Sheet in Good Shape Because Exxon Mobils balance sheet is in good shape it can focus on finding other things besides debt reduction on which to spend the more than billion in cash it generates annually Generally the options include acquisitions capital spending stock buybacks and dividend increases Analysts dont expect the company to make any sizable acquisitions until after the company sells off some of the assets it gained in the merger They will remain disciplined in their focus on return on capital employed and not spend their free cash flow unwisely said State Streets Walsh As of January Exxon Mobil planned to spend up to billion on capital projects including developing oil fields and improving its refineries in up as much as percent over last year Though Raymond wont say what Exxon Mobil plans to divest Matthew Warburton an analyst at UBS Warburg in New York says the company will sell about billion of Mobils old oil and gas fields annually Sale of Aera Energy Fadel Gheit an analyst at Fahnestock Co says a prime candidate for sale is Exxon Mobils stake in Aera Energy LLC a joint venture with Shell in California that currently produces about barrels of oil and million cubic feet of gas a day Exxon Mobils share could be worth more than billion Investors will be surprised at the scope and size of the asset sales said Gheit Last year Exxon Mobil raised billion from asset sales required by federal regulators Exxon Mobil paid billion in dividends or a common share up from billion or a year earlier the th straight yearly increase That leaves stock repurchases for which the former Exxon Corp was famous From to Exxon repurchased more than billion of its common shares at a cost of about billion Mobil purchased about million shares during that period for about billion Continuous Buyback Through the end of Exxon Mobil purchased million shares at a cost of about billion Instead of announcing a level for buybacks like Shells billion goal Exxon Mobil buys continuously With shares as undervalued as they are UBS Warburgs Warburton said the company could repurchase billion of stock in Because of the companys stature Exxon Mobil shares often serve as a proxy for the energy industry said Michael LaBranche chairman and chief executive of LaBranche Co As the companys specialist on the New York Stock Exchange LaBranche is responsible for raising the volume of Exxon Mobil shares traded on the exchange An average of about million of Exxon Mobils billion common shares outstanding change hands daily up from about million daily last year That kind of liquidity is good when a company is trying to attract large institutional investors Fidelity and Barclays Exxon Mobils two largest shareholders are Fidelity Investments and Barclays Global Investors both of which sell many indexrelated funds Many of these funds must own Exxon Mobil shares because the company makes up a large percentage of key indexes such as the SP and the Dow Jones Industrial Average For example of every invested in an SP fund buys Exxon Mobil shares Only General Electric Co at and Microsoft Corp at get more of the investment Exxon Mobil shares make up percent of the Dow There are side effects to this status Some investors use Exxon Mobils liquidity to treat the company like a bank buying the companys shares and holding them until their favorite stock starts to rise again This is something the company has to suffer through in part because of its status as a defensive or antitechnology stock Exxon and the Nasdaq When the Nasdaq started to plummet in March you could often use the indexs daily performance to track how Exxon Mobil shares traded for the day Usually the relationship was an inverse one My wife has the view Raymond said that when she looks at the stock market in the morning if she sees the Nasdaq is up she says Well Im not even going to look at Exxon Mobil And if the Nasdaq is down she goes Hooray Exxons up dont even need to look That may no longer be true as investors beaten down by the drop in the Nasdaq so far this year search for companies that have earnings Exxon Mobil is the place to hide for the time being said Allen Ashcroft a portfolio manager with Allied Investment Advisors Inc This year Exxon Mobil is expected to earn a share or about billion according to First CallThomson Financial Estimates range from to a share or about billion to about billion Conventional Wisdom The conventional wisdom is that Exxons earnings last year were as good as it gets said Fahnestock analyst Gheit who used to be at Mobil Corp and who rates Exxon Mobil shares a buy but this old dog may have a few new tricks Size doesnt always guarantee success for Exxon Mobil In March the company lost to BP a contract to build a liquefied natural gas terminal in China And the company after being slapped with a billion judgment in its infamous Valdez oil spill in has since become a magnet for other large judgments including a billion case related to natural gas royalties in Alabama that the company has allegedly underpaid since Raymond Undaunted Raymond remains undaunted Putting Mobil together with Exxon gave us by far the largest asset base with more quality projects to do than anyone in our industry and you can be sure that were going to take advantage he said Raymond has yet to convince many investors of that And he wont get the respect he craves on Wall Street until he proves that his enormous enterprise is smarter than its rivals not just bigger David Wells in the New York newsroom or kl Story illustration For the most important Exxon Mobil news type XOM US EQUITY ICN GO SURVEY ENERGY UTILITY REVIEW US demand boosts marketplace LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS by David Buchan With prices for natural gas set to stay high LNG seems to be back in fashion Financial Times Apr By DAVID BUCHAN If the US is a drag on the world oil market with its enormous imports placing strains on prices its newfound appetite for liquefied natural gas LNG imports is wholly welcome In contrast to its effect on the oil market US demand is not raising the world price for gas because there is as yet no such thing but rather reflecting local north American hunger for gas At the same time US readiness to buy shortterm LNG cargoes is adding flexibility and depth to a world market characterised by longterm contracts and an apparently rigid supply line of specialised tanker ships carrying frozen gas from one billiondollar terminal to another The US has introduced a new dynamic into the market says Ron Billings head of ExxonMobils LNG business But LNG is an expensive business You need Dollars bn to get going says Dick de Jong Shells head of LNG with Dollars bn needed to build one train or unit liquefying m tonnes of gas a year and three tankers costing around Dollars m each to move the product And there have been false LNG dawns before In the mids when US importers of LNG found the deregulated price of domestic natural gas slipping below that of LNG they fought to wriggle out of their longterm LNG contracts and mothballed their LNG import terminals But with US natural gas prices double what they were a year ago and looking set to stay high the industry is scrambling to put the terminals back into operation The capacity of the largest at Lake Charles in Louisiana is being expanded and BP and Shell are buying capacity at Cove Point on the Chesapeake Bay which is due to start receiving LNG next year after a gap of two decades BP Chevron El Paso Phillips Petroleum and Enron are prospecting for sites for new import terminals on both coasts of the US the west coast has to rely on gas from the AsiaPacific region and the east coast on Atlantic basin gas because most LNG carriers are too big to pass through the Panama canal Right now LNG only amounts to per cent of total US demand says Skip Horvath president of the US Natural Gas Supply Association But it is very important to certain areas and it does not involve building extra pipelines which have become increasingly difficult to site in the US The US is also helping something like a spot market to develop in world LNG Of the spot cargoes of LNG traded last year many went to the US The upshot is that many companies are beginning to build a bit of spare capacity into their LNG plants Some companies such as BP are starting to order LNG ships which are not tied to any specific LNG contracts and which could therefore be available to carry spot cargoes Contracts are also becoming more flexible as shown in BPs recent contract to supply LNG to the Dominican Republic At years the contract was no shorter than the old norm But instead of pinning down the origin of the gas as is usual in LNG contracts it allows BP to supply the gas from anywhere within its portfolio though the gas will probably come from BPs plant in Trinidad and Tobago The export push of certain gasproducing countries is also conducive to the development of a more flexible market Nigeria for example is very keen to abolish the flaring of gas that comes up with oil extraction and sees LNG exports as the only feasible way of commercialising this gas Its current LNG gas is on longterm contract to Europe but last year for instance the Nigerian LNG consortium of Shell TotalFinaElf and Agip sold six spot cargoes to the US A consortium of US oil companies is looking at a second Nigerian LNG project Egypt is another enthusiast for LNG In the past six months it has signed three LNG deals one with Union Fenosa of Spain and two with AngloItalian partnerships of BP and Eni and of BG and Edison Like Nigeria Egypt appears to see the US especially with its current high prices as a useful supplement to its core European market But it is in Asia that LNG first started to overcome that regions long distances and lack of pipelines and it is still in Asia that the big volumes of LNG are traded Whether the Asian market becomes more flexible may depend on the balance in supply and demand in the Asian region On the supply side large Middle East LNG producers notably Qatar are making their presence felt alongside producers based in Indonesia Malaysia Brunei and Australias North West Shelf Qatars Rasgas is rapidly expanding its capacity in conjunction with ExxonMobil in particular to supply Indias Petronet with which it has the worlds largest LNG contract of m tonnes a year On the demand side India and China are clearly the big potential growth markets in a region where demand has been dominated by Japan South Korea and Taiwan But they may prove difficult and slow to develop as Enrons persistent payment problems in India have shown So the Asian market may develop into the sort of buyers market that would allow for instance the big Japanese utilities to negotiate the shorter and flexible contracts they want However there will be no revolution in LNG says Martin Houston a vicepresident of BG though the share of LNG traded short term could rise from to per cent by the end of the decade Mr Billings of ExxonMobil concurs Things are changing and maybe contracts will be shorter than years But when you look at the enormous investments involved you have to say there are not too many players who are going to let the whole LNG value chain go ahead as a speculative

KnightRidder Tribune Business News San Jose Mercury News California Copyright C KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News Source World Reporter TM Santa Clara County agreed Thursday to join a lawsuit against power suppliers alleging they conspired to raise prices and boost profits while subjecting consumers to higher bills and rolling blackouts The county is the first to join the suit originally filed by San Francisco in January The suit seeks refunds for consumers of more than billion in alleged excess electricity profits The San Francisco suit contains significant allegations of manipulation and collusion by the wholesalers resulting in the disastrous consequences were all familiar with said lead deputy county counsel Alan Tieger We looked at the evidence on which those allegations were grounded and found they were indeed supported by the evidence expert and otherwise The suit names a dozen electricity generating and marketing companies including Duke Energy and Enron Energy Marketing Similar claims have been filed by three water districts in the San Diego area and two classaction lawsuits by private attorneys on behalf of consumers are pending against power suppliers The companies have vigorously denied the charges I dont think there will be any evidence of illegal activity by anyone said Jan SmutnyJones executive director of the Independent Energy Producers Association when asked about various government probes BUSINESS Huge increase in Calpine earnings San Jose power supplier rakes in million Christian Berthelsen Chronicle Staff Writer The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL B Copyright Power producer Calpine Corp announced a percent increase in earnings yesterday capping a series of huge firstquarter earnings announcements by companies that are profiting mightily during Californias energy crisis Calpine said it earned million in the first three months of the year compared with million in the same period last year That profit level on billion in revenue puts Calpine in league with industries such as computer sales and securities brokering in terms of median return on revenue and far above the median annual return in the energy industry which averages about percent Calpines centspershare earnings blew past the average analyst estimate of cents per share compiled by Thomson Financial First Call The San Jose power generator said last month that it expected to report earnings of cents to cents Williams a Tulsa Okla energy concern that markets electricity in California produced by AES the Arlington Va generation company reported firstquarter profit of million more than double its results one year ago AES reported gains yesterday of percent Other energy companies with business in California including Reliant and Enron have reported huge gains in recent days Calpine executives yesterday sought to distinguish themselves from other merchant energy companies in California saying most of the electricity it sells here is under relatively lowcost contracts with the utilities the state and other entities and very little of it is sold in the spot market where prices are often three times as high It is not our business strategy to play in the volatility of the market but to have longterm contracts said Bill Highlander the companys director of public relations Calpine was not among the companies named in a report last month by the California Independent System Operator identifying power concerns that gouged California consumers Calpines stock was hit hard earlier this month when it revealed that it had not set aside reserves to offset more than million in potentially bad debt owed by Pacific Gas Electric Co which filed for bankruptcy protection But Calpines stock was trading near the top of its week high yesterday ending up or percent to close at Ann Curtis Calpines chief financial officer said in an interview yesterday that the company still expects to be paid by PGE since the power it provides under contract to the utilities and the state is much less expensive than if they voided the contract and sold the power on the spot market It makes sense and would be in the best interest of the utility and state to honor the contract Curtis said As it had last quarter Calpines announcement made no mention of runaway wholesale energy costs in California which have severely damaged the states leading utilities and are beginning to hurt the state governments finances Rather Calpine Chief Executive Officer Peter Cartwright in a prepared statement attributed the earnings growth to the continued execution of Calpines strategy to acquire and build lowcost generation facilities in key power markets throughout the US More than half of the companys plants are in California Overall the supplier operates plants nationwide that generate nearly megawatts Calpine is one of the darlings of the energy industry viewed as a model for a new energy company because of its aggressive expansion plans and reliance on relatively clean efficient generation The company is relatively small in the industry with a market capitalization of about billion compared with about billion for an industry giant like Duke Energy of Charlotte NC Calpine is in the midst of a program that is expected by to boost its electricity generation portfolio to megawatts an amount equivalent to more than twice the energy California uses at this time of year from its current capacity of about Lehman Bros calls Calpine one of its top picks and maintains a strong buy rating on the companys stock CREEK SEEKS HEARING ON POWER PLANT PLAN DAVID FLESHLER and JEREMY MILARSKY Staff Writers South Florida SunSentinel Broward Metro B Copyright by the SunSentinel Coconut Creek filed a legal petition with the state Thursday that could stall Enron Corps plans for a power plant in Pompano Beach Attorneys for the city requested an administrative hearing on the states plans to issue an air permit for the plant This could delay the companys plans by six months if it doesnt thwart them altogether Coconut Creek which is downwind from the site is a center of opposition to Enron When Pompano Beach held public hearings on the project condominium complexes in Coconut Creek chartered buses to pack the meeting rooms with opponents The state Department of Environmental Protection already has announced its preliminary intention to issue the permit In its petition the city argues that the state had failed to take into account the cumulative effect of the sources of air pollution in the area These include the North Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant a Florida Power Light Co substation a Broward County landfill the Wheelabrator trash incinerator the Broward County Hazardous Materials Receiving Facility and the Waste Management Transfer Station according to the petition Eric Thode spokesman for Enron disputes the petitions statement that the cumulative effect on air quality has not been considered You have to take it into account when youre assessing air quality and the cumulative impact on air quality he said He said the petition may ruin the companys plans to open the plant by the summer of next year but not its plans to build the plant Well continue to go forward with the project he said Now that the petition has been filed DEP will decide whether to send it to the Division of Administrative Hearings Both sides present their case to a judge who recommends whether the department should issue the permit The department usually follows the recommendations said Alvaro Linero the DEP administrator handling the Enron petition Meanwhile in Deerfield Beach Enron officials made their final pitch to a volunteer committee thats studying their plans for a plant identical to the one proposed for Pompano Beach Company officials promised to build a plant that wouldnt be an eyesore to the subdivisions of Independence Bay and Waterways Steve Rose a traffic expert for Enron said the

MARGARITA Dow Jones Venezuela is forging ahead with plans to develop its natural gas industry through a series of concessions involving both foreign and local companies Industry officials reckon the effort should generate up to billion in investment over the next years The biggest push now underway in the Gasification of the Nation program is the awarding of licenses for the exploration and production of nonoil associated gas in centralwestern Venezuela a zone estimated to contain trillion to trillion cubic feet in reserves Of companies that have qualified for the concessions are foreign The government is also moving to open up offshore exploration and production of free gas in the Paria and Plataforma Deltana regions in waters bordering northeast Venezuela where officials suspect Tcf to Tcf are waiting to be discovered Jose Pacheco vice minister of energy told Dow Jones Newswires that the government wants to start the prequalification process sometime this year Trinidad he said has been aggressively tapping reserves in the area some of which may extend into Venezuela territory The government has been talking with authorities from the island to reach some understanding for the exploitation of the region he said Rafael Ramirez president of Venezuelas gas regulator said stateoil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA EPVZ has allocated million for exploration in the area He

Dabhol Power Co the Indian subsidiary of Enron met in London on Wednesday and authorized the companys managing director to issue a preliminary notice to terminate the project billed as the worlds largest natural gas fired power plant The Times of India reported The board has given powers to the management to issue the pretermination notice But the meeting unanimously felt the need of the hour

week have said they favor renegotiation The state power utility has said it cannot pay Dabhols monthly electricity bills since rates for power have nearly quadrupled That prompted Dabhol to invoke a federal guarantee in February the first time in India that such a federal guarantee was invoked As part of the agreement between the company and the state government the federal government must pay in case of a state default But before the federal government stepped in the state government paid million in outstanding bills Since then the state power utility has confirmed that all pending bills have been paid However a dispute over payment of million for December and January bills is pending Several political parties had earlier demanded the project be scrapped since the costs had increased from

Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved DABHOL India AP Workers in yellow helmets scramble up steel girders to fit pipes into place for the worlds largest natural gasfired power plant to be completed off Indias western coast this year by American energy giant Enron Corp But miles away in Bombay government officials say they cannot afford the electricity that Enron is now providing from a naphtha plant at the site and they expect the electricity generated by liquefied natural gas will cost even more Enron is simply unaffordable said Padamsinh Patil energy minister for the state of Maharashtra which includes Bombay The state cannot afford the power so we take less power but still have to pay Enron huge amounts India needs power during the ApriltoOctober hot season the nation had a daily shortfall of nearly megawatts of electricity according to the Center for Monitoring the Indian Economy Enrons naphtha and gas plants at Dabhol will together be able to generate about megawatts but politicians have trouble with the price Aging coal and gasfired plants that have been depreciated can charge about two rupees cents per kilowatt hour while Enrons naphtha plant has been charging to cents Everyone wants to use us to blame for the systemic problem that the state electricity boards in this country sell power for less than it costs them to generate or buy power said K Wade Cline president of Enron India Despite the protests Cline believes that the billion project Indias biggestever foreign investment will go on line at the end of But the companys frustrations are obvious This week the board of the Dabhol Power Co Enrons India subsidiary authorized the companys managing director to issue a preliminary notice that could lead to termination of the power project Enron says it is owed million for power delivered in December and January The February power bill has already been paid and Krishna Rao member of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board said Wednesday the March electricity bill was being paid Rao said renegotiation of the existing contract was the next step The government and DPC have to come together he said The termination notice will have to wait till negotiations actually begin Indian lenders insist it is impossible for Enron to pull out before it makes up the huge amounts already spent They speculate that the companys board is using pressure tactics to ensure timely payments in future An advantage for Enron and the major complaint against it is a unique contract that requires the federal government to pay up in case of default by Maharashtra Another grievance is that the Enron deal requires Maharashtra to pay for electricity even if it doesnt use it Enron invoked the federal guarantee in February when the state utility said it could not afford to pay Dabhol Power But before the national government stepped in state officials paid million in overdue bills The state bailout drew attention to the Enron deal with opponents again raising questions about the cost to be borne for foreign investment and development The debate comes as the government in New Delhi tries to reduce subsidies and sell off stateowned enterprises Enron says federal payment guarantees were essential because few foreign companies were willing to invest when India began opening its economy in the early s Who wanted to come to India at that time Very few companies did said Cline We came along with some others and said were willing to invest because we think India has a bright future Preparing for that future workers at Dabhol clamber around inside an LNG tank that could fit three jets stacked one atop another They weld a steelreinforced dome while others outside drill concrete blocks for the milelong jetty where the LNG tanker Laxmi meaning wealth in Hindi is scheduled to dock in November Enron says LNG is the cleanest and most economical fuel but Bombay politicians have their doubts They point at electricity prices that have increased fourfold which Enron attributes to the rise to the jump in oil prices and a depreciation of the Indian rupee Opponents of the project say the government should have invested in its own power plant instead of tying up with a foreign company Were not against foreign companies but the Enron project is a sure pill for Indias financial collapse said Pradyumna Kaul an antiEnron activist It will bankrupt the nation Both sides should agree to a separation and abort the contract now Enron believes a crackdown on power theft and reduction of waste in transmission and distribution would generate enough money to pay for Dabhols electricity A state governmentappointed committee agreed and this month called for reform of the state power utility that defaulted on its payments to Enron But the fivemember panel also insisted on lower tariffs and urged renegotiating the price agreement Enron chief executive Jeffrey Skilling likened the India situation to the power woes being felt in California The utility offers a fixed rate to their customers and the wholesale costs of electricity have gone up like they have in the US he said from Enron headquarters in Houston The distribution

Standard Copyright c Business Standard The board of the Enronpromoted Dabhol Power Company DPC at its meeting in London on Wednesday authorised the managing director of Enron India to issue a notice for terminating the power purchase agreement to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board and the state government The board has authorised Wade Cline to serve the termination notice However this does not mean that the termination notice will be served immediately It is only an enabling provision and will be used only if the situation arises a state government source told Business Standard from London He said DPC was under pressure from its lenders The DPC spokesperson here refused to comment on the issue The hardening of the boards stand is in sharp contrast to the advice of DPCs lenders who had warned Enron not to precipitate matters by issuing a termination notice The lenders had arrived at a consensus that the termination notice need not be served at this stage Serving of the notice requires a nod from the lenders who have an exposure of about billion in the project Sources said given the lenders strong opposition to termination of the contract the Enron boards enabling resolution did not have much significance beyond conveying a hardening of its stand with regard to the current imbroglio The Maharashtra Chief Minister had warned Enron not to scuttle the process of crisis resolution by issuing a termination notice The state government is to nominate an expert group to renegotiate the terms of the Dabhol contract Enron holds per cent in DPC while USbased GE and Bechtel hold per cent each The balance per cent is held by MSEB through a special purpose vehicle Maharashtra Power Development Corporation The MSEB representatives were not allowed to vote at the

bills After MSEB failed to pay Rs crore towards the December bill DPC invoked the state governments guarantee and then the Union governments counter guarantee When payment of the Rs crore January bill became overdue DPC again invoked the state governments guarantee MSEB retaliated on January by slapping a Rs crore penalty for nonsupply of electricity at adequate levels It demanded that DPC adjust

Risks Seen For Suppliers By Mark Golden Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc NEW YORK Dow Jones The biggest of all power bills for Californias two main utilities comes due March billion for December realtime purchases It represents an enormous amount of fourth quarter revenue at risk for suppliers to the utilities via the California Independent System Operator Some independent generators like Calpine Corp CPN and western utilities did much in December to reduce their exposure to the cashstrapped California utilities Other generators and trading companies like Enron Corp ENE Williams Cos WMB and Mirant Corp MIR increased their exposure by buying power for the ISO from Northwest utilities that had stopped selling directly to the ISO due to credit concerns We entered into contracts with utilities and third parties like Enron and avoided selling to those that had questionable credit Calpine Executive Vice President Tom Mason told Dow Jones Newswires Thursday at an industry conference in New York Some of these folks were willing to take on that risk PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas Electric Co will owe billion for its December realtime market purchases through the ISO the company said Thursday Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edisons bill will come to million according to a person familiar with the billing Barring a legislative solution to the states energy crisis within the next two weeks the utilities are expected to pay little of their March bill Earlier this month Pacific Gas Electric paid about of its November ISO bill of million and Southern California Edison paid none of its bill for million As reported Calpine Avista Corp AVA New Century Energies Inc NCE and the British Columbia provincial utility BC Hydro are among those companies that aggressively reduced exposure to the California utilities and ISO by December Calpine still has some exposure for the fourth quarter but its comfortable enough with that exposure that it didnt take reserves against its earnings as some other companies did Mason said Some Suppliers Stepped Into Middle As Prices Soared After colder temperatures moved in Dec wholesale power prices in the Northwest shot up to as high as a megawatthour up from MWh in late November The ISOs volume of purchases increased as well to meet higher demand for electric space heating and it started paying a large credit risk premium on top of the regular market prices From Dec until Dec when the US Department of Energy ordered all historical suppliers to the ISO to deliver available electricity directly companies that were willing to take on more California utility credit risk could buy Northwest power at an average price of about MWh and deliver it to the ISO for about MWh Making that deal for business days on MW supply for example would come to million of profit in the event of payment but million in losses in the event of nonpayment Enron chairman Ken Lay confirmed that the company stepped in to buy power from companies that wouldnt sell to the ISO and then sold that power to the ISO at a premium We make markets in California and elsewhere Lay said Thats what we do Williams said Thursday that it too bought power for the ISO in addition to delivering all available power it owns inside California Because of the ISOs desperate need for power from Northwest outofstate state sources when those historic sources dried up for the ISO Williams was one of the companies that stepped in and we did it at a reasonable margin said Tim Thuston Williams managing director of government relations This wasnt profiteering Power traders said that Mirant which is the recently spunoff unregulated division of Southern Co SO also was buying from Northwest utilities and selling to the ISO in the first half of December Specifically I cant say if we bought from Northwest utilities and sold to the ISO Mirant spokeswoman Jamie Stephenson said In general we bought and sold power nationwide The sleeving of power sales as it is called by power marketers stopped in the second half of December after the Department of Energy issued its emergency order InState Producers Enron And TransAlta Owed Most On the receivable side of the March bill Dynegy Inc DYN and partner NRG Energy NRG Enron Mirant Reliant Energy REI TransAlta TTA Williams BC Hydro and the Los Angeles Department of Water Power are owed the most tens of millions of dollars each according to a person familiar with the billing Instate energy producer Duke Energy DUK says it limited its spot

Administration Cheney Does Heavy Lifting And Bush Rides Agenda Taste f or HorseTrading A Lot of Pain in the West By Jeanne Cummings Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc WASHINGTON George W Bush had barely celebrated his belated presidential victory when he was hit by the energy crisis in the West In a series of telephone calls to Mr Bushs Texas ranch before Christmas Utah Gov Michael Leavitt spent hours raising the alarm with the presidentelects top aides A supply squeeze had sent utility bills soarin g not just in California but in neighboring states as well with the prospect of bigger spikes in the months ahead How Mr Bush went on to handle the crisis the first big challenge of his presidency offers some early clues to how his White House will function H e has leaned heavily on Vice President Dick Cheney to handle the details Tha t allowed Mr Bush to stick doggedly to his chosen public message and shielded the president from some difficult policy choices Even Mr Leavitt never insisted on speaking directly to the new president who was busy nami ng his cabinet Mr Bush bent his freemarket limitedgovernment principles to accommodate a crisis but so far by only a little He offered a single twoweek extension of Mr Clintons executive order directing suppliers to sell power to nearl y bankrupt California utilities While turning to national issues Mr Bush remained open to a statelevel problem offering his former gubernatorial colleagues a sensitive ear And he worked hard to use unexpected events to help buttress his arguments for his policy agenda Just as he has used the economic slowdown to garner support for his taxcut agenda he hopes to use the Western energy crisis t o win political support in Congress for his controversial agenda of expanding exploration into environmentally sensitive areas in Alaska and the Rocky Mountains Such exploration might not yield energy for years or yield much power at all especially of the sort California needs But its a pet project of a White House where the president and vice president are both veterans of the oil industry Winning the necessary support for exploration is part of the challenge of drafting a comprehensive energy bill which a team of top aide s led by Mr Cheney is working to produce within to days The energy problem has shadowed Mr Bush throughout the first month of his presidency It commanded his private attention every day of his first week in office even as he was publicly unveiling educationreform proposals More recently he has received regular briefings from Mr Cheney who is consulting key members of Congress and energy experts The matter will move front and center today when the president makes his first foreign visit to Mexico where he is expected to discuss expanded naturalgas exploration an d trade with Mexican President Vicente Fox Quesada At the same time Mr Cheney will be back in Washington convening the first working meeting of th e various cabinet secretaries whose departments will be affected by a nationa l energy bill Some top Republicans believe the energy crisis could cast an even larger cloud over Mr Bushs first year than the softening economy especially i f the continuing supply squeeze leaves Western consumers facing new price increases this summer as widely predicted We recognize that this is a challenge we will be faced with at least through the summer Were obviousl y monitoring it very closely says Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham The problem has its roots in Californias energyderegulation bill signed by former GOP Gov Pete Wilson As part of the negotiations over the bill the states utilities agreed to buy power on shortterm contracts making them vulnerable to wholesaleprice swings The law also capped consumer bills which meant rising fuel costs couldnt be passed along to t he users The situation became critical last year when naturalgas prices spiked upwa rd at the same time that hot summer weather and a booming economy increased usage and low rainfall depleted the regions hydroelectric power Californi a soon began gobbling up any available power in the Western regions electric grid which drove wholesale rates skyhigh and wound up increasing the utility bills of consumers in neighboring states Idaho residents for instance saw their bills rise by while California users still benefit ed from retailprice caps So Gov Leavitt wasnt the only Western governor trying to get the new president to focus on the issue Wyoming Gov Jim Geringer raised it on Jan when he and Mr Bush were standing together in the pasture parking lot o f the Bush ranch awaiting the arrival of other Republican governors invited to a Bushsponsored barbecue The issue was also discussed later among all the governors but only in broad terms participants say Three days later Clinton administration officials convened the first meeti ng of all the parties involved in the California crisis To provide a voice fo r Mr Bushs team Clinton aides invited the presidentelects friend and fellow Texan Kenneth Lay head of Houstonbased Enron Corp As the largest trader of gas and electricity in North America Enron has profited from the energy crisis During the campaign Mr Lay donated more than to the GOP according to the Center for Responsive Politics A second meeting was held four days later and the rough outlines of a solution began to emerge but time had run out on the Clinton team The onl y question left was how to handle an executive order to keep the lights on in California On the Wednesday before Inauguration Day Gene Sperling Mr Clintons top economic adviser and his Bush counterpart Lawrence Lindsey sat down for a final discussion in a secondfloor office at the White House They agreed t o one last Clinton order that would reach by three days into the Bush term The goal was to give the Bush team some breathing room The next day Mr Bush and his top advisers settled into the Blair House in Washington to put the finishing touches on his inaugural speech But their work was at times interrupted by discussions about the energy crisis That night Mr Lindsey arrived and briefed the president on his meeting with Mr Sperling On Inauguration Day Mr Bush received a congratulatory call from Californi a Gov Gray Davis who had stayed in Sacramento because of the crisis In tha t call Davis aides say the Democratic governor made his first direct pitch to Mr Bush for an extension of the Clinton executive order forcing energy sal es to California utilities While the two men diverge politically they had worked together on issues affecting border states Last June Mr Bush was one of three US governors who joined six Mexican governors at a dinner hosted by Mr Davis in Sacramentos Crocker Art Museum Their shared experiences as state leaders made Mr Bush sympathetic to Mr Daviss reque st for extra time to get a recovery bill through the state legislature On Sunday night Mr Abraham the new energy secretary called Mr Davis to hear another pitch and the two men spoke again on Monday the first offici al working day of the Bush administration While Mr Davis was sounding out Mr Abraham Mr Lindsey met with Mr Bush in the Oval Office and recommended that he grant the extension The strongest argument in favor of issuing the order Mr Lindsey says was Mr Bushs belief that the federal government should help states solve their own problems Later that day while Mr Bush was highlighting education reform Mr Lindsey Mr Abraham Commerce Secretary Donald Evans Treasury Secretary Paul ONeill and Christine Todd Whitman director of the Environmental Protection Agency began sorting out the administrations shortterm and longterm responses to the crisis On Tuesday Mr Bush discussed energy with his economic policy team which included Messrs Cheney and Lindsey Chief of Staff Andrew Card Deputy Chi ef of Staff Josh Bolten and top aides Karen Hughes and Karl Rove Mr Bush to ok a seat in front of the Oval Office fireplace while his aides settled in on small couches The energy crisis had to be managed on two fronts Mr Bush told the group Shortterm they had to do what they could for California But an equally important objective needed to be development of a comprehensive policy for the country because of the broad economic implications of the crisis he said They weighed setting up a cabinetlevel task force an idea that Messrs Bu sh and Cheney appeared to have already discussed privately The two men often confer each morning before or after the regularly scheduled nationalsecurity briefing They also chat throughout the day as they come and go from meetings As the group hammered out the details of which agenci es needed to be represented on the task force it was not lost on anyone that the energy crisis in the West may also be an opportunity to build support a nd a sense of urgency for their national energy agenda Mr Bush tested the political waters the next day in the Cabinet Room durin g a meeting with bipartisan leaders from Capitol Hill according to Nevada Democrat Sen Harry Reid This time it was the president who raised the subject and Western lawmakers jumped at the call for stronger leadership a nd action on the issue The conversation didnt go into specifics though because we would have gotten into an argument over Mr Bushs support for drilling in Arctic National Wildlife Reserve recalls Mr Reid an ardent opponent of that proposal and a staunch supporter of expansion of renewable energy On Friday the White House was teeming with educators lawmakers governors and citizens who had come to witness the transition to a new administration After a public event hosted by Mr Bush to highlight education four governors Messrs Leavitt and Geringer Arizonas Jane Dee Hull and Idahos Dirk Kempthorne slipped into Mr Cheneys tiny West Wing office to talk about energy The room smelled of fresh paint and the glasses were so new that they lacked the presidential seal For nearly an hour Mr Cheney probed the governors about how the crisis was affecting their states and constituents None of the governors brought the issue up with Mr Bush The governors decision to seek out Mr Cheney rather than intrude on Mr Bushs choreographed agenda created an awkward moment the following Monday when Mr Bush announced the creation of the Cheneyled energy policy group Cant think of a better man to run it than the vice president Mr Bush said Were very aware in this administration that this situation in California is beginning to affect neighboring states Western governors cam e to see the vice president he said and then rushed to add and they ca me to see me as well Since that announcement Mr Cheney has taken over the job of creating an energypolicy bill and Mr Bush receives regular updates from Mr Lindsey including a session held last night just before the presidents trip to Mexico But the potential political and economic ramifications of the energ y crunch on the new administration are as layered as the problem itself And as consumers face the full cost of the crisis pressure will become enormous o n Mr Bush to wade deeper into it Administration officials worry that high energy costs could prompt consumer s to cut household budgets and persuade factories to begin layoffs The soft landing that the Bush administration is counting on could become a hard on e and threaten the government surpluses Mr Bush must have to sustain his tax cut and other domestic initiatives As Mr Bush himself warned when he unveiled his national energy policy during a September campaign stop in Saginaw Mich Our nation has had three recessions in the last generation and each one was tied to an energy shock The Western energy crisis also will continue to test the balance between Mr Bushs commitment to open markets and his sympathy for the plight of a fell ow governor The decision to extend the Clinton forcedsales order was a very difficult call Mr Lindsey says in part because the help provided to California came at the expense of the utility customers in other Western states several of which are governed by Mr Bushs close Republican colleagues This was not a costless extension Mr Lindsey says Theres a lot of pain in the West for having done the twoweek extension But the supply crunch that drove up wholesale costs this winter may only ge t worse as temperatures warm in the West and residents from California to New Mexico turn on their air conditioners Republican officeholders wary of th e sort of political backlash that helped cost one California Congressman his seat last November are pressing for further federal intervention Alaska Sen Frank H Murkowski the powerful chairman of the Senate Energy and National Resources Committee says a marketbased cap on wholesale prices m ay be needed for a transitional period But Mr Bush is flatly rejecting the idea of price caps A shortterm dela y of a needed solution he says The idea is also anathema to Mr Cheney whose first White House tour during the Ford administration was dominated b y an energy crisis made more complex by President Nixons policy of price controls Nasdaq Chairman Frank Zarb who served as Mr Fords energy czar and worked with Mr Cheney and other aides while crafting an energy policy says the price controls were just a dumb idea In a recent interview Mr Lindsey said even a temporary cap on natural gas or electricity is not something hed recommend Anyone who looks at the history of price caps would have to suspect one that was socalled temporary he says But adhering to freemarket principles could yet become a drag on Mr Bush s popularity warns former US Sen Bennett Johnston a Democrat Mr Bush on ce considered for energy secretary If the administration takes no action and prices remain high he says people will start trying to find somebody to blame John Fialka contributed to this article Generators No Plans To Build PeakingPwr Plants In Calif Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc This article was originally published Thursday By Jessica Berthold OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow Jones Major electricity suppliers with experience building power plants in California said Thursday they have no plans to construct new peaking units in the state for operation by summer Their position raises questions about whether Gov Gray Davis will be able to get megawatts of new power on Californias grid by July a target he announced last week Davis plan offers incentives to generators but it also leaves key issues unsettled creating uncertainty in the market And time is short If the ne w plants are to come on line construction will have to begin by midMarch Were not going to be able to have any peakers this summer said Mark Palmer spokesman for Enron Corp ENE Its not possible physically and theres no market that would allow plants to be profitable Davis plan calls for megawatts of additional generation to come on line in the state by July Roughly half of that power will come from large plants now under construction and from easing environmental restrictions thus allowing plants currently off line to run as long as operators buy emission credits The other half will come from peaking generation units typically small units designed to run only during periods of high demand The state Independent System Operator has contracts for construction of MW wort h of peakers The governor hopes to get MW more through an emergency order cutting the permit process from four months to days But generators say cutting permit time is not enough of an incentive for generators to build in the state While the governors announcement about streamlining the approval process appears attractive on the face of it there are still problems of creditworthiness and regulatory uncertainty said Richard Wheatley spokesman for Reliant Energy REI We have to allocate our equipment for projects which will have the greatest potential to succeed We dont have a ny projects that could be on the ground in California this summer Generators Fear They Wont Recover Investment Generators say they are wary of investing more capital in part because the state Department of Resources would likely be signing the contracts for the MW of emergency power and theyve been burned once already by the DW R Generators thought the DWR was covering the states entire net short electricity needs in recent weeks But last week the agency said it has no t been paying for power it deemed unreasonably priced That means the bills g ot passed to the states two investorowned utilities which havent paid thei r power bills in weeks due to cash and credit problems Another problem say generators is that they dont know what rate of retur n they can expect from the peakers The governors order says the peaker powe r must be sold only to the DWR and at a reasonable rate but that rate has not been defined Exactly how the state determines reasonableness is the key question said Tom Williams spokesman for Duke Energy DUK Williams added that Duke wouldnt build peakers for the summer because the company already has enough risk in that market right now If the state could guarantee a workable market for power this summer generators would rush to build in the state because theyd know they could recover their costs said Enrons Palmer But with the states history of price caps generators simply see to much uncertainty he added A Mirant Corp MIR spokeswoman said the company had not announced any pla ns to build new peakers Calpine Corp CPN said it was still considering its options but planned to concentrate this summer on larger generation projec ts already under way in California ISO Peaker Program Also In Jeopardy The ISO peaker program which has MW of projects due on line by summe r and currently in various stages of completion is also in jeopardy due to generators concerns they wont be paid enough to cover their investment said an ISO spokesman who helps manage the peaker program Credit concerns are a real issue among generators at this point said Bob Theaker ISO manager of reliability contracts The way our tariff authoriz es us to pay generators we would levy an uplift on people who serve load through the ISO grid in essence it comes down to the utilities Theaker said the governor is still looking into ways that generators would be paid for their peaker contracts given that the utilities are unable to pay A lot of projects are in suspended animation right now as people wait to s ee how they will get paid Theaker said We dont know how far the governors discussions have progressed but its got to be resolved soon because the development and building of these projects requires a month lead time Theaker added that midMarch would be the latest that construction could begin or resume if the state expected to see any power from peakers by June By Jessica Berthold Dow Jones

But it may be a hard sell south of t he border EVELYN IRITANI TIMES STAFF WRITER Los Angeles Times Home Edition C Copyright The Times Mirror Company When President Bush meets today in Mexico with President Vicente Fox he wi ll deliver the same message he did to Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien la st week in Washington Lets share energy Bush wants a hemispheric energy policy that although only vaguely define d so far would foster the seamless flow of oil natural gas and electricity among the three nations and reduce barriers that limit foreign access to energy resources It is a goal that Chretien embraces but that presents Fox with big practica l and constitutional problems And the White House initiative faces opposition from other quarters as a result of Californias power debacle which is now drawing blame for soarin g energy prices in Canada and Mexico as well as the United States It has sparked a global reassessment of energy deregulation and could turn America s energy industry into the latest target for antiglobalization forces The energy companies could easily become a poster industry for the message that if globalization means a market economy then thats bad news said Gary Hufbauer a trade analyst at the Institute for International Economics in Washington As the worlds biggest single consumer of energy the US has a point of view that to some outsidersespecially in energyproducing countries such as Mexico and Canadais purely one of selfinterest Critics liken the USl ed deregulation effort to economic imperialism disguised as free trade where the US forces other countries to open their energy markets to powerful American firms that then siphon off the energy for SUVdriving electricitygobbling Americans We now have a continental energy market largely run by American corporatio ns that is based on a model of increased consumption and the premise that wel l never run out of energy said Maude Barlow chairwoman of the Ottawabas ed Council of Canadians that countrys largest publicinterest group In his first few weeks in office Bush has used Californias electricity shortage as ammunition to promote the need for a longterm energy policy centered on greater development of oil and natural gas One element would have oil gas and electricity flow more freely within North America So far the former Texas oilmans plans for a continental energy market hav e been long on rhetoric and short on details USCanada trade in energy is already largely unfettered with Canada sending billion in energy products south in And US energy firms are major players in Canada We are in the business of selling them oil and gas and electricity Chretien said after meeting with Bush But as its own energy reserves dwindle and its appetite grows the United States has a lot to gain from reducing barriers everywhere to trade in oil gas and electric power an economic enterprise valued at between billi on and trillion worldwide That is why Washington over the years has sought to open up energy markets through pacts such as the North American Free Trade Agreement and the World Trade Organization Previously energy services such as oil production and electricity transmission were not part of trade agreements because those areas were largely controlled by governmentowned monopolies But today at least countries are in some stage of energy deregulation or privatization according to Robert Michaels a deregulation expert at Cal State Fullerton Deregulation advocates argue that tearing down these barriers will foster investment in infrastructure in energyrich but undeveloped countries speeding the construction of power systems They point out that nearly billion people around the world dont even have access to electricity or other forms of commercial energy But the California experience has changed attitudes everywhere Energy analyst Lawrence Makovich of Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Cambridge Mass has been traveling the globe urging anxious governments n ot to turn their backs on energy deregulation because of Californias failed deregulation scheme We are at a very critical point here Makovich said Are we going to continue and fix this market and get things right or retreat back toward government control and regulation Trade agreements such as the WTO establish rules on how markets should be liberalized and the proper role of government A US proposal to add energ y services to the WTO trade pact for example would require countries to do away with excessive tariffs on drilling equipment and prohibit preferential treatment for domestic firms in bidding for oil concessions or getting acce ss to electrical grids There are reasons why historically these energy markets were set up as integrated monopolies because they knew security of supply was essential t o any modern economy said Ellen Gould an economist in Vancouver Canada w ho served on the board of BC Hydro British Columbias publicly owned utility You cant have the lights go out But you cant introduce market forces unless youre prepared to see a little blood Political and economic tensions over energy in the NAFTA region especially in Canada illustrate the obstacles facing the Bush initiative Under NAFTA Canada agreed to reduce government intervention and ensure a more stable flow of energy across the border in exchange for increased acce ss to the much larger US market That included a pledge not to give Canadian customers preferential treatment by charging them less than foreigners and to maintain exports at a certain level even if Canada was experiencing a shortfall or price surges at home Since then Canadas exports to the United States have jumped dramatically Canadas share of the US natural gas market has tripled to Throughout Californias energy crisis Canadian producers and governments i n resourcerich provinces have enjoyed a windfall because of the resulting price runups But in Alberta which in January became the first Canadian province to deregulate electricity a sharp spike in gas and electricity prices has triggered a consumer and business backlash Energy has become a hot issue i n an upcoming provincial election and the government has provided hundreds o f millions of dollars in energy rebates to unhappy customers Even the provinces largest manufacturers have pronounced electricity deregulation a mistake Steven Shrybman a trade attorney in Ottawa believes Canada signed onto a pact that undermined its sovereignty while allowing the United States by getting more oil and gas from Canada to reduce its dependence on oil from the Middle East and lessen the likelihood of going to war to keep its cars and heaters fueled From the American point of view Shrybman says I regard these provisions of NAFTA as an alternative to the Iraq war In Mexico the constitution requires that natural resources remain under domestic control The country was exempted from most of NAFTAs energy marketopening provisions That has made foreign firms wary of investing in Mexicos energy sector You cant have any foreign ownership and yet they want investment and jointventure partners said Enrons Hillings Theres an awful lot of ga s right around the TexasMexico border thats never been developed Meanwhile Mexico cant even meet its own burgeoning demand for gasoline or electricity By some estimates Mexico needs to invest billion in energ y including natural gas to feed new power plants money that Fox has said wil l have to come from outside investors US energy firms are already building power plants in Baja California and other parts of Mexico but nearly all t he output is needed in Mexico itself Sergio Rivas an economist at Primer Enfoque an energy consulting firm in Mexico City predicted that Fox will have trouble persuading Mexicans suffering brownouts themselves that they should provide energy to their wealthier northern neighbors People would ask How is it possible we are thinking to supply electricit y to the United States when we dont have enough for our own consumption Rivas said In the political sense this issue is very very complicated BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX

Reporter of The Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc BUENOS AIRES While many Argentines were still nursing hangovers on New Years Day Buenos Aires Gov Carlos Ruckauf was holding a news conference His urgent message to the nation Im going to be the next president Never mind that Argentinas sitting president Fernando de la Rua was just a year into his fouryear term Mr Ruckauf was once again reveling in his ro le as the selfappointed spokesman for victims of a painful recession widely blamed on Mr de la Rua Governor of a state comprising more than a third of the countrys populatio n and total output Mr Ruckauf has struck a chord with beleaguered Argentine s by sounding off about surging crime and stubbornly high unemployment He ha s also sided with local businesses against foreign competitors and freetrade deals and with consumers against aspects of the countrys sweeping privatization program The strategy has paid big dividends for the yearold governor In recent opinion polls he ranked twice as popular as Mr de la Rua and had a higher positive rating than any other politician on the national scene But certain positions have increasingly put Mr Ruckauf at odds with multinational companies operating in Buenos Aires state Last month his administration ordered the state legislature to review a million waterdistribution contract held by Azurix Corp which is majorityowned b y Houstons Enron Corp following a contract dispute Mr Ruckauf crossed swords with WalMart Stores Inc of Bentonville Ark recently when his government backed a law that greatly restricts the size of new hypermarkets a move seen as an effort to protect local retailers Observers tend to view Mr Ruckaufs morepopulist platforms as a vehicle f or the governors political ambitions rather than the product of deeply held beliefs Before becoming a firebrand governor Mr Ruckauf was a lowprofil e sidekick as vice president to former President Carlos Menem who was a confirmed believer in free markets Analysts note that Mr Ruckauf regularl y courts foreign investors to buy the states global bonds and appointed a former Argentine ambassador to the US Diego Guelar to nurture highleve l contacts with US officials Hes a total pragmatist says political analyst Rosendo Fraga In terms of Mr Ruckauf making major policy changes he says theres a low probability that hell do it Mr Ruckauf has also drawn the ire of some within his own Peronist party which ceded the presidency to Mr de la Ruas Alliance party in December Party chief Mr Menem along with several other Peronist governors a re believed to have their eyes on the presidential race And many were jarred when Mr Ruckauf attacked his opponent in the gubernatorial race for being proabortion in an appeal to the partys ultraconservative wing Abortion is generally outlawed in the largely Catholic country and typicall y isnt raised as an issue in political campaigns But the governors noholdsbarred message is resonating strongly with ordinary Argentines who quickly soured on their new president when he fail ed to bring fast economic relief In almost daily declarations Mr Ruckauf ha s called for a crackdown on youth violence sweeping tax cuts and increased funding for small and mediumsized businesses He has attacked Brazil Argentinas partner in the regional trade pact Mercosur for robbing jobs from Argentina And he recently led an appeal to the national government fo r a social aid package to accompany the nearly billion financial packag e led by the International Monetary Fund in December I make proposals that are absolutely clear Mr Ruckauf said recently Opponents say Mr Ruckaufs popularity surge is just a blip on the screen that will disappear when the

Times of India Copyright C The Times of India Source World Reporter TM MUMBAI ND Patil chairperson of the coordination committee of the Democratic Front coalition has categorically told chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh that the terms of reference for the Godbole committee must include a review of the Dabhol power project Mr Patil told The Times of India News Service that the terms should also provide for reviewing all clearances given to the project and examining all the relevant laws and notifications Mr Patil a former minister of the Peasants and Workers party and a respect ed politician is a staunch opponent of the project He has demanded the scrapping of phase II of the project saying that it is exploitative and wou ld imposes a severe burden on the states finances and the consumers Mr Patil is of the view that the second phase can be scrapped as the agreement with Enron violates several provisions of the Contracts Act Some experts feel that phase II would be so deleterious to the state and the consumers that it would be more acceptable to bear the costs of scrapping i t The Godbole committee will make recommendations not only on the Dabhol powe r project but also on two other major proposed private sector projects of Reliance at Patalganga and Ispat group at Bhadrawati The Maharashtra state electricity board had signed power purchase agreement s for both the projects during the Shiv SenaBJP administration However the MSEB told the government that it would find it difficult to absorb the high volume of additional power The Ispat project has a capacity of MW and Reliance MW Besides if the proposed MW plant of BSES comes up at Saphale near Palghar it would further create problems wrt cost of purchasing power fo r the MSEB sources said Ideally BSES should be ready to give a crosssubsi dy to MSEB sources said Sources said the BSES was making a lot of profit sin ce it catered to a large number of affluent consumers in Mumbai While they take away the cream we are forced to cater to the rural areas at a low pri ce and suffer losses the sources said A senior official said the state electricity board should also benefit from Mumbais affluence The board has protested to the government against the proposed BSES plant a t Saphale BSES must compensate MSEB the sources said BSES has submitted another proposal for a MW coalbased unit at Nandgaon near Amravati It should not even be discussed until BSES meets its obligations by paying standby charges for the Dahanu plant the sources said Meanwhile MSEB has launched a major drive to disconnect power supply to

Line The Hindu Copyright C Kasturi Sons Ltd KSL Source World Reporter TM Asia Intelligence Wire MUMBAI Feb IN its quest for higher returns Enron Corp would sell assets such as its stake in Dabhol Power Company DPC if the price is right says an article in BusinessWeek quoting Enron executives The February story on Enrons activities worldwide also talked about ho w Enron had faced a barrage of criticism in many Third World countries Not only has the Dabhol project been a draining experience but it is no longer seen as a wise investment says the article It quoted the Enron President Mr Jeffrey K Skilling We shouldnt be in there building billion power plants Our cost of capital is too high to do that A spokesperson for Enron India however said the reference in the article to the selling of its stake did not mean it intended to sell out of DPC altogether It is with reference to what we have already announced We are looking for someone to buy the additional per cent we have in the company following the Maharashtra State Electricity Board acquiring only half of the per cent stake it was to take We have already appointed Credit Suisse First Boston for the same we want to revert to the earlier equity stake we had said a spokesperson for Enron India On Mr Skillings comment that Enron should not be in there building billion power plants Enron India spokesperson said the reference was t o building new plants in India We have no further plans to build more plant s here Kripa Raman MSEB tightening screws on power thefts defaulters The Times of India News Service The Times of India Copyright C The Times of India Source World Reporter TM MUMBAI The Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB has started tighteni ng its grip on defaulters and power theft in the wake of the Enron crisis The drive has already borne fruit with revenue collections rising and cases of power theft in the wane Making this claim a top MSEB official said that the government would have to decide the fate of the DPC project at the political level and not depend on the Godbole committee for solutions Speaking to TOINS on the condition of anonymity he said that over the past few months MSEB had shown better recovery the collection in January was Rs crore against Rs crore in December It is expected to be around Rs crore in February Also electricity lines of more than defaulte rs were being disconnected on a daily basis Generation too has shown considerable improvement Plant load factor PLF of MSEBs generation plants has achieved a peak capacity of per cent which is a national record he stated The main problem was MSEBs tariff structure he said The official pointed out that crore of MSEBs consumers were subsidised ie nine out of every ten enjoy receive power at concessional rates He however pointe d out that despite these shortcomings MSEB continued to be one of the most efficiently run SEBs in the country The official conceded that power thefts continued to be a major cause of th e losses and also accepted the fact that there existed a nexus between power pilferers and some MSEB personnel He revealed that nearly MSEB officer s had been punished for turning a blind eye on power thefts The official said the Rajadhyaksha committee appointed some of years ago b y the former Shiv SenaBJP government to review Maharashtras power situation had strongly recommended metered power supply all over the state Neither this recommendation nor other important recommendations have been implemented Describing agriculturists demand for power as a subsidyinduced demand the official said it had been observed that electric motors were left running even after the required amount of water w as drawn This was happening simply because power was cheap he said India State Pays Bills to Enron But Electricity Crunch Persists John Elliott Special to the International Herald Tribune Friday February BOMBAY The Indian state of Maharashtra has paid Enron Corp million i n overdue bills from a troubled power project temporarily easing tensions with the US company But the payment of the bill came only after Enron intensified the standoff with the state calling in the federal government and it resolves none of the issues that prompted the dispute Meanwhile a severe energy shortage i n India continues to worsen The confrontation was prompted by increases last year in the price of power from the Enron plant which was begun in amid a backlash of nationalis t sentiment against the big outside investor The state government called in December for Enrons entire billion megawatt project in Dabhol to be renegotiated for a second time and stopped paying its bills That provoked the company last month to demand payment of overdue bills It invoked a central government guarantee intended to reassure skittish foreig n investors The power minister Suresh Prabhu who comes from Maharashtra stepped in a nd on Monday the state government paid the million due We spoke to the state government and they have made their payment Mr Prabhu said Now both sides need to talk and we need to solve this situation While the million November payment was finally made Enron says it is still owed additional payments from the project The Enron project is part of a much wider problem There is a national shortage of power amounting to about percent at peak periods but virtually bankrupt state electricity distribution boards throughout the country can neither pay their bills nor provide financial guarantees for builders of new power projects Given the financial health of the state electricity boards we shall very soon reach a state of no return if we do not take corrective measures Mr Prabhu said adding that new generation transmission and distribution projects costing more than billion would be needed in the next year s Mr Prabhu has two immediate aims One is to solve the Enron dispute and salvage what is left of Indias reputation as a destination for foreign investment At the same time he is pushing the state electricity boards to revise their finances For example percent of the Maharashtra boards power is sold below cost some of it is virtually free and onethird of its revenues disappear in theft and other distribution losses Analysts suggest Enron and its bankers might be willing to discuss revising some of the Dabhol deal if they believed that the board which is both its customer and a partner in the project had sufficient revenues to be able t o pay its bills on time For that to happen the state government would have to introduce changes that reduce subsidies implement a tougher rate structure and strengthen bill collection The state government however is riven wit h political divisions and some leftist parties plan statewide demonstration s next month where they will call for the project to be scrapped The problem is urgent because Dabhols second phase is due to be commission ed in two stages in July and August adding at least million a month to th e bills that Enron sends to the board Then in January liquefied natural ga s will begin to flow from Abu Dhabi and Oman under contracts that have alread y been finalized The state will find it difficult to meet these deadliness on its own One solution being discussed is for the state to call off its dispute with Enro n over the existing phase of the project and pay all outstanding bills At th e same time it would demand renegotiation of phase two with the aim of reducing Enrons rates and offloading some of the project to the central government The projects bankers which include Citibank Bank of America ANZ Grindla ys and ABNAMRO would then come under pressure to reduce financing charges possibly by reducing interest payments and rescheduling debt in US dollar s to Indian rupees Enron would also be asked to reduce standing charges whi ch are imposed irrespective of how much electricity the company produces and currently cost million a month Meanwhile Enron which is refocusing on more developed economies is reviewing its other projects in India It has canceled a joint ventur e with Calcuttabased Ispat Industries for a gasbased power project at an Ispat steelworks

Kennett or through the Princeton newsroom pjm Enron Saga Spills Over Into Cyberspace Hindustan Times India Feb BY SIDDHARTH ZARABI THE ENRON imbroglio after having hogged headlines in the print and television media recently has now spilled over into cyberspace A number of USbased nonresident Indian NRI academics and professionals have come together and formed a group Enron Action that runs a we bsite wwwaltindianetenron The site carries an emotional call for transparency for accountability for that lost promise called a democracy And as the name suggests it has extensive information on the chronology of events legal suits filed in the past and most interestingly a section that suggests a way out fro m the current mess that Maharashtra and the central government find themselves in The crux of the NRIs argument scrap the project as according to their estimates Maharashtra will end up paying a whopping billion Rs crore to Dabhol Power Company DPC The NRIs say that under international law the Maharashtra State Electricit y Board MSEB can bypass its insane obligations to the DPC only if an Indian court rules that the DPC agreement the Power Purchase Agreement PP A and the agreements surrounding it was in violation of Indian law Indeed a court case to this effect filed by Prayas an NGO has been rejected by the Maharashtra High Court an appeal against this dismissal filed by CITU and A Mehta is pending before the Supreme Court says the group Explaining the background of the imbroglio the NRIs group says that under the laws in force when the PPA was signed the agreement required mandatory economic and technical clearance from a statutory body the Central Electricity Authority CEA constituted for this very purpose The grou p says that the CEA did issue a technical clearance to the DPC power plant but explicitly refused to issue the economic clearance Instead the regulatory body observed that the economic issues had been looked into by t he Ministry of Finance which found them satisfactory The website further claims that petitioners in this court case have contend ed that the DPC deal never received the mandatory economic CEA clearance A mandatory CEA clearance was the legal safeguard against signing PPAs at exorbitant rates As this clearance was never received the petitioners conclude that the Dabhol PPA has no force in law The group believes th at this argument is persuasive and has hoped that the Supreme Court will as well And the NRIs are putting their money in what they believe is the truth A week ago they ran an advertisement in an Indian daily on the controversy Headlined each of you owes Rs lakh to Enron the ins ert claims that the Maharashtra government has been unable to pay DPC Rs billion But it has entered into a contract which obligates it to pay Rs trillion over the next years Predicting a collapse in the states finances the NRIs believes that Maharashtra will have no money for roads drinking water projects

Utility Commission of Texas If there are any bugs we want to find out before the full launch Jan State officials were already nervous about their grand experiment in free markets but the current debacle in California has them even more on edge California which partially deregulated its electricity markets several yea rs ago now has two public utilities teetering on the edge of bankruptcy and unable to pay for electricity they bought Homes and businesses have faced rolling blackouts as the state at times hasnt been able to scrape up enoug h electricity to meet demand While the Public Utility Commission and others have repeatedly said that Texas wont repeat the California experience theyre looking to the pilot program to expose any flaws For the first month the state and electric providers will concentrate on commercial customers In midMarch theyll turn their attention to home customers However Public Utility Commission chairman Pat Wood III said both residential and commercial customers may sign up beginning Thursday Commercial users must go through a lottery to be chosen and the percent will be based on total commercial electricity used Residential customers will be added on a firstcome firstpicked basis wi th the cutoff after percent of all residential customers have volunteered fo r the program A key to the Texas program is the price to beat the basic rate that the utilities can charge That price will be a percent reduction from the electric rates charged by the utilities before the pilot program begins The investorowned utilities also include Central Power Light Southweste rn Electric Power Co Entergy SESCO and Southwestern Public Service Co Other companies can charge whatever they please but as Mr Hadley noted they probably wont get too far charging more than the pricetobeat rate s of the utilities When the Texas Legislature passed Senate Bill in to start retail competition in electricity the pricetobeat rate was set up to give competitors a chance to compete against the entrenched utilities Mr Hadley said the price to beat provides other electric retailers something to work against In addition the percent reduction from the utilities current rates would be enough of a cut to provide a customer a benefit but not so low as to prevent competition he said Of course the utilities dont have their hands tied in areas outside their current monopoly territory and most plan to compete aggressively for customers For example TNP Enterprises Inc parent of TexasNew Mexico Power has created a subsidiary First Choice Power Inc to lead its fight in the electric wars Jim Niewald First Choice director of marketing said the company will use the pilot period as a learning time to test ways to compete and to market its products Were going to take a sort of moderate approach Were not going to be rea l aggressive On the other hand were not going to be sitting back totally Mr Niewald said TXU spokesman Chris Schein said the Dallasbased company sees the pilot period as a time to work out kinks and discover if there are any inherent problems in the way that electricity competition in Texas works Its important to remember that the pilot program is less of a marketing event than it is an opportunity for TXU and the rest of the state to test systems The real marketing opportunity begins Jan Mr Schein said We are treating this as an opportunity to make sure our systems are communicating with all the states systems to make the customers choosing process as seamless as possible he said While TXU will be trying to sign up customers in the parts of Texas that it doesnt now serve it also has to deal with the pricetobeat rate freeze that will keep it from offering discounts in its current service area including DallasFort Worth Central Texas and other spots TXU is hoping that its existing customers want more than the lowest price Mr Schein said in the same way that not every customer chooses a car bas ed on price If that were true Kia would be the bestselling car in the US TXU will be promoting its quality of service and a package of bundled services that it hopes will be attractive For those who care about the environment TXU will offer green power or electricity generated by wind or other nonfossil sources Also entering the fray will be Green Mountain Energy Co which sells nothi ng but green power We are looking forward to bringing Texans the opportunity to support clean er air by purchasing power made from cleaner and renewable sources Green Mountain chief executive officer Dennis Kelly said in a prepared statement One of the most powerful benefits of electric choice is the ability for people to choose how their power is made he said As more people understand that making electricity causes more air pollutio n than any other industry he continued they will look for a simple way to purchase electricity that includes clean renewable sources like wind sun a nd hydropower Enron Corp the Houston energy giant has three companies that will compet e for customers in the deregulated world Two of its subsidiaries will target large customers Enron Power Marketing Inc will sell to wholesale

since nationalisation in the s Some of the oil majors are worried about the scope of the projects and abou t some apparent resistance from state firm Saudi Aramco to their involvement in areas which the national company feels remains its territory Theres a feeling that Aramco and the oil ministry may be putting up some resistance to the scope of the projects said an industry insider The companies want more financial and logistical details he said There s a worry that the extent of the upside for the companies is getting very limited Others remain more sanguine saying negotiations remain at an early stage Its still at an early stage and all these companies are still keen to for ge ahead said one company official Foreign minister Prince Saud is in charge of the negotiations and is the driving force behind the move to get the companies back into Saudi Arabia The firms are being asked to help develop known gas reserves and also inves t in downstream projects fed by gas supplies such as power and desalination The more valuable oil sector where Aramco holds large volumes of mothballe d capacity remains strictly off limits to the foreign companies Industry insiders said Riyadh is looking for detailed plans on how to go forward with the three gas projects for which three consortiums have alread y been sketched out But the companies ideally would like to see more information

rebuffing an approach last year from rival platformIntercontinentalExchange ICE which is now up and running Rappaport who will turn in a few weeks will have to watch from afar to see if his strategy

of more than Internet energy exchanges observers usually poi nt to Enron Corps EnronOnline wwwenrononlinecom and ICE wwwintcxcom as success stories so far But Rappaport counts neither as competitors enymex has to worry about EnronOnline trades an average of billion a day but does not accept third party trades so Rappaport doesnt put it in the same category as enymex ICE has enough liquidity to be a leader among fledgling independent online exchange but its numbers are far from those of an established exchange lik e NYMEX In its first week trading crude options this year ICE traded million

has turbines that could be used in new California power plants if the state gives generators incentives to relieve an electricity shortage there Chairman Kenneth Lay said California Gov Gray Davis wants to boost the states generating capacity by megawatt s enough to light million homes by July Staff Associated Press Bloomberg News Dow Jones News Service Wall Street Journal State sees billion tab for emergency buys San Diego UnionTribune By Ed Mendel UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER February SACRAMENTO The amount the state expects to spend on emergency power has soared to billion and may continue to grow for weeks or months A request for an additional million last week was quickly followed by a request for another million this week in part because the state has begun buying power for San Diego Gas Electric The emergency purchases began Jan when Gov Gray Davis declared an emergency because suppliers would no longer sell power to two nearly bankru pt utilities Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison The state is buying power on the expensive spot market while struggling to negotiate a portfolio of longterm contracts that are expected to sharply reduce costs Davis said yesterday that more longterm contracts could be announced this week But the state does not want to obtain all of its longterm contracts immediately because prices could go down later Meanwhile the governor said he hopes that an agreement on a plan to begin paying off the billion debt of the utilities in exchange for their transmission systems and other assets will calm the market The governor intends to reach an agreement with legislative leaders on a debtrelief plan that can be presented to the utilities tomorrow setting t he stage for several weeks of negotiations As soon as the utilities indicate their assent to this plan or some modified version we can assent to everything will begin to stabilize and calm down Davis said There is no question when there is uncertainty it affects prices and we want to create the opposite some certainty predictability in what I like to call a challenge Davis told reporters and you guys call a crisis The governor said that state purchase of the transmission systems will be t he biggest part of the proposal tomorrow Other assets that have been mentione d are stock options scenic land around hydroelectric facilities and payment s from utility parent firms The state is not revealing the price of its power purchases arguing that would prevent lowerpriced bids from suppliers in the future Davis said he hopes to have a secrecy period of less than six months and may announce a schedule in two or three weeks But I definitely do not want to jeopardize the integrity of the secret bid prices he said Because if we do that we are just going to force Californians to pay more for power than they would otherwise An official of the state Department of Water Resources which owns hydroelectric facilities and is purchasing power for the state estimated last month that the state was paying million a day for power The governors emergency order last month authorized the state to dip into million in Water Resources funds The Legislature quickly appropriated million for additional power purchases and included million in t he bill authorizing longterm contracts But Feb the state Department of Finance sent the Legislature a deficiency notice saying it intended to begin spending an additional million to b uy power in days unless the Legislature objected The department issued another notice this week saying yet another million will be required because all of the previous funding is expected to be exhausted by Feb This is somewhat sooner than had earlier been anticipated due to colder weather and the inclusion of electricity purchases for the San Diego Gas Electric service area said the notice issued Tuesday The longterm contracting legislation signed early this month by Davis made SDGE eligible for the state purchases SDGE is in better financial condition than PGE and Edison but has a debt of more than million All three utilities are the victims of a failed deregulation plan The rate s they can charge customers are capped in SDGEs case by legislation after bills doubled last summer while the wholesale cost of power soared producing huge debts The longterm contracting legislation authorizes the state to issue billion or more in bonds to spread the cost of the power purchases over a period of years in an attempt to avoid a rate increase The bonds will be paid off by ratepayers through a monthly charge on their bill Money from the bonds also will be used to repay Water Resources and t he state general fund for the purchases made on the spot market In comparison the billion that the state expects to spend on power purchases so far is equal to the reserve in the billion state budget proposed for next fiscal year It is more than the total amount of money earmarked for the states mental health programs State Treasurer Phil Angelides told reporters last week that the billio n bond issue will not be ready until May He said if interim financing throug h shortterm notes is too expensive the state has billion in cash reserve s Angelides said that the longterm contracts must be obtained before the bon ds can be issued He said the average price of the contracts will determine th e total amount needed for the bond issue which could exceed billion The governor spoke yesterday while revealing more details of his plan to boost power generation in California by megawatts to avoid blackouts this summer when airconditioning drives up the demand for electricity He is proposing legislation that would provide rebates to companies that install small business generators of less than kilowatts a percent t ax credit for generators between and kilowatts and million for cogeneration wind and solar programs We are in for a struggle this summer Davis said It will test our resolve But I am convinced if we all do our part we will get through this summer without major disruptions Jeffrey Skilling chief executive officer of Enron the nations largest electricity trader said electricity costs would go down when significant progress occurs in planning power plants Faster siting will cause the forward price of electricity to drop below a megawatt Skilling said yesterday at an electric industry conference in Houston In retail terms that is cents a kilowatt Yesterday was Californias th straight day in a Stage power alert Grid operators struggled to meet demand by making lastminute power purchases fr om the Northwest We came close this morning to blackouts but it got better by the hour said Patrick Dorinson spokesman for the state Independent System Operator It was touch and go ISO managers had worried they might not meet demand because of the forced shutdown of power plants capable of producing megawatts megawatts more than the day before Officials said the plants were taken of f line for repair work Dorinson said he could not predict how long the state would remain on Stage alert It is the same situation I feel like Bill Murray he said referring to the star of the

away from floors and towards electronic trading platforms the LME last October introduced a trial GMT extension to its openoutcry trading hours Before then there had been a break at the end of the

trader said Others said the bulk of trade was seen after with business slackening after some minutes only to pick up from onwards when the customary afternoon rings take place There is a bit of a dead zone between and but the longer it the floor is open the better it is for the survival of the ring anoth er senior trader said EVEN LONGER HOURS UNLIKELY Last month traders from the RDMs mooted the idea of even longer trading hou rs with some seeking to begin daily floor trading from as early as GMT ending as now at GMT It the board looked at this situation in the light of a great deal of change

interoffice telephone market the LME also demutualised late in and reconstituted its board Traders said another extension was unlikely as there was no unanimity among the RDMs Also such a move would meet opposition from the LMEs associate broker clearing members ABCMs These companies have all the rights of LME membership but cannot trade during the openoutcry sessions Then they largely become customers of the market and trade through the RDMs The current extension means that they ABCMs have lost a lot of their pricing power over lunch one said The RDMs are fighting the advance of

sector and it has found an important Western ally Canada Under Mr Zhus plans the power industry would no longer be run as a monopoly State power companies operating hydro dams and nuclear stations would have to compete with private power companies for access to customers Consumers would need to pay for transmission costs as well as generation costs giving local power producers who dont need to ship power a great distance a major cost advantage over distant suppliers If Mr Zhu and his reformers succeed in implementing this plan Chinas multibillion dollar hydro and nuclear empires long

a new gasfired plant Hangzhou city with Japanese financing is building a megawatt gasfired cogeneratio n plant that will save tons of coal a year and eliminate dozens of th e citys inefficient industrial boilers Already five major Chinese cities have built their own natural gas networks to promote private investment in gasfired power plants While Canada partners with Chinas aging

Steel Corporation Shakou Power Plant Company now supplies electricity to Foshan city using a megawatt oilfired combinedcycle plant financed by Hong Kong banks Knowing that large hydro coal and nuclear cannot compete with this new bre ed of cleaner and lowercost power producer the central monopolists are fighting back To prop up the uneconomic nuclear plants that Canada and Chinas domestic nuclear industry are providing Chinas State Council not only provides a host of subsidies it wants to force large power consumers to buy nuclear power To prop up the Three Gorges project a pariah that no western government would touch before Canada endorsed it with subsidies on a previous Team Canada mission the State Economic and Trade Commission announced that provincial and city authorities will have to buy electricity from the Three Gorges dam once it starts generating electricity in At the same time the government is shutting down small power plants ostensib ly for environmental reasons and forbidding electricity distribution authorities in areas served by large hydro dams to buy power from private suppliers But these successes by the old guard at subverting markets are exceptions Apart from Canada the power monopolists have few friends Should the power monopolists lose their grip to Mr Zhu as have other monopolists in Chinas economy Canadas power industry may find it has few friends

Reliance Reliance Petroleum Ltd RRPT and ONGC Oil Natural Gas Co PONG for buying Enrons stake in these fields the Financial Express reported Asked to comment on the report Roger Holliday Marathons director of publ ic affairs told Dow Jones Newswires that it is not company practice to respon d to speculation in the media Enron said last year it was considering selling its oil and gas assets located in the Mukta Panna and Tapti oil and gas fields Reliance Petroleu m and ONGC Enrons joint ventures partners have expressed an interest in bidding for the stake Enron India operates three offshore oil and gas fields in a joint venture with ONGC and Reliance Petroleum The Tapti Panna and Mukta fields are located off the coast of Gujarat and Maharastra It holds a stake in each field

agrees to widen scope of Enron review committee Our Bureau The Economic Times Copyright C The Economic Times Source World Reporter TM MUMBAI IN RESPONSE to persistent demands from the antiEnron section of the ruling alliance the Maharashtra government on Wednesday agreed to widen the terms and references of the highpowered Enron review committee The state government has instituted the review committee to look into the states energy scenario with special reference to the US energy giant Enron s Dabhol Power Company The terms and references of the review committee will be extended as suggested by the allies of the ruling Democratic Front and whatever documen ts are sought by the committee will be provided to it including the power purchase agreement chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh said on Wednesday He however refused to go into details of the extended scope of the review panel saying all issues raised by the DF constituents will be studied The DF coordination committee convenor N D Patil had earlier disapproved the terms and references of the Madhav Godboleled panel saying the committee should look not only into the PPA but also the Enron project in totality He had written to the chief minister asking him to widen the revi ew committees scope The review committee will be submitting its interim report about the PPA signed between the Maharashtra State Electricity Board and Enrons DPC within a month said the chief minister It could take another month or so to submit its report concerning issues raised by the DF splinter groups Deshmukh said adding there are no differences in the ruling alliance over the matter When asked about the state governments Rs crore payment to MSEB to clear the last installment of DPCs November bill of Rs crore Deshmukh said The amount was not paid to clear DPCs dues It is the amount payable to MSE B from the budgetary allocation It is purely at the discretion of the board as how to use its funds he clarified To a query he said we have not asked the MSEB to put a stop to DPCs payments Deshmukh reiterated that the Centre should take over DPCs project and said the state government was yet to receive any communication in this regard Asked about renegotiations with DPC Deshmukh said let the review committe e submit its report first Meanwhile Kirit Parikh a prominent member of the review committee has expressed his inability to attend some of the committee meetings The antiEnron section of the DF allies had expressed displeasure at Parikhs inclusion in the committee citing his proEnron stance in the past Parikh is not withdrawing from the committee said Deshmukh while confirmi ng the development It might not be possible for a member to attend each and every meeting of the committee he said INDIAN NEWSPAPER

supplier You guarantee the supplier you will buy at least per cent of everything he produces In case you fail to buy up to per cent of the suppliers plant capacity then you agree to pay a penalty to the supplier The absolute quantum you have to pay is determined among other factors by the rupeedollar rate as well as the prices of certain commodities in the international market Under the terms of the contract you agree to shoulde r both these risks In case you fail to pay your supplier who incidentally is supplying only about a fifth of your total requirements the contract mortgages all your assets as well the assets of your parent company The contract also guarantees that in case you fail to pay the supplier your parent company will be forced to pay the supplier and then deduct it from the revenues due to your company As if all this is not enough the contract also stipulates that it is not governed by Indian laws and that the parent company will continue to pay th e supplier even if the contract is termed illegal invalid or unenforceable The supplier starts his operations and given the nature of the contract th e product is extremely highpriced and your company is not in a position to pay What would you do Are you stupid I would never sign a contract like that If my company even got a hint that I was contemplating signing a contract like this I would be sacked and legal proceedings initiated against me were some of t he reactions I got when I put this proposal to some of my friends from the corporate circles Why is it then that the Maharashtra State Electricity Board the Maharashtr a Government as well as the Union Government have got into such an agreement with the Enronpromoted Dabhol Power Corporation Were they all really concerned about the power situation in Maharashtra or were there other unsa id imperatives We will perhaps never get the answers to these questions but as DPC evoked the Central counterguarantee for its payment the controversial project ha s once again become the focus of media attention Last week was full of stories and discussions on the controversy from daytoday news reports to a lengthy feature in the India Business Report But the most interesting one was on India Talks on CNBC and featured Mr Har ry Dhaul DirectorGeneral of the Independent Power Producers Association an d Mr Abhay Mehta activist and author of Power Play an expose of the Enron project Anchored by Mr Paranjoy Guha Thakurta the discussion kicked off by talking about the options open to the various parties involved Mr Dhaul understandably considering his constituency was of the opinion that the first thing to do is honour the contract He believed it was possible for a ll parties concerned to come to some kind of an amicable solution Mr Guha Thakurta interrupted to ask him whether the Maharashtra Government going bankrupt by honouring the contract was an amicable solution Mr Dhauls answer was a classic case of using numbers to confuse the issue I do not know whether by adding five per cent of the capacity the Maharashtra government will go bankrupt he said Reacting to this Mr Mehta pointed out that for this additional five per ce nt capacity that Mr Dhaul talked about the MSEB would be shelling out about per cent of its revenues and once the second phase of DPC came on stream t he MSEB would be paying out close to per cent of its total revenues There is no set of conceivable economic parameters which can allow payments of th is magnitude he said Mr Mehta pointed out that what has never been appreciated is the sheer amou nt of money involved The total contract with DPC is worth billion the singlelargest commercial contract in the history of this country as Mr Mehta described it and went on to say that if one assumed a per cent annual depreciation of the rupee against the dollar as it has happened ove r the last years it meant a total outlay of hold your breath Rs crore When Mr Dhaul started to ask whether it meant that the country was not in a position to accept foreign investment of billion Mr Guha Thakurta again to his credit interrupted to say the issue was not really the quantu m of foreign investment as the terms at which it has been contracted Mr Mehta disputed the claim that DPC has invested billion or about Rs crore for a MW project Are they out of their minds Who has checked these figures he asked pointing out that internationally the norm for power projects was Rs crore per MW There is no way they ha ve invested more than billion he said Mr Thakurta with a wicked grin on his face interrupted to ask him whether he was including the million that Ms Linda Powers of Enron had said been spent on educating Indian authorities Second Mr Mehta said that almost per cent of the investmen ts has come from India from institutions such as the IDBI SBI etc We have an absurd situation when a country like Mozambique orders equipmen t from the US and the US EXIM bank gives a loan for it without any guarantees But the US EXIM Banks loans to Enron have been guaranteed by Indian institutions Mr Mehta said Mr Dhaul while eventually agreeing that power from DPC was more expensive said that the regulator in Maharashtra has made certain observations about it He said he was not worried about the merit or dispatch aspect of the issue Mr Dhaul was of course referring to the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commissions direction to the MSEB to buy power from the cheapes t available sources But the problem is that irrespective of whether the MSE B buys power from Enron or not the PPA stipulates that it still has to continue paying A point that maybe not Mr Dhaul but all citizens of Maharashtra should be worried about Mr Dhaul went on say that he shared Mr Mehtas concerns about the cost of electricity and felt that some sort of solution could be found But he lef t the critical issue unsaid Where is the money How is the Maharashtra Government going to pay the absurd amounts of money that it has contracted for May be as a wag suggested trifle cynically it is time we set up a Dabhol Relief Fund Menka Shivdasani Enron Saga Power of political will on test Rajesh Ramachandran The Times of India Copyright C The Times of India Source World Reporter TM NEW DELHI Is there a way out of the Enron imbroglio Contrary to what experts and the government say there seem several options available to t he government But to avail them would require some political will S N Roy former chairman of the Central Electricity Authority points out that just as Pakistan got a US power company to reduce its tariff by half India too should get the Enron tariff reduced When asked whether it is ready to renegotiate the power purchase agreement PPA and bring down the tariff Enron did not respond Instead a public relations agency replied that tariffs are not high Observers assert that even after ensuring a reasonable profit for Enron th e tariffs can be cut K K Govil director projects Power Finance Corporation insists The present PPA is heavily in favour of Enron The PPA should be renegotiated to get capital costs and rate of return calculated in rupees and not dollars According to Govil pegging the costs and tariffs to foreign exchange is unheard of The capacity related incentive should also go Ideally the cost of a gasbased plant should be half that of a coalfired plant But in Enrons case it is not so This too has to be rectified said Govi l The government is tightlipped but sources say the government may palm off the burden to utlilities like National Thermal Power Corporation Power Trading Corporation or Power Grid Corporation That will end the public scrutiny of the project contrary to what is happening in Maharashtra now and the account will be shared by central utilities state electricity boar ds and others Also making the round is a politically powerful industrial houses name which might broker the deal But will all this help Roy feels it would be a disaster Impossible How can the government force NTPC or PTC a commercial enterprise to buy power at Rs a unit and sell it at Rs Even at full capacity Enrons power is expected to cost around Rs a unit much higher than the NTPCs selling ra te of about Rs per unit Prasant Bhushan fighting a public interest litigation in the Supreme Court has another set of solutions Nationalise the project by an Act of Parliament paying Enron a token or fair amount as in the case of bank nationalisation Or the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commissions statutory power should be invoked to override the PPA and regulate the tariffs The Supreme Court had earlier limited the petitions scope to accountabilit y of the public servants If the SC gives full leave the project will be voided since there was much illegality involved Most importantly if a criminal investigation into the bribes is initiated enough evidence could be unearthed in three months said Bhushan Will all this deter foreign investment in India Ashok Rao convenor of national working group for power feels the bogey of foreign investment fleeing is a blackmail tactic He points out that India is a bigger power industry market than most of Europe West Asia or Latin America There is a global recession in power industry So most private power companies are ju st a front for power equipment manufacturers who have to sell their equipment in India That is why they insist there should be no competitive bidding for equipment Would it hurt much if the government synchronised peoples nee ds with investor priorities Making the power sector viable Prem Shankar Jha The Hindu Copyright C Kasturi Sons Ltd KSL Source World Reporter TM Asia Intelligence Wire The fact that Enron had to invoke the Central governments guarantee before the Maharashtra State Electricity Board finally paid its dues till November shows that both the MSEB and the Maharashtra government are comprehensively bankrupt The MSEB paid because the Maharashtra government realised that pushing the burden onto New Delhi would not get it off the hook The counterguarantee ensured that the Centre would pay Enron and deduct the mon ey from Maharashtras annual plan allocation So why did Mumbai create the confrontation If one were to go by the ranting of Maharashtra politicians it was to mak e sure that there would be no more Enrons that is no more corrupt deals with rapacious foreign investors bent upon robbing the poor people of Indi a by forcing them to pay seven rupees a unit for power But the true reason i s that the Maharashtra government was trying to shift the blame for its own lack of courage Like virtually every other State government Maharashtra lacks the courage to stop giving electricity free or nearly free to more than three quarters of its consumers This has plunged the MSEB deep into t he red because there is an obvious limit to how far the remaining paying consumers can subsidise the rest The CEO of Enron in India put this in a nutshell a few days ago when he pointed out that the MSEBs problems arose from the fact that it was subsidising per cent of its consumers and allowing transmission and distribution losses an euphemism for power theft of fully one third of the power it generated As if this was not bad enough the Government repeatedly declared an amnesty for consumers who had not paid their bills The MSEB has therefore sunk deeper and deeper into the red To cut its cost s it has bought as little as possible from Enron and that has pushed the per unit cost of Dabhol power into the stratosphere Enrons argument is unassailable Every single power utility in the world follows one basic rul e in power pricing This is to set a tariff that covers the average cost of generation for all the stations that are on line at the time When a new power plant is added or an old one replaced the much higher cost of generation from the new plant the marginal cost to the utility is absorbe d by raising the average tariff just enough to absorb the increased cost at t he margin In the case of Maharashtra since the Dabhol plant added per cent to the States total generating capacity and amounted to about per cent o f MSEBs capacity an per cent increase in average tariff or in the realisation of unpaid dues would have sufficed But although the MSEB had been increasing its average tariffs in earlier years it did not do so between and that is when Dabhol was commissioned Add to this a rise in TD losses and MSEBs average realisation actually fell aft er Dabhol came on line If Maharashtra does not want to buy Dabhols power why does it not sell th e surplus to a neighbouring State or to the National Thermal Power Corporatio n in the public sector The answer is that none of them has kept its average tariff realisation above the average cost of generation They too will add to their losses by buying Dabhol power and therefore prefer load shedding instead The difficulty that Enron is experiencing in recovering its dues has delivered the coup de grace not just to foreign but to all private investment in power projects For if it takes a dentists tongs to extract money secured by a formal central counterguarantee what will happen to projects that do not enjoy that safeguard Since public investment is capab le of adding at most MW of generating capacity a year when the country needs three times that capacity economic growth will soon slow to a snail s pace for want of power The Central government knows this Since it has been prodding the Stat e governments towards breaking up the State electricity boards into separate generation transmission and distribution companies and then privatising them But so far only one State Orissa has gone the whole way The cris is that the country therefore faces is that while at the present pace the privatisation of distribution could take as long as ten years the power crisis is already here What the country needs is a means to make the State electricity boards viable today before they are privatised So far apart from making the States bind themselves to various financial reforms in the memoranda of understanding that they have signed with the Centre as they as k for doles to tide them over their financial woes the Central Government ha s done nothing There is however a way to do this almost immediately This is to end the theft of power that is taking place in the country in the name of the farme r In sharp contrast to the privatisation of the SEBs this can be accomplishe d in at most two years While everyone knows that some of the electricity supposedly consumed by th e farmer is actually diverted to other uses most people have assumed that th e proportion diverted is relatively small This is because the rise in the share of electricity consumed by the rural sector from per cent in to per cent in seems on the face of it reasonable Not everyone has realised that in absolute terms farm consumption increase d by times And this happened when the number of electrified tubewells ha d only doubled from million to million and the land under irrigation had increased by only per cent In absolute terms therefore electricity consumption for agriculture should not have risen by more than three times The balance amounting to billion units in was in effect stole n Had the States realised only Rs per unit for this electricity it would have increased the revenue of the SEBs by Rs crores and made them solvent overnight State governments have been unwilling to raise tariffs f or agriculture for fear of hurting the farmers But the Central Government can show them a simple way of continuing to subsidise irrigation which is overwhelmingly the main consumer of electricity on the farm without encouraging wholesale diversion and theft This is to issue registration papers for every electrified pumpset in the country stating its horsepower and the land cultivated by the farmer raise the rural tariff to a flat Rs per unit or whatever the SEBs deem appropriate and offer a rebate of Rs the going rate of subsidy on the estimated maximum consumption of power per tubewell Farmers need only bring their bills to a local bank wit h which they have opened an account show their registration papers and pay the rebated amount The bill will be paid by the bank as urban electricity and telephone bills are paid today and the rebate collected by it from the government authority concerned This scheme has the added advantage that to avail themselves of the subsidy the farmers will have to install electricity meters State governments have accepted the need to do this in principle but have so far been unable to speed up its implementation Prabhu stresses supply reforms Our Economy Bureau NEW DELHI Business Standard Copyright c Business Standard Union power minister Suresh Prabhu has called for the need to shift focus from power generation to the upgradation of the distribution system so tha t generation

DEREGULATION JUST HASTENED RECKONING MIKE LEWIS PI reporter Seattle PostIntelligencer FINAL A Copyright A decade ago it seemed like a great idea Lift regulations on electrical utilities so that competition could drive down prices Deregulating the generation and distribution of power the theory went wou ld create competition among a new breed of power companies that would lower costs to consumers and unleash creativity just as deregulation of the telephone utilities did a decade before California and more than dozen other states jumped in Oregon made a small step in that direction Washington took a pass But now all three states share the burden of outofcontrol energy costs and the specter of blackout s Legislators from Sacramento to Olympia are scrambling to rein in a fullblo wn power crisis even as consumers scramble to pay ballooning power bills Theres little argument that existing deregulation has not only failed but has failed so profoundly that politicians and regulators are not talking as much about fixing it as scuttling it whole Deregulation has gotten to be such a bad word said state Sen Bill Finkbeiner a Kirkland Republican who in chaired the Legislatures Ener gy Committee which rejected deregulation Its never going to happen now at least not in the Western US How bad has the situation become Over two weeks in late November and early December the market price for a megawatt of power jumped fivefold forcin g King County to briefly shut down one of its two sewage treatment plants Some cities are turning off streetlights and the states multibilliondoll ar aluminum industry has idled some plants sometimes to sell power leaving hundreds of workers idle In Seattle the average monthly City Light bill h as jumped percent to For all of us the power crisis has become a lesson in how policies of individual states can be rendered meaningless when it comes to interstate a nd international commerce Washington didnt deregulate California did Both states pay the price As one Northwest corporate lobbyist put it dryly the next time his company needs economic protection in Olympia hell contact Sacramento Heres how it is said Ed Mosey a Bonneville Power Administration spokesman Everyone else is the tail California is the dog Gov Gary Locke who is often reluctant to publicly criticize allies such a s California Gov Gray Davis acknowledged in a recent interview that he find s it frustrating that his state decided against deregulation but still finds itself in a mess We didnt make the same decision they did Locke said But Californias effect is impossible to avoid But blaming California isnt just simplistic it also isnt entirely accurate Those who buy sell and move electricity and natural gas and the politicians who attempt to control the markets agree that Washingtons risi ng power costs are a culmination of events that began to unfold a lifetime ago in the depths of the Great Depression President Franklin D Roosevelts New Deal gave the Northwest the bargain o f a lifetime Hoping to lift the nation out of the Depression the Roosevelt administration arranged an unprecedented series of public works projects providing jobs building roads bridges and dams among other things across the nation The Works Progress Administration built the Bonneville and Grand Coulee dam s on the Columbia River the vanguard of the federal hydroelectric dams th at now feed power to the Bonneville Power Administration a selfsupporting federal authority with headquarters near Portland The BPA is the powerhouse of a region the size of Texas providing half of all electricity used in the Northwest The remainder comes from a network o f public and private utilities including giants like Seattle City Light that predate Bonneville by decades All told there are about big and small hydroelectric dams in the Northwest and a far smaller number of coal and gasfired plants In the early days the BPA dams generated so much more power than the Northwest could use that congressmen joked that even the jackrabbits could be wired up During World War II the government took advantage of the plentif ul power by building aluminum production plants in Tacoma Spokane and Vancouv er to supply the needs of aircraft makers and shipbuilders such as The Boeing Co in Seattle and Henry Kaisers shipyard in Portland After the war BPA officials and local politicians persuaded the aluminum producers to stay put promising continued lowcost subsidized power contracts recently renewed to run through For local industry cheap power has always been a selling point No raw materials used in making aluminum are found in the Northwest but shipping them here is costeffective because smelting the ore takes a lot of juice One aluminum plant consumes as much electricity as a small city In the s this newly powerful local industry secured its first major coup a federal mandate that public utilities in the region such as Seattl e City Light could buy power at the subsidized cost of production Sixty percent of that preference power stays in Washington state Oregon generally takes percent The balance goes to Idaho and Montana and any surplus can be sold at market rate This combination of natural resources federal investment and populist politics has allowed the Northwest to enjoy some of the cheapest electricit y in the nation A BPA survey showed that the average residential cost f or power in the region was cents per kilowatt hour compared with a nationwide average of cents a rate that at least until now has continued to attract industry to the region In when Seattle resident s were paying monthly electricity bills the same amount of power on the East Coast sometimes cost as much as Much of the hightech relocation up here directly was linked to cheap power said Intels director of governmental relations Richard Hall Inte l employs people at its plant in DuPont While rates have gone up recently power in the Northwest remains a good deal City Light residential customers for example pay cents per kilowatt hour for the first kilowatt hours they use in a day and cents for each kilowatt hour afterward In and the BPA completed an mile line called an intertie between The Dalles Ore and Los Angeles allowing it to market what seeme d like a neverending surplus of power to utilities in fastgrowing Californi a In BPA sold about megawatthours for use in California or about percent of all BPA power sales that year the most recent year Bonneville reported those numbers It takes about megawatts of generating capacity to serve million homes Public utilities in California are small but two giant private investorowned companies rival Bonneville in size Monopolies regulated by the state California giants Pacific Gas Electric PGE and Southern California Edison CalEd eventually grew to serve a combined million customers making them the nations two largest private utilities During the summer when air conditioners cause California power use to peak utilities there supplement their needs by turning to the Northwest which usually has electricity to spare In winter when furnaces cause demand to peak in the Northwest California plants ship surplus power north The relationship worked flawlessly for decades In fact it worked too well With the West Coast tied into one grid the easy flow of power between regions allowed the states to avoid the politically difficult chore of siti ng and building new power plants that would allow each to become selfsufficient even as the total population in the three states blossomed from million in to million today In the mids California began climbing out of a recession brought on b y deep defense cuts high unemployment and energy prices that were among the highest in the nation inadvertently driven up by state and federal regulators who feared that oil and natural gas prices would soar These officials had pushed the utilities to diversify their generation methods T he Federal Energy Regulatory Commission required that they buy a portion of their power from what were then expensive alternative sources such as wind and geothermal plants CalEd estimates that the order has cost its customer s billion over two decades California business interests began to pressure their lawmakers to deregula te the power industry allowing them to buy electricity on the open market and to force PGE and CalEd to cut rates Congress wrote the law in and t he energy commission pressured the utilities to get moving in In December the California Public Utilities Commission voted to open the states electricity industry to competition The Legislature followed with a law based on an agreement brokered with CalEd its biggest industria l customers and an association of independent power producers But the deal was based on four colossal miscalculations And those led to t he current crisis No one foresaw that Californias economy would come roaring back from recession so strongly or so quickly or that so much of the new economy wou ld depend on energyhungry computers and the plants that produce them Both factors overtaxed a system that hadnt seen a new power plant come online for nearly a decade California generates about percent of the electricity it uses relying o n imports from the Southwest and the Northwest for the rest Officials acknowledge that California has not added enough power plants to accommodat e the roughly percent annual growth in its demand for electricity To meet that each year the state has to add either megawatts of generating capacity or conserve an equal amount Regulators forced California utilities to sell their generation divisions without also requiring them to sign longterm power contracts at fixed an d presumably lower rates This put the utilities at a disadvantage because they had to buy power on the open or spot market from operators such as Houstonbased as Enron and Dynegy which have reportedly seen revenues clim b by percent in the past two years while the utilities spiraled into debt A combination of factors cut into the amount of power available on the spot market Less power has been flowing into the grid because several major California power plants have been offline for needed repairs Northwest hydroelectric dams have been operating at lower capacity as they try to avo id draining reservoirs during the drought and a failure to upgrade California s distribution system makes it hard to move surplus power to where it is needed In fact that failure to upgrade the transmission system has proven to be a problem of the same scale as the lack of new power plants Californias fir st rolling blackout was caused not by a lack of power but by a lack of free lines to move it Washington has missed blackouts because it has enough capacity to move power when needed While attorneys general in all three states are investigating accusations that some power sellers have been withholding electricity to drive up price s its unclear whether they did or whether any laws were broken With deregulation the spot market has taken on the trappings of a desperat e auction Every morning the power marketers pay what they must for whatever surplus power they can find Wholesale prices can swing wildly climbing an d falling hundreds of dollars per megawatt hour over a day of trading When Californias demand began to outstrip its supply last summer San Dieg o was hit first The Northwest barely noticed But as the problem spread the power that Bonneville and Puget Sound Energy once bought for winter coverag e wasnt there Local prices began inching up Finally and some would say most important Californias deregulation schem e included a cap on rates for consumers In fact the Legislature there force d a percent retail rate cut as part of the deal to win passage of deregulation These errors and circumstances combined with some corporate restructuring that shifted resources away from traditional lines of busines s forced Californias big utilities to amass a combined debt of billion severely limiting their ability to buy power and prompting the recent round of blackouts in Northern California Do you see the problem there asked Mosey the BPA spokesman It didnt allow the market to function It gave consumers zero incentive to conserve If you had to devise a method whereby you shot yourself in both feet you couldnt do a better job California lawmakers are trying to undo the damage They have appropriated billions of dollars in emergency funding to keep the utilities afloat while they consider a more expensive bailout and re regulation scheme that might involve turning PGE and CalEd into public utilities exactly the opposite of the intent of deregulation Deregulation was initially popular in Washington state but it never had th e same attraction in a region where most voters enjoyed cheap power thanks t o Bonneville and public utilities At the time most people wanted it Finkbeiner recalled And Id like to say we had the great foresight to pass on it but that isnt true We just couldnt agree on what to do and it didnt go anywhere After two years of debate Washington lawmakers saw there was no groundswel l of support for deregulation and they did what politicians do in such cases They dropped it in moving on to the next big issue Now obviously Im glad Finkbeiner said But Finkbeiner is once again dealing with deregulation this time as sponso r of pending legislation that asks California to drop its power rate cap a source of irritation for Northwesterners who have seen their bills zoom up while Californians have not I dont know how Governor Davis will react but it is something they hav e to do Finkbeiner said of his bill which is an entirely symbolic act Washington cannot force California to do anything even though it shares Californias pain Color Photo Photos Map Chart Caption THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Jamie Lubbar a grid resource

E WEST COAST Available only on microfilm Editorial LETTERS PAGE Denver Rocky Mountain News FINAL A Copyright Mike Rosens lesson leaves great deal unsaid Mike Rosens latest effort at providing an economics lesson to the great unwashed masses is typical of his previous efforts it is rife with errors Rosen states that there is no conspiracy of oil and gas companies at work Rosen must have forgotten about OPEC a conspiracy to maximize profits for oil producers Rosen must also have forgotten that last year Vice President Cheney who at the time was head of Haliburton Oil praised OPEC for reduci ng production Rosen must not be aware that California has sued energy companies includin g Enron and Duke Energy both of which are large contributors to President Bu sh and other conservatives for unfair business practices Rosen also blames the California electrical shortage on legislators who fix ed the price of retail electricity and limited the abilities of companies to build new power plants What he fails to state is that retail electricity prices were fixed at the request of power companies at percent of the national retail electricity price so that power companies could gouge consumers and receive a billion bailout for their stranded costs losses that power companies had suffered due to bad investments in nuclear power plants Since California private power companies had made billion from those excess prices that were charged to consumers and had used that money to provide dividends to their shareholders and purchase other power companies Further Southern California Edison SCE one of the largest private power companies in California lobbied to stop a large energy project because the project would have reduced SCEs profits Rosen infers that there is an electricity shortage in California because it does not have adequate electrical capacity for its users What Rosen fails to mention is that peak usage of electricity in California was higher in both and than it was in and that percent more electricity is used during the summer when air conditioners are running than during the winter Because of those facts the only reasonable explanation for the current shortage of electricity is the unrestricted greed of power supplier s who find it more important to maximize the returns to their shareholders by restricting supplies and raising profits than to supply necessary power to the citizens who need it Steve Waldmann Colorado Springs BUSINESS Catholic Health East signs energy supply contract Staff report Times Union Albany NY THREE STAR E Copyright

companies are throwing their weight behind storage services promising to help deliver storage capacity much li ke utilities furnish electricity But a looming market shakeout makes it more vital than ever for companies t o scrutinize providers before committing to a contract Some customers already are seeking to protect their data with servicelevel agreements SLAs that compensate them when their storage service provider fails to deliver as promised Experts also recommend examining a providers market capitalization expertise reference accounts and all the other attributes a company would typically consider when choosing a strategic IT partner Storage service providers or SSPs claim to remove many headaches of managing storage Customers dont have to invest in their own storage infrastructure and personnel so SSPs can be a cheaper and faster way to ge t started Customers buy only as much capacity as they need The cost of buying and managing a storage system was so prohibitive that Verilytics Inc signed on with StorageNetworks which charges the Web porta l builder about per month for Gbytes of storage Because they have a payasyougo model it allowed us to get in at a fair ly low entry point said Mike Harvey head of operations at Verilytics As o ur needs require we can add additional capacity Verilytics signed an SLA with StorageNetworks that specifies financial penalties for unplanned downtime based on the length of an outage In fact nearly half of companies surveyed by Dataquest say theyre willing to p ay SSPs extra for agreements that compensate them for lost revenue due to downtime or service problems Increasing numbers of customers are even demanding SLAs per application typ e Unless these storage companies are making appropriate investments so they can guarantee perapplication SLAs theyre going to meet some resistance from potential customers said Sage Research president Kathryn Korostoff The range of SSP options varies widely For example to keep data inhouse because of security or privacy concerns a company may elect to have the vendor provide remote storage management Companies pay about per month per terabyte for basic storageondemand Additional featuressuch as scheduled backup and rest ore realtime data replication and SLAs guaranteeing percent uptimeca n push costs to more than per month per terabyte That figure include s equipment maintenance floor space and personnel costs StorageNetworks quotes fees of to per month per terabyte said John Clavin executive vice president of marketing A downside to outsourcing storage is that an organization is putting valuab le digital assets into someone elses hands The data may not be adequately protected from snoops or secured against loss And what happens to the data if the SSP should suddenly go out of business No one really knows We tell our enduser clients to be very selective who they choose and we tell them to make sure they have very concrete very well defined escape clauses said Arun Taneja an analyst at the Enterprise Storage Group Brokerage firm Charles Schwab Co prefers to maintain control of its huge repository of customer data said David Sherr vice president of architectu re and planning Sherr questions the wisdom of trusting customer data to a thi rd party It would be problematic he said You need to protect the privacy of your customers data The initial SSP customers were mostly dotcoms but in recent months more Global enterprises have signed up according to a recent survey by Sag e Research The survey found that percent of businesses with fewer than employees and percent of larger enterprises outsource storage While tho se numbers are small they are significant because the category is still so new Korostoff said More than half of the companies with which StorageNetworks has contract s are large enterprises Clavin said Several companies have jumped into storage services in recent months Exodu s Communications stock

IBM and Sun ha ve storage services alliances with ASPs and other providers Even energy company Enron is getting into the business Its Broadband Services unit launched a BtoB exchange on Jan that matches excess capacity owned by SSPs with corporate storage buyers Enron has signed a deal with StorageNetworks and is negotiating similar agreements with at least six other providers said Ravi Thuraisingham Enro n s lead storage trader Many analysts see a massive consolidation on the horizon A lot of compani es have gone into this business thinking that its an easy business Taneja said The economics of running an SSP profitably arent well defined Tanej a said and the longterm cost of building and regularly upgrading a bestofclass storage infrastructure may be too onerous for many Meanwhile the amount of data that companies amass is increasing exponentially Forrester Research predicts that companies will increase the ir average online storage capacities by a factor of over the next five year s That means storage and associated administration will grow from percent o f current information systems budgets to percent in the firm estimates And the business outlook for SSPs is rosy North American businesses will spend billion on storage utilities by according to Dataquest Enterprise Storage forecasts a billion market in Members Keep Off First Enron Panel Meet The Indian

serious concern in view of their likely impact on th e momentum of reform in the power sector initiated after nearly a decade of planning privatization and unbundling of SEBs and distribution systems The attitude of the Maharashtra Government towards an agreement on Dabhol does not inspire confidence in our honesty of purpose Failure to obey the contract displays frustration lack of integrity and the untrustworthiness of the Government The Government of Maharashtra knew their contractual obligations beforehand and should have started negotiations with Enron in order to find a solution The fact that it has taken two months to appoint a committee only indicates the lack of seriousness on its part Again the formation of a committee may be rightly or wrongly construed as an attempt to delay the

Senate measures would authorize takeover of transmission lines and construction of generating plants Backers say the plan is not a bailout of utilities CARL INGRAM MITCHELL LANDSBERG JENIFER WARREN TIMES STAFF WRITERS Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO Nudging government toward an expanded role in the energy business a Senate committee Tuesday approved two farreaching bills paving the way for the state to buy Californias sprawling electrical transmission grid and build and operate its own power plants The legislation aims to protect California from the crisis it faces today a nightmare of supply shortages and skyhigh power prices said the bills author Senate leader John L Burton DSan Francisco What were trying to do here is give the state some influence and control over its own destiny Burton said The idea is to provide affordable reliable energy at times we need it most One of the bills authorizes Gov Gray Davis to negotiate with Californias beleaguered utilities about a state takeover of the transmission system a transaction that could help them avoid bankruptcy By paying anywhere from billion to billion for the miles of electric wires the state would provide the utilities with cash to help relieve their mushrooming debt Some would call it a bailout Burton said I would prefer to call it an infusion of capital Davis prefers the term buyout and said any state takeover of the grid should be a moneymaker Talking with reporters after a speech in Los Angeles Davis said he hopes to announce a proposal Friday under which the state would receive the transmission system a financial stake in the utility companies and some other assetpossibly some of the utilities hydroelectric facilitiesin exchange for billions of dollars in state cash We will insist upon receiving commensurate equivalent value for any value we confer on the utilities Davis said The governor added that the utilities parent companieswhich have received among other assets billions of dollars in tax overpayments from Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electricshould help bring the utilities back to fiscal health Tuesday marked the th straight day in which California endured a Stage power alert with energy reserves critically low on the grid serving most of of the state Grid operators came closer than usual to triggering rotating blackouts but by the evening hours of peak demand officials at the California Independent System Operator were optimistic that conservation and power purchases would help them dodge outages CalISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson blamed the power shortfall on a cold snap that boosted electricity consumption and on the shutdown of power plants capable of generating onethird of the states winter peak demand Four years after electric utilities were partially deregulated in California the state is caught in a tangle of skyrocketing energy prices booming demand and short supplies Battered by debt the states largest investorowned utilities lack the cash and credit to buy power themselves forcing the state to step into the electricity market For more than three weeks the state Department of Water Resources has spent an average of million a day purchasing power as negotiators work to nail down longterm power contracts under a billion program authorized by the Legislature Davis maintains that in recent weeks the state has made major progress toward solving the electricity crisis Officials have signed four very good contracts with electricity providers begun an million conservation program and embarked upon an aggressive drive to get power plants built he said In other developments Tuesday the precarious financial condition of Edison and PGE remained a top concern of utilitywatchers as a grace period granted by banks that are owed money by Edison expired We are now on a daily involuntarybankruptcy filing watch said Steven Fleishman a utility analyst with Merrill Lynch Co We believe that creditors will wait to see what plan the governor proposes but time is short Edison formally asked a group of banks for an extension of a day period of forbearance on a million default Ted Craver Edison Internationals chief financial officer said in a conference call with debt holders The banks had not yet responded he said Several electricity generators have said they are willing to wait for the utility debtrelief plan that Davis and legislators have promised in the coming days the governors spokesman Steve Maviglio said Tuesday They have signaled to us that they have patience he said Most of the action in the Capitol on Tuesday centered on Burtons two bills both of which cleared the Senate Energy Committee and will go next to the Appropriations Committee A third measure SB X by Sen Byron Sher DStanford which would provide billion in taxpayer subsidies to consumers government entities and businesses to help pay for conservation measures also passed Burton said his bill paving the way for the purchase of the transmission grid SB X is based on the concept of willing buyer willing seller and would not lead to any unilateral seizure of utility assets Although it attracted support from consumer groups skeptics say that the system is overburdened and needs an estimated billion in repairs and expansionand that it costs several million dollars annually to maintain As lawmakers debated the bill a private company quietly pressed its own bid to buy the system TransElect Inc has offered to pay billion for the grid Company Vice President Bob Mitchell was in the Capitol to pitch the idea to lawmakers most of whom are indifferent to the notion Were not convinced that a single forprofit monopoly owner of the grid gains the people a lot said Assemblyman Bill Leonard RSan Bernardino But others said they were open to proposal We certainly prefer to keep the transmission grid in the private sector where it belongs said Jamie Fisfis spokesman for Republican Assembly leader Bill Campbell RVilla Park The other Burton bill approved Tuesday SB X seeks to create a California consumer power and conservation financing authority that would build finance and run power plants alone or in partnership with private generators The new agency would be financed by the sale of up to billion in bonds which would be repaid by revenues from power sales The bill also would empower the state to take over private plants by condemnation Several other states including New York operate public generation and transmission facilities Burton said adding that they provide electricity at favorable rates Burton insisted that the agency would supplement but not take over the electricity business that traditionally has been a privatesector enterprise in California He predicted that the state would involve itself mostly in peaking generatorsportable generators about the size of bigrig truckswhose energy would be tapped during periods of short supply but high demand such as hot summers and cold winters But GOP Sens Charles Poochigian of Fresno and William Morrow of Oceanside voiced fears that the public energy agency would be too dominant and could disadvantage private generators with its power of condemnation This bill is pretty much sending a large bright red flag Morrow told Burton Lobbyists for the power generators testifying before the committee agreed that a public power authority could scare off private investors reluctant to compete with the state That type of uncertainty about the states role in this system can have the role of discouraging private capital said Mike Day a lobbyist for Enron Corp In another development Tuesday state officials working to fire up new power plants to add megawatts of electricity by this summer raised the possibility that the new generators might not be adequate to meet demand Winston Hicox director of the California Environmental Protection Agency said the gap between supply and demand could be greater than megawatts this summer given that other Western states probably wont be sending as much electricity to California and that the states own production of hydroelectric power might be low Calling conservation steps incredibly important Hicox said the state needs to cut use by at least to avoid blackouts Meanwhile the California Republican Party said it will begin airing a second radio ad today blasting Davis a Democrat for his handling of the energy crisis Unlike the first ad which ran in smaller markets on conservative radio stations the new ad will run in Los Angeles and San Francisco on mainstream stations said a party spokesman On the federal level President Bush said Tuesday that he intends to discuss Californias power needs and other energy policy issues in his talks Friday with President Vicente Fox of Mexico They will talk about improving the power plants to be able to help additional power get into the Western grid Bush told reporters aboard Air Force One on a flight back to Washington after visiting the Norfolk Va Naval Base Bush said he also intends to discuss the flow of natural gas between the two countries specifically the issue of California natural gas flowing to Mexican power plants Its conceivable that that gas will be interrupted and it will create obviously a problem for our neighbors to the south Bush said But gas can flow both ways And any gas down in Mexico that improves the Mexican situation will help America Ingram and Warren reported from Sacramento and Landsberg from Los Angeles Times staff writers Miguel Bustillo Dan Morain Rone

Outcome KRTBN KnightRidder Tribune Business News The Orange County Register California Copyright C KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News Source World Reporter TM Gov Gray Davis and top lawmakers have enlisted a small circle of energy insiders to help craft electricity bills and policies that could indirectly affect their financial interests Key parts of the billion financial plan that launched the state into the power buying business were written by investment bankers for Credit Suisse First Boston which also works for a Texas power generator Other advisers include a former Southern California Edison executive who owned stock in three independent power companies while advising the governor A third is a New York banker whose company prepared the sale of billion in securities last week for two power generators who sell electricity in California These power companies earned record profits last year selling electricity into Californias troubled market State utilities were pushed to the brink of insolvency by power prices because their billing rates were still frozen by rules that deregulated the market Now some lawmakers consumer advocates and legal scholars worry that the businessmen who have come to Sacramento to help sort out the mess are too closely tied to these same power companies and wont be able to place the interests of the state and its small electricity users first Theyve let the fox into the hen house said Peter Navarro a University of California Irvine business professor and author of The Dimming of America which predicted a national deregulation fallout The deregulation bill was drafted in large part by utility lobbyists If weve learned anything from this it should be that people with a vested interest shouldnt draft legislation No one denies that industry insiders are playing a critical role inside the Statehouse But Davis administration officials and Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg say they needed industry experts to help solve the states energy crisis I said give me the best possible experts in the investment banking world Hertzberg said Everyone who is an expert has conflicts all over the place The outcome of these energy initiatives could prove beneficial to some of the states advisers or their companies Southern California Edison vice president Larry Hamlin joined the Davis team last Thursday as the project manager for the governors new plan to speed construction of power plants statewide Hamlin has taken a twomonth leave from Edison where he was vice president of power production and operations A faster construction cycle could directly benefit the utilitys operations and generating divisions Former Treasury Secretary Robert E Rubin chairman of the executive committee at Citigroup Inc was appointed in January to advise Davis on bond financing longterm power contracts and ownership of power plants SEC filings show that Citigroups Salomon Smith Barney subsidiary works as an investment banker for several private power companies that sell electricity in California Salomon prepared for sale last week billion in securities offered by Calpine Corp and million in securities by AES Corp In addition Citigroup owned or managed billion in independent power company stocks as of September A Citigroup spokeswoman said neither Rubin nor the company would have any comment on his role Michael R Peevey a former president of Southern California Edison Co began advising the governor last June Peevey left Edison in and formed New Energy Ventures Inc a nonutility energy service provider which he sold to AES Corp in for million He now sits on the board of Excelergy a Lexington Mass provider of technology to energy companies A sworn disclosure signed by his wife Assemblywoman Carol Liu DLa Canada Flintridge shows that the couple owned between and of stock in AES Enron and Unisource all independent power companies last year The UniSource stock was purchased one month after Peevey began his advisory role Liu said in an interview that Peevey has sold all his energy stocks since she made that disclosure Dec Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said he was unaware that Peevey had continued to hold power company stocks after the appointment Neither Peevey Hamlin nor Rubin responded to requests for an interview but Maviglio said the governor has chosen the best people and is reviewing suggestions to make sure the best interests of Californians are being protected It seems natural to tap people who are the best at this and can get the job done for California said Maviglio They know that they need to separate their past and their future when it comes to helping the state Many experts applaud these choices If youre in a bind and California clearly is who better to enlist than the insiders Is it a potential conflict Yes Is it a big one Not likely said UCLA Finance Professor William M Cockrum a specialist in business ethics and a former investment banker himself Cockrum said such relationships are routine on Wall Street and investment bankers are trained to handle them What you want is a bunch of smart people who are used to dealing with economic realities Cockrum said Not everyone agrees It is a different matter when public dollars are at stake and matters of public policy of this order of magnitude are being decided said Harvard Law professor Elizabeth Warren The Legislature needs to be clear when they are getting independent advice and when they are getting lobbied Just because this is how business is always done doesnt mean its right Lawmakers have raised similar concerns saying there hasnt been enough disclosure of potential conflicts Im uncomfortable with someone who represents a stakeholder like power generators providing independent advice on which direction we should go said Sen Joe Dunn DSanta Ana These are folks out of the financial markets whose businesses may very well have a lot at stake in terms of the outcome of this crisis I dont think we can consider that to be independent advice Dunn was talking specifically about the role of Credit Suisse First Boston which worked to restructure El Paso Electric Co which went bankrupt in Today the investment firm is preparing a public stock offering for a new subsidiary of Reliant Energy of Houston called Reliant Energy Resources Securities and Exchange Commission documents show As of September the company also held or managed million worth of stock in AES Corp which owns power plants in Orange County Investment bankers usually earn between percent and percent of the amount underwritten the exact amount is not disclosed Credit Suisse First Boston declined comment other than to say Hertzberg asked its investment bankers to help and they are working for free Some of Davis appointments have been applauded For instance he tapped Los Angeles Department of Water and Power head David Freeman to lead the states negotiations for longterm contracts with power suppliers Freeman has been praised for his role at the DWP because he fought against those who wanted to sell the public utilitys own generators There is no one I would rather have negotiating for the state of California said Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg DLos Angeles He has never worked for anything other than the public This man lives and breaths and thinks about what is in the best interest of ratepayers Others sought by the governor decided on their own they had too many conflicts In January consultants from investment banker Goldman Sachs met with Davis Finance Director Tim Gage to discuss advising the governor Goldman Sachs owns J Aron a Singaporebased energy trader that supplies percent of Pacific Gas and Electrics natural gas needs According to SEC records Goldman also held or managed more than billion in power company stocks as of September of and is listed as another lead underwriter with Credit Suisse on the Reliant public offering Consumer advocates immediately began criticizing Goldman for its conflicts Goldman decided shortly thereafter that its competing business interests posed a conflict Critics worried about the role of the investment bankers said their concerns mounted when they learned that Credit Suisse was doing more than offering advice Hertzberg asked the company to craft a financing plan for the states power purchases ABX the landmark bill which put California into the longterm energy buying business included a revenue bond financing plan written by Credit Suisse Another part of Credit Suisse plan which would use the bonds to pay off utilities past debts has stalled in committee and may die there Some lawmakers say the experts have helped protect Californians For example ABX has a provision that came from a panel of bankruptcy attorneys who are advising the governor and the legislature The state was going to buy energy and then sell it to the utilities but this would have made the state an automatic party in any bankruptcy lawsuit As a result of advice from experts the state is making sure the energy gets delivered to customers but the ownership of the electricity never shifts to the utilities We learned that if we are going to go out and buy power there are very specific things we must do to protect ourselves Hertzberg said For example that if there was a bankruptcy we would have been is an unsecured creditor Their advice has been very valuable And Hertzberg said when it comes to advisors with serious conflicts the Legislature is smart enough to take the advice of experts and recognize any bias But Dunn the Santa Ana senator thinks the issue is too complex With all due respect thats nonsense Dunn said No one in this building can rise to the sophistication of the players in this market Their entire professional life is dedicated to make sure they understand how this works in all its subtletiesIn fact the advisers may believe they can step aside and provide independent unbiased advise but I dont think they can If you have lived your life in this arena you have a certain point of view By Chris Knap Kimberly Kindy and Mark Katches Register staff writer Kate Berry contributed to this report NewPower posts

Germanys cartel office and economics ministry have shown an encouraging commitment to clamping down on energy network owners who blocked access for newcomers US energy giant Enron said on Wednesday The cartel office last week charged Edis Nord over excessive grid access tariffs said Paul Hennemeyer who specialises in government and regulatory affairs at Enrons office in Frankfurt This will begin to send a signal to the market that these sorts of games have to stop and of course theres increasing pressure coming out of the ministry he told Reuters during the Eworld of energy conference and exhibition Edis a subsidiary of major utility EON has until March to respond to charges its fees are more than percent above the national market average Hennemeyer said the cartel office was doing a good job given it was badly resourced and with its role reduced to rule whether certain tariffs were anticompetitive on a case by case basis The office cannot actually set tariff levels Hennemeyer said a state regulator would be better placed to ensure competition but the preferred reliance on voluntary agreements had created reasonable conditions for wholesale power markets since their liberalisation in April If the German associations can extend these agreements to the retail market they might be able to avoid regulation he said The situation was different in gas which was deregulated in October but where market participants were dragging their feet over access terms forcing the government to start working on its own network access decree Ive made my bets that regulation in gas will come hopefully in the right way Hennemeyer said The networks are natural monopolies and the regulator should make sure the system is properly run the commodity part is different and there should be competition it should be up to supply and demand Either by design or by default I see these things mixed up a lot when they are really two separate topics GERMANY German gas market regulation inevitableAquila By Vera Eckert Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited ESSEN Germany Feb Reuters A leading German energy trader said on Tuesday failure of German gas distributors and consumers to work out terms for market deregulation means political intervention is inevitable Its not a question of if but when the economics ministry will impose measures to force the market open Joerg Spicker managing director of Aquila Energy GmbH told Reuters during the Eworld of energy conference and exhibition The experiment with negotiated instead of regulated market access in Germany has failed I think the customers are beginning to realise that they would fare better with a regulated system Negotiations among the four associations for a new network agreement to come into force by the end of September VV are still nonconclusive ahead of a top level meeting of the associations presidents on February The two sides which maintain that Germanys fragmented market nature and consensual political tradition makes voluntary negotiations the best option failed to agree on access terms to networks and storage and the priorities at times of bottlenecks These would be the minimum requirements to start free competition To date only a few shortterm delivery contracts for industrial clients have been secured by independent international traders such as Aquila Enron and local firm Trianel but these often have to be enforced by court orders or interference by the cartel authorities Thats maybe the beginnings of a market but you would not call it true competition Spicker said Aquila which had won new business in southern Germany in the first few weeks of this year was finding negotiations over pointtopoint access with sometimes up to four pipeline owners challenging given they had to be done within a short time period QUIBBLING OVER PIPELINE VALUES Spicker who attended closeddoor meetings last week through Aquilas membership of the European Federation of Energy Traders EFET said it was highly doubtful that a solution could be found on February that would pass governmental and EU scrutiny One of the most controversial points was that pipeline operators wanted to base charges on renewal costs of their facilities when many installations had long been written off Spicker said We refuse to help pay for pipelines that have already enabled the incumbents to reap profits for many decades he said The economics ministry in his view was already drawing up terms for cost structures and for the obligation to publish rates and capacity

a memorandum of understanding to build a megawatt power plant in southern Nigeria a spokesman said Wednesday The multimillion dollar agreement was signed Tuesday by Nigerias Power and Steel Minister Olusegun Agagu for the government and Antonio Viera the managing director of Nigerian Agip Oil Company company spokesman Tajudeen Adigun said Viera told reporters at the ceremony he expected the two sides to finalise an agreement on the purchase by the national power company NEPA of the power produced by the plant within two weeks The gasfired plant to be built in Kwale in Delta State and expected to cost around million dollars to build would be expected to come on stream by December Viera said The power minister Agagu told reporters he was delighted that the two sides had reached this stage and said he was confident a final deal would be signed soon It will not take long before a power purchase agreement that is acceptable to all parties could come to be because most of what could constitute stumbling blocks have actually been addressed he said He praised ENIs subsidiary for moving ahead with the project where other companies including US group Enron AngloDutch oil company Royal DutchShell and US group ExxonMobil were still in talks on proposals Finally we are on our way to actualising the first major independent power production through AGIP he said Agagu said the government was very concerned to build up power generation and improve transmission and distribution The federal government has put a lot of emphasis on the power sector being the driving force behind the economy he said Nigerias staterun power company NEPA has underperformed for many years and is incapable of providing constant power throughout the country President Olusegun Obasanjo has pledged

delivery to Dubai and Oman Last year Offsets sold of the project to TotalFinaElf SA TOT and Enron ENE which have been commissioned to implement the initial phase of the project estimated at a cost of about billion McClelland said Enron is responsible for midstream and marketing while Totalfina will be in charge of upstream operations The kilometer pipeline from the Qatari capital Doha to Abu Dhabi is estimated to cost about billion million million of which will be on the subsea pipeline he added McClelland said currently its economically feasible to pipe billion cubic feet a day of gas through the pipeline but the long term plan is to send bcf a day from Qatar to the UAE and Oman He added that Enron will retain equity in pipeline US Exxon Mobil Corp XOM which has a concession in the North Field might get involved in supplying the additional amounts of gas in the future he added Qatars Oil Minister Abdullah bin Hamad AlAttiyah said earlier this week that a final agreement between Qatar and the UAE would be signed within weeks and that previous disagreements on the transfer price of the gas between the two sides had now been resolved McClelland said Wednesday that marketing the gas in the region wouldnt be a problem Also in the long term plans are possibilities to take the gas further east to India and Pakistan Enron is already involved in a project which supplies gas from Abu Dhabi and Oman to an Indian power plant First gas from Dolphin is targetted to reach Abu Dhabi by late or early About billion to billion cubic feet per day of Qatari gas would be consumed by utilities in Abu Dhabi and the remainder would be supplied to Dubai Enrons McClelland said the Dolphin project and a natural gas venture in Saudi Arabia are two priority projects for the company in the Middle East Enron is involved jointly with Canadas Occidental in making investment proposals for Saudi Arabias natural gas sector a process which kicked off last year He said Enron is looking into several

released Blockbuster chairman John Antioco said the vidtailer had reached a verbal agreement with Vivendi U late Monday covering homevideo payperview and videoondemand rights to Universal films The vidtailer has been seeking those additional rights for several months as it struggles to expand beyond its video rental base Company recently launched a videoondemand system in conjunction with Enron

equityrights issue to which it will waive its right to subscribe in favour of financial institutions FIs According to a Cabinet Committee on Disinvestment CCD decision once this is done the FIs may do what they will with their new share sell it to the other halfowner Japans Suzuki Motors sell it in the market or keep it All this is contingent on the prior written consent of Suzuki a agreement between the two partners compels each to take the others prior permission before doing anything about equity ownership We aim to do everything only in full agreement with Suzuki said Disinvestment Minister Arun Shourie he stressed the point more than once Suzuki will the plan presumes fully exercise its proportionate right to the new equity issue If they Suzuki agree we expect the entire process to be completed by September Shourie said The invitation to Suzuki to start negotiating details will be issued in a couple of days All the details the quantum of the rights issue the valuation and everything else will be settled through negotiation between Suzuki and the government The CCD decided that the valuation if Suzuki agrees should be done by three bankers of international repute one to be decided by it one by Suzuki and the third by mutual consent The entire basis for valuation indeed the entire process at each stage will be made completely transparent Shourie said This decision was one of the five options before the CCD the outcome of a series of discussions between a panel of Union government secretaries and Suzuki In addition on Monday the secretaries had another detailed discussion with financial institutions on what would be needed if the rights issue was cleared Suzukis main concern in the talks already held was to ensure we dont disinvest our share in favour of one of their competitors Shourie said adding it was a legitimate wish The CCD he said had decided on doing it this way to ensure two things One to ensure Maruti retains its competitive strength Two to ensure maximum valuation of the governments present equity in it The CCD decision aims at ensuring both he said In another development the Union Cabinet discussed the power situation

discussions Power reforms and regulations Kirit Parikh Business Standard Copyright c Business Standard Power shortages scheduled power cuts and unscheduled brownouts have plagued the country for many years The process of privatisation and reforms was begun in to solve these problems Yet eight years later the situation is if anything worse than before Why is it What have we done Why has not it worked What should we do It is obvious that power shortages imply lack of capacity to generate power In turn this reflects inadequate investment in building power plants transmission and distribution network or fuel production and transport capacity It could also reflect poor operation of existing capacities In mideighties when Rajiv Gandhi became the Prime Minister he concentrated on the latter and emphasised improving load factor of thermal plants This worked for some time but the slack was more or less exhausted by early nineties Today the average load factor on thermal plants has reached per cent which is very good Since then despite some progress in further raising load factor lack of adequate investment has been the main reason for power shortages Over the last decade installed generating capacity has grown by per cent whereas power generation has grown by per cent Inadequate investment was mainly the result of the inability of state electricity boards SEBs to generate financial surpluses The main reasons for the financial sickness of SEBs are poor pricing of electricity and pilferage Most SEBs subsidise highly agricultural consumers and some also domestic consumers All have high losses due to pilferage of power disguised as transmission and distributions TD losses and also as agricultural consumption This is the fundamental reason for power shortages Unfortunately instead of tackling this main problem successive governments have tried to skirt around it Their efforts at reforms have more or less failed What have they done and why have they failed The first attempt was to attract private investors to set up generating plants The power sector was opened up for private both domestic and foreign power generators in Despite massive interest of private investors the progress has been miniscule The private generators were required to sell only to the SEBs When ones only customer is financially sick one would think twice before getting into the business The difficulties Maharashtra SEB is facing in meeting Enrons bills would make private producers think even more before they invest In fact unless the financial sickness of the SEBs is taken care of private power generators are even less likely to come now Once the reluctance of private generators was perceived the government thought of megaprojects There were and are to be large projects which would supply power relatively cheaply To reduce the price of power the government offered concessions such as no customs duty and longer tax holiday Thus the government provides the subsidy up front But here also the unreliability of SEBs as customers which may not honour bills is a problem To get around this a new public corporation called Power Trading Corporation PTC is envisaged This will buy all the power from a megaproject pay the bill how and in turn sell the power to different SEBs How would the PTC collect its dues from SEBs If it cannot presumably the central government will foot the bill The sick SEBs would have an even greater incentive to default on payment to a public corporation than to a private generator This is obvious as today the various SEBs together owe public sector corporations such as NTPC Coal India NHPC etc Rs crore Pricing and pilferage reforms are inescapable If we delay these reforms even good firms like NTPC would be dragged down by the sick SEBs The chief ministers agree in New Delhi to raise tariff for agricultural consumers but as soon as they return to state capitals they develop cold feet Only a handful of chief ministers have made some progress here To force state governments to raise the price of power the idea of state electricity regulatory commission SERC was thought of SERCs are to be independent statutory bodies and are to prescribe power tariffs If a state government wants so subsidise any particular set of consumers it has to give direct budgetary support to the SEB This roundabout way has not yet produced substantial result and progress is understandably slow as the SERCs are appointed by state governments Only three state SERCs had issued tariff orders by the end of June To deal with pilferage ie theft of power should be easy Unfortunately it is not as some of the large staff of SEBs collude in this theft Thus it was felt that if distribution is privatised the problem of pilferage can be solved Naturally the SEB unions oppose such moves The progress has been miniscule Only Orissa has fully privatised distribution Some states have privatised small parts of their system The few cases where distribution is privatised customers have not been happy as they are asked to pay higher price They pay it but do not see any improvement in the reliability of quality of supply If reforms are done properly consumers who are not subsidised at present should benefit from them Reforms should improve the efficiency of the system reduce costs and hence price for such consumers How should we carry out reforms which have such effects Privatisation of distribution is the necessary first step However it should be done in a way that does not turn the consumers away from reforms For this we should set up a process which ensures that consumers are not required to pay any more for the inefficiency of the system This requires the following First of all we should work out the minimum cost at which an efficiently working power system without pilferage would supply power to different consumers Consumers should be informed about it and made to accept that they have to pay such a price Next SERCs should not permit anyone to charge a price higher than the optimal price or the present price whichever is higher If the present price is higher it should be brought down to optimal level in a time bound schedule over two or three years The private distribution company should be given a plan of eliminating pilferage over a period of two years as per an agreed schedule The state should compensate the private distributor for pilfered power only as per the agreed schedule If the private firm eliminates pilferage at a faster pace it would make extra profit If it delays it loses money That is its incentive Such a scheme makes privatisation of distribution acceptable to consumers who should see better cheaper power with higher efficiency So deal with the main problem first DPC not to invoke central guarantee Our Corporate Bureau Mumbai Business Standard Copyright c Business Standard The Enron promoted Dabhol Power Company DPC has decided not to invoke the Central government counterguarantee for now although the Maharashtra government failed to pay the Rs crore bill for December on Tuesday DPC had invoked the state government guarantee last week when the Maharashtra State Electricity Board failed to pay the bill The last date for paying the bill as per the terms of the state government guarantee was Tuesday This is not a double default situation They have already paid the November bill and only the December bill is pending Consequently we have decided not to invoke the counterguarantee for the moment said Neil McGregor CEO and president of DPC When queried further he clarified that this did not mean that the counterguarantee would not be invoked at all The next key date is February when the January bill becomes due he added It is also learnt that DPC does not want to embarrass the state government at a time when negotiations are due to be held with the Godbole panel The Maharashtra government last week announced the formation of a panel under former Union home secretary Madhav Godbole to review the controversial power project Meanwhile DPC has said in a press statement that it has received the outstanding amount of Rs crore towards the November bill The receipt of this payment as well as the formation of the review committee are very positive signals Enron saga Powered by govt generosity Rajesh Ramachandran The Times of India Copyright C The Times of India Source World Reporter TM NEW DELHI The tariff structure of Enrons Dabhol power project was conceived in such a manner that it was inevitable that the company would invoke its counterguarantee against the Maharashtra and Union governments The Shiv SenaBJP combine came to power in Maharashtra in on the slogan of throwing Enron into the Arabian Sea Soon after it cancelled the project Later it renegotiated the deal with Enron and even gave an assurance for the second phase Meanwhile the day Vajpayee government approved the extension of the government of Indias counterguarantee on May The first counterguarantee given on September was for PhaseI of the Dabhol project with a capacity of mw After the SSBJP government cancelled the project the then finance secretary Montek Singh Ahluwalia told the parliamentary subcommittee on fasttrack projects that as of today if the power purchase agreement PPA is being revised that means the counterguarantee is not effective When Ahluwalia said this in the project was being cancelled only to be renegotiated again after Enrons Rebecca Mark visited Bal Thackeray But Ahluwalia had held that if the PPA is revised the earlier counterguarantee would not hold good Yet the Union power minister told Parliament in May that the counter guarantee held good Thus a member of the standing committee gave a breach of privilege notice against Ahluwalia for misleading the House The finance ministry on behalf of Ahluwalia replied to Parliament thus While the government of Maharashtra had announced its decision for cancellation of the Dabhol power project the PPA between MSEB and the company was not terminated That is despite the project being cancelled the agreement to purchase power from the cancelled project is valid and hence the counterguarantee stands It was then pointed out by the member who had moved the breach of privilege notice that the contract was repudiated by the Maharashtra government After renegotiation the project itself was revised There was a change in the capacity of the project the fuel to be used the capital cost tariff and change in scope after inclusion of phase II of the project which was not included earlier In reply Ahluwalia submitted that the counterguarantee had provided for amendments to be made to the PPA subject to prior written approval by the Central government Thus if Jaswant Singh as finance minister had not approved the extension of the earlier counterguarantee it would not have been valid insofar as the amendments to the PPA were concerned So the onus of the counterguarantee rests with the day BJP government which did not wait for a review before it approved the extension of the earlier counterguarantee All this was done within days when the government had not even won a vote of confidence in Parliament Again it was not a fresh counterguarantee but the extension of the earlier one despite the Maharashtra governments repudiation its renegotiation with Enron and the changed physical parameters of the project It is interesting to note what Jaswant Singh as chairman of the committee had said about the counterguarantee a year before his government gave the approval for extension Counterguaranteeing for any project is uncalled for since several independent power producers are ready to implement projects without any counterguarantee Also there appears to be no justification for giving counterguarantee only to selective fasttrack projects Tomorrow The way forward Centre signs power sector reforms MoU with Haryana Our Regional Bureau New Delhi Business Standard Copyright c Business Standard The Centre today signed a Memorandum of Understanding on power reforms with Haryana which involves hundred per cent metering of all consumers by the end of this year while a special Cabinet meeting discussed the power situation and the possible reforms in the sector In his presentation to the Cabinet power minister Suresh Prabhu said the demand for power would touch mw by the end of the th Plan It could be met only with an equal investment each by the public and the private sector he remarked The meeting was held in the backdrop of the messy Enron affair Prabhus paper on the power scenario gives an insight into power supply augmenting mechanisms The MoU was signed by the Haryana chief secretary L M Goyal and Union secretary power A K Basu in the presence of the Prime Minister A B Vajpayee Prabhu and the Haryana Chief Minister O P Chautala It is based on the state achieving specific reforms milestones including compulsory metering of electricity supply and reducing transmission losses from per cent to per cent by The state will also undertake energy audit to reduce system losses The milestones achieved Prabhu said would entitle the states to modernisation funds from the accelerated power development programme and another programme soon to be announced to improve transmission systems The Center will also take up the mw Faridabad gasbased power station for early completion Though MoU did not mean network privatisation Chautala said he was willing to raise power tariffs even for farmers India Enron review panel to begin sittings today Our Special Correspondent The Hindu Copyright C Kasturi Sons Ltd KSL Source World Reporter TM Asia Intelligence Wire MUMBAI FEB Following the payment of the November bill to Enrons Dabhol Power Company by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board yesterday a review panel headed by Mr Madhav Godbole former State official who was later a Union Home Secretary has been set up to look at all aspects of the high tariff imbroglio The panel will start its sittings from tomorrow It is expected to submit its findings within a month as stipulated by the Government The Dabhol Power Company DPC while confirming the receipt of the November dues has said it would like to enter into a dialogue with the committee after having earlier shown its willingness to consider a third party buyer for its power which the MSEB did pick up A solution to the issue the Government here expects is one in which the Centre or its undertakings in the energy sector would pick up the power entirely from the DPC This was stated by the Chief Minister Mr Vilasrao Deshmukh in a recent letter to the Prime Minister Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee The State Government is aware that the Centre is averse to such counterguarantees being uncashed as it would send adverse signals on the capacity of the country to absorb foreign direct investments The MSEB cashstarved as ever made the November payment on the basis of an improved momentary liquidity enabled by the Government which paid about the same quantum of money as was needed but under the guise of provisioning for what was set out in the annual plan and under a budgetary provision A senior official conceded that both the sum and the timing of its routing to the MSEB was a coincidence Macerich Announces YearEnd Results PR

sources in Washington President Bush will appoint Mr Farish an old and close friend of his father to be his man at the Court of St James Mr Farish was coy yesterday about the appointment which has not yet been confirmed by the White House and is subject to Senate approval Speaking from his home near Lexington yesterday Mr Farish said Ive had a meeting with the President some time ago and he asked if I would serve in the administration in some capacity He confirmed that he had been offered a specific job but told the Lexington HeraldLeader At this point it would be impossible to say any more Mr Farish known as Will seems to have beaten off several other contenders for Americas plum diplomatic job Others who have been mentioned include Bob Dole the former Senate leader and Republican

Enron business model almost limitlessSkilling By C Bryson Hull Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited HOUSTON Feb Reuters The ink on newlyminted Enron Corp chief Jeff Skillings business cards was hardly dry on Tuesday before he outlined his intention to transform Enron into an even bigger global marketmaker The new vision is going to be From the worlds leading energy company to the worlds leading company because we believe markets are critical to every commodity Skilling told Reuters in his first interview since assuming duties as president and chief executive officer Skilling and Chairman Ken Lay over the past years transformed Enron from a gas and power company into a trading powerhouse with interests outside the energy sector on their belief that many products can be sold like commodities That business model Skilling said helped Enron outgrow its old vision of becoming the worlds leading energy company The application is almost limitless because every single business has at its heart markets he said So if weve got a better market model we can participate in a whole lot of different businesses And so Enron has as its forays into the marketing of broadband capacity data storage steel and pulp and paper have shown Skilling said Enrons success in the gas and power businesses is proof his company has the wherewithal to take on the biggest companies in wellentrenched industries Enron is an incumbent players worst nightmare Skilling Do you think Amoco liked that we were out talking to their customers about buying gas from us that we were packaging from other people No He expects similar reactions from the giants in the paper and steel industries STEADY AS SHE GOES Skilling promises things will be steady as she goes during his stewardship which began Tuesday two months after Lay named his heir apparent CEO and decided to stay on as chairman But steady only means Enrons constant flow of innovation will continue Skilling said Enron has quickly become able to remove the complex and costly infrastructure around many commodities because of EnronOnline its Internet trading site which has logged more than million in notional trades since starting months ago The real advantage of EnronOnline and a whole webbased system is that we can create additional scale and options without buying another piece of pipe another generating facility because we have liquidity Skilling said We can create deeper more reliable predictable markets than someone that doesnt have that capability he said WHITHER THE PHYSICAL STOCK EXCHANGE Skilling sees EnronOnline and other competing electronic commodity exchanges like smaller rival Dynegy Incs Dynegy Direct as challengers to the hegemony of traditional American markets where traders still physically work on the floor In every commodity whether its interest rates equities securities there is a battle between exchanges Skilling said The American futures exchanges are battling for market share with these new electronic approaches Electronic exchanges have the advantage of lower personnel costs and flexibility and Skilling said the succes of allelectronic trading in European markets is a harbinger of the USs trading future I think its really going to be a function of who can create the most liquidity at the lowest price and thats going to be the market system that will win Skilling

All Rights Reserved SACRAMENTO AP Californias energy crisis could cause higher dormitory bills fewer night and weekend classes and sweltering summer classrooms at the states public colleges lawmakers learned Tuesday Officials from the states three college and university systems urged the Legislature to provide them with extra money in the state budget to keep their higher energy prices particularly for natural gas from hurting education Its impacting students its impacting learning its impacting budgets and its impacting planning said Ray Giles of the Community College League The University of California paid million for natural gas last year and is expecting to pay at least million this year said Mike Bocchicchio UC assistant vice president for facilities UC has not decided whether to raise dormitory rates to reflect the higher cost of heating and cooling dorm rooms he said The UC dormitory system is designed to be selfsupporting he added I dont think its fair to say were just going to pass the costs along to the dorm residents said Assemblywoman Elaine Alquist DSanta Clara chair of the committee California State Universitys natural gas prices are expected to jump from million last year to million this year said Assistant Vice Chancellor Patrick Drohan Fred Harris of the community colleges chancellors office chancellors office estimated community colleges costs for electricity and natural gas will increase from million last year to million this year Giles said the effect on community college campuses has included a decreased number of evening and weekend classes and closing of libraries and other resources Assemblywoman Gloria Negrete McLeod DChino wondered how colleges located in the sweltering desert or Central Valley areas could afford air conditioning for spring summer and fall classes without additional state support They cant change nature she said The Assembly Higher Education Committee held a hearing Tuesday to learn how the energy crisis is affecting higher education The committee took no action Lawmakers are continuing to debate how the state should respond to the crisis and the budget wont be written until next June Most of Californias public colleges and universities currently have relatively low electricity rates because of longterm contracts signed with Enron Energy Services The nine University of California campuses get percent of their electricity from Enron through a contract tied to rates and lasting until UC gets the rest of its power from federal or municipal power agencies or from cogeneration plants at six campus locations said Bocchicchio California State University also has an Enron contract for its campuses said Drohan The Community College League a nonprofit corporation that represents community college districts enrolled districts with colleges in a similar Enron contract that lasts through said Giles Statewide there are locally run community college districts with campuses Some colleges and universities have been hit by higher electricity bills or power outages because they signed up years ago for the utilities interruptible programs which gave them lower rates in exchange for cutting power usage during serious shortages There have been at least such shortages since Jan Four CSU campuses and community college districts were part of those programs In some cases they chose not to cut back on power use and face fines instead officials said The interruptible programs were suspended last month by the state Public Utilities Commission On the Net UC is at CSU is at The community

sixth paragraph For more on the California electricity crisis see EXTRA GO Rosemead California Feb Bloomberg Southern California Edison Cos banks are considering a request to delay taking action against the utility for defaulting on lines of credit an executive of its parent company said We have asked the banks to extend the forbearance agreements that we have with them Ted Craver Edison Internationals chief financial officer said in a conference call with investors The banks led by JP Morgan Chase Co previously provided forbearance through today Craver said the utility and its parent dont have any indication from them yet on whether the banks will grant more time The group of banks have the right to demand accelerated payments or seek other remedies after Southern California Edison Californias secondlargest utility failed to make million of payments on maturing notes last month That produced a cross default on its lines of credit with the banks My view of the relationship with the banks is that its strong and that they are generally looking for ways to be cooperative Craver said He added he couldnt predict how they will respond Suffice it to say the utility and its parent asked for a period of forbearance similar to the past one Craver said which lasted almost a month Both the utility and PGE Corps Pacific Gas Electric also defaulted last month on commercial paper a type of moneymarket security Patience Wearing Thin The utilities ran up about billion in debt last year buying power at higher wholesale prices than they could charge customers under state laws The state is buying power on the utilities behalf and looking at other ways to deal with the past debt to keep them from going bankrupt Investors on the call asked about the timetable for proposals to address the utilities past debts Were not betting the farm on getting something by this Friday Craver said The utility had about billion in cash at the end of last week according to Craver Investors on the conference call asked Craver about a comment by a spokesman for California Governor Gray Davis who said today that power generators will be patient while they await a debt repayment plan I guess I would have to agree that the generators and creditors have been very patient Craver said Still everybodys patience gets thinner as we move forward each week No one has petitioned the utility to push it into involuntary bankruptcy Craver said and he called for continuing patience while acknowledging the pace is frustrating for everybody affected by the utilitys payment suspension Financing Unlikely Were trying to encourage people to stand still and give us time to work this thing out Craver said It is certainly not our hope nor our intent to go into bankruptcy which would only complicate attempts to arrive at solutions he added In response to a question about when the utility might be able to get financing again Edison officials on the call said issues surrounding the implementation of legislation still need addressing I dont think financing is likely to be available while there is so much uncertainty Craver said Uncertainty has arisen for example over whether the state Department of Water Resources will be paying for all the power purchases for the utilities or whether some spot purchases still might be passed along to the utilities in future bills Duke Energy Corp sued over this issue yesterday claiming the California Independent System Operator which runs about percent of the states utility grid continues to deliver electricity to the utilities without an assurance suppliers will get paid TaxExempts Paid Generators have been willing to sell power on the assumption the states credit was on the hook for those purchases Stephen Pickett general counsel of Southern California Edison said during the teleconference Edison is seeking clarification on the matter with the California Public Utilities Commission because it also believes the legislative intent was to have the state covering all the purchases Investors also asked several questions about a decision by the utility to make recent payments on taxexempt pollution control bonds The payments were relatively small and missing them would have immediately caused a broader default on all the utilitys first mortgage bonds said Ken Stewart an assistant general counsel for the utility That would raise the risk of having about billion of first mortgage bonds subject to acceleration Stewart said By contrast defaults on certain other utility debt includes various grace periods and doesnt trigger a default on other series of bonds he added Dennis Walters in Ojai California at or and Mark Lake in New York through the New York newsroom jm BN Feb GMT Acegas listed on

News Tribune The News Tribune Tacoma WA South Sound A Copyright WASHINGTON Their names may not appear on your electric bill but they are the largest energy marketers in the nation and theyre cashing in on the skyrocketing electric rates in the Northwest As ratepayers throughout the West are socked with doubledigit increases in their bills regulators throughout the region are looking into suspicions that this new breed of energy companies has manipulated the overheated market to maximize profits So far there is no evidence they are doing anything illegal California Gov Gray Davis has called them pirates and plunderers The San Francisco city attorney has filed a billion lawsuit against them saying they are playing with marked cards and looking to make a quick buck at the expense of consumers The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is investigating as are state regulators in Washington Oregon and California Based on hints of manipulated energy supplies and allegations of price manipulation I think we owe it to Washington utilities and consumers to make sure the soaring prices are not the result of illegal practices Washington Attorney General Christine Gregoire said in announcing her offices antitrust division would investigate The power marketers though say theyve done nothing wrong The real problem they say is there simply isnt enough power being generated to meet demand The players include Enron Corp Dynegy Inc and Reliant Energy all of Houston Duke Energy of Charlotte NC Southern Energy of Atlanta AES Inc of Arlington Va and Calpine Corp of San Jose Calif Enrons profits were up percent in last years fourth quarter Dukes fourthquarter revenues doubled Dynegys earnings more than doubled in the fourth quarter When we hear about these stunning profit increases I think we need to investigate Gregoire said Corporate raider Charles Hurwitz also could profit handsomely His Maxxam Inc owns Kaiser Aluminum Corp which has shut down its Washington mills and under a special contract provision is reselling power on the open market for much more than it paid the Bonneville Power Administration the federal agency that sells hydropower generated at dams along the Columbia and Snake rivers Hurwitz could make half a billion dollars before the contracts expire this fall And the holding companies of two huge California utilities on the edge of bankruptcy have made billions of dollars off the West Coast electricity market through a financial juggling act Audits by outside auditors hired by state regulators showed Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric turned over billions to their holding companies money that could have been used to ease the cash crunch they now face The utilities say they were engaged in accepted business practices when they transferred the money which the parent companies used for such things as stockholder dividends and stock buybacks Is it capitalism or profiteering said Ed Mosey a BPA spokesman The very complexity of these markets allows these companies to hide in the grass A few years ago the energy industry was tightly regulated and utilities and generators were allowed to recover their costs and make a decent return on their investment But beginning with the deregulation of wholesale electricity markets in energy marketers generators independent power producers and others became major players Regulated utilities opened computerdriven trading rooms as they scrambled to find the cheapest electricity available Now electricity is sold on spot and longerterm markets traded for electricity available in other parts of the country or even swapped for natural gas Power can pass through three or four hands before you even buy it Tacoma Power Superintendent Steve Klein said The latest jolts in the Northwest market began last summer when California experienced severe shortages and prices soared Because the entire West Coast is connected by one power grid the rate shocks were felt in the Northwest and grew even more as Californias problems deepened and a winter drought prompted fears of a nearrecord low runoff in the Columbia and Snake rivers Some called it a perfect storm scenario and BPA saw the price it paid for power in January grow sixfold over the previous year We will buy from anyone who will sell to us at a reasonable prices but the problem is finding a reasonable price said BPA Administrator Steve Wright The marketers are recovering a substantial amount of money The same companies making money in California are making money in the Northwest These are forprofit companies said Mark Crisson who heads Tacoma Power These folks dont answer to a state regulatory commission and they dont answer to ratepayers They answer to their stockholders and Ive seen no effort by them to minimize prices Critics say the energy marketers have manipulated the market by shutting down generating facilities in California in an effort to restrict the supply and drive prices up According to some utility executives generating plants are usually offline percent of the time because of unforeseen problems and that an offline average of percent to percent would be considered high During some months certain California generating plants have been offline percent to percent of the time We are seeing abnormal rates Crisson said Asked whether he thought the companies were manipulating or gaming the market Crisson said I would stop short of accusing them of that but there is something funny going on The California generators and marketers say the outages have been the result of running aging plants hard in an effort to supply power in a tight market We think these allegations are a little unfair said Randy Wheeless a spokesman for Duke Energy which operates four power plants in California Despite several investigations Wheeless said his and other companies have always been cleared Were trying to feed the market not manipulate it he said There isnt any one single person or company to blame The remedy is to get more generation on line Enron doesnt own any power plants in California but sells and trades energy throughout the West Spokesman Mark Palmer agreed that the key to solving the current crisis is adding more generation and truly deregulating the California market so there is real competition Everyone is scrambling for power he said Staff

Financial Express Anupama Airy Kavita Bhaskaran New Delhi Feb The USbased energy major Marathon Oil and Gas Company has emerged as one of the strong contenders for picking up Enrons per cent stake in the Mukta Panna and Tapti oil and gas fields Top industry sources disclosed that Marathon has also been shortlisted in the first round of bidding along with Reliance and ONGC for buying Enrons stake in these fields Whereas both Reliance and ONGC are part of the consortia already developing these fields Marathon is the only company which has been shortlisted outside the consortia Currently Marathon is doing the due diligence of Enrons assets following which it will submit the financial bids along with other shortlisted parties the sources said Sources informed that Marathon possesses some of the best oil and gas exploration technologies in the world and at one point of time even ONGC was in talks with Marathon for acquiring its technology Asked if there was any possibility of ONGC and Marathon joining hands for submission of financial bids industry sources said both the companies have decided to bid independently Moreover for all these discovered fields ONGC does not require any financial or technical support from others Reliance however is not qualified to be the operator of oil and gas fields as it does not have sufficient experience in the area On the other hand Marathon possess strong technical skills in this area and if selected can easily qualify as an operatorONGC is the biggest partner in the consortium in terms of its equity stake It has per cent with the remaining per cent shared equally between Reliance Industries and Enron Oil and Gas India However Enron is the operator of this million joint venture between Reliance and ONGC Both ONGC and Reliance have the preemption rights by virtue of being partners in the joint ventures operating these companies But this does not mean that they will get it any cheaper They will have to match the highest bidder sources said It may be recalled here that Enron has recently decided to sell its entire oil and gas assets in India The buyer for these assets is to be selected through a twostage bidding process Credit Suisse First Boston has been appointed as the investment banker to derive current value of its stake in the joint venture These oil and gas fields in Gujarat and Mumbai offshore
