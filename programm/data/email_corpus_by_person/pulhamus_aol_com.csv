employee one of the cockpit crew We were about hours out of Frankfurt flying over the North Atlantic and I was in my crew rest seat taking my scheduled rest break All of a sudden the curtains parted violently and I was told to go to the cockpit right now to see the captain As soon as got there I noticed that the crew had one of those All Business looks on their faces The captain handed me a printed message I quickly read the message and realized the importance of it The message was from Atlanta addressed to our flight and simply said All airways over the Continental US are closed Land ASAP at the nearest airport advise your destination Now when a dispatcher tells you to land immediately without suggesting which airport one can assume that the dispatcher has reluctantly given up control of the flight to the captain We knew it was a serious situation and we needed to find terra firma quickly It was quickly decided that the nearest airport was miles away behind our right shoulder in Gander on the island of New Foundland A quick request was made to the Canadian traffic controller and a right turn directly to Gander was approved immediately We found out later why there was no hesitation by the Canadian controller approving our request We the inflight crew were told to get the airplane ready for an immediate landing While this was going on another message arrived from Atlanta telling us about some terrorist activity in the New York area We briefed the inflight crew about going to Gander and we went about our business closing down the airplane for a landing A few minutes later I went back to the cockpit to find out that some airplanes had been hijacked and were being flown into buildings all over the US We decided to make an announcement and LIE to the passengers for the time being We told them that an instrument problem had arisen on the airplane and that we needed to land at Gander to have it checked We promised to give more information after landing in Gander There were many unhappy passengers but that is par for the course We landed in Gander about minutes after the start of this episode There were already about other airplanes on the ground from all over the world After we parked on the ramp the captain made the following announcement Ladies and gentlemen you must be wondering if all these airplanes around us have the same instrument problem as we have But the reality is that we are here for a good reason Then he went on to explain the little bit we knew about the situation in the US There were loud gasps and stares of disbelief Local time at Gander was pm AM EST Gander control told us to stay put No one was allowed to get off the aircraft No one on the ground was allowed to come near the aircrafts Only a car from the airport police would come around once in a while look us over and go on to the next airplane In the next hour or so all the airways over the North Atlantic were vacated and Gander alone ended up with airplanes from all over the world out of which were flying US flags We were told that each and every plane was to be offloaded one at a time with the foreign carriers given the priority We were No in the US category We were further told that we would be given a tentative time to deplane at pm Meanwhile bits of news started to come in over the aircraft radio and for the first time we learned that airplanes were flown into the World Trade Center in New York and into the Pentagon in DC People were trying to use their cell phones but were unable to connect due to a different cell system in Canada Some did get through but were only able to get to the Canadian operator who would tell them that the lines to the US were either blocked or jammed and to try again Some time late in the evening the news filtered to us that the World Trade Center buildings had collapsed and that a fourth hijacking had resulted in a crash Now the passengers were totally bewildered and emotionally exhausted but stayed calm as we kept reminding them to look around to see that we were not the only ones in this predicament There were other planes with people on them in the same situation We also told them that the Canadian Government was in charge and we were at their mercy True to their word at PM Gander airport told us that our turn to deplane would come at AM the next morning That took the last wind out of the passengers and they simply resigned and accepted this news without much noise and really started to get into a mode of spending the night on the airplane Gander had promised us any and all medical attention if needed medicine water and lavatory servicing And they were true to their word Fortunately we had no medical situation during the night We did have a young lady who was weeks into her pregnancy We took REALLY good care of her The night passed without any further complications on our airplane despite the uncomfortable sleeping arrangements About on the morning of the th we were told to get ready to leave the aircraft A convoy of school buses showed up at the side of the airplane the stairway was hooked up and the passengers were taken to the terminal for processing We the crew were taken to the same terminal but were told to go to a different section where we were processed through Immigration and customs and then had to register with the Red Cross After that we were isolated from our passengers and were taken in a caravan of vans to a very small hotel in the town of Gander We had no idea where our passengers were going The town of Gander has a population of people Red Cross told us that they were going to process about passengers from all the airplanes that were forced into Gander We were told to just relax at the hotel and wait for a call to go back to the airport but not to expect that call for a while We found out the total scope of the terror back home only after getting to our hotel and turning on the TV hours after it all started Meanwhile we enjoyed ourselves going around town discovering things and enjoying the hospitality The people were so friendly and they just knew that we were the Plane people We all had a great time until we got that call days later on the th at AM We made it to the airport by AM and left for Atlanta at PM arriving in Atlanta at about PM Gander is hour and minutes ahead of EST yes hour and minutes But thats not what I wanted to tell you What passengers told us was so uplifting and incredible and the timing couldnt have been better We found out that Gander and the surrounding small communities within a Kilometer radius had closed all the high schools meeting halls lodges and any other large gathering places They converted all these facilities to a mass lodging area Some had cots set up some had mats with sleeping bags and pillows set up ALL the high school students HAD to volunteer taking care of the GUESTS Our passengers ended up in a town called Lewisporte about kilometers from Gander There they were put in a high school If any women wanted to be in a women only facility that was arranged Families were kept together All the elderly passengers were given no choice and were taken to private homes Remember that young pregnant lady she was put up in a private home right across the street from a hour Urgent Care type facility There were DDS on call and they had both male and female nurses available and stayed with the crowd for the duration Phone calls and emails to US and Europe were available for every one once a day During the days the passengers were given a choice of Excursion trips Some people went on boat cruises of the lakes and harbors Some went to see the local forests Local bakeries stayed open to make fresh bread for the guests Food was prepared by all the residents and brought to the school for those who elected to stay put Others were driven to the eatery of their choice and fed They were given tokens to go to the local Laundromat to wash their clothes since their luggage was still on the aircraft In other words every single need was met for those unfortunate travelers Passengers were crying while telling us these stories After all that they were delivered to the airport right on time and without a single one missing or late All because the local Red Cross had all the information about the goings on back at Gander and knew which group needed to leave for the airport at what time Absolutely incredible When passengers came on board it was like they had been on a cruise Everybody knew everybody else by their name They were swapping stories of their stay impressing each other with who had the better time It was mind boggling Our flight back to Atlanta looked like a party flight We simply stayed out of their way The passengers had totally bonded and they were calling each other by their first names exchanging phone numbers addresses and email addresses And then a strange thing happened One of our business class passengers approached me and asked if he could speak over the PA to his fellow passengers We never never allow that But something told me to get out of his way I said of course The gentleman picked up the PA and reminded everyone about what they had just gone through in the last few days He reminded them of the hospitality they had received at the hands of total strangers He further stated that he would like to do something in return for the good folks of the town of Lewisporte He said he was going to set up a Trust Fund under the name of DELTA our flight number The purpose of the trust fund is to provide a scholarship for high school students of Lewisporte to help them go to college He asked for donations of any amount from his fellow travelers When the paper with donations got back to us with the amounts names phone numbers and addresses it totaled to K or about K Canadian The gentleman who started all this turned out to be an MD from Virginia He promised to match the donations and to start the administrative work on the scholarship He also said that he would forward this proposal to Delta Corporate and ask them to donate as well Why all of this Just because some people in far away places were kind to some strangers who happened to literally drop in among them WHY NOT NazimAmin Bill Eleanore Graham Ivandale Independence OH

Air Force F fighter and a US Navy EP over the South China Sea has revealed a striking military weakness As the day standoff over the fate of of our military personnel detained by the communist Chinese unfolded the masters of the media went into high gear to explain to the American people what was going on The potentates of the press did an adequate job of reporting on the political dynamic in our nations capital on the diplomatic exchanges between Beijing and Washington and on the anxieties of loved ones waiting at home But when it came to reporting on the military aspects of the incident they failed miserably Strangely enough almost no one noticed in large part because the American media and the American people suffer from the same malady military illiteracy Some examples From the day of the collision onward nearly every US media outlet referred repeatedly to the damaged US aircraft a year old fourengine turboprop as a spyplane Its not A spy plane the U or SR for example is designed to overfly an adversarys territory The sturdy old EP however is designated as a reconnaissance and surveillance aircraft and it conducts its mission of collecting electronic emissions by flying in international airspace or over friendly territory The difference between surveillance aircraft and spy plane is not a simple matter of semantics it is an important distinction that affords the EP and its crew protections in international law Not unexpectedly the use of the term spy plane in the US media was immediately picked up by the international press and Communist Chinas propaganda machine A less egregious example of military illiteracy is evident in listening to what the media call those who serve in the Armed forces At various times during the days our military personnel were detained network newsreaders referred to them as soldiers or troops and occasionally as intelligence specialists The cable news hounds made similar errors last October when terrorists attacked the USS Cole in Yemen and the masters of the media repeatedly described the sailors killed and wounded aboard the vessel as soldiers It is tempting to ascribe these inaccuracies to media malevolence an undercurrent of antipathy toward the US military And members of the armed forces can perhaps be forgiven their paranoia when they are treated to investigative reports like CNNs Tailwind broadcast in which it was falsely alleged that US forces employed Sarin nerve gas against US defectors in Vietnam But in fact it appears that most of the factual errors in todays media coverage of our military stem less from malice than from ignorance And thats not just a media problem its becoming a national predicament How is it that so many know so little about military life today that they cannot distinguish between a soldier and a sailor The answer lies in part with the success of the all volunteer force now in its th year Once we abandoned selective service the draft military recruiters were forced to appeal to an increasingly narrow crosssection of young Americans to fill the ranks Gone is the challenge of patriotism and service that had motivated young men from all walks of life to join the military Douglas MacArthurs Duty honor County was replaced with a bald bounty system Sheer greed cold hard cash became the Pentagons answer to enlisting those with critical skills essential to todays increasingly complex and technologybased military In when my Naval Academy classmates and I first swore to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic it was the commander in chief who administered the oath Many have found fault with John Kennedy since that day but not in his appeal that we should ask not what our country can do for you but what you can do for your country That sentiment is heard no longer And the effect is seen not just in military recruiting shortfalls but throughout our society General James L Jones commandant of the Marine Corps recently noted that The average citizen even the average congressman neither knows nor cares about national security and that congressmen and senators no longer vie for seats on the House or Senate Armed Services Committees Hes right Fewer than one in new recruits even knows a military veteran and only four out of Americans personally know someone in uniform It should be instructive that the military hero of the moment Navy Lt Shane Osborn who saved the lives of his EP crew by successfully piloting his badly damaged aircraft to a safe landing says that he was motivated to become a flyer by his high school football coach an Air Force veteran But Osborns experience is increasingly rare Today many educators especially those who came of age during the Vietnam era remain hostile to military service and even go so far as to deny military recruiters access to high schools George Orwell wrote We sleep safe in our beds because rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence on those who would do us harm If we expect to remain safe in our beds we would do well to get smart about our armed forces
