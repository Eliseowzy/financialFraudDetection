Association of Risk Professionals Garp this week was again thrown into doubt as a significant number of exGarp regional directors splintered off to form their own risk management association the Professional Risk Managers International Association PRMIA The new body which will include local chapters in Europe Asia the Middle East North America and South America will be strictly notforprofit and plans to run a new risk management certification programme in likely competition with Garps Financial Risk Manager exam The creation of PRMIA pronounced premia comes as many senior Garp officials failed to reach satisfactory terms with Garp founders Marc Lore and Lev Borodovsky to convert that association back from a forprofit to a notforprofit organisation PRMIA plans to offer clear bylaws publish a members code of conduct plus provide members with fully audited financials all to be made available on its website www prmiaorg Regional chapters will include London New York Chicago Toronto Boston Montreal Zurich Philadelphia Minneapolis Charlotte Australia Japan Korea Singapore India Russia Poland Italy Israel Denmark Sweden Chile Argentina and Spain Others are in the pipeline Meanwhile increased familiarity with credit derivatives is leading to a greater appetite for synthetic securitisation according to Standard Poors SP and Moodys The agencies expect a sizeable increase in the synthetic securities market this year following high growth levels in Greater investor sophistication and decreasing yields in traditional investments are also driving the market The two biggest growing asset classes in the synthetic market last year were collateralised debt obligations CDO and commercial mortgagebacked securities CMBS European CDO transactions saw a jump over figures while CMBS more than doubled said Moodys A large proportion of these deals were being used to capture enhanced yields through speculative arbitrage On the same theme Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein has undertaken a major reorganisation of its credit derivatives operations and named Rick Weinstein its new head of credit derivatives Weinstein will report directly to Matteo Mazzocchi global head of credit derivatives and securitisation He will lead a group that now consists of four units trading collateralised debt obligations collateralised synthetic obligations and structured credit products

peak and offpeak terms from dayahead through the forward curve to calendar years via the new system The broker has already combined voice and electronic brokerage trading in Europe becoming the

banks in all countries and not just internationally active institutions while others raised grave concerns that the proposals would have a significant detrimental impact on loans to emerging markets
