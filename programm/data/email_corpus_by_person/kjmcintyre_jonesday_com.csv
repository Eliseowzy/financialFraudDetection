draft order went out to all parties I share Robert Fallons concern Although the judge did say at Mondays prehearing conference that she would accept a partys ballpark estimate of its ripple claims the express inclusion of a procedure for ripple claim offers of proof could later harm a party that remains silent on this issue despite the draft orders statement that offers of proof are not required The draft order might benefit from an upfront definition of ripple claims First though we need to make sure that we all agree on the meaning of the terms that we are using Depending on how we define ripple claims it seems to me that a counterclaim or a crossclaim could indeed be a ripple claim and we need to be sure that we are not prejudiced by failing to assert such claims now A counterclaim is my claim against somebody who has asserted a claim against me A crossclaim is my claim against a third party who has NOT asserted a claim against me As for offset I have been under the impression that we have been using that term to describe a deduction that may validly be made from a refund amount that I am deemed to owe another party particularly a deduction occasioned by that other partys unpaid bill from me Presumably each of us knows who sold power to us and the prices for those sales Therefore should I so choose I already have the ability to assert a refund claim against any of the entities that sold to me whether the seller has made a claim against me making my refund claim a counterclaim or has not made a claim against me making my refund claim a crossclaim But given my opposition to ANY refunds in this case I would prefer to refrain from asserting my own refund claims whether counterclaims or crossclaims while reserving my right to do so in the future should the need arise Perhaps we should define a ripple claim simply as any refund claim that could potentially be asserted by a party that has expressed an opposition to refunds in this case That way we could maintain a unified front of opposition to refunds without being prejudiced in any way from seeking our own refunds if it should come to that In testimony and other filings we would make it clear that any refund directive would open the Pandoras box of wave after wave of ripple claims but we would not need to quantify them now The draft order in the title defers ripple claims to a later phase in this proceeding We want this proceeding to die not to live on in later phases Shouldnt the order simply EXCLUDE ripple claims as beyond the scope of the proceeding Kevin J McIntyre Jones Day Reavis

Pcom Perlis Mark Rizzo Sandra DC cc Subject RE Revised Ripple Claim Order I was unable to attend the prehearing conference on Monday However I question why the Judge wants the sentence at the end of the first full paragraph starting with In lieu of such claims That sentence totally destroys what I thought she was trying to accomplish ie keep ripple claims out of this proceeding It says that you can submit an offer of proof estimating the amount of ripple claims and she will certify that to the Commission In order to protect themselves wont that just mean that market participants will submit their estimate of ripple refunds due and we will back in the same boat we were trying to get away from Thanks Robert Fallon Original Message From mailto Sent Wednesday August AM To Longstreth John DC
