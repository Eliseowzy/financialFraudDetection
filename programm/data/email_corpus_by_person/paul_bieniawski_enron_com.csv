Thomas Steinbauer Thomas Uding William Cc McGill Chris Traweek Lori Subject AGAs Weekly Storage Report FYI Hello everyone I hope that you had a fine holiday weekend Mine was great Several committee members have expressed an interest in learning more about the events that lead to and resulted from the unexpected working gas storage number reported a few weeks ago in the AGA American Gas Storage Survey At the committees request the following is a brief message from Chris McGill managing director of policy analysis regarding this activity Please review the material below and attached By the end of this week or early next week I will forward to you the summary referenced in the final paragraph below for your comments andor concerns Thank you Have an awesome day Original Message From McGill Chris Sent Tuesday September AM To Denbow Kimberly Cc Wilkinson Paul Shin David Pierson Paul Subject To AGA Underground Storage Committee Members Thank you for the opportunity to provide an update on the recent activities of AGAs American Gas Storage Survey AGSS Certainly the voluntary survey and resulting estimates of working gas in storage for the nation would not be possible without your help and support There are three issues I would like to cover in this message including the recent revision of working gas an issue of continuing the reporting and current procedures and methods Regarding the recent report and subsequent revision of working gas in storage for the Consuming Region East please know that we continue to follow our procedures for data collection verification and distribution Several weeks ago we flagged several survey submittals that seemed different from traditional patterns in the eastern region for this time of year Followup to the submittals was set in motion however were not fully resolved until days after the Wednesday posting period It is our policy to consider eliminating certain data submittals if questions arise about the validity of the data In this case inclusion of the data or elimination of the data from the computational spreadsheets did not change the fact that a very low net build would be reported for the nation Because of that we opted to go forward with our estimates and continue to pursue our verification efforts Simply put we dont make up numbers for companies when we have an actual report in hand just to create a final estimate of working gas changes that fits more closely with market expectations What turned out to be a clerical error in the data reported to us was discovered and a revised survey submitted Our revision of the estimates of working gas in storage for the eastern region and the total US came one week later at our normal reporting period as is our stated policy for distributing revisions to the public The fact is that we have revised our data about times in the past years or about weekly reports Our accuracy can be clearly documented by comparing the AGSS estimates to that of EIA The attached slides do just that as well as show the current level of working gas compared to the prior fiveyear average What seems to have developed in the natural gas market particularly among traders is a lack of tolerance between what we report and what the market expects In order to continue our reach for consistency we are reviewing our methods and procedures to ensure that they continue to reflect the best practices of completing a report such as the weekly estimates of working gas Our evolving methods and procedures issue brief is attached Any comments you have on the stated procedures or regarding this memorandum in general can be directed to me Finally the issue of whether we continue to report the estimates of working gas publicly remains one to be considered by the AGA Board of Directors Like all projects at AGA the AGSS come under periodic scrutiny for its value to the members and to the gas market in general However like many realtime information sources the sequential data set has become sensitive over time Please be alerted to the fact that a summary is being prepared by AGA for presentation to board members on this issue It is our intention to copy the Underground Storage Committee on the documentation that is distributed It seems likely that if AGA discontinues the weekly reporting of working gas that some other entity federal or otherwise will pick it up Again if you have comments on this memorandum the attachments to this memo or the AGSS summary to be presented to the AGA Board not attached but expected to be copied to you soon please make them to me or to the appropriate person at your company I appreciate your attention to this matter Your support of the American Gas Storage Survey is gratefully acknowledged Christopher B McGill
