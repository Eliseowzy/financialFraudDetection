right the party finally ended and the kids drove out of sight I got into my car sure to get home in one piece I never knew what was coming Mom something I expected least Now Im lying on the pavement And I hear the policeman say The kid that caused this wreck was drunk Mom His voice seems far away My own bloods all around me as I try hard not to cry I can hear the paramedic say This girl is going to die Im sure the guy had no idea while he was flying high because he chose to drink and drive now I would have to die So why do people do it Mom Knowing that it ruins lives And now the pain is cutting me like a hundred stabbing knives Tell sister not to be afraid Mom tell daddy to be brave and when I go to heaven put Daddys Girl on my grave Someone should have taught him that its wrong to drink and drive Maybe if his parents had Id still be alive My breath is getting shorter Mom Im getting really scared These are my final moments and Im so unprepared I wish that you could hold me Mom

<6523306.1075856162565.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,tori.kuykendall@enron.com,2000-11-27 07:07:00,customer service complaint my name is Tori Kuykendall One Pass BJ My husband Patrick One Pass VF and I have been One Pass members for a few years now as well as elite members on several occasions We also use Chase Continental Visa exclusively and my husband is a Presidents Club member I have made Continental my airline of choice for as long as I can remember booking my own travel arrangements and have been a very satisfied customer in the past This morning however I had a very bad experience I booked tickets for a vacation back on September th for a trip from Houston to New York on December Since I booked the ticket I became pregnant and found out from my doctor last week that I will still be unable to travel on December st due to complications with my pregnancy My doctor indicated to me that I may not be able to fly at all during my pregnancy which is due to end in June I spoke to Leroy Peterson this morning to explain the situation and he indicated that all he could do was give me credit that would expire on September th and that a service would be charged to me next time I book a ticket for me or my husband I understand that this is the same policy that you would have given me if I had just decided that I didnt feel like taking a vacation this weekend In my opinion this is an unacceptable policy in the event of medical complications As you can see with my situation it is unlikely that my husband and I will be able to plan a vacation by September of considering we will hopefully have a month old child I repeatedly asked Leroy if there was anyone else who could help me or anyone I could talk to in order to get some kind of exception to your policy I indicated that I could provide a doctors note if necessary He was very rude to me stating You dont have to ask me different times for the same thing I already told you NO I had to cancel a flight for work about a month ago on Southwest airlines for the same reason but I was hoping that I would be able to fly again by now For your information your competitor was very helpful They accepted my doctors note gave me a credit good for one year and will allow me to change the ticket to another persons name if I am still unable to use it That ticket was also booked as a nonrefundable fare Although I have always used Continental for my personal travel the treatment I have had in this difficult time has definitely made me secondguess my future choices If there is anything you can do to help I would greatly appreciate it

to drink Mom so I had a sprite instead I felt proud of myself the way you said I would that I didnt drink and drive though some friends said I should I made a healthy choice and your advice to me was right the party finally ended and the kids drove out of sight I got into my car sure to get home in one piece I never knew what was coming Mom something I expected least Now Im lying on the pavement And I hear the policeman say The kid that caused this wreck was drunk Mom His voice seems far away My own bloods all around me as I try hard not to cry I can hear the paramedic say This girl is going to die Im sure the guy had no idea while he was flying high because he chose to drink and drive now I would have to die So why do people do it Mom Knowing that it ruins lives And now the pain is cutting me like a hundred stabbing knives Tell sister not to be afraid Mom tell daddy to be brave and when I go to heaven put Daddys Girl on my grave Someone should have taught him that its wrong to drink and drive Maybe if his parents had Id still be alive My breath is getting shorter Mom Im getting really scared These are my final moments and Im so unprepared I wish that you could hold me Mom

right the party finally ended and the kids drove out of sight I got into my car sure to get home in one piece I never knew what was coming Mom something I expected least Now Im lying on the pavement And I hear the policeman say The kid that caused this wreck was drunk Mom His voice seems far away My own bloods all around me as I try hard not to cry I can hear the paramedic say This girl is going to die Im sure the guy had no idea while he was flying high because he chose to drink and drive now I would have to die So why do people do it Mom Knowing that it ruins lives And now the pain is cutting me like a hundred stabbing knives Tell sister not to be afraid Mom tell daddy to be brave and when I go to heaven put Daddys Girl on my grave Someone should have taught him that its wrong to drink and drive Maybe if his parents had Id still be alive My breath is getting shorter Mom Im getting really scared These are my final moments and Im so unprepared I wish that you could hold me Mom

November PM To DLGAALLenronworldwide Subject Overview of Investor Conference Call Today Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company Heres an update of what we discussed during the call We told investors that were doing everything we can to protect their inter ests and to regain their confidence Our focus remains on our credit qualit y balance sheet and liquidity which are essential for our continued succe ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today Heres a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation In hindsight we definitely made some very bad investments in our nonco re businesses over the past several years Those include investments in Azu rix India and Brazil They have performed far worse that we could have eve r imagined when we made these investments Because of these bad investments weve become overleveraged as a compa ny The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in vestor confidence which has been very damaging Weve been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hardtounder stand financial and operating disclosures and On top of it all we discovered errors in our financial statements as d iscussed in our K filing last week that required a restatement of previo usly reported earnings Weve taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas core businesses noncore businesses and businesses under review Core Businesses Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear nings and cash flows for the company Theyre our competitive advantage Th ese include Natural gas pipeline businesses Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe Retail businesses in North America and Europe and Coal businesses in North America and Europe The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou r projected fourth quarter profitability Its too early to tell at this ti me what impact this might have on our operating results We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in I also remain optimistic that the actions weve taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns According to our business unit leaders we have definitely seen i mprovement in our counterparty relationships NonCore Businesses Our noncore businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d ivision We have invested more than billion in these businesses and the return from them has been dismal We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses We alre ady have more than million in assets contracted for sale this year Th ey include CEG Rio a gas LDC in Brazil EcoElectrica a power plant and LN G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico and asset sales of offshore oil and ga s properties in India The approximately billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late pending regulatory approvals Businesses Under Review These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets While sev eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects we need to dete rmine if their capital requirements and nearterm growth prospects are suff icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force More information will follow as soon as it b ecomes available Credit RatingQ Filing We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating Our current cr edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows Moodys at Baa Under Review for Further Downgrade Fitch at BBB Evolving Status SP at BBB CreditWatch Negative We also discussed our existing financial vehicles including Osprey Marlin and Yosemite in further detail We told investors that we will file our Q five days late due to our current activities It will be filed on Nov We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we ll as our frequent updates with you The full transcript of our conference call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next few days It will also be posted on our web site at wwwenroncomcorpinve stors under SEC Filings In connection with the proposed transactions Dynegy and Enron will file a joint proxy statementprospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio n Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro xy statementprospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes

minds and decided to do the year again but could only get still much better than the we had before We are still going to pay on it like a year mortgage but the years gives us flexibility to make the lower payment in case of an emergency sounds really good do you have to pay points to get it that low I like year loans for the interest rate but like year loans for the flexibility its really a matter of personal choice Thats why we went with the year and will pay like a it costs a little more due to int rate than a straight year mortgage but is kind of an insurance policy because you only have to pay the small year payment Sorry to hear about the golf membership I know how much you enjoyed that We have focused this entire year on paying down debt so we really havent saved anything

refinancing we should close in a couple of weeks Susan doesnt want to start trying for a baby until after the holidays The answer to your Calpine question is a little complex but the short and simple answer is the following Although there is a lot of new power coming online most companies are not accounting for the fact that a lot of the old generation will be displaced by the new generation ie the new generation is much cheaper to operate so it will win the battle in the end New power generation has not kept up with the growth of the s and s plain and simple this is a fact However if we go into a longlived recession some of the growth will erode A lot of the current plans for more generation will not materialize Many companies will shut down plans to build more generation because of fears of overbuilding Whoever gets the new generation on the ground first will force the other companies to back off In the s Calpines CEO recognized the fact that there would be a lack of power in the US by the late s and into the s Therefore he bought call options from the major turbine producers GE Westinghouse etc which gives us the rights to a large portion of the turbines that are

to drink Mom so I had a sprite instead I felt proud of myself the way you said I would that I didnt drink and drive though some friends said I should I made a healthy choice and your advice to me was right the party finally ended and the kids drove out of sight I got into my car sure to get home in one piece I never knew what was coming Mom something I expected least Now Im lying on the pavement And I hear the policeman say The kid that caused this wreck was drunk Mom His voice seems far away My own bloods all around me as I try hard not to cry I can hear the paramedic say This girl is going to die Im sure the guy had no idea while he was flying high because he chose to drink and drive now I would have to die So why do people do it Mom Knowing that it ruins lives And now the pain is cutting me like a hundred stabbing knives Tell sister not to be afraid Mom tell daddy to be brave and when I go to heaven put Daddys Girl on my grave Someone should have taught him that its wrong to drink and drive Maybe if his parents had Id still be alive My breath is getting shorter Mom Im getting really scared These are my final moments and Im so unprepared I wish that you could hold me Mom

The two men concluded that the headlight fuse on the older model truck had burned out As a replacement fuse was not available Wallis noticed that the caliber bullet from his pistol fit perfectly into the fuse box next to the steering wheel column Upon inserting the bullet the headlights again began to operate properly and the two men proceeded on eastbound toward the White River bridge After traveling approximately miles and just before crossing the river the bullet apparently overheated discharged and struck Poole in the right testicle The vehicle swerved sharply to the right exiting the pavement and striking a tree Poole suffered only minor cuts and abrasions from the accident but will require surgery to repair the other wound Wallis sustained a broken clavicle and was treated and
