the advancement of highefficiency cars freedomCAR The new program will focus on fuel cells and hydrogen production from renewable energy sources DOE will carry out the freedomCAR program in partnership with the US Council of Automotive Research a cooperative research organization formed by Ford Motor Company General Motors Corporation and DaimlerChrysler Corporation In fact the CAR in freedomCAR stands for Cooperative Automotive Research FreedomCAR replaces the Clintonera Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles PNGV which aimed to produce an affordable sedan that achieves miles per gallon by In contrast the longterm goal for freedomCAR is to develop technologies for hydrogen powered fuel cell vehicles that will require no foreign oil and emit no harmful pollutants or greenhouse gases An interesting aspect of freedomCAR is its emphasis on developing a hydrogen supply infrastructure many automotive companies are currently developing cars that would be fueled with lowsulfur gasoline methanol or natural gas fuels which would be converted to hydrogen using onboard fuel processors FreedomCAR looks farther ahead to an energy economy that is built around hydrogen as the energy carrier See the DOE press release with a link to a fact sheet at HQPressreleasesjanprprhtm So how do you produce hydrogen Today most hydrogen is produced from fossil fuels It can also be produced by passing a current through two electrodes immersed in water but that technique tends to be expensive Researchers are now examining ways to make hydrogen from organic materials to generate it from organic processes or to produce it directly from sunlight and water Some catalysts help sunlight to split water into hydrogen and oxygen but researchers are also using modified solar cells immersed in water called photoelectrodes For more information see the Hydrogen Information Network on EREN at hydrogen For those more technically inclined the proceedings of the DOE Hydrogen Program Review are posted on the Hydrogen Information Network at hydrogendocstochtml Ford Shows Hybrid Escape SUV at Detroit Auto Show Ford Motor Company is displaying the hybrid electric version of its

American Wind Energy Association AWEA The record growth of megawatts boosted the total US wind power capacity from megawatts to megawatts AWEA says last years installations represent capital investments of about billion and will produce enough electricity to meet the annual needs of US households See the January th press release on the AWEA Web site at newsindexhtml The US growth in wind capacity is actually outpacing the world growth according to the Earth Policy Institute world wind power capacity increased percent in In fact wind capacity grew faster in the United States than in the other four leading winddevelopment countries Germany Denmark India and Spain Germany however still has nearly twice the wind power capacity as the United States thanks to aggressive government policies for wind power development German wind power capacity overtook US wind power capacity in According to the Earth Policy Institute the worlds total wind power capacity is now at megawatts more than five times the US capacity See the Earth Policy press release with links to detailed tables and graphs at UpdatesUpdatehtm Note that the Earth Policy numbers are preliminary so they are slightly lower than the AWEA numbers If the latest news is any indication world wind power capacity will continue to grow rapidly in Ireland gave the goahead for the worlds largest offshore wind power facility

Installed on Novel Tower Without Large Crane A single kilowatt wind turbine was installed in December in Omaha Nebraska to serve a green power program run by the Omaha Public Power District OPPD The installation uses an innovative tower designed by Valmont Industries Inc that incorporates a lifting platform for installing the turbine The platform eliminated the need for a large crane to install the turbine See the OPPD Web site at newsGreenPowerhtm Valmont Industries believes its wind turbine tower could help expand the installation of wind turbines into rugged terrains that present access problems for large cranes See the Valmont Web site at polespolesshtml North Carolina Utilities to Pursue Green Power A Green Power Program Advisory Committee formed last year in North Carolina has led the electric utility companies throughout the state to pursue a green power program According to Advanced Energy which helped form the advisory committee the three investorowned utilities in North Carolina have publicly declared their intentions to file for a green power program with the states utility commission The states municipal utilities and electric cooperatives have also agreed to participate A statewide program should be in place by midyear Advanced Energy is a nonprofit energy consultancy founded by the North Carolina Utilities Commission in See the Advanced Energy Web site at greenpowerindexhtml Green power also continues to advance in Washington state where all the utilities are now required by law to offer a green power program The latest offerings come from Avista Utilities which serves nearly electric customers in eastern Washington and northern Idaho and from Clark Public Utilities in southwest Washington Clark Public Utilities is buying socalled green tags from the Bonneville Environmental Foundation while Avista is buying wind power from the Stateline Wind Project that went online at year end See the Avista Web site at accountwindpowerasp And see the

success with their drill bits in significantly boosting oil and gas reserves according to a report released last week by DOEs Energy Information Administration EIA The major US energy producers expanded their worldwide oil and gas reserves by an equivalent of billion barrels of crude oil in exceeding their worldwide oil and gas production by percent allowing the reserves to gain some ground over production Meanwhile the companies actually gained percent of their oil and gas reserve increases through mergers and acquisitions The companies nearly doubled their worldwide capital expenditures in and most of the growth in spending went toward mergers and acquisitions The companies also posted record profits as their net income increased percent from levels to a new record of billion See the EIA press release with a link to the full report at neicpresspresshtml ABOUT THIS NEWSLETTER You can subscribe to this newsletter using the online form at newslettersubscribe This Web

press release from Governor Davis at electricitypeakdemandreductionhtml The Pacific Northwest can be proud too according to DOEs Bonneville Power Administration BPA the region reduced its electricity demand by roughly megawatts or enough to power more than homes in See the BPA press release at CorporateKCCnrnrnrshtml Spire Solar Chicago Installs Kilowatts of Solar Power Spire Solar Chicago a business unit of Spire Corporation announced last week the installation of a total of kilowatts of solar photovoltaic systems on six roofs in Chicago The systems were installed on the DuSable Museum of African American History the Homan Square Community Center Commonwealth Edisons South Hydome facility two Chicago public schools and a small commercial building The installations are part of a local publicprivate partnership to produce clean energy in Chicago See the Spire press release at SpirenewsPVhtml DOT Proposes No Change in Light Truck Efficiency Standards The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA a part of the US Department of Transportation DOT released last week its proposed fuel efficiency standards for Model Year light trucks The proposed standard holds the Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency CAFE standard for light trucks at its current level of miles per gallon The light truck classification includes vans pickup trucks and most sport utility vehicles SUVs Since Congress has prohibited NHTSA from spending any funds to consider changes to the CAFE standards Although that prohibition was lifted in December the NHTSA claims it has not had sufficient time to consider changes to the standard The NHTSA must issue its proposed rules early enough to allow public comment and changes prior to a final rulemaking which must be issued by April st The public is invited to provide comments on the proposed fuel efficiency standard before midFebruary See the January th press release on the NHTSA Web site at nhtsaannouncepressindexcfm On January th four days before the proposed standards were released the National Research Council NRC sent NHTSA a report confirming the NRCs conclusions on CAFE standards originally released in a detailed report published in July The reassessment was performed after the initial report was challenged by the automotive industry The latest report reaffirms that technologies exist that if applied to passenger cars and lightduty trucks would significantly reduce fuel consumption within years and that assessment of currently offered product technologies suggest that lightduty trucks including SUVs pickups and minivans offer the greatest potential to reduce fuel consumption See the new report on the National Academy Press Web site at booksNIhtmlRhtml According to the US Environmental Protection Agency EPA the overall fuel economy of light vehicles including both light trucks and cars is now at a year low of miles per gallon Although car mileage has remained essentially flat for the past years and light truck mileage has stayed largely unchanged for the past years the growing market share of light trucks has dragged down the overall fuel economy of light vehicles See the EPA Light Duty Automotive Technology and Fuel Economy Trends Web page at otaqfetrendshtm Note that actual fuel economies can be lower than the CAFE standards for a number of reasons including the fact that manufacturers earn credits for any alternativefuel vehicles that they sell Some manufacturers also fall below the standards and pay penalties To see how the details of how manufacturers are meeting the standards see the NHTSA report on Model Year CAFE standards at carsproblemsstudiesfueleconindexhtml RealWorld Test of Superconductor Cable Delayed A test of a hightemperature superconductor HTS cable at a Detroit Edison substation has been delayed indefinitely According to American Superconductor Corporation which made the HTS wires for the cables a problem with the vacuum insulating system used to help keep the cables cool is preventing Detroit Edison from placing the HTS cables into service The company says the HTS wires met all their performance requirements and the vacuum insulating technology is a proven technology that would not be expected to hinder the future use of HTS cables Pirelli Energy Cables and Systems the cable manufacturer is expected to issue a revised timetable for the demonstration project in spring The Detroit Edison substation is the site of the first installation and demonstration of an underground HTS cable in a US utility network The utility installed three foot cables inside inchdiameter underground ducts during the summer of All other cable components including the cryogenic cooling and vacuum insulating systems were completed in the fall American Superconductor does have some good news though its horsepower HTS motor prototype which uses HTS wires in its rotor winding the part of the motor that rotates was successfully tested at full load early this month The motor also successfully carried a peak load of horsepower while running at its rated speed Both the HTS rotor coils and the refrigeration system met or exceeded their performance goals and the system as a whole operated at an efficiency of percent The company claims it also identified potential changes to the stator the part of the motor that stays still or static that could boost the efficiency of the motor to percent See the American Superconductor press releases at presshtm Report Questions Government Support for Renewable Energy A report issued early this month by the Cato Institute a nonprofit public policy research foundation says that government subsidies for renewable energy sources are unwarranted The report says that renewable energy is not likely to gain significant market share in the foreseeable future without a significant increase in government subsidies or mandates The report also claims that the environmental benefits of renewable energy could be achieved more cheaply using other technologies The report does acknowledge that government subsidies for fully commercialized fossil energy technologies oil coal and natural gas are nearly double those for renewable energy while nuclear and fossil fuels are also receiving more research and development funds It also suggests that natural gas prices and availability will remain stable for the foreseeable future See the Cato Institute press release with a link to the full report at newrhtml ENERGY FACTS AND TIPS Report Claims Utilities are Struggling to Power Data Centers A report issued last week suggests that electric utilities are having a difficult time providing power to electronic data centers including socalled Internet hotels that provide servers for Web sites The Platts report finds that such data centers can consume from to times the electricity per square foot used by standard commercial buildings For instance a squarefoot data center under construction in Washington State is expected to draw up to megawatts of power when it is complete Such high power loads are causing some data centers to develop their own power sources See the news release from Platts one of The McGrawHill Companies at pressreleasespressreleaseshtml The Platts report might be somewhat suspect however in light of a report issued last summer by DOEs Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory LBL That report found that for a variety of reasons data centers often greatly exaggerate their power needs It concluded that data centers use at most watts per square foot and usually closer to watts per square foot This number applies only to the computer room part of the facility and not surrounding office areas Using these figures the data center in Washington would need at most megawatts of power probably much less See the August th edition of EREN Network News at newsletterarchivesaughtml A report released last month by the Renewable Energy Policy Project REPP suggests that energy use in data centers could be even lower Using efficient servers properly sized and efficient cooling systems and other energy efficiency approaches data centers could reduce their electricity demand by to percent according to the report See the REPP announcement with a link to the full report at articlesstatichtml ABOUT THIS NEWSLETTER You can subscribe to this newsletter using the online

renewable energy combined heat and power CHP systems and energyefficient vehicles For power producers the budget includes a new percent investment tax credit for qualifying CHP systems an extension of the tax credit for landfill methane power plants an extension of the production tax credit PTC through and an expansion of the PTC to include more biomass energy facilities The PTC provides renewable power producers with a tax break of cents per kilowatthour in dollars adjusted for inflation and was formerly applicable only to electricity produced from wind power poultry waste and biomass power produced from dedicated energy crops The PTC expired in December leading to a slowdown in the wind energy business For example Vestas Wind Systems AS shifted employees to halftime work in January with the expectation that the slowdown will continue for weeks See the Vestas press release at nyhederpresseUKfondUKhtml The budget also includes a tax credit for the average American people that install solar hot water or solar electric systems on their homes would earn a tax credit of percent of the cost of the systems including installation The credit has a maximum of per person for solar hot water systems and another per person for solar photovoltaic systems People buying hybrid electric vehicles would also earn a tax credit of up to with the amount determined by both the performance of the hybrid system and the vehicles fuel economy When fuelcell vehicles become available theyll earn an even higher tax credit at least and up to depending on the vehicles fuel economy And fuel producers

have failed to win approval from the California Office of Administrative Law The ARB announced last week that the rules were apparently not approved because it failed to follow proper procedures when giving notice of its proposed changes to the program ARB has days to remedy the situation and it expects to meet that deadline See the notice on the ARB Web site at regactzevzevhtm New York meanwhile is pressing ahead with its own version of the ZEV program The states current regulations require ten percent of all vehicles sold in the state to be ZEVs which in practical terms means electric vehicles starting with Model Year Early this month Governor George E Pataki announced an alternative approach for automakers that starts a year earlier but includes credits for vehicles with nearzero emissions vehicles referred to as Partial ZEVs or PZEVs in the California rules The new approach also allows partial credits for PZEVs that use alternative fuels or hybrid technologies These changes are similar to changes made in California by the ARB but on a slower timetable See Governor Patakis press release at governorpressyearjanhtm State standards for auto emissions are governed by unusual rules by federal law only California can set stricter standards than the federal standards and other states must either follow federal standards or adopt standards essentially equal to Californias This approach helps keep the standards manageable for automakers but places California in a leadership position New York Massachusetts and Vermont have followed Californias lead on ZEV rules

Site News Green Energy Ohio Energy Facts and Tips Study Earth Likely to Warm to Degrees by About this Newsletter NEWS AND EVENTS US Investment in Energy Efficiency Research Pays Off The United States has reaped huge economic benefits from its investments in energy efficiency research and development says a report released last week by the National Research Council NRC An NRC panel examined energy efficiency projects that represented billion in federal investment or roughly percent of the billion that DOE has spent over the past years The panel estimates that the billion investment yielded net economic benefits of billion Incredibly three DOE projects that cost only million resulted in most of the economic benefit compressors for refrigerators and freezers energyefficient fluorescent lighting components called electronic ballasts and low emission lowe window glass that resists the transmission of heat through windows The NRC also credits federal standards and regulations that incorporated the efficiencies attainable by these new technologies ensuring that the technologies would be adopted nationwide As part of the report the panel also examined federal investments in fossil energy research and development For projects costing billion about percent of the billion spent over years the NRC estimates net economic benefits of billion See the July th press release on the National Academies Web site at topnews See also the full report especially the executive Summary on the National Academy Press Web site at bookshtml Company Builds First Horsepower HTS Motor American Superconductor Corporation has built the first horsepower motor that uses hightemperature superconducting HTS wires in its rotor the company announced last week Because HTS wires carry large amounts of electrical current with low energy losses the HTS motor is roughly half the size and weight of a conventional motor and also reduces the energy losses by up to percent According to the company motors greater than horsepower in size use onequarter of the electricity generated in the United States so the potential energy savings from large HTS motors could be significant See the American Superconductor Web site at htsmotorhtm Honda BMW Start Up Hydrogen Fueling Stations American Honda Motor Co Inc announced in early July the startup of a hydrogen fueling station for its fuelcellpowered vehicles Located at Hondas research and development center in Torrance California the station uses solar power to extract hydrogen from water The solar panels on the station generate

Increased Energy Security and Isolated Price Hikes Follow Terrorist Attacks One of the impacts of last weeks terrorist attack on the World Trade Center was the loss of electrical service to lower Manhattan Two electrical substations next to the Trade Center were totally destroyed and a third substation was knocked out of service Major electrical transmission cables were also lost As of this morning the citys electric utility Con Edison had managed to restore power to all of lower Manhattan after installing more than miles of new highvoltage cable However the utility is still asking people in lower Manhattan to minimize their use of electricity More than Con Edison workers have labored around the clock to restore power See the Con Edison press releases at aboutaboutaspsubframenews In response to the attacks security was heightened throughout the US energy infrastructure Shipments of nuclear material were halted and security was heightened at nuclear plants refineries pipelines and along the electricity transmission grid Taking a longer view the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC noted that the electric gas and oil companies that it regulates may need to adopt new procedures update existing procedures and install facilities to further safeguard their systems FERC announced that it will approve applications to recover prudently incurred costs for such actions and will expedite any such requests These costs will presumably be passed on to consumers See the FERC announcement at QCIPSMISCPLPLTXT Fears of supply disruptions apparently led some US gas stations to hike their prices to as much as per gallon DOE Secretary Spencer Abraham announced on the day after the attack that such price hikes were unjustified and asked consumers to call the DOE Hotline to report such incidents See the DOE press release at HQPressreleasessepprprhtm As of Monday DOEs Energy Information Administration EIA reported that US petroleum
