Jared Loving Scott Bates Kimberly Muhl Gil Smith Maureen Smith Shauywn Taylor Craig Willis Jim Subject Highlights from this mornings ENEDYN analyst conference call Listened in on the analyst call this morning Here are my notes Did not yet have a chance to organize them so theyre simply in chronological order The call began with Watson Bergstrom and Whalley reading from prepared statements Watson spoke for c minutes Bergstrom for and Whalley spoke for perhaps seconds Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them Specific points EES will be a part of the new company Enron assets will be revalued at closing The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred If the merger does not go through Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for very little additional consideration If DYN terminates the merger and ENE has sufficient liquidity ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred Debtequity of combined company expected to be Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative ChevronTexaco will hold MM shares out of a total MM shares of the postmerger entity Watson reiterates that going forward the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure with a significant reduction in on and offbalancesheet leverage In what was termed a new approach the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true Dynegy owed Enron MM Lay says that Enron had other options particularly financial All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be pretty big but that the companies feel theyre able to appropriately value this exposure Lay says we have nothing else to hide but internal investigation still under way Lay had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps MM more of risk capital there would have been no question that they would have qualified for offbalancesheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs Dynegy says that several internal investigations continue at Enron and thus DYNENE cannot say with certainty that theres absolutely nothing else out there Doty Dynegy CFO says that late last week ENE had close to a billion in cash Osprey will be unwound late next summer Marlin will be unwound after closing Many of the offbalancesheet structures including the creditlinked notes are expected to be unwoundredeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing With regard to ENE asset dispositions these will be accelerated to the extent possible However Doty says that our backs are not against the wall and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash ENE will renew its day facility believe this is the Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago within the next weeks BBBflat most likely rating for combined entity according to initial comments from ratings agencies McMahon says no comment to WSJ article indicating that ENEs banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks Consolidation of trading activity Mid and backoffice consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing such that only the front office trading books will need to be combined at closing EES NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity so there wont be much integration work required there The big integration effort will be ENA Watson says that the creative financing surrounded noncore assets Doty adds that frankly DYN assigned zero economic value to noncore businesses in their valuation model They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the noncore assetsbusinesses and left it at that Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by Enrons top three executives who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies Says that their approach evidenced a willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegys deliberations on proceeding with the merger WatsonDoty said that theyre NOT sure that no surprises remain in Enrons booksbut that the riskreward offered by the combination was compelling The deal does have materialadversechange outs for Dynegy covering any MAC regarding Enrons assets or businesses Dynegys lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a blunt instrument under which it would be difficult to bring a case so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enrons total legal liability from any source or cause of action tops Bn prior to closing McMahon adds that there could be more restatements but he does not expect there to be more restatements ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron Enron is planning to hold an Enronspecific conference call in the next few days tentatively scheduled for Wednesday Initial reaction of ratings agencies very positive to combined entities McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to yearend had the merger not materialized Dynegys earnings guidance places Enronrelated earnings accretion at which represents a haircut to Enron internal estimates Doty says that this is all operating earningsfigure does not include any amounts from expected synergies Doty says that both Enron and Dynegys books as far as he understands are relatively shortterm in weight and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity Says a very very substantial portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash ChevronTexacos investment in Dynegy was calculated at a discount to public prices on the date of negotiation not disclosed Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week ChevronTexacos investment is now at a more substantial discount to market prices ChevronTexaco has provision to get different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better No further clarification given Whalley believes that well retain the Enron traders and marketers Theyre used to being part of a winning team and the combined entity will definitely be a winner They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders and they are very excited by the combination They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions He says that to the extent necessary yes Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENEthere will be more of an assetbacked trading focus but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial marketmaking trading than the Dynegy of today Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture hes a strong team player He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well Patrick Tucker
