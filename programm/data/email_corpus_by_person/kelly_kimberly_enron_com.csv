<16946143.1075846369244.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,kelly.kimberly@enron.com,2000-03-21 05:45:00,ALSO URGENT AND CONFIDENTIALDiomedes is going to jump all over me for even sending the ESA memo to Metts I told him that this message affects more than us and he thinks he has free reign within his region I am vacillating about whether to include the paragraph I put in bold but I do want everyone to know just how different this is from the sale of one asset The implications are much broader and we dont want to come off looking dishonest to our own people And believe me the rumors are out there I just dont want to make it worse instead of better and that is my principle concern In terms of the market finding out we always say that our assets are always for sale so I dont think we are giving away anything new I have a draft of the proposed Office of the Chairman letter a DC version and a DH version but need the Skilling input on what our international strategy is I am caught here between a rock DC and a hard place DH and I really feel like we need the direction Both of them have been calling Skilling and we need to take his temperature If the message it the one Diomedes thinks it is we definitely will not want to issue an all employee memo We would be telling about half the international people that there is no future for them Whew Thats it for now My mission tomorrow is getting every possible question written for Jim for espeak so he doesnt say something he should not
<3817747.1075846369284.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,kelly.kimberly@enron.com,2000-03-21 05:33:00,URGENT AND CONFIDENTIALis a memo to ESA employees that Diomedes and I have been working on I dont think there will be any concerns except for the section in bold It does admit that we are looking at the potential sale of some assets although the message is softened up quite a bit Will it cause widespread panic or live up to our vision and values that communication is good Please review and comment ASAP This memo will be the basis for preparing Jim to go on espeak although we will NOT specifically address the potential asset sale issue there except in an answer to a question
