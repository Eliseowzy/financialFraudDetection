complex oak tones of spice and vanilla Theres a great balance on the palate with a natural harmony and brightness between fruit acidity and tannins Order heresevenhillswineryhtml Jeans Choices this month I dont usually put my own preferences out but this month there are some great sleeper wines and some excellent prices that you might miss while wandering through the pages that are the Avalon site Argh How did I do that Ive been tasting wines like crazy for the last month and some of these are really lovely but they havent been reviewed yet or they are too obscure to hit the press So here for what its worth are the wines that as work on the website I type in and say to myself I hope they find this its a good one Andrew Rich Cuvee B Pinot Noir Cuvee B Pinot Noir is made from the same grapes as his regular Pinot Noir but from younger vines or graes that did not quite make the cut for his blend This is a happy mood making easy drinking Pinot with lots of spice and soft red cherry fruit A GREAT DEALandrewrichcuveebhtml Beaux Freres Belles Soeurs Shea regular The best wine from Shea Vineyard Ive ever had Incredibalievable A yumm bucket beauxfreresbellessoeurssheahtml Broadley Marcile Loraine Morgan Broadley told me a restaurants staff that came to the winery to taste drank up his whole tasting bottle in a jiffy and I can tell you they had good reason to This is stellar Pinot Noir in the Broadley tradition VERY VERY LIMITED The nose was full of truffles and bitter chocolate and a hint of licorice that I find in most of the Broadley estate wines The flavors were layered and complex with every kind of spice and seasoning entwined with big black fruit cassis plum and blackberry The finish went on for minutes I think The Claudias Choice is just as good in its own wayBroadleyMarcileLorainehtml Fiddlehead Pinot Noir Kathy Josephs is one of the nicest people you could ever hope to meet and she makes wonderful Pinot Noir Based in Santa Barbara she is better known in CA In she started making a limited bottling of Oregon Pinot Noir and we are so fortunate to have a supply of this wonderful wine I tried it and it is drinking beautifully and showing all the complexity and intriguing mystery of well made well aged Pinot Noir The wine has been perfectly cellared since bottling with no exposure to heat or shipping trauma I suggest a vertical tasting of her wines we have the and available This wine is well worth a try if only to see what well made Oregon Pinot Noir is capable of five years outfiddleheadhtm High Pass Pinot Noir Walnut Ridge Vineyard High Pass Scheurbe Late Harvest ml Dieter Boehms vineyards are a stones throw from Big Pink Avalons farm and web office and as with Broadley a stones throw in a different direction theres world class wine in the hills of the Monroe and Junction City High Pass is the classic sleeper winery making wines that the most experienced wine judges I know are ranking at the top of the list Both of these wines are outstanding examples of their type I wish I could afford to take home more of the late harvest wine I cant pronounce it but I sure like it I thought is was as good as some of the ice wines from Canada And the Pinot is rich almost buttery with a meaty hit that would stand up well to roast leg of lamb This could be a great choice for Easter dinnerhighpasshtm Patricia Green Cellars Pinot Noir Estate This wine tastes a lot like Beaux Freres signature Pinot Noir their Beaux Freres Vineyard Pinot Noir The vineyard is right next to Beaux Freres vineyard so it makes sense and Patricia is already pulling great fruit from it In a few years this will be the wine she is best known for Or so I think Huge Patty Green nose with warm luscious black cherry and cassis hits along with a dense earthy undertone that is rich and pleasant The flavors are of dark blak fruits spices like cinnamon allspice nutmeg a hint of violets and roses and elegant complexity The finish is long and silky Patty is one of my favorite winemakers her jolly disposition and passion for wine show through in all of her delicious wines producthtml Thomas Pinot Noir He makes very little wine and some vintages there is no wine as he does not find the grapes up to his standards When he does drop by with wine we dance in delight A wine made with passion and great finesse age for up to years classicly
