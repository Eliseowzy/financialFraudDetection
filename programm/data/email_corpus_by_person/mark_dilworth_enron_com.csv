Trading OnLine Results of Legal Due Diligence and Risk Me mo NOTE GIVEN THE PROPOSED LAUNCH DATE OF JANUARY FOR THIS PRODUCT THIS NOTE IS INTENDED TO SERVE BOTH AS A SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS OF OUR LEGA L DUE DILIGENCE AND AS A RISK MEMO As you know we have carried out legal due diligence in the eight countries where it was intended the credit product would initially be traded via EnronOnLine namely the UK the US Canada Finland Germany Norway Sweden and Switzerland Under the terms of the credit product on the occurrence of a bankruptcy with respect to a specified third party the Reference Entity the Seller of the product which could be either Enron or its online counterparty will pay a fixed preagreed cash sum in an agreed currency to the Buyer It should be borne in mind that this product differ s in a number of ways from the more conventional credit derivatives traded in the international markets This means that a change in the nature or terms of our product or the introduction of alternative credit products will likely change the analysis below Set out below is an overview of where we have come out on the more significant legal issues I am also attaching a two page Executive Summar y of Legal Advice prepared by outside counsel which highlights the significa nt legal issuesrisks in each country and which should be read in conjunction with this note mail As you will see the Executive Summary does not focus on issues we raised which are all clear from a legal perspective so as to keep the summary to a sensible length but there was plenty of good news too Where a legal issue has been identified I have either set out belo w what action is to be taken or not addressed it further on the basis that on the advice of foreign counsel the risk is not very substantial or unlikely to materialise Therefore where no comment is made below in relation to a risk highlighted in the attached summary please assume that the legal risk is one which in our view it is reasonable to take A Countries in which the credit product can be traded in January Finland Norway Sweden Switzerland UK US B Countries in which launch of the product via EnronOnline will need to b e delayed Canada Germany reasons set out below C General Issues applicable in all countries The credit product is fundamentally different from the usual energy and related products we trade and so gives rise to new or increased legal risks of a general nature i Capacity We will not be able to assume generally that our counterparties will have the legal power and authority necessary to trade t he product and so will need to check each counterpartys constitutional documents before allowing them to trade the product online This applies t o almost all entities eg corporates municipalities insurance companies in all countries Some entities may lack the power to trade under the general law in which case we will not be able to deal with them at all or under their constitutional documents in which case they will need to amend their constitutional documents if they wish to trade The check need only be made once at the beginning of the credit trading relationship and so can be added to our procedures It is not a particular ly onerous job and will increase the cost of this business only incrementally ii Confidentiality We will need to put in place procedures to ensure that we are not misusing confidential information about our business counterparties on whom we are offering credit protection Misuse can occur both in pricing the product and trading it The procedures will not includ e formal Chinese Walls separating the credit traders from our other traders o r the credit department a point we have managed to agree with both UK and US counsel following very detailed discussions The procedures will include a the use of a Restricted List in both the US and Europe similar to the procedure currently used in Houston and b practical steps to ensure tha t confidential information derived from other areas of our business and which we are not entitled to use eg because it is the subject of a confidentiali ty agreement is not imparted to the credit traders In addition where Enron has an especially close relationship with a prospective reference entity o r otherwise has confidential information relating to such an entity we will need its written consent before offering protection on that entity Withou t such consent there will be an unjustifiably high risk of being sued by tha t entity for breach of confidence D Country Specific Issues i Canada There is a substantial risk that the product will constitute insurance business constituting an offence and rendering contracts in the product unenforceable against our counterparties We should try to resolve this issue with the Canadian authorities before launching the product in Canada Timeframe for clearance is highly uncertain since it is not clear which Canadian authority would take jurisdiction of the matter ii Germany Again the issue is insurance The risk is higher than in Canada and so Germany should be excluded initially iii Norway There is a material risk that the credit product could be regarded as gaming in Norway in which case trades would be void and unenforceable The normal way to mitigate this risk in Norway is by using a substantial professional effort to satisfy ourselves that a trade is bein g entered into for valid commercial purposes normally hedging by our counterparty Clearly it will not be possible to take such steps on a trad e by trade basis in the context of EnronOnline At a minimum we should therefore ensure at the outset of the online trading relationship in this product with each Norwegian counterparty that there is a commercial logic behind its trading this product type iv Switzerland If the credit product is the main purpose of our tradi ng relationship with a counterparty we should check with the Swiss supervisor y authority whether the product constitutes insurance the position being unclear If a trade is insurance it can be terminated by the counterpart y which is obviously of greater concern if Enron is the Buyer and an offenc e will be committed since Enron is not authorised as a Swiss insurer Howeve r I understand that the initial group of counterparties will be existing business relationships in which case we can parallel path this issue v US New York Law a CFTC regulation by structuring the product either as a swap or an option and meeting certain other conditions we can rely on exemptions und er the US Commodities Exchange Act b US securities laws there is a small chance that the credit product constitutes a security under US securities laws please see attached Executive Summary However SEC regulations allow the public offering of securities to accredited investors which will allow us to deal with investors having at least US million in assets Since most of our counterparties will be fairly large sophisticated players this test shoul d not impede the business c Insider trading US counsel have advised that the risk of insider trading occurring as a result of the product being characterised as securit y see b above is relatively remote Please feel free to call me on x if you would like to discuss this project further Best regards Paul

Trading OnLine Results of Legal Due Diligence and Risk Me mo NOTE GIVEN THE PROPOSED LAUNCH DATE OF JANUARY FOR THIS PRODUCT THIS NOTE IS INTENDED TO SERVE BOTH AS A SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS OF OUR LEGA L DUE DILIGENCE AND AS A RISK MEMO As you know we have carried out legal due diligence in the eight countries where it was intended the credit product would initially be traded via EnronOnLine namely the UK the US Canada Finland Germany Norway Sweden and Switzerland Under the terms of the credit product on the occurrence of a bankruptcy with respect to a specified third party the Reference Entity the Seller of the product which could be either Enron or its online counterparty will pay a fixed preagreed cash sum in an agreed currency to the Buyer It should be borne in mind that this product differ s in a number of ways from the more conventional credit derivatives traded in the international markets This means that a change in the nature or terms of our product or the introduction of alternative credit products will likely change the analysis below Set out below is an overview of where we have come out on the more significant legal issues I am also attaching a two page Executive Summar y of Legal Advice prepared by outside counsel which highlights the significa nt legal issuesrisks in each country and which should be read in conjunction with this note mail As you will see the Executive Summary does not focus on issues we raised which are all clear from a legal perspective so as to keep the summary to a sensible length but there was plenty of good news too Where a legal issue has been identified I have either set out belo w what action is to be taken or not addressed it further on the basis that on the advice of foreign counsel the risk is not very substantial or unlikely to materialise Therefore where no comment is made below in relation to a risk highlighted in the attached summary please assume that the legal risk is one which in our view it is reasonable to take A Countries in which the credit product can be traded in January Finland Norway Sweden Switzerland UK US B Countries in which launch of the product via EnronOnline will need to b e delayed Canada Germany reasons set out below C General Issues applicable in all countries The credit product is fundamentally different from the usual energy and related products we trade and so gives rise to new or increased legal risks of a general nature i Capacity We will not be able to assume generally that our counterparties will have the legal power and authority necessary to trade t he product and so will need to check each counterpartys constitutional documents before allowing them to trade the product online This applies t o almost all entities eg corporates municipalities insurance companies in all countries Some entities may lack the power to trade under the general law in which case we will not be able to deal with them at all or under their constitutional documents in which case they will need to amend their constitutional documents if they wish to trade The check need only be made once at the beginning of the credit trading relationship and so can be added to our procedures It is not a particular ly onerous job and will increase the cost of this business only incrementally ii Confidentiality We will need to put in place procedures to ensure that we are not misusing confidential information about our business counterparties on whom we are offering credit protection Misuse can occur both in pricing the product and trading it The procedures will not includ e formal Chinese Walls separating the credit traders from our other traders o r the credit department a point we have managed to agree with both UK and US counsel following very detailed discussions The procedures will include a the use of a Restricted List in both the US and Europe similar to the procedure currently used in Houston and b practical steps to ensure tha t confidential information derived from other areas of our business and which we are not entitled to use eg because it is the subject of a confidentiali ty agreement is not imparted to the credit traders In addition where Enron has an especially close relationship with a prospective reference entity o r otherwise has confidential information relating to such an entity we will need its written consent before offering protection on that entity Withou t such consent there will be an unjustifiably high risk of being sued by tha t entity for breach of confidence D Country Specific Issues i Canada There is a substantial risk that the product will constitute insurance business constituting an offence and rendering contracts in the product unenforceable against our counterparties We should try to resolve this issue with the Canadian authorities before launching the product in Canada Timeframe for clearance is highly uncertain since it is not clear which Canadian authority would take jurisdiction of the matter ii Germany Again the issue is insurance The risk is higher than in Canada and so Germany should be excluded initially iii Norway There is a material risk that the credit product could be regarded as gaming in Norway in which case trades would be void and unenforceable The normal way to mitigate this risk in Norway is by using a substantial professional effort to satisfy ourselves that a trade is bein g entered into for valid commercial purposes normally hedging by our counterparty Clearly it will not be possible to take such steps on a trad e by trade basis in the context of EnronOnline At a minimum we should therefore ensure at the outset of the online trading relationship in this product with each Norwegian counterparty that there is a commercial logic behind its trading this product type iv Switzerland If the credit product is the main purpose of our tradi ng relationship with a counterparty we should check with the Swiss supervisor y authority whether the product constitutes insurance the position being unclear If a trade is insurance it can be terminated by the counterpart y which is obviously of greater concern if Enron is the Buyer and an offenc e will be committed since Enron is not authorised as a Swiss insurer Howeve r I understand that the initial group of counterparties will be existing business relationships in which case we can parallel path this issue v US New York Law a CFTC regulation by structuring the product either as a swap or an option and meeting certain other conditions we can rely on exemptions und er the US Commodities Exchange Act b US securities laws there is a small chance that the credit product constitutes a security under US securities laws please see attached Executive Summary However SEC regulations allow the public offering of securities to accredited investors which will allow us to deal with investors having at least US million in assets Since most of our counterparties will be fairly large sophisticated players this test shoul d not impede the business c Insider trading US counsel have advised that the risk of insider trading occurring as a result of the product being characterised as securit y see b above is relatively remote Please feel free to call me on x if you would like to discuss this project further Best regards Paul
