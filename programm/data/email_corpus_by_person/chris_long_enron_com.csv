Coalition booth was a great opportunity to spread the word on the goals of ESC We manned the booth during the Global Marketplace the name of the exhibition We distributed hundreds of the onepager on energy services as well as the bound ESC briefing book In the time I was at the booth there was a significant interest in the ESC Thanks to Marc Eichman for dedicating significant time to managing the booth and to the Enron graphics department for the outstanding display Below find a photo of our display II Energy Services Panel How the Energy Services Industry Can Use Trade Negotiating to Secure and Expand Markets Chair Terry Thorn Senior VP Enron Panelists John Easton VP Intl Programs Edison Electric Institute Ian Miller President EDS Global Energy Business Tim Richards Sr Manager Intl Govt Affairs GE Rachel Thompson Administrator Trade Directorate OECD Attendance at the panel was impressive with over academic government officials from the US Norway Portugal Costa Rica Holland and Israel and private sector participants in fact we had to keep adding more chairs Terry Thorn began the panel with a history of energy services and the future of the industry in a liberalized market Tim Richards provided a summary of GEs view of energy services outlined the current WTO commitments related to energy services and discussed the issues of defining energy services identifying barriers and setting a negotiating approach John Easton outlined the debate on classification of energy services goods vs services Ian Miller followed on the classification issue and applied it to the EU especially the German and French liberalization experience Rachel Thompson outlined her paper on trade in environmental services Rachel went on to describe her lead in the OECD work program on trade in environmental services with its focus on a winwin approach to trade and environment this is similar the winwinwin approach USTR has adopted The OECD work program on environmental services could easily be adopted for energy services A lively discussion ensued on the following the link between environmental and energy services the NAFTA negative list negotiating strategies challenges of definition and classification and ecommerce effect on energy services Terry suggested that interested persons attending the panel provide him contact information so we can create a global network on energy services We can do this independently or through the CSI Global Services Network which is an informal private sectorled online community dedicated to liberalization of services we can start a sector specific network Thanks to all the panelists for your time and talent in making the panel such a success Please see Terrys and Tims panel presentations attached below WSC Plenary On Tuesday morning all the sector specific panelists chairs presented the panel recommendation to the WSC Plenary Each chair was given minutes to present its recommendation and Govt representatives then responded The recommendations will be collected and presented to the trade ministers in advance of Seattle In addition to energy services recommendations were delivered on ecommerce banking insurance entertainment transportation China accounting legal services and express delivery Terry Thorn delivered the ESC recommendation Attached below are Terrys transcribed comments to the Plenary and the official panel recommendation The government responses were as follows Stuart Harbinson Permanent Rep of Hong Kong to the WTO and Chairman of the WTO Council on Trade in Services Any guidelines on energy services must be general in nature Industry must move thoroughly make the case to its respective governments to raise energy services as a priority Govt of Hong Kong will focus on Energy Services Joseph Papovich Assistant USTR Services Investment Intellectual Property Energy Services are now in need of further analytical work supported by the private sector Energy Services are similar to telecommunication and could be negotiated accordingly Note of caution attempts to liberalize energy services will be derailed if countries often developing countries view this as a mandate for govts to privatize energy assets Instead it should encourage open and transparent regulatory processes when privatization occurs US supports including energy services in the services round Katsuhiro Nakagawa Special Advisor Ministry of Intl Trade and Industry Japan Japan is currently deregulating its energy sector A primitive debate needs to occur on defining electricity as good vs service Resource limitations and environmental aspects will be important to Japanese negotiation In summary I believe we made significant movement on mobilizing global allies in our efforts Numerous colleagues commented on how impressed they were in our raising energy services to such a level of interest in such a short time and many acknowledged Joe Hillings outstanding leadership of the ESC Thanks to all for making the World Services Congress a success Please contact me with any questions or concerns

Coalition booth was a great opportunity to spread the word on the goals of ESC We manned the booth during the Global Marketplace the name of the exhibition We distributed hundreds of the onepager on energy services as well as the bound ESC briefing book In the time I was at the booth there was a significant interest in the ESC Thanks to Marc Eichman for dedicating significant time to managing the booth and to the Enron graphics department for the outstanding display Below find a photo of our display II Energy Services Panel How the Energy Services Industry Can Use Trade Negotiating to Secure and Expand Markets Chair Terry Thorn Senior VP Enron Panelists John Easton VP Intl Programs Edison Electric Institute Ian Miller President EDS Global Energy Business Tim Richards Sr Manager Intl Govt Affairs GE Rachel Thompson Administrator Trade Directorate OECD Attendance at the panel was impressive with over academic government officials from the US Norway Portugal Costa Rica Holland and Israel and private sector participants in fact we had to keep adding more chairs Terry Thorn began the panel with a history of energy services and the future of the industry in a liberalized market Tim Richards provided a summary of GEs view of energy services outlined the current WTO commitments related to energy services and discussed the issues of defining energy services identifying barriers and setting a negotiating approach John Easton outlined the debate on classification of energy services goods vs services Ian Miller followed on the classification issue and applied it to the EU especially the German and French liberalization experience Rachel Thompson outlined her paper on trade in environmental services Rachel went on to describe her lead in the OECD work program on trade in environmental services with its focus on a winwin approach to trade and environment this is similar the winwinwin approach USTR has adopted The OECD work program on environmental services could easily be adopted for energy services A lively discussion ensued on the following the link between environmental and energy services the NAFTA negative list negotiating strategies challenges of definition and classification and ecommerce effect on energy services Terry suggested that interested persons attending the panel provide him contact information so we can create a global network on energy services We can do this independently or through the CSI Global Services Network which is an informal private sectorled online community dedicated to liberalization of services we can start a sector specific network Thanks to all the panelists for your time and talent in making the panel such a success Please see Terrys and Tims panel presentations attached below WSC Plenary On Tuesday morning all the sector specific panelists chairs presented the panel recommendation to the WSC Plenary Each chair was given minutes to present its recommendation and Govt representatives then responded The recommendations will be collected and presented to the trade ministers in advance of Seattle In addition to energy services recommendations were delivered on ecommerce banking insurance entertainment transportation China accounting legal services and express delivery Terry Thorn delivered the ESC recommendation Attached below are Terrys transcribed comments to the Plenary and the official panel recommendation The government responses were as follows Stuart Harbinson Permanent Rep of Hong Kong to the WTO and Chairman of the WTO Council on Trade in Services Any guidelines on energy services must be general in nature Industry must move thoroughly make the case to its respective governments to raise energy services as a priority Govt of Hong Kong will focus on Energy Services Joseph Papovich Assistant USTR Services Investment Intellectual Property Energy Services are now in need of further analytical work supported by the private sector Energy Services are similar to telecommunication and could be negotiated accordingly Note of caution attempts to liberalize energy services will be derailed if countries often developing countries view this as a mandate for govts to privatize energy assets Instead it should encourage open and transparent regulatory processes when privatization occurs US supports including energy services in the services round Katsuhiro Nakagawa Special Advisor Ministry of Intl Trade and Industry Japan Japan is currently deregulating its energy sector A primitive debate needs to occur on defining electricity as good vs service Resource limitations and environmental aspects will be important to Japanese negotiation In summary I believe we made significant movement on mobilizing global allies in our efforts Numerous colleagues commented on how impressed they were in our raising energy services to such a level of interest in such a short time and many acknowledged Joe Hillings outstanding leadership of the ESC

Coalition booth was a great opportunity to spread the word on the goals of ESC We manned the booth during the Global Marketplace the name of the exhibition We distributed hundreds of the onepager on energy services as well as the bound ESC briefing book In the time I was at the booth there was a significant interest in the ESC Thanks to Marc Eichman for dedicating significant time to managing the booth and to the Enron graphics department for the outstanding display Below find a photo of our display II Energy Services Panel How the Energy Services Industry Can Use Trade Negotiating to Secure and Expand Markets Chair Terry Thorn Senior VP Enron Panelists John Easton VP Intl Programs Edison Electric Institute Ian Miller President EDS Global Energy Business Tim Richards Sr Manager Intl Govt Affairs GE Rachel Thompson Administrator Trade Directorate OECD Attendance at the panel was impressive with over academic government officials from the US Norway Portugal Costa Rica Holland and Israel and private sector participants in fact we had to keep adding more chairs Terry Thorn began the panel with a history of energy services and the future of the industry in a liberalized market Tim Richards provided a summary of GEs view of energy services outlined the current WTO commitments related to energy services and discussed the issues of defining energy services identifying barriers and setting a negotiating approach John Easton outlined the debate on classification of energy services goods vs services Ian Miller followed on the classification issue and applied it to the EU especially the German and French liberalization experience Rachel Thompson outlined her paper on trade in environmental services Rachel went on to describe her lead in the OECD work program on trade in environmental services with its focus on a winwin approach to trade and environment this is similar the winwinwin approach USTR has adopted The OECD work program on environmental services could easily be adopted for energy services A lively discussion ensued on the following the link between environmental and energy services the NAFTA negative list negotiating strategies challenges of definition and classification and ecommerce effect on energy services Terry suggested that interested persons attending the panel provide him contact information so we can create a global network on energy services We can do this independently or through the CSI Global Services Network which is an informal private sectorled online community dedicated to liberalization of services we can start a sector specific network Thanks to all the panelists for your time and talent in making the panel such a success Please see Terrys and Tims panel presentations attached below WSC Plenary On Tuesday morning all the sector specific panelists chairs presented the panel recommendation to the WSC Plenary Each chair was given minutes to present its recommendation and Govt representatives then responded The recommendations will be collected and presented to the trade ministers in advance of Seattle In addition to energy services recommendations were delivered on ecommerce banking insurance entertainment transportation China accounting legal services and express delivery Terry Thorn delivered the ESC recommendation Attached below are Terrys transcribed comments to the Plenary and the official panel recommendation The government responses were as follows Stuart Harbinson Permanent Rep of Hong Kong to the WTO and Chairman of the WTO Council on Trade in Services Any guidelines on energy services must be general in nature Industry must move thoroughly make the case to its respective governments to raise energy services as a priority Govt of Hong Kong will focus on Energy Services Joseph Papovich Assistant USTR Services Investment Intellectual Property Energy Services are now in need of further analytical work supported by the private sector Energy Services are similar to telecommunication and could be negotiated accordingly Note of caution attempts to liberalize energy services will be derailed if countries often developing countries view this as a mandate for govts to privatize energy assets Instead it should encourage open and transparent regulatory processes when privatization occurs US supports including energy services in the services round Katsuhiro Nakagawa Special Advisor Ministry of Intl Trade and Industry Japan Japan is currently deregulating its energy sector A primitive debate needs to occur on defining electricity as good vs service Resource limitations and environmental aspects will be important to Japanese negotiation In summary I believe we made significant movement on mobilizing global allies in our efforts Numerous colleagues commented on how impressed they were in our raising energy services to such a level of interest in such a short time and many acknowledged Joe Hillings outstanding leadership of the ESC

Coalition booth was a great opportunity to spread the word on the goals of ESC We manned the booth during the Global Marketplace the name of the exhibition We distributed hundreds of the onepager on energy services as well as the bound ESC briefing book In the time I was at the booth there was a significant interest in the ESC Thanks to Marc Eichman for dedicating significant time to managing the booth and to the Enron graphics department for the outstanding display Below find a photo of our display II Energy Services Panel How the Energy Services Industry Can Use Trade Negotiating to Secure and Expand Markets Chair Terry Thorn Senior VP Enron Panelists John Easton VP Intl Programs Edison Electric Institute Ian Miller President EDS Global Energy Business Tim Richards Sr Manager Intl Govt Affairs GE Rachel Thompson Administrator Trade Directorate OECD Attendance at the panel was impressive with over academic government officials from the US Norway Portugal Costa Rica Holland and Israel and private sector participants in fact we had to keep adding more chairs Terry Thorn began the panel with a history of energy services and the future of the industry in a liberalized market Tim Richards provided a summary of GEs view of energy services outlined the current WTO commitments related to energy services and discussed the issues of defining energy services identifying barriers and setting a negotiating approach John Easton outlined the debate on classification of energy services goods vs services Ian Miller followed on the classification issue and applied it to the EU especially the German and French liberalization experience Rachel Thompson outlined her paper on trade in environmental services Rachel went on to describe her lead in the OECD work program on trade in environmental services with its focus on a winwin approach to trade and environment this is similar the winwinwin approach USTR has adopted The OECD work program on environmental services could easily be adopted for energy services A lively discussion ensued on the following the link between environmental and energy services the NAFTA negative list negotiating strategies challenges of definition and classification and ecommerce effect on energy services Terry suggested that interested persons attending the panel provide him contact information so we can create a global network on energy services We can do this independently or through the CSI Global Services Network which is an informal private sectorled online community dedicated to liberalization of services we can start a sector specific network Thanks to all the panelists for your time and talent in making the panel such a success Please see Terrys and Tims panel presentations attached below WSC Plenary On Tuesday morning all the sector specific panelists chairs presented the panel recommendation to the WSC Plenary Each chair was given minutes to present its recommendation and Govt representatives then responded The recommendations will be collected and presented to the trade ministers in advance of Seattle In addition to energy services recommendations were delivered on ecommerce banking insurance entertainment transportation China accounting legal services and express delivery Terry Thorn delivered the ESC recommendation Attached below are Terrys transcribed comments to the Plenary and the official panel recommendation The government responses were as follows Stuart Harbinson Permanent Rep of Hong Kong to the WTO and Chairman of the WTO Council on Trade in Services Any guidelines on energy services must be general in nature Industry must move thoroughly make the case to its respective governments to raise energy services as a priority Govt of Hong Kong will focus on Energy Services Joseph Papovich Assistant USTR Services Investment Intellectual Property Energy Services are now in need of further analytical work supported by the private sector Energy Services are similar to telecommunication and could be negotiated accordingly Note of caution attempts to liberalize energy services will be derailed if countries often developing countries view this as a mandate for govts to privatize energy assets Instead it should encourage open and transparent regulatory processes when privatization occurs US supports including energy services in the services round Katsuhiro Nakagawa Special Advisor Ministry of Intl Trade and Industry Japan Japan is currently deregulating its energy sector A primitive debate needs to occur on defining electricity as good vs service Resource limitations and environmental aspects will be important to Japanese negotiation In summary I believe we made significant movement on mobilizing global allies in our efforts Numerous colleagues commented on how impressed they were in our raising energy services to such a level of interest in such a short time and many acknowledged Joe Hillings outstanding leadership of the ESC Thanks to all for making the World Services Congress a success Please contact me with any questions or concerns

Coalition booth was a great opportunity to spread the word on the goals of ESC We manned the booth during the Global Marketplace the name of the exhibition We distributed hundreds of the onepager on energy services as well as the bound ESC briefing book In the time I was at the booth there was a significant interest in the ESC Thanks to Marc Eichman for dedicating significant time to managing the booth and to the Enron graphics department for the outstanding display Below find a photo of our display II Energy Services Panel How the Energy Services Industry Can Use Trade Negotiating to Secure and Expand Markets Chair Terry Thorn Senior VP Enron Panelists John Easton VP Intl Programs Edison Electric Institute Ian Miller President EDS Global Energy Business Tim Richards Sr Manager Intl Govt Affairs GE Rachel Thompson Administrator Trade Directorate OECD Attendance at the panel was impressive with over academic government officials from the US Norway Portugal Costa Rica Holland and Israel and private sector participants in fact we had to keep adding more chairs Terry Thorn began the panel with a history of energy services and the future of the industry in a liberalized market Tim Richards provided a summary of GEs view of energy services outlined the current WTO commitments related to energy services and discussed the issues of defining energy services identifying barriers and setting a negotiating approach John Easton outlined the debate on classification of energy services goods vs services Ian Miller followed on the classification issue and applied it to the EU especially the German and French liberalization experience Rachel Thompson outlined her paper on trade in environmental services Rachel went on to describe her lead in the OECD work program on trade in environmental services with its focus on a winwin approach to trade and environment this is similar the winwinwin approach USTR has adopted The OECD work program on environmental services could easily be adopted for energy services A lively discussion ensued on the following the link between environmental and energy services the NAFTA negative list negotiating strategies challenges of definition and classification and ecommerce effect on energy services Terry suggested that interested persons attending the panel provide him contact information so we can create a global network on energy services We can do this independently or through the CSI Global Services Network which is an informal private sectorled online community dedicated to liberalization of services we can start a sector specific network Thanks to all the panelists for your time and talent in making the panel such a success Please see Terrys and Tims panel presentations attached below WSC Plenary On Tuesday morning all the sector specific panelists chairs presented the panel recommendation to the WSC Plenary Each chair was given minutes to present its recommendation and Govt representatives then responded The recommendations will be collected and presented to the trade ministers in advance of Seattle In addition to energy services recommendations were delivered on ecommerce banking insurance entertainment transportation China accounting legal services and express delivery Terry Thorn delivered the ESC recommendation Attached below are Terrys transcribed comments to the Plenary and the official panel recommendation The government responses were as follows Stuart Harbinson Permanent Rep of Hong Kong to the WTO and Chairman of the WTO Council on Trade in Services Any guidelines on energy services must be general in nature Industry must move thoroughly make the case to its respective governments to raise energy services as a priority Govt of Hong Kong will focus on Energy Services Joseph Papovich Assistant USTR Services Investment Intellectual Property Energy Services are now in need of further analytical work supported by the private sector Energy Services are similar to telecommunication and could be negotiated accordingly Note of caution attempts to liberalize energy services will be derailed if countries often developing countries view this as a mandate for govts to privatize energy assets Instead it should encourage open and transparent regulatory processes when privatization occurs US supports including energy services in the services round Katsuhiro Nakagawa Special Advisor Ministry of Intl Trade and Industry Japan Japan is currently deregulating its energy sector A primitive debate needs to occur on defining electricity as good vs service Resource limitations and environmental aspects will be important to Japanese negotiation In summary I believe we made significant movement on mobilizing global allies in our efforts Numerous colleagues commented on how impressed they were in our raising energy services to such a level of interest in such a short time and many acknowledged Joe Hillings outstanding leadership of the ESC

October PM To Walia Amit Cc Robertson Linda Decker Larry Subject RE Wind Production Tax Credit PTC Amit The House just passed its version of the stimulus package which included a twoyear extension of the PTC The Senate will likely act next week Senate Finance Chair Baucus floated a plan yesterday which included a oneyear extension The bill will go to conference committee and will undergo significant changes Both Chairman Thomas and Finance Ranking Member Grassley are strong supporters of a longer extension so two years is very possible We are continuing our efforts in support of a multiyear extension we dont like to limit it to two years Again I wish I could tell you with more certainty the final outcome The PTC is a piece in a much larger debate Please feel free to contact me

terms of the length of extension or years thanks Amit Original Message From Long Chris Sent Wednesday September PM To Walia Amit Cc Metts Mark Decker Larry Robertson Linda Subject RE Wind Production Tax Credit PTC Amit Recent events have had a dramatic impact on the Congressional agenda Congress is in discussion with the Administration on the need for an economic stimulus package Congressional leaders are saying that they will wait a week or so before deciding on how to proceed The package would likely be in the billion range and include tax law changes incentives to invesment trade promotion measures and job training PTC extension and the other expiring tax provisions could very likely be attached to the stimulus package If it is not or a stimulus package does not materialize we have been assured Congress would consider a stand alone extenders package All that said we are fairley certain that the PTC should be extended before Congress adjourns The target date for Congressional adjournment in October however this is could change This can and will change given the national security situation so please feel free to get back with me anytime Original Message From Walia Amit Sent Wednesday September AM To Long Chris Cc Metts Mark Decker Larry Robertson Linda Subject RE Wind Production Tax Credit PTC Chris In light of recent events and Congress preoccupation with other issues what is the likely impact on the timing and likelihood of PTC extension Thanks Amit Original Message From Long Chris Sent Wednesday August AM To Walia Amit Cc Metts Mark Decker Larry Robertson Linda Subject RE Wind Production Tax Credit PTC Amit Congress is on recess until September and will not adjourn in October as planned We expect Congress to be in session until late November or even into December The PTC extension was passed out of the House in its energy package it was part of the tax title The Senate Committee is expected to consider its version of the energy in September into October We expect the PTC to pass in the Senate as well Now to the timing it is unclear if the energy package with the PTC extensionwill move before Congress adjourns for the year If it does not then Congress can pass what it calls an extenders package which would extend all tax credits that are set to expire at the end of the year If that were to not happen then Congress could send notice to the Administration that it plans to pass the PTC and other extenders early next year and make it retroactive until December Any of theses scenarios is possible While nothing is when you deal with Congress I think it highly likely the PTC will be extended either this year or retroactively next The question then becomes for how long The House bill extends it for five years and we are pushing for longer in the Senate I do not think a permanent extension is possible given the revenue numbers Let me know if you need additional information Original Message From Walia Amit Sent

Original Message From Long Chris Sent Monday July AM To Metts Mark Cc Kean Steven Robertson Linda Decker Larry Fisher Dolores Subject Wind Production Tax Credit PTC Mark I left a voice mail on your cell The Wind Production Tax Credit expires on December The PTC will be extended There is significant bipartisan support for the PTC the revenue number is reasonable and renewables are a key component of the energy debate The question is when and how Two likely scenarios are As part of the Energy Bill The House Ways and Means Committee will markup the tax portions of the energy bill in midJuly We understand that Chairman Thomas is committed to including the PTC as part of the Ways and Means bill The Senate Finance Committee has not scheduled a markup While the energy bill will be debated during July final action will likely not occur until after the August recess In this scenario look to September at the earliest There are provisions including the PTC in the IRC that expire by December Historically Congress approves an extenders package late in the session to keep the tax credits functioning While no one can predict when Congress will adjourn they are set to adjourn in early October In this scenario the PTC would be extended in late September at the earliest Mark this is Congress so anything can change Call me with any questions at

Coalition booth was a great opportunity to spread the word on the goals of ESC We manned the booth during the Global Marketplace the name of the exhibition We distributed hundreds of the onepager on energy services as well as the bound ESC briefing book In the time I was at the booth there was a significant interest in the ESC Thanks to Marc Eichman for dedicating significant time to managing the booth and to the Enron graphics department for the outstanding display Below find a photo of our display II Energy Services Panel How the Energy Services Industry Can Use Trade Negotiating to Secure and Expand Markets Chair Terry Thorn Senior VP Enron Panelists John Easton VP Intl Programs Edison Electric Institute Ian Miller President EDS Global Energy Business Tim Richards Sr Manager Intl Govt Affairs GE Rachel Thompson Administrator Trade Directorate OECD Attendance at the panel was impressive with over academic government officials from the US Norway Portugal Costa Rica Holland and Israel and private sector participants in fact we had to keep adding more chairs Terry Thorn began the panel with a history of energy services and the future of the industry in a liberalized market Tim Richards provided a summary of GEs view of energy services outlined the current WTO commitments related to energy services and discussed the issues of defining energy services identifying barriers and setting a negotiating approach John Easton outlined the debate on classification of energy services goods vs services Ian Miller followed on the classification issue and applied it to the EU especially the German and French liberalization experience Rachel Thompson outlined her paper on trade in environmental services Rachel went on to describe her lead in the OECD work program on trade in environmental services with its focus on a winwin approach to trade and environment this is similar the winwinwin approach USTR has adopted The OECD work program on environmental services could easily be adopted for energy services A lively discussion ensued on the following the link between environmental and energy services the NAFTA negative list negotiating strategies challenges of definition and classification and ecommerce effect on energy services Terry suggested that interested persons attending the panel provide him contact information so we can create a global network on energy services We can do this independently or through the CSI Global Services Network which is an informal private sectorled online community dedicated to liberalization of services we can start a sector specific network Thanks to all the panelists for your time and talent in making the panel such a success Please see Terrys and Tims panel presentations attached below WSC Plenary On Tuesday morning all the sector specific panelists chairs presented the panel recommendation to the WSC Plenary Each chair was given minutes to present its recommendation and Govt representatives then responded The recommendations will be collected and presented to the trade ministers in advance of Seattle In addition to energy services recommendations were delivered on ecommerce banking insurance entertainment transportation China accounting legal services and express delivery Terry Thorn delivered the ESC recommendation Attached below are Terrys transcribed comments to the Plenary and the official panel recommendation The government responses were as follows Stuart Harbinson Permanent Rep of Hong Kong to the WTO and Chairman of the WTO Council on Trade in Services Any guidelines on energy services must be general in nature Industry must move thoroughly make the case to its respective governments to raise energy services as a priority Govt of Hong Kong will focus on Energy Services Joseph Papovich Assistant USTR Services Investment Intellectual Property Energy Services are now in need of further analytical work supported by the private sector Energy Services are similar to telecommunication and could be negotiated accordingly Note of caution attempts to liberalize energy services will be derailed if countries often developing countries view this as a mandate for govts to privatize energy assets Instead it should encourage open and transparent regulatory processes when privatization occurs US supports including energy services in the services round Katsuhiro Nakagawa Special Advisor Ministry of Intl Trade and Industry Japan Japan is currently deregulating its energy sector A primitive debate needs to occur on defining electricity as good vs service Resource limitations and environmental aspects will be important to Japanese negotiation In summary I believe we made significant movement on mobilizing global allies in our efforts Numerous colleagues commented on how impressed they were in our raising energy services to such a level of interest in such a short time and many acknowledged Joe Hillings outstanding leadership of the ESC

synthetic fuels produced from coal qualify for a tax credit under tax code Section Following is additional information from BNA Section provides a credit for the production and sale of qualified fuels produced from a nonconventional source IRS said including liquid gaseous or solid synthetic fuels produced from coal or lignite In Rev Proc DTR G L IRS stopped issuing rulings under Section because it said it was concerned that taxpayers claiming the credit were not processing the coal in the manner intended by Congress IRS asked for information on the processes used to produce solid fuel for which taxpayers claimed the credit It received numerous comment letters many urging it to resume issuing rulings others agreeing that some processes should not qualify for the credit In Rev Proc IRS said it will issue a ruling on processes it had approved prior to The production process must meet the following requirements IRS said substantially all of the coal used as feedstock must undergo a significant chemical change the feedstock coal must consist entirely of coal fines or crushed coal comprised of particles no larger than inch the feedstock coal must be thoroughly mixed a with styrene or other monomers following an acid bath b with quinoline or other organic resin and left to cure for several days c with ultra heavy hydrocarbons or d with an aluminum andor magnesium silicate binder after being heated to a minimum temperature of degrees Fahrenheit and the treatment method must involve elevated temperature and pressure that results in briquettes pellets or an extruded fuel product or the taxpayer may represent that the omission of these procedures will not significantly increase the production output of the facility The revenue procedure applies to both pending and future ruling requests Rev Proc will be published in Internal Revenue Bulletin dated May See text below No Monday April Page L ISSN X Tax Budget Accounting Text EnergyIRS Revenue Procedure Announcing Decision to Issue Letter Rulings On Whether Solid Fuel Produced From Coal Qualifies Under IRC Section Rev Proc is scheduled to appear in Internal Revenue Bulletin dated May Part III Administrative Procedural and Miscellaneous CFR Rulings and determination letters Also Part I o Rev Proc SECTION PURPOSE This revenue procedure informs the public of the Internal Revenue Services decision to issue private letter rulings regarding whether a solid fuel produced from coal is a qualified fuel under ocC of the Internal Revenue Code under the circumstances described in section of this revenue procedure SECTION BACKGROUND Section of Rev Proc IRB provides that whenever appropriate in the interest of sound tax administration it is the policy of the Service to answer inquiries of individuals and organizations regarding their status for tax purposes and the tax effects of their acts or transactions prior to the filing of returns or reports that are required by the revenue laws There are however certain areas in which because of the inherently factual nature of the problems involved or for other reasons the Service will not issue rulings or determinations letters Section of Rev Proc sets forth those areas in which rulings or determination letters will not ordinarily be issued Not ordinarily means that unique and compelling reasons must be demonstrated to justify the issuance of a ruling or determination letter Section of Rev Proc Section of Rev Proc provides that the Service will not ordinarily issue rulings or determination letters regarding any matter in which the determination requested is primarily one of fact for example market value of property or whether an interest in a corporation is to be treated as stock or indebtedness Section of Rev Proc sets forth those areas under extensive study in which rulings or determination letters will not be issued until the Service resolves the issue through publication of a revenue ruling revenue procedure regulations or otherwise Section of Rev Proc provides that the Service will not issue rulings or determination letters on whether a solid fuel other than coke or a fuel produced from waste coal is a qualified fuel under ocC Waste coal for this purpose is limited to waste coal fines from normal mining and crushing operations and does not include fines produced for example by crushing runofmine coal for the purpose of claiming the credit Section of Rev Proc supersedes Rev Proc IRB Rev Proc was published because concern had been raised that taxpayers were claiming the o credit for processing coal in ways that may not have been intended by the Congress Rev Proc requested comments concerning the standard to be applied in determining whether fuel produced from coal is a solid synthetic fuel The Service received extensive comments Section provides a credit against income tax for the production and sale of qualified fuels produced from a nonconventional source Section cC provides that qualified fuels include liquid gaseous or solid synthetic fuels produced from coal including lignite Rev Rul CB adopts for purposes of ocC the definition of synthetic fuel in o c of the Income Tax Regulations Section cii provides that to be synthetic a fuel must differ significantly in chemical composition as opposed to physical composition from the substance used to produce it Rev Rul describes favorably processes such as gasification liquefaction and production of solvent refined coal that result in substantial chemical changes to the entire coal feedstock rather than changes that affect only the surface of the coal Section f provides that o applies to qualified fuels that are produced in a facility placed in service after December and before January and that are sold before January Section gA provides that a facility for producing qualified fuels described in oc C is treated for this purpose as being placed in service before January if the facility is placed in service before July pursuant to a binding written contract in effect before January For a facility that meets this condition and is originally placed in service after December ogB provides that the o credit applies to qualified fuels that are sold before January Property is placed in service in the taxable year the property is placed in a condition or state of readiness and availability for a specifically assigned function See for example o aei Thus the o credit is not allowed for fuel produced in a facility that was originally placed in service for a function other than producing qualified fuel under ocC and was not converted into a facility for producing qualified fuel until after June The Service interprets of and g to allow the o credit for qualified fuel produced in a facility after its modification only if the modification was placed in service before July or does not significantly increase the production capacity of the facility or significantly extend the life of the facility For example a facility including one of multiple facilities located at the same site may be relocated without affecting the availability of the credit if all essential components of the facility are retained and the production capacity of the relocated facility is not significantly increased at the new location If however the essential components of a single facility are combined after June with other components that were not part of the facility on June to create multiple facilities or significantly increase production capacity the credit will not be allowed for fuel produced at any of those facilities After reviewing the comments received in response to Rev Proc and reconsidering its interpretation of ocC the Service has decided that the significant chemical change standard of Rev Rul is the correct standard The Service has also decided to resume the issuance of rulings under ocC but only in the circumstances described below The Service is willing to issue rulings that do not go beyond the processes approved in the rulings issued prior to One procedure common to all of those processes other than processes for the production of coke and similar products is the use of elevated temperature and pressure to produce briquettes pellets or an extruded fuel product The Service is also willing to rule with respect to a process that omits this procedure if the process is otherwise consistent with a process approved in a pre ruling and the omission of the procedure will not significantly increase the production output of the facility Accordingly the Service will issue rulings regarding whether a solid fuel other than coke is a qualified fuel under ocC under the circumstances described in section of this revenue procedure SECTION PROCEDURE The Service will issue rulings that a solid fuel other than coke produced from coal is a qualified fuel under ocC if the conditions set forth below are satisfied and evidence is presented that all or substantially all of the coal used as feedstock undergoes a significant chemical change The conditions are that The feedstock coal consists entirely of coal fines or crushed coal comprised of particles no larger than inch The feedstock coal is thoroughly mixed in a mixer a with styrene or other monomers following an acid bath b with quinoline CHN or other organic resin and left to cure for several days c with ultra heavy hydrocarbons or d with an aluminum andor magnesium silicate binder following heating to a minimum temperature of degrees Fahrenheit and The treated feedstock is subjected to elevated temperature and pressure that results in briquettes pellets or an extruded fuel product or the taxpayer represents that the omission of this procedure will not significantly increase the production output of the facility over the remainder of the period during which the o credit is allowable SECTION EFFECTIVE DATE This revenue procedure applies to all ruling requests including any pending in the national office and any submitted after the date of publication of this revenue procedure SECTION EFFECT ON OTHER DOCUMENTS Section of Rev Proc is revoked DRAFTING INFORMATION The principal author of this revenue procedure is David McDonnell of the Office of Associate Chief Counsel Passthroughs and Special Industries Other personnel from the IRS and Treasury

produced from a nonconventional source IRS said including liquid gaseous or solid synthetic fuels produced from coal or lignite In Rev Proc DTR G L IRS stopped issuing rulings under Section because it said it was concerned that taxpayers claiming the credit were not processing the coal in the manner intended by Congress IRS asked for information on the processes used to produce solid fuel for which taxpayers claimed the credit It received numerous comment letters many urging it to resume issuing rulings others agreeing that some processes should not qualify for the credit In Rev Proc IRS said it will issue a ruling on processes it had approved prior to The production process must meet the following requirements IRS said substantially all of the coal used as feedstock must undergo a significant chemical change the feedstock coal must consist entirely of coal fines or crushed coal comprised of particles no larger than inch the feedstock coal must be thoroughly mixed a with styrene or other monomers following an acid bath b with quinoline or other organic resin and left to cure for several days c with ultra heavy hydrocarbons or d with an aluminum andor magnesium silicate binder after being heated to a minimum temperature of degrees Fahrenheit and the treatment method must involve elevated temperature and pressure that results in briquettes pellets or an extruded fuel product or the taxpayer may represent that the omission of these procedures will not significantly increase the production output of the facility The revenue procedure applies to both pending and future ruling requests Rev Proc will be published in Internal Revenue Bulletin dated May See text below No Monday April Page L ISSN X Tax Budget Accounting Text EnergyIRS Revenue Procedure Announcing Decision to Issue Letter Rulings On Whether Solid Fuel Produced From Coal Qualifies Under IRC Section Rev Proc is scheduled to appear in Internal Revenue Bulletin dated May Part III Administrative Procedural and Miscellaneous CFR Rulings and determination letters Also Part I o Rev Proc SECTION PURPOSE This revenue procedure informs the public of the Internal Revenue Services decision to issue private letter rulings regarding whether a solid fuel produced from coal is a qualified fuel under ocC of the Internal Revenue Code under the circumstances described in section of this revenue procedure SECTION BACKGROUND Section of Rev Proc IRB provides that whenever appropriate in the interest of sound tax administration it is the policy of the Service to answer inquiries of individuals and organizations regarding their status for tax purposes and the tax effects of their acts or transactions prior to the filing of returns or reports that are required by the revenue laws There are however certain areas in which because of the inherently factual nature of the problems involved or for other reasons the Service will not issue rulings or determinations letters Section of Rev Proc sets forth those areas in which rulings or determination letters will not ordinarily be issued Not ordinarily means that unique and compelling reasons must be demonstrated to justify the issuance of a ruling or determination letter Section of Rev Proc Section of Rev Proc provides that the Service will not ordinarily issue rulings or determination letters regarding any matter in which the determination requested is primarily one of fact for example market value of property or whether an interest in a corporation is to be treated as stock or indebtedness Section of Rev Proc sets forth those areas under extensive study in which rulings or determination letters will not be issued until the Service resolves the issue through publication of a revenue ruling revenue procedure regulations or otherwise Section of Rev Proc provides that the Service will not issue rulings or determination letters on whether a solid fuel other than coke or a fuel produced from waste coal is a qualified fuel under ocC Waste coal for this purpose is limited to waste coal fines from normal mining and crushing operations and does not include fines produced for example by crushing runofmine coal for the purpose of claiming the credit Section of Rev Proc supersedes Rev Proc IRB Rev Proc was published because concern had been raised that taxpayers were claiming the o credit for processing coal in ways that may not have been intended by the Congress Rev Proc requested comments concerning the standard to be applied in determining whether fuel produced from coal is a solid synthetic fuel The Service received extensive comments Section provides a credit against income tax for the production and sale of qualified fuels produced from a nonconventional source Section cC provides that qualified fuels include liquid gaseous or solid synthetic fuels produced from coal including lignite Rev Rul CB adopts for purposes of ocC the definition of synthetic fuel in o c of the Income Tax Regulations Section cii provides that to be synthetic a fuel must differ significantly in chemical composition as opposed to physical composition from the substance used to produce it Rev Rul describes favorably processes such as gasification liquefaction and production of solvent refined coal that result in substantial chemical changes to the entire coal feedstock rather than changes that affect only the surface of the coal Section f provides that o applies to qualified fuels that are produced in a facility placed in service after December and before January and that are sold before January Section gA provides that a facility for producing qualified fuels described in oc C is treated for this purpose as being placed in service before January if the facility is placed in service before July pursuant to a binding written contract in effect before January For a facility that meets this condition and is originally placed in service after December ogB provides that the o credit applies to qualified fuels that are sold before January Property is placed in service in the taxable year the property is placed in a condition or state of readiness and availability for a specifically assigned function See for example o aei Thus the o credit is not allowed for fuel produced in a facility that was originally placed in service for a function other than producing qualified fuel under ocC and was not converted into a facility for producing qualified fuel until after June The Service interprets of and g to allow the o credit for qualified fuel produced in a facility after its modification only if the modification was placed in service before July or does not significantly increase the production capacity of the facility or significantly extend the life of the facility For example a facility including one of multiple facilities located at the same site may be relocated without affecting the availability of the credit if all essential components of the facility are retained and the production capacity of the relocated facility is not significantly increased at the new location If however the essential components of a single facility are combined after June with other components that were not part of the facility on June to create multiple facilities or significantly increase production capacity the credit will not be allowed for fuel produced at any of those facilities After reviewing the comments received in response to Rev Proc and reconsidering its interpretation of ocC the Service has decided that the significant chemical change standard of Rev Rul is the correct standard The Service has also decided to resume the issuance of rulings under ocC but only in the circumstances described below The Service is willing to issue rulings that do not go beyond the processes approved in the rulings issued prior to One procedure common to all of those processes other than processes for the production of coke and similar products is the use of elevated temperature and pressure to produce briquettes pellets or an extruded fuel product The Service is also willing to rule with respect to a process that omits this procedure if the process is otherwise consistent with a process approved in a pre ruling and the omission of the procedure will not significantly increase the production output of the facility Accordingly the Service will issue rulings regarding whether a solid fuel other than coke is a qualified fuel under ocC under the circumstances described in section of this revenue procedure SECTION PROCEDURE The Service will issue rulings that a solid fuel other than coke produced from coal is a qualified fuel under ocC if the conditions set forth below are satisfied and evidence is presented that all or substantially all of the coal used as feedstock undergoes a significant chemical change The conditions are that The feedstock coal consists entirely of coal fines or crushed coal comprised of particles no larger than inch The feedstock coal is thoroughly mixed in a mixer a with styrene or other monomers following an acid bath b with quinoline CHN or other organic resin and left to cure for several days c with ultra heavy hydrocarbons or d with an aluminum andor magnesium silicate binder following heating to a minimum temperature of degrees Fahrenheit and The treated feedstock is subjected to elevated temperature and pressure that results in briquettes pellets or an extruded fuel product or the taxpayer represents that the omission of this procedure will not significantly increase the production output of the facility over the remainder of the period during which the o credit is allowable SECTION EFFECTIVE DATE This revenue procedure applies to all ruling requests including any pending in the national office and any submitted after the date of publication of this revenue procedure SECTION EFFECT ON OTHER DOCUMENTS Section of Rev Proc is revoked DRAFTING

synthetic fuels produced from coal qualify for a tax credit under tax code Section Following is additional information from BNA Section provides a credit for the production and sale of qualified fuels produced from a nonconventional source IRS said including liquid gaseous or solid synthetic fuels produced from coal or lignite In Rev Proc DTR G L IRS stopped issuing rulings under Section because it said it was concerned that taxpayers claiming the credit were not processing the coal in the manner intended by Congress IRS asked for information on the processes used to produce solid fuel for which taxpayers claimed the credit It received numerous comment letters many urging it to resume issuing rulings others agreeing that some processes should not qualify for the credit In Rev Proc IRS said it will issue a ruling on processes it had approved prior to The production process must meet the following requirements IRS said substantially all of the coal used as feedstock must undergo a significant chemical change the feedstock coal must consist entirely of coal fines or crushed coal comprised of particles no larger than inch the feedstock coal must be thoroughly mixed a with styrene or other monomers following an acid bath b with quinoline or other organic resin and left to cure for several days c with ultra heavy hydrocarbons or d with an aluminum andor magnesium silicate binder after being heated to a minimum temperature of degrees Fahrenheit and the treatment method must involve elevated temperature and pressure that results in briquettes pellets or an extruded fuel product or the taxpayer may represent that the omission of these procedures will not significantly increase the production output of the facility The revenue procedure applies to both pending and future ruling requests Rev Proc will be published in Internal Revenue Bulletin dated May See text below No Monday April Page L ISSN X Tax Budget Accounting Text EnergyIRS Revenue Procedure Announcing Decision to Issue Letter Rulings On Whether Solid Fuel Produced From Coal Qualifies Under IRC Section Rev Proc is scheduled to appear in Internal Revenue Bulletin dated May Part III Administrative Procedural and Miscellaneous CFR Rulings and determination letters Also Part I o Rev Proc SECTION PURPOSE This revenue procedure informs the public of the Internal Revenue Services decision to issue private letter rulings regarding whether a solid fuel produced from coal is a qualified fuel under ocC of the Internal Revenue Code under the circumstances described in section of this revenue procedure SECTION BACKGROUND Section of Rev Proc IRB provides that whenever appropriate in the interest of sound tax administration it is the policy of the Service to answer inquiries of individuals and organizations regarding their status for tax purposes and the tax effects of their acts or transactions prior to the filing of returns or reports that are required by the revenue laws There are however certain areas in which because of the inherently factual nature of the problems involved or for other reasons the Service will not issue rulings or determinations letters Section of Rev Proc sets forth those areas in which rulings or determination letters will not ordinarily be issued Not ordinarily means that unique and compelling reasons must be demonstrated to justify the issuance of a ruling or determination letter Section of Rev Proc Section of Rev Proc provides that the Service will not ordinarily issue rulings or determination letters regarding any matter in which the determination requested is primarily one of fact for example market value of property or whether an interest in a corporation is to be treated as stock or indebtedness Section of Rev Proc sets forth those areas under extensive study in which rulings or determination letters will not be issued until the Service resolves the issue through publication of a revenue ruling revenue procedure regulations or otherwise Section of Rev Proc provides that the Service will not issue rulings or determination letters on whether a solid fuel other than coke or a fuel produced from waste coal is a qualified fuel under ocC Waste coal for this purpose is limited to waste coal fines from normal mining and crushing operations and does not include fines produced for example by crushing runofmine coal for the purpose of claiming the credit Section of Rev Proc supersedes Rev Proc IRB Rev Proc was published because concern had been raised that taxpayers were claiming the o credit for processing coal in ways that may not have been intended by the Congress Rev Proc requested comments concerning the standard to be applied in determining whether fuel produced from coal is a solid synthetic fuel The Service received extensive comments Section provides a credit against income tax for the production and sale of qualified fuels produced from a nonconventional source Section cC provides that qualified fuels include liquid gaseous or solid synthetic fuels produced from coal including lignite Rev Rul CB adopts for purposes of ocC the definition of synthetic fuel in o c of the Income Tax Regulations Section cii provides that to be synthetic a fuel must differ significantly in chemical composition as opposed to physical composition from the substance used to produce it Rev Rul describes favorably processes such as gasification liquefaction and production of solvent refined coal that result in substantial chemical changes to the entire coal feedstock rather than changes that affect only the surface of the coal Section f provides that o applies to qualified fuels that are produced in a facility placed in service after December and before January and that are sold before January Section gA provides that a facility for producing qualified fuels described in oc C is treated for this purpose as being placed in service before January if the facility is placed in service before July pursuant to a binding written contract in effect before January For a facility that meets this condition and is originally placed in service after December ogB provides that the o credit applies to qualified fuels that are sold before January Property is placed in service in the taxable year the property is placed in a condition or state of readiness and availability for a specifically assigned function See for example o aei Thus the o credit is not allowed for fuel produced in a facility that was originally placed in service for a function other than producing qualified fuel under ocC and was not converted into a facility for producing qualified fuel until after June The Service interprets of and g to allow the o credit for qualified fuel produced in a facility after its modification only if the modification was placed in service before July or does not significantly increase the production capacity of the facility or significantly extend the life of the facility For example a facility including one of multiple facilities located at the same site may be relocated without affecting the availability of the credit if all essential components of the facility are retained and the production capacity of the relocated facility is not significantly increased at the new location If however the essential components of a single facility are combined after June with other components that were not part of the facility on June to create multiple facilities or significantly increase production capacity the credit will not be allowed for fuel produced at any of those facilities After reviewing the comments received in response to Rev Proc and reconsidering its interpretation of ocC the Service has decided that the significant chemical change standard of Rev Rul is the correct standard The Service has also decided to resume the issuance of rulings under ocC but only in the circumstances described below The Service is willing to issue rulings that do not go beyond the processes approved in the rulings issued prior to One procedure common to all of those processes other than processes for the production of coke and similar products is the use of elevated temperature and pressure to produce briquettes pellets or an extruded fuel product The Service is also willing to rule with respect to a process that omits this procedure if the process is otherwise consistent with a process approved in a pre ruling and the omission of the procedure will not significantly increase the production output of the facility Accordingly the Service will issue rulings regarding whether a solid fuel other than coke is a qualified fuel under ocC under the circumstances described in section of this revenue procedure SECTION PROCEDURE The Service will issue rulings that a solid fuel other than coke produced from coal is a qualified fuel under ocC if the conditions set forth below are satisfied and evidence is presented that all or substantially all of the coal used as feedstock undergoes a significant chemical change The conditions are that The feedstock coal consists entirely of coal fines or crushed coal comprised of particles no larger than inch The feedstock coal is thoroughly mixed in a mixer a with styrene or other monomers following an acid bath b with quinoline CHN or other organic resin and left to cure for several days c with ultra heavy hydrocarbons or d with an aluminum andor magnesium silicate binder following heating to a minimum temperature of degrees Fahrenheit and The treated feedstock is subjected to elevated temperature and pressure that results in briquettes pellets or an extruded fuel product or the taxpayer represents that the omission of this procedure will not significantly increase the production output of the facility over the remainder of the period during which the o credit is allowable SECTION EFFECTIVE DATE This revenue procedure applies to all ruling requests including any pending in the national office and any submitted after the date of publication of this revenue procedure SECTION EFFECT ON OTHER DOCUMENTS Section of Rev Proc is revoked DRAFTING INFORMATION The principal author of this revenue procedure is David McDonnell of the Office of Associate Chief Counsel Passthroughs and Special Industries Other personnel from the IRS and Treasury
