ERCOT physical switching However we need to have appropriate data consumption facility and rate schedule etc submitted to us in a standardized format for site profiling A dedicated Data Capture team similar to Brad Athertons team for Project Phoenix would work very well Putting together data capture team quickly in my mind is key for the success of the project Please note that Site Profile Desk will have to deal with triple the amount of recent work load new origination Project Phoenix CA rebooking Project Guadalupe etc in the next two months Even though we are implementing significant systems improvements to reduce processing time these systems will not be ready until Dec th In order to manage site profiling I request that the data be fed to us in a relatively smooth manner Since there are a lot of players involved in getting this done I recommend agreeing upon a process and identifying single point of responsibility from each Desk Group involved Thanks Mallik Original Message

deadlines for notification Does this group feel we need to get together to discuss any open issues Please let me know if anyone feels uncomfortable with our getting there Thanks Rogers Original Message From Ochsner Preston Sent Monday October PM To Herndon Rogers Cc Wagner Joseph Misra Narsimha Day Smith L Merola Jeff Bird Richard Subject ERCOT physical delivery update Changes from last week in red Retail load About MW peak MW offpeak October th First account was switched By November th Remaining accounts will be switched Issue Some Lockheed Martin accounts that arent in the batch Issue Trying to get positions correctly reflected in positions report Jeff Jackson Issue Data we are getting from RPS is incorrect Interface with EWS Wholesale To date Met with EPMI and discussed management when will position be transferred how at what price of retail position Tom May to discuss with Rogers Issue How will we pass through intrazonal congestion costs This isnt an issue for the pilot but will be an issue on Intramonth book development November Expect to have volume managementreporting capability November Expect to have MTM calculations Expect to have all other reporting capabilities functioning Will meet with Richard Bird this week to develop a new timeline Working with CSC to develop a method to obtain actual customer usage on a timely basis Load forecasting Issue There is a significant difference at least in terms between the Packaged Ice position per the positions report and Fraziers forecast Appears the majority of this difference is due to some Packaged Ice accounts being booked more than once Issue Forecasting by zone vs at the account level may lead to inaccuracies in PL reporting Customer switching process Jeff Merola to determine roles and responsibilities Site profile Site profile desk has processed the pilot program deals Met with the desk to discuss the other nonpilot program deals that we expect to switch Thanks Preston Ochsner Commodity Risk
