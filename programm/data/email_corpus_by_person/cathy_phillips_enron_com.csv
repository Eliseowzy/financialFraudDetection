Mike McConnell has volunteered to be the chair of the Juvenile D iabetes Research Foundation JDRF walk This year the walk will be held o n Sunday October at Greenspoint Mall As some of you may know Mike has diabetes and JDRF is an organization that is very important to him There are two types of diabetes and Mike has Ty pe insulindependent diabetes which is also known as Juvenile Diabetes The other type of diabetes is Type adultonset diabetes that can often be controlled with a combination of diet exercise and oral medication Ev ery day Mike must prick his finger to test his blood sugar at least times in addition to giving himself at least or injections of insulin Jus t think of it at least times a day Mike has to stick himself with a nee dle to manage his disease I dont know about you but I am a wimp if I ha ve to get a shot just once every few years and I cant even begin to imagin e what it must be like to stick yourself over times in just one week B ut for Mike it is not just one day or one week it is every day of every we ek for the rest of his life until a cure is found Diabetics can never take a break from their disease It requires constant management of their food intake monitoring of their blood sugar and the administration of the proper amount of insulin If diabetes is not properly managed it can lead to kidney disease or failure blindness heart disease amputations among other complications I wanted you all to know that I have volunteered to help Mike in his effort s with the JDRF walk again this year I am serving on the steering committ ee and I plan to walk again this year to raise funds to help find a cure fo r this terrible disease I am doing this to support Mike but I also have a personal interest in doing whatever I can to help find a cure My husban d has adultonset diabetes and we lost his mom and her three sisters all to diabetes and diabetesrelated diseases several years ago In addition I have an uncle and a cousin that both have juvenile diabetes I am sending this message to ask you to join our team for the JDRF walk thi s year It would mean a lot to me and to Mike to have support from the p eople in our Enron Global Markets organization as well as people from prev ious groups we have worked with along with other friends throughout Enron Some of you receiving this message have already signed up and I want to tak e this
