Pres Enrons Core Business Is Very Very Strong Dow Jones Newswires Dynegy Deal Sets Path Of Resolution For Enron Analyst Dow Jones Newswires DynegyEnron deal potential staggering Energy Insight News for Tuesday November If the deal between Enron and Dynegy is successfully executed it should yield the most widely recognized respected and downright credible wholesaleretail energy merchant in the world said James Yannello and Ronald Barone analysts with UBS Warburg in a research note Monday Troubled energy giant Enron Corp agreed late Friday to be taken over by smaller rival Dynegy Inc in a billion stock swap with assumption of at least billion of Enron debt The deal includes an immediate infusion of billion from Dynegys owner ChevronTexaco to shore up Enrons cashstrained trading operations with another billion of new equity from ChevronTexaco when the merger closes We view both the near and longterm upside potential of this deal as staggering said the UBS Warburg analysts citing the combination of Enrons unsurpassed global wholesale network franchise with that of Dynegys fully leveraging the twos online capabilities continuing the aggressive growth of what will likely become Dynegy Energy Services disposing of all noncore assets and managing this global powerhouse with Dynegys aboveboard culture based on teamwork strict values and honesty Even though it remains positive about this merger UBS Warburg hasnt underestimated the enormous challenge at hand In the nearterm Enron must remain highly liquid investment grade and its employees must remain focused on keeping its core wholesaleretail franchises up and running Also early indications are that the ratings agencies have blessed the plan Dynegy will offer of its shares for each Enron share giving Dynegy holders of the combined company At Dynegys closing price Friday of share that equates to share for Enron which has seen its stock plummet from more than a year ago to a recent low of before rebounding on Dynegy bailout rumors Enron closed at share Nov Dynegy Calls SECs Probe of Enron Financial Noise By Russell Hubbard Houston Nov Bloomberg Dynegy Inc Chairman Chuck Watson said hes convinced Enron Corps trading operations are sound and described disclosures about affiliated partnerships that helped drive Enrons stock down percent in three weeks as financial noise Dynegy agreed Friday to buy Enron for at least billion including at least billion in stock and billion in assumed debt Dynegy shares rose as much as percent today Enron rose as much as percent In an interview after the merger announcement Watson and Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay discussed how the Houstonbased companies reached agreement less than three weeks after Enrons shares began plunging All the financial noise about the partnerships maybe it has damaged the Enron brand a bit Watson said But Ill tell you what it hasnt impacted and thats the high regard that the industry places on Enrons trading business he said Enron last week restated earnings for four years to include losses from three affiliated partnerships reducing earnings by million Six employees out of Enrons may have improperly benefited from the partnerships Lay said Im sorry those six people seem to have gone somewhat over the edge in their dealings or transactions but you cant be absolutely protected from that in any business he said Lost Effectiveness Lay didnt specify which six people he was referring to He removed Andrew Fastow who helped set up and ran many of the affiliated partnerships as chief financial officer on Oct An Enron securities filing says Fastow made more than million off two of the partnerships Fastow had lost his effectiveness because of all the press coverage on the affiliates Lay said Treasurer Ben Glisan and Kristina Mordaunt a managing director and a corporate counsel for an Enron division also were fired Enron said in a corporate filing on Thursday Former employees Michael Kopper Kathy Lynn and Anne Yeager were in a position to profit from partnerships the filing said You trust people you accept their representations and proposals Lay said Sometimes when you do that you get surprised and disappointed Both executives said they expect antitrust regulators to approve the merger because the two companies own different types of assets and wont dominate any market There really isnt anything that lays on top of each other Watson said Friday night Were not in the pipeline business and they are Were in the generation business and theyre really not Dynegy shares rose percent on Friday after terms of the Enron purchase leaked to the press Watson expects the acquisition to add cents to cents a share or percent to Dynegys earnings Enron is selling for a share onefifth the average price over the past months Enron stock climbed cents or percent to in late morning trading Earlier they touched Dynegy rose or percent to after touching Cash Crunch The rapid decline of Enron threatened to bankrupt the company and disrupt energy markets Enron handles an estimated onequarter of US electricity and naturalgas trades A falling credit rating made it difficult for the company to raise capital needed to back trades As part of the purchase ChevronTexaco Corp which owns percent of Dynegy agreed to provide Enron with billion What we found when looked under the hood is that the core of Enron was still there and working as well as ever Watson said That business was pristine and had nothing to do with the partnerships Dynegy began taking steps toward the acquisition in late October when Watson called Lay to offer assistance with Enrons growing financial crisis the two men said That led to a Saturday morning meeting in Lays kitchen He even made me a breakfast roll Watson said He didnt eat it Lay said Lay said he wont be an active manager in the new company Watson said Friday that he and Lay hadnt discussed a severance package As head of Enron Lay had refocused the Houston operator of US naturalgas pipelines on trading and international expansion boosting reported revenue fold since to billion last year He said he doesnt regret the strategy Clearly Enron has gotten involved in business that hasnt turned out well Lay said pointing to moneylosers Azurix Inc created to supply water and build related projects around the world and NewPower Holdings Inc a seller of electricity to homes and small businesses But you have to keep in mind too that years ago we werent in the wholesale merchant trading business Today thats an incredibly valuable franchise The trading business which accounts for about percent of Enrons revenue buys electricity gas and other commodities from producers and sells them to end users such as utilities and industrial customers It also advises big business customers on energy use and sells them gas and electricity Reassessing Steel Lumber Watson said the new company will keep trading coal gas power and petroleum products and plans to expand by buying assets and using them to develop trading Well just have to reassess over time whether we stay in trading of steel lumber and other nonenergy commodities he said Enron wants to shed its percent stake in Dabhol Power Co in India which is owed million in overdue bills from a state government agency that has refused to pay the power prices Enron was promised in contracts We have strong legal remedies and were heading down the path toward arbitration but wed still very much like to work out a settlement with the government Lay said Potential buyers have balked at Enrons billion asking price for Dabhol Neither man would comment on whether Dynegy plans to cut jobs after the merger or what will happen to the naming rights to Enron Field The Major League baseball stadium is home to the Houston Astros and Enron paid million to have its name on the ballpark The name of the company is now Dynegy Watson said Dynegys acquisition requires approval from US securities antitrust and energy regulators Watson expects soon to share details of the new Dynegy with regulators from the European Union and UK where Enron operates a trading desk and owns a water company and two power plants I dont know if we are required to do so but we will talk to them anyway Watson said We dont think there are going to be any problems Lay said Dynegy sees no more nasty surprises from Enron By Andrew Kelly Reuters English News Service HOUSTON Nov Reuters Dynegy Inc said on Monday does not foresee any damaging disclosures from Enron Corp slammed by news of murky offbalance sheet transactions that could derail its planned takeover of the beleaguered energy trading giant However Dynegy said it can drop its billion offer if more bad news emerges or if pending lawsuits against Enron lead to more than billion in costs Dynegy also expressed confidence the takeover announced on Friday will win US regulatory approval I really have a good deal of confidence but not an absolute guarantee that we are going to be fine here said Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck Watson when pressed about the possibility of further troubling disclosures by Enron Watson said Dynegy had run the deal through worstcase scenarios and concluded that it made good business sense Investors apparently agreed bidding up Dynegy shares or percent to close at on the New York Stock Exchange Enron shares gained cents to percent to The deal valued Enron stock at Enron agreed to a Dynegy buyout after it was overwhelmed by a series of problems including a US regulatory probe into the offbalance sheet dealings a billion cut in shareholder equity and damaging credit rating downgrades Watson has cause for concern about new disclosures from Enron which last Thursday said an internal probe showed its earnings had been overstated by some million since In a conference call with analysts on Monday Dynegy executives emphasized their confidence in the future of the combined company including annual projected earningspershare growth of percent to percent over the next three years But they also fielded a barrage of questions about how well Dynegy has insulated itself against further surprises of the kind that had slashed Enrons market value last week to barely onetenth the almost billion it was valued in August DYNEGY DOUBTS HUGE LIABILITIES To ensure against unpleasant disclosures Dynegy wrote socalled material adverse change clauses into the deal allowing it to walk away from Enron if there is serious deterioration of its businesses or assets In particular Dynegy can turn its back on the deal if pending litigation against Enron including a stack of lawsuits filed by angry investors who have lost a fortune leads to costs of more than billion Chief Financial Officer Rob Doty said it was highly unlikely that this threshold would be reached even if a very substantial settlement was reached in the stockholder suits Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade said he was not yet convinced that the stream of bad news from Enron was over I think Dynegy is making a big bet that they can successfully clean up the problems that Enron has had he said But UBS Warburg analyst Jay Yannello said after hearing management discuss the deal he was reassured it could address tough questions a breath of fresh air after Enrons tightlipped response to investors Some analysts have said the deal could be thwarted by regulators because of concerns that Dynegy would be too powerful after merging with Enron currently North Americas biggest buyer and seller of both natural gas and electricity Watson said Dynegy would have to work hard to explain the deal to regulators led by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission but does not doubt it will eventually pass muster We really are confident that up and down the line we are going to be able to convince them that this is really in the best interest of the energy industry as well as these two respective companies he said GAS PIPELINE OPTION BREAKUP FEES Dynegy executives also said there would be no complicated financing arrangements of the kind that triggered Enrons downfall and that the new Dynegy will be able to keep top Enron executives and traders from defecting to rival firms Enron officials declined to comment on reports that its banks JP Morgan and Citigroup were considering pumping an extra million of capital in to Enron Oil company ChevronTexaco Inc a major Dynegy stockholder has already agreed to inject billion into Enron immediately to keep it afloat while the merger is completed which Dynegy expects to take six to nine months If Enron backs out of the deal to accept a higher offer it would have to pay a million breakup fee to Dyegy And if the deal breaks down for any reason Dynegy would be allowed to exercise an option to acquire Enrons Northern Natural Gas pipeline subsidiary Dynegy and Enron Shares Get a Boost As Acquisition Plan is Met With Optimism By John R Emshwiller The Wall Street Journal The shares of Enron Corp and Dynegy Inc both rose in heavy trading as investors began trying to digest the possible risks and rewards of Dynegys plan to acquire Enron in a stock swap with a current value of billion In calls and meetings with analysts yesterday Dynegy Chairman Chuck Watson and Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay continued talking up the deal that was announced late Friday We are confident this is good strategically and financially for Dynegy and Enron said Mr Watson who will serve as chairman and chief executive of the combined entity to be called Dynegy Inc While the proposed combination faces months of review by government agencies and gives Dynegy possible opportunities to cancel the deal investors initial reaction to the merger announcement was positive As of pm in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Dynegy shares were at up or Also on the Big Board Enron was at up or cents Both companies were among the most actively traded issues Under terms of the proposed acquisition Dynegy would give of its shares for each Enron share Based on Dynegys stock price yesterday this formula values Enron stock at each Enron has about million shares outstanding Some people raised cautionary notes yesterday Moodys Investors Service placed Dynegy on review for a possible creditratings downgrade Standard Poors made a similar move on Friday Moodys said that while it saw positive elements to the proposed combination it also believed the financial and business risks associated with the transaction could negatively impact Dynegys credit fundamentals Prudential Securities analyst Carol Coale who counts herself a fan of Dynegy also worries that Enrons enormous problems could be a drag on the combined entity I dont want the Dynegy folks to get into something thats not good for the company she said As reported Enron in the past several weeks has seen its stock price and standing in the investment community plummet largely as the result of largescale transactions it did with partnerships headed by Enron officers Those transactions have produced hundreds of millions of dollars of writeoffs and restatements in the past month They are being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and have helped spawn more than a dozen shareholder lawsuits Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved Gas Pipeline Is Prominent As Dynegy Seeks Enron By FLOYD NORRIS The New York Times Dynegy has negotiated a great takeover And it may end up buying Enron too As part of its planned acquisition of Enron Dynegy will get the crown jewel even if the overall deal falls apart In return for its billion investment today Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern Natural Gas a pipeline system that is probably worth more As Dynegy stock soared percent yesterday Enrons lagged behind rising just percent Page C That widened the spread the profit a trader could lock in by buying Enron and selling Dynegy short assuming the deal goes through to percent The big premium probably reflects more than the fact that this deal will not close for many months It is at least a possibility that Dynegy will renegotiate the price or even walk away as it learns more about Enrons business Not that Chuck Watson chairman and chief executive of Dynegy was threatening to do any such thing In a talk to analysts yesterday and in a later interview he was extraordinarily upbeat about Enrons trading business even as he dismissed many of the companys diversifications as failures whose poor performance might have been obscured by fancy accounting Full details of the agreement between the companies will not be known until the merger agreement is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission today or tomorrow But it appears that if the agreement falls apart for any reason Dynegy has the right to keep the pipeline without putting up any additional cash Speaking to analysts yesterday Rob Doty chief financial officer at Dynegy said the company was paying about seven or eight times the cash flow of the pipeline business Walking away from the deal might cost Dynegy million if it could not cite any material adverse change in Enrons business as provided in the merger agreement But one way to look at this deal is that Dynegy is spending billion for the pipeline and a right to get the rest of Enron on the agreed terms Mr Watson said he was confident that things would not go wrong We have comfort there is not another shoe to drop he said If there is no shoe this is a phenomenally good transaction In presentations to analysts Dynegy officials said they expected the companys earnings per share to grow by at least cents a year even before considering cost reductions as the two businesses are merged That arithmetic was based on assumptions that Enron could deliver at least percent of the a share in proforma earnings that Wall Street had been forecasting for next year Those forecasts had stayed the same even as Enrons business collapsed The bullish case for the merger is that Enrons real profits were there and that the financial maneuvering did not cover up far deeper problems Mr Watson promised that more details would be disclosed about the partnerships that were created by Enron and traded with it providing a substantial part of the companys profits in Enrons need to make a deal quickly almost any deal was emphasized by Standard Poors the bond rating service In a conference call yesterday Ron Barone an analyst with S P said that without the takeover Enrons rating would have been cut to low BB or high B Those ratings are not even at the high end of junk and a company like Enron which depends on others being willing to treat it as a trusted trading partner needs an investment grade rating Its current S P rating is BBB minus the lowest investment grade rating That means Enron could not continue as an independent business And it means that should Dynegy decide to renegotiate Enron would be in a very poor bargaining position unless it had another bidder Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved Suitor for Enron Receives Approval From Wall St By ALEX BERENSON The New York Times Wall Street found nothing but good news in Dynegys billion takeover of the Enron Corporation yesterday Three days after Dynegy an energy marketing and trading company based in Houston agreed to take over Enron its giant crosstown rival Dynegy executives came to New York to assure investors that the deal would sharply increase their companys profits They met a receptive audience Dynegy stock closed yesterday at up or percent Since last Wednesday when news of a possible takeover emerged Dynegys stock has risen more than onethird Enron closed at up cents or percent After some initial uncertainty about the takeover investors appear to have accepted Dynegys view that the deal will give it a lucrative franchise in trading natural gas and electricity Enrons stock fell almost percent in the weeks leading up to the deal as Enron said it had overstated its earnings by almost million since and forced out several top executives But Chuck Watson Dynegys chairman told investors repeatedly yesterday that Enrons problems were mainly a result of failed expansion efforts He largely dismissed the concerns of some shortsellers and analysts that Enron might be hiding losses at its core energy trading operations Theres nothing wrong with Enrons business Mr Watson said in an interview at the WaldorfAstoria Hotel after making a lunchtime presentation to analysts and investors The people in it ought to be really upset that for the last several years they have produced earnings and cash that have been invested in other businesses that are not making money Enrons immediate problem was a crisis of confidence which could have caused other companies to stop trading with it Mr Watson said A billion cash infusion from Dynegy should restore the confidence of Enrons business partners and keep Enron stable until the takeover is complete he said To bolster Enron further J P Morgan Chase and Citigroup may each invest an additional million executives close to the deal said The potential investments by J P Morgan Chase and Citigroup were reported yesterday in The Wall Street Journal Mr Watson said Dynegy would also move quickly to assuage Enron employees who are angry that Kenneth L Lay Enrons chairman and other top executives sold hundreds of millions of dollars in stock in and this year as Enrons shares plunged Right now theres some animosity over there he said Many employees at Enron will get new grants of stock options when the acquisition is completed he said The company said it expected the deal to close by the end of the third quarter of next year after extensive reviews from federal and state energy regulators and the Department of Justice Mr Watson predicted that the deal would lift Dynegys earnings by cents or more a share next year to more than a share Analysts backed that view yesterday Investments in noncore business distracted the attention of management and also took up capital said Thomas Hamlin an analyst at Wachovia Securities Mr Hamlin said he believed that Dynegy had obtained Enron which reported more than billion in revenue last year for a bargain price Its not too often you get to take out the No Fortune company and double your earnings in the meantime he said My guess is the stock is worth per share The deal could increase Dynegys earnings by to a share next year said Christopher Ellinghaus an analyst at the Williams Capital Group Thats a whopper he said Its a very good deal financially certainly should be a good deal strategically and provides some immediate balancesheet backstop for Enron Mr Lay said in an interview that Enron had been forced to sell itself because of the relentlessness of all the articles and the shorts We realized that we needed to do something to stabilize the ship he said A good company was being badly tarnished Photo In Houston the headquarters building of Dynegy Inc the energy and marketing trading company which is in a billion takeover of Enron Asociated Press Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved Share boost for Dynegy good news Saving Enron trading called key handicap By LAURA GOLDBERG and DAVID IVANOVICH November Houston Chronicle Although investors Monday cheered Dynegys planned acquisition of Enron Corp Dynegy must still negotiate a series of potential roadblocks to pull off a successful merger Among them ensuring that Enrons core energytrading business suffering before the merger announcement stays healthy Negative news on that front quickly surfaced Monday as at least two traders said they still plan extremely limited business with Enron Dynegy must also manage any unexpected disclosures about Enrons financial performance and investment partnerships convince Enrons traders and other key employees to stick around and mesh different corporate cultures Investors were optimistic in Dynegys abilities as shares in the company traded up to close at Monday while shares in Enron ended the day up cents at Enron has been under siege since Oct when it reported a million loss and billion reduction in shareholder equity tied to business dealings with investment partnerships run by its thenchief financial officer Since then the Securities and Exchange Commission started an investigation of Enron a slew of shareholder lawsuits were filed and Enrons stock price plummeted A new shareholder suit filed Monday included Dynegy on its list of defendants Last week Enron said it was restating its earnings back to to include losses related to a number of complex partnerships including several being investigated by the SEC It said it was correcting almost million worth of mistakes Just how close Enron was to a collapse remains unclear One industry source believes Enron had been pushed to the brink and would have been done for if it had been unable to reach agreement with Dynegy last week But Ron Barone a credit analyst with Standard Poors doesnt think Enrons condition was so desperate We clearly didnt see this as an imminent bankruptcy or imminent default but it is something that could have eroded over time in a fairly short time Friday Enrons longterm debt rating was downgraded to one notch above investmentgrade status by both Moodys Investors Service and SP Enron is the largest natural gas and electricity trader in the nation accounting for about percent of all transactions Its collapse would have meant the loss of much liquidity in the trading market making trades more difficult and prices more volatile industry experts said Dynegy announced a deal Friday to buy Enron at a firesale price of almost billion in stock plus the assumption of about billion in debt and billion in preferred stock The merger is expected to close barring holdups from regulators in six to nine months As part of the agreement Dynegy stakeholder ChevronTexaco is giving Dynegy billion which is to be infused today to help shore up Enrons liquidity and preserve its trading franchise Some of Enrons former trading partners are still steering clear of the giant To facilitate transactions the various energy trading firms extend credit to one another Those agreements are contingent upon a partner maintaining an adequate rating If the credit rating firms had downgraded Enrons debt to junk status its trading operation would have been devastated industry officials said As details of Enrons questionable financial dealings have been revealed Enrons trading partners have been scrambling to reduce their exposure Kansas City Mobased Aquila Energy Marketing Corp for instance has been ratcheting down its activity with Enron company spokesman Al Butkus said By the end of last week Aquilas exposure to Enron was insignificant Butkus said And after all that was revealed on Friday and the downgrading of the credit we are now at an even lower level Atlantabased Mirant has likewise reduced its exposure and is only doing a limited amount of business with Enron Some larger players however continue doing deals with the company Reliant Energy has consistently been trading with Enron through its difficulties albeit with a heightened sense of caution said Shahid Malik president of Houstonbased Reliant Energys trading operation Charlotte NCbased Duke Energys exposure stands at million Were continuing the way we have been said Duke spokesman Terry Francisco John Olson an analyst with Sanders Morris Harris in Houston predicted it would take the traders some time to digest the merger deal I think people will increasingly come back to Enron just as soon as the billion changes hands he said Traders still have incentives to do business with Enron even though its being sold as it has a wider variety of products than some of its competitors and its EnronOnline Internet trading operation is regarded as superior On a conference call with investors and analysts Monday morning Dynegy and Enron executives fielded a variety of questions about the merger but refused comment on a Wall Street Journal report that JP Morgan Chase Co and Citigroup are considering a million investment in Enron Analysts remain worried that new and troubling surprises will emerge about Enrons finances including those that could call into question whether its core trading business is as advertised Dynegy executives arent expecting any such disclosures but took a conservative approach to calculating merger benefits I believe we have adequately bracketed the downside said Chuck Watson Dynegys chairman and chief executive Even with a worstcase scenario Dynegy still found a tremendous amount of economic value in the merger said Watson who will take the same roles after the merger The deal Dynegy said will add cents to cents per share in earnings for current Dynegy shareholders And thats before cost savings that are expected to run million to million a year Dynegy detailed two escape clauses in the merger deal For one if the amount of legal and shareholder claims Enron must pay out is greater than billion it can be called off Enron and Dynegy officials also said they will do whatever it takes to keep their key people But will traders jump ship Oh yeah Im sure they will the industry source said Jeff Dietert an analyst with Simmons Co International in Houston believes that a number of Enrons marketers and traders will find Dynegy a strong alternative I firmly believe that the Enron guys like to play on the winning team and Dynegy is a very very strong player he said That Dynegy was approached by three key Enron executives about a merger showed Dynegy would be getting the full cooperation of Enrons management team Watson said Enron employees working for Dynegy will have to get used to a new culture Teamwork and fraternal are words often used to describe Dynegy while cutthroat is used for Enron which also is known for its willingness to take more risk Watson plans to blend strategies and business elements of each The new company will include Enrons strong offering of financial products and combine them with Dynegys base of power plants and other assets said Steve Bergstrom Dynegys president who will take the same job in the new company The postmerger Dynegy will also be more involved in marketmaking which Enron is known for Thats the practice of ensuring orderly markets can exist by acting as both the buyer and the seller of a commodity Its unclear whether Dynegy will continue Enrons foray into other commodities such as paper and metals Dynegy hopes Enron can complete its planned sale of assets considered outside its core wholesale energy business before the merger closes Enron already has deals to sell power utility Portland General Electric along with about million in international assets Billions of dollars in international projects are for sale But Watson said Dynegy isnt interested in seeing the assets go at bargainbasement prices We dont necessarily feel like our back is pinned against the wall in asset dispositions he said Dynegy Pres Enrons Core Business Is Very Very Strong By Christina Cheddar Dow Jones News Service NEW YORK Dow Jones Dynegy Inc DYN Chairman Chuck Watson said he sees nothing but upside ahead from the companys planned acquisition of Enron Corp ENE which was announced late Friday In addition to being a sound strategic move the deal injects confidence into the energy markets said Watson founder of the Houston energy trading firm in a conference call held Monday to discuss the billion takeover of Enron On Friday Dynegy confirmed the widely speculated deal by announcing it would buy its crosstown rival in a stock swap that values each Enron share at of a Dynegy share The sale of Enron for only a quarter of its share price a month ago or just a quarter of its alltime high of a share reached just last year follows an abrupt turn in Enrons fortunes Last week Enron which is the nations biggest trader of natural gas and electricity admitted its financial statements going back to couldnt be relied upon and would have to be restated The company made accounting errors in recording transactions from some of its limited partnerships The company also misstated its level of debt and its shareholder equity over this period Enrons partnership dealings are being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and have sparked a number of shareholder lawsuits Over the past month new revelations about Enrons web of partnerships and offbalance sheet financing vehicles have been uncovered almost daily During the conference call Kenneth Lay Enrons chairman and chief executive said it was a very reflective time for him When Lay transformed Enron from a natural gas pipeline company into a dynamic energy trading company that was a darling on Wall Street this was clearly not what he had in mind Lay said I didnt expect to create the worlds next leading energy trading company by merging Enron i nto another company Enron officials said they were continuing their internal investigations of its accounting practices We have disclosed anything and everything we have found so far Lay said Enron President and Chief Operating Officer Greg Whalley who will remain with Dynegy after the merger as an executive vice president said Enron will host a conference call later this week to further discuss recent events at the company The call will likely be held on Wednesday he said In light of the uncertainty surrounding Enrons financial dealings it is not surprising that quite a number of questions during the conference call focused on the companys liquidity and the potential liabilities Dynegy would assume in the transaction Dynegys acquisition agreement allows the company to walk away if Enrons additional legal and financial liabilities exceed billion There also are other material adverse change or MAC provisions officials said Upon the closing of the acquisition Dynegy expects to post reserves to cover the cost of outstanding litigation said Dynegys Doty We believe we have adequately bracketed the downside said Dynegys Watson There has to be a substantial substantial material change in what we already know I dont want to minimize the impact Thats why we have MAC outs According to Dynegys Bergstrom the economics of the transaction assumed the potential risk from outstanding lawsuits Even in that worstcase there is a substantial amount of economic value here Watson said Dynegy expects to continue its due diligence in the months leading up to the deals close Bergstrom said Dynegys examination of the business so far has turned up no surprises in Enrons core energy trading business Bergstrom said However the merger agreement has provisions in case the companys examination does reveal any Bergstrom said We dont expect to find anything material he said adding that Enrons core energy business is very very strong Based on its current information Dynegy expects the acquisition to increase earnings by or between cents to cents a share before taking into account expected merger cost savings As a result Dynegy now expects its full year pro forma earnings for to be in the range of to a share According to Thomson FinancialFirst Call analysts were expecting Dynegy to earn a share next year In the company earned a share before items Dynegy has estimated cost savings from the acquisition at between million to million The ratio of stock Enron shareholders will be paid is fixed and there is no collar to limit its range said a Dynegy spokeswoman There isnt a walkaway provision but if the deal is terminated Dynegy will own rights to Enrons Northern Natural Gas pipeline because of the billion cash infusion it will provide to the company immediately Dynegy able to give Enron the cash infusion immediately because ChevronTexaco Corp CVX which owns slightly more than a fourth of Dynegy will invest billion in Dynegy The deal has a million topping fee a Dynegy spokeswoman said She explained that if either party decided to terminated the transaction that party would owe the other the topping fee if it were acquired by another party Dynegys Bergstrom said he expects the acquisition of Enron will receive the needed regulatory approvals and close within the next six to nine months In addition to approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission the deal must be approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission We expect FERC to be the pacesetter Bergstrom said Until the deal closes Dynegy expects Enron will have sufficient interim liquidity Doty said The cash infusion should immediately put to rest the liquidity concerns Based on conversations Dynegy had with the leading credit rating agencies management expects Enrons ratings to remain investment grade Doty said Meanwhile Dynegys ratings are expected to be affirmed at their current ratings but be placed on watch for a downgrade until the transaction is completed he said According to Doty Dynegy expects its debttocapital ratio will be below after the acquisition closes Enron said it wouldnt comment on reports published in The Wall Street Journal Monday that said its bankers JP Morgan Chase Co JPM and Citigroup Inc C are considering making an additional million investment in Enron Dynegy officials said marketplace speculation that suggested Dynegy was acquiring Enron because it was afraid Enron would default on a liability it owed Dynegy was incorrect Dynegy currently owes Enron an immaterial amount less than million said Dynegys Doty The chief financial officer also pledged to make the combined companys balance sheet more easy to understand than that of Enron But integrating the two energy trading companies will be more than just combining their balance sheets According to Enrons Whalley the integration of Enrons noncore assets trading businesses will be rather simple but combing the core trading businesses will not be the easiest thing to do One prevalent concern is that Enrons trading talent will depart for other jobs and erode the true value of the business which is rooted in intellectual capital The employees have seen their value of compensation which was partially paid in stock options erode with the value of Enrons shares I believe we will retain the people we already have Whalley said Most traders want to be part of the winning team However the officials didnt say whether they were making any specific efforts to retain staff Still in the end callers were most interested in learning more about Enrons past accounting practices and the potential effects it will have on the future Dynegy Officials from both companies said they couldnt tell yet if there were any additional details that needed to be revealed Enrons newly appointed chief financial officer Jeff McMahon said Could there be more Possibly Do we expect more No Mahon replaced Andrew Fastow who resigned after questions arose related to a partnership he ran while chief financial officer of Enron Fastows activities are at the center of the SEC probe of Enrons financial dealings By Christina Cheddar Dow Jones Newswires Dynegy Deal Sets Path Of Resolution For Enron Analyst By Christina Cheddar Dow Jones News Service NEW YORK Dow Jones Dynegy Incs DYN proposed acquisition of Enron Corp ENE creates a clear path for the resolution of the liquidity and financial issues plaguing Enron said Ted Izatt a highgrade debt research analyst at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH Izatt made the comments during a conference call held Tuesday with bondholders to discuss the proposed acquisition which was announced late last Friday Lehmans investment bankers advised Dynegy on the transaction Enron was advised by JP Morgan Chase Co JPM and Citigroup Inc C On Monday the marriage of the two Houston energy traders received a warm reception as equity investors bid up shares of both companies Recently Enron shares traded at up cent or while Dynegy shares changed hands at up cents up Enron shares had fallen more than in the weeks leading up to the transaction as the company posted more than billion in writeoffs of failed investments and was forced to restate its earnings going back to because it improperly accounted for the results at some of its partnerships The restatement reduced Enrons profits over the period by and added millions to its debt level Also the Securities and Exchange Commission launched an investigation of the financial dealings of Enrons former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow The chain of events prompted a series of credit rating downgrades and raised doubts about Enrons liquidity Eventually the concerns threatened Enrons core energy marketing and trading business because a perception of creditworthiness is vital to the business Izatt said a combination of billion in newly secured bank lines and the billion equity infusion from Dynegy has bolstered Enrons financial position With this additional cash on hand the greatest risk to bondholders is whether the deal closes said Izatt The analyst added he expects the merger to close because both companies are committed to the deal and he expects regulators to approve the transaction There is a lot of commitment to get the deal done he said However if the transaction doesnt close Izatt said he believes Dynegys bondholders are very well protected in the transaction According to Izatt Dynegys bonds are at an attractive level The spread on the bonds had widened ahead of the announcement of the deal as rumors began to leak into the market leaving the price of the bond in a weaker position But Izatt does expect Dynegy will merge with Enron and the resulting company will emerge as a much stronger company he said For example the analyst expects Dynegy has the potential to achieve more than million to million in pretax merger cost savings Dynegy is projecting Also Izatt said Dynegys cash infusion and purchase will help Enron to retain its position in the energy market Dynegy is there for real Izatt said They intend to see this through to fruition and energy players will view this and feel confident enough to trade with Enron Under terms of the acquisition Dynegy will pay Enron shareholders of a Dynegy share for each Enron share outstanding The value of the stock swap at the close of the market Monday was billion Dynegy is making an immediate cash investment in Enron with the assistance of ChevronTexaco Corp CVX Later when the deal closes ChevronTexaco will make an additional billion investment in the combined company By Christina Cheddar Dow Jones Newswires
