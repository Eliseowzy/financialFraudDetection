Think of it Try to remember something you did during the first week of September a party a movie a dinner out Doesnt that seem like a lifetime ago At a recent seminar I gave to a group of young members of the International Association of Business Communicators I was asked How has communications changed since September I think that there are two important shifts All communications now must be relevant The era of cranking out meaningless press releases on top of fluffy brochures followed by disjointed ads is past I have been as guilty as the next person But here on out irrelevant blather is not going to be tolerated by target audiences The example I use is the ubiquitous new senior vice president press release In the past journalists and the public could dismiss these without a second thought Today the recipient is just as likely to wonder Why is this company bothering to waste precious resources on this If the press release describes a newsworthy shift in the marketplace and articulates how this new senior VP address that shift in a way that benefits the companys customers then that is a step in the right direction Communications that are sensitive to balance are more likely to resonate Even if a communication is relevant if it has an underlying message that some gadget or feature is incredibly important it will fall on deaf ears Whats important today Balance in

like the name so his father AJ Milne encouraged him to make up a new name The boy immediately came up with WinniethePooh a combination of the name of a friendly bear he had met at the London Zoo named
