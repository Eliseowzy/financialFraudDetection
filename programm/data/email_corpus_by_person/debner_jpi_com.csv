anything until one hour before So I congratulate you all on this big step We are on for December and In any event this is the final list of people that are definitely coming We are at counting the email list above plus two additional people that Palmer is bringing Paul Parks roommate may be coming as well Remember to get directions for the website below before you head out BTW the directions are pretty iffy So you will want to look at a map before you get in your car Also cell phones dont work too well out there so dont try to rely on calling us once you get lost What to bring Bedding is supplied But we now have people potentially in on this thing If memory serves the house can sleep and bedding should be available I think people should plan on bringing the justincase sleeping bag Ill bring one That leaves others for you all to decide Bring all your booze and ice for the weekend and cups to drink out of Its next to impossible to find this stuff out there You also want to bring your baffroom stuff and warm clothes for drinking outside at night You will also want lighter not summer clothes for daytime stuff Theres fishingcountry golfhiking available in the area So bring what equipment you want to Each car should bring a cooler with ice in it You also will want your food for the weekend Bring what you want but popular meals are steaks at night and sandwiches during the day I specifically like to get steak blood all over my face and chase vegetarianSummitt around Mostly you shouldnt need to bring too much Cost Plan on about for the cabin per person Plan on another per person for firewood This has gone up because were buying lots and towing it down Stupidyes Funyes You may also want to have a little more justincase cash When to arrive The hills are pretty difficult driving at night and if you havent ever been before the cabin itself is difficult to find at night So if at all possible try to get a halfday off or so on Friday to get you out there by sundown on Friday night You may want to call the cabin office and get specific directions beforehand regardless of what time you plan on arriving We will likely leave somewhat early on Sunday Palmer can you bring lanterns lantern fuel etc ClintKoppa can you bring a case of Duraflam logs yes we cheat Summitt and I will be towing the trailer down Palmer you may want to grab a little firewood that day if we are running late I hope this answers everything Let me know if it does not Looking forward to it Daniel Ebner Acquisitions DFW Region JPI mailto PIcom Original Message From Ebner Daniel Sent Wednesday

Scott Ebner Daniel Matt Gildon Paul Park Richard Donoghue Rob Jablonski Scott Palmer Trey Stone Subject Fall Camping Trip The time is upon us to schedule another guys camping trip Id like to acknowledge a few new entries to the distribution list Devine Buddy Stone Gildon RDoug Peck Scott I didnt have Luiss email address Can you make sure he knows about this For the newbies we have been getting the guys together for a weekend cabin camping trip semiannually for about years now Weve found a cool place in the hill country about hours from Austin Its called Fox Fire Cabins Click on the Farm House link to see the spread Its a huge house that sleeps about and is on its own acres and has river frontage Those of you with WD will enjoy trashing your trucks in the river Watch as Palmer destroys his K Runner Fun Fun I have reserved the house for the weekend of November This is one of few Longhorn bye weeks and does not conflict with Thanksgiving Nov Plan on meeting out there Friday night after work and staying until Sunday This is a very low cost event If people go the cost of the cabin is slightly less than per person I have people invited We also like to buy obscene amounts of firewood so plan on another to pp for this To give you an idea Im planning on renting a trailer this time to haul in the appropriate amount of wood Lastly the place supplies all bedding dishes etc So you dont have to worry about any camping gear Theres usually some interest in fishing hiking etc so if you have that gear bring it with you If not Koppa has special ways to keep you entertained back at the cabin grin There is not much in the way of grocerybeerliquor stores so plan on showing up with what you need for consumption While Clint will need a pack of beer to get through the weekend Devine will need a case of Beam Ice is also an important thing to show up with Make sure you bring a lot For those that are not inclined to the camping lifestyle the cabin has baffrooms with showers a full kitchen tvvcr etc If Koppa can handle it you can too This is a haul for the Dallas guys and we typically try to leave around noon on Friday But that may be hard for me this year In any event I can get others down with me The drive is totally worth it Ill know more about how early I can leave as it gets closer More information will come as we get closer But email me back fairly soon so I can get a headcount and make the appropriate reservation If a smaller number goes we can shift to a smaller cabin But I want to know sooner rather than later the interest in this This event is a great time Fraternity stories only improve with Jim Beam and fire Let the onslaught of email trashing begin Daniel Ebner Acquisitions DFW Region JPI mailto PIcom

To Ebner Daniel Richard Donoghue Cc Luis Gasparini Subject RE This weekend On the camping note I am researching alternative sites just in case the weather is insane this weekend Depending on which weather forecast you believe it will be cloudy with a chance of rain with lows in the s and highs in the s I also have to check for trail closures Even if its not raining some trails will close down if they are muddy wet because of erosion No matter what were on for camping though Even if I have to ride my bike in circles around the tent Original Message From Ebner Daniel mailto PIcom Sent
