Jones dogged determination the Governors energy adviso rs and consultants are going to follow the laws First Bill called for complete public disclosure by Davis advisors by filing their legallyrequired statements of economic interests to protect against any conflicts of interest You can read about Bills call for action in Thursdays Sacramento Bee at CAPoliticsCAPoliticscfmIDDcD Bet you can guess what happened nextthe Governors office lied and stonewalled until they couldnt stand the pressure from the media So they hastily prepared of the advisors statements some incomplete so me very sloppily prepared perjury anyone and made them available late on Thursday afternoon Well wouldnt you know there are astounding and disturbing confli cts of interest by a number of the consultants and some potentially criminal violations too But dont take our word for it you can see what t he Los Angeles Times San Francisco Chronicleand Sacramento Beehad to say aft er reviewing the conflicts in the disclosure reports More than half a dozen consultants hired by the state to purchase electricity and to negotiate longterm power deals own stock in generating companies such as Calpine and Enron that have profited handsomely during Californias energy crisis wrote the Los Angeles Times To read the article visit CAPoliticsCAPoliticscfmIDD cD The SF Chronicles analysis of the situation netted this fact According to statements filed with the states Fair Political Practice Commission six of new consultants hired by Davis own stock in San Jose based Calpine Corpwhile one has investments in

necessary to guarantee that while I am Secretary of State Californians will have fair and accurate districts from which to select their leaders Visiting with the Grassroots Bill met this Saturday with
