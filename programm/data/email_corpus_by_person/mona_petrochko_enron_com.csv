Motion for authori ty to enter into bilateral contracts The decision directs to enter into bilateral agreements that will expire by It provides similar reasonableness guidance as provided to SCE bilateral contracts must be within of actual annual procurement costs The draft decision rejects SDGEs request to allocate those contracts to residential and small commercial customers It rejects SDGEs request for an exemption from the affiliate rules which would have allowed SDGE to enter into bilateral agreements with its trading affiliate without posting those transactions or providing an opportunity for a bid process Because this decision adopts the same principles in the SCE and PGE Decisions I give a low probability to changing the decision language However if folks would still like us to weigh in on an issue please let m e know asap Thanks Mona Forwarded by Mona L PetrochkoSFOEES on PM Daniel Douglass rterHaddencom on PM To om cc Subject Draft Decision Issued in SDGE Emergency Motion ALJ Cooke has issued the attached draft decision with regard to the August emergency motion filed by SDGE to enter into bilateral power contracts SDGE sought similar authority to that granted to Edison and PGE in D The draft decision would grant the motion but would impose certain conditions different from those requested by the utility The differences are summarized below Background Under the terms of the Commissions D SDGE is currently authorized to participate in the PX forward markets for energy services subject to seasonal trading limits through the end of the last utility ra te freeze SDGE is not proposing an increase to the limits approved in D and will treat its capacity purchases under those limits although it reserves the right to request expanded authority in the future The draft decision also notes that SDGE proposes that costs associated with and gainslosses from these bilateral contracts should be attributed only to small commercial and residential customers It also notes that intervenors focused on four general areas of concern regarding the specifi c authority requested by SDGE duration of contracts reasonableness standards request for exemption from affiliate rules and ratemaking Duration of Contracts SDGE requested authority to enter into bilateral contracts that expire on or before December The ALJ notes that the Commission recently instituted an investigation into the impact of the functioning of the wholesale electric market on retail rates in SDGEs service territory and that the OII will consider whether SDGE should be removed from that defau lt provider role The ALJ states that the Commission should not compromise future longterm solutions by affording SDGE greater purchasing authority than is needed to address the current emergency situation For this reaso n we limit SDGEs authority to what we described in D as near term bilateral contracting authority that is contracts with delivery occurrin g on or before December Reasonableness Standards The draft decision suggests that the OII provides a forum to establish a common framework for all three utilities for determining the reasonablenes s of their bilateral purchases However in the interim it adopts the same reasonableness standard for nearterm contracts as it did for SCE If th e average price of SDGEs bilateral transactions delivered or requiring delivery over the course of an annual period exceeds the average price of SDGEs corresponding portfolio of transactions delivered or requiring deliver over the same period by more than then the Commission will initiate a reasonableness review Reasonableness reviews to the extent needed will take place as part of SDGEs Annual Transition Cost Proceeding Affiliate Rules Exemption SDGEs request to be exempted from the affiliate rules for any purchases from affiliates was denied Ratemaking TURN urged the Commission to reject SDGEs request to limit the ratema king impacts of the bilateral contracts to its residential and small commercial customers saying that the potential risks and benefits should be spread among all customers The draft decision states that we do not believe it prudent to limit the cost exposure for these contracts solely to residenti al and small commercial customers This aspect of SDGEs motion is denie d Transparency Considerations The ALJ orders SDGE to disclose all bilateral transactions to the Energy Division on a confidential basis in a monthly report The draft decision notes that WPTF and ARM argue that additional transparency of bilateral transactions is required compared to that proposed by SDGE We adopt consistent disclosure standards for SDGE bilateral contracts as that adopted in D for PGE and SCE This issue may be revisited on a going forward basis in I Response Time The normal response time has been shortened Parties to the proceeding ma y file comments on the draft decision no later than noon on September I suggest that comments be filed agreeing with the thrust of the decision but strongly advocating that SDGE be required to publicly post its transactions as it agreed to do in Advice Letter E with regard to SDGEs

<25619454.1075846170746.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,mona.petrochko@enron.com,2000-08-24 14:45:00,Re Daily Update Legislative activity Cc Cmmr Woods twoday hearing on Wholesale Markets which concluded today in San Diego Three Commissioners were present Wood Lynch and Neeper with Duque and Bilas participating by phone Administrative Law Judge Wetzel was present and a transcript was taken The quasilegislative hearing was the beginning of a record developed for the investigation into the workings of wholesaleretail markets This session focused on Wholesale markets There will be subsequent sessions on retail issues market structure and other related issues in the future My conclusion from this session is that Wood is looking for support for increasing regulatory intervention in the market Dan Larcamp Director of the Office of markets Tariffs and Rates FERC was present He relayed FERCs concern of this matter and a desire to hold hearings in San Diego He also relayed that Hoecker held a press conference announcing the opening of a investigative proceeding into the operation of the wholesale markets in California which carried with it refund authority The format of the hearing was to respond to prefiled questions developed by WoodLynch Each member of the panel would respond to the questions and any questions posed by the Commissioners the Judge or the CPUC Attorney No questions were posed by members of the audience Yesterdays panel of academics were comprised of Dr Timothy DuaneUC Berkley Dr William HoganHarvard Dr Frank WolakStanford ISO Market Surveillance Committee David MarcusEnergy Consultant for the Coaltion of Utility Employees Dr Gene Coyle Dr JeanMichel Glachant Universite Paris I Pantheon Sorbonne The panel was asked to speak as individuals and not on behalf of any institutions they may represent While the purpose of the panel seemed to be to determine that market power was being exercised and that prices were too high and therefore not just and reasonable the panelist stopped short of blaming generators and market participants in behaving illegally The concensus generally was that market power did exist at various times but the mere existence did not constitute bad behavior None with the exception of Dr Wolak who is in the process of doing a study using recent data as part of his role for the Market Surveillance Committee had done a study There was some discussion though not much of the monopsony power of the utilities I think ultimately the group conceded that scarcity of supply amplified concerns about the exercise of market power as even the increase in gas costs did not fully explain the recent spikes Wolak believes that encourage utilities to enter into forward purchases will reduce the exercise of realtime market power Hogan seemed to be there with Sempras interests in mind He continued to promote expansion of the ISOs abilities to dispatch load as well as maintain system reliability There was alot of discussion about forward purchase ability for utilities so as to be less subject to volatile market prices The concerns were also discussed about the appropriateness of a distribution utility making

in San Diego Three Commissioners were present Wood Lynch and Neeper with Duque and Bilas participating by phone Administrative Law Judge Wetzel was present and a transcript was taken The quasilegislative hearing was the beginning of a record developed for the investigation into the workings of wholesaleretail markets This session focused on Wholesale markets There will be subsequent sessions on retail issues market structure and other related issues in the future My conclusion from this session is that Wood is looking for support for increasing regulatory intervention in the market Dan Larcamp Director of the Office of markets Tariffs and Rates FERC was present He relayed FERCs concern of this matter and a desire to hold hearings in San Diego He also relayed that Hoecker held a press conference announcing the opening of a investigative proceeding into the operation of the wholesale markets in California which carried with it refund authority The format of the hearing was to respond to prefiled questions developed by WoodLynch Each member of the panel would respond to the questions and any questions posed by the Commissioners the Judge or the CPUC Attorney No questions were posed by members of the audience Yesterdays panel of academics were comprised of Dr Timothy DuaneUC Berkley Dr William HoganHarvard Dr Frank WolakStanford ISO Market Surveillance Committee David MarcusEnergy Consultant for the Coaltion of Utility Employees Dr Gene Coyle Dr JeanMichel Glachant Universite Paris I Pantheon Sorbonne The panel was asked to speak as individuals and not on behalf of any institutions they may represent While the purpose of the panel seemed to be to determine that market power was being exercised and that prices were too high and therefore not just and reasonable the panelist stopped short of blaming generators and market participants in behaving illegally The concensus generally was that market power did exist at various times but the mere existence did not constitute bad behavior None with the exception of Dr Wolak who is in the process of doing a study using recent data as part of his role for the Market Surveillance Committee had done a study There was some discussion though not much of the monopsony power of the utilities I think ultimately the group conceded that scarcity of supply amplified concerns about the exercise of market power as even the increase in gas costs did not fully explain the recent spikes Wolak believes that encourage utilities to enter into forward purchases will reduce the exercise of realtime market power Hogan seemed to be there with Sempras interests in mind He continued to promote expansion of the ISOs abilities to dispatch load as well as maintain system reliability There was alot of discussion about forward purchase ability for utilities so as to be less subject to volatile market prices The concerns were also discussed about the appropriateness of a distribution utility making purchasing decisions on behalf of its customers This included discussion of separation of these functions and the default provider role Most everyone agreed that rolling back to a regulated market was

in San Diego Three Commissioners were present Wood Lynch and Neeper with Duque and Bilas participating by phone Administrative Law Judge Wetzel was present and a transcript was taken The quasilegislative hearing was the beginning of a record developed for the investigation into the workings of wholesaleretail markets This session focused on Wholesale markets There will be subsequent sessions on retail issues market structure and other related issues in the future My conclusion from this session is that Wood is looking for support for increasing regulatory intervention in the market Dan Larcamp Director of the Office of markets Tariffs and Rates FERC was present He relayed FERCs concern of this matter and a desire to hold hearings in San Diego He also relayed that Hoecker held a press conference announcing the opening of a investigative proceeding into the operation of the wholesale markets in California which carried with it refund authority The format of the hearing was to respond to prefiled questions developed by WoodLynch Each member of the panel would respond to the questions and any questions posed by the Commissioners the Judge or the CPUC Attorney No questions were posed by members of the audience Yesterdays panel of academics were comprised of Dr Timothy DuaneUC Berkley Dr William HoganHarvard Dr Frank WolakStanford ISO Market Surveillance Committee David MarcusEnergy Consultant for the Coaltion of Utility Employees Dr Gene Coyle Dr JeanMichel Glachant Universite Paris I Pantheon Sorbonne The panel was asked to speak as individuals and not on behalf of any institutions they may represent While the purpose of the panel seemed to be to determine that market power was being exercised and that prices were too high and therefore not just and reasonable the panelist stopped short of blaming generators and market participants in behaving illegally The concensus generally was that market power did exist at various times but the mere existence did not constitute bad behavior None with the exception of Dr Wolak who is in the process of doing a study using recent data as part of his role for the Market Surveillance Committee had done a study There was some discussion though not much of the monopsony power of the utilities I think ultimately the group conceded that scarcity of supply amplified concerns about the exercise of market power as even the increase in gas costs did not fully explain the recent spikes Wolak believes that encourage utilities to enter into forward purchases will reduce the exercise of realtime market power Hogan seemed to be there with Sempras interests in mind He continued to promote expansion of the ISOs abilities to dispatch load as well as maintain system reliability There was alot of discussion about forward purchase ability for utilities so as to be less subject to volatile market prices The concerns were also discussed about the appropriateness of a distribution utility making purchasing decisions on behalf of its customers This included discussion of separation of these functions and the default provider role Most everyone agreed that rolling back to a regulated market was not feasible without raising other major and serious concerns however there seemed to be support for some interim measures where costofservice regulation may be a good idea and that was during peak periods All agreed that a demand response and price signals are important in the longrun although not to the extent currently experienced in San Diego Todays panel included representatives from SDGE SCE and PGE TURN UCAN and ORA While yesterdays panel maintained objectivity as to whether or not generators were exercising market power to the detriment of the system todays panel made no bones about the generators being to blame SCEPGE indicated their need for relief for recovery of market costs in excess of the rate freeze SDGE was still on the hot seat for their inaction in hedging any of their supply SDGE brought up their failed PBR proposal and ORA and UCAN thought that that may be one way to incent the utility to be more responsible with their purchases UCAN discussed the Governors direction and the potential for putting rate caps into affect for residential and small commercial He mentioned that CI customers are experience difficulties as well TURN raised the need for costbased bid caps and costbased peaking contracts Mike Florio TURN urged against any further divestitute of assets and alleged market concentration on those assets that had been divested In fact TURN urged the Commission to seek legislation to clarify the Commissions authority to order retention of assets Neeper urged that part of the solution should be changing the current requirement to use the PX as the only authorized exchange although TURN disagreed Bruno Gaillard PM To SF Directors Edward ES Jennifer ES Chris ES Greg ES Harold G ES Martin ES Douglas ES James M ES Gary ES Dennis ES Roger ES David

Williamson Act passed the Senate It should be heard at the assembly Saturday or Monday if it is not redirected to a Committee hearing There was a long meeting with Ducheny with regards to AB The enviros boycotted they want to draft a bill with Keeley Labor was obstructionist they wanted to gut all the expediting siting language with regards to all facilities except for the peaking plants Rate Cap related bills The Edison Language on Rate Stabilization may not go anywhere Edison has not found an author because of the efforts of Enron and others lobbying against it Furthermore there are signs that Gov Davis opposes it The Governors office has issued a proposed language for a rate cap bill The language however is not available as of yet It may be released today or tomorrow SDGE has shown concerns over the content of the bill They seem to think that it is worse than initially proposed by the Governor in his press release The bill includes retroactive rate caps through The rate cap could reflect Woods rate cap proposal cts cap on the energy component The bill does not specify who or how the costs associated with the cap will be recovered The reasoning is that UDCs will be more cautious in their procurement if there is uncertainty on who is responsible for the costs All of this is speculative We hope to see the actual language soon Enron has been working with the Republican leadership to promote a rate cap proposal similar to the amended language we have proposed for AB The bill focuses only on SDGE customers and our major principals are the following The Interim Rate Cap should be limited to residential and small commercial customers plus specific institutions that have a significant public role such as schools and hospitals The Interim Rate Cap should be limited to the period ending December The Interim Rate Cap must be structured so that any undercollection is eventually recovered from the same customers who benefit from the lower rates provided by the rate cap

and AB expedited siting for nonpermanent peaking I had a conversation today with Wayne Sakarias from SDGE about implementation It appears based on the press release that the Commissi on will act tomorrow to adopt an order that will begin the implementation process although the order is not available for review yet I asked Wayne how they intended to implement the bill He believes that th e optin provision for large CI customers and any associated undercollectio ns associated with the customers that optin would be handled separately from the general application of the rate cap for residential and small commercia l customers I asked how they would collect any shortfalls It didnt soun d like they had a plan yet I suggested balancing account treatment for the customers that benefit from the optin with any shortfalls recovered as quickly as possible but no later than year Relative to ResSmall Commercial He said that SDGE will propose in response to ARM comments that the cap for res and small commercial customers would not disadvantage DA customers In other words they are concerned about the appearances that SDGEs rates would be lower than market prices because of the cap and woul d make available to DA customers a comparable pricing mechanism that in effect would eliminate any pricing advantage by staying w SDGE For example If prevailing market prices were centskWh SDGEs res a nd small commercial customers would only be charged upto cents and DA customers would receive a centkWh credit against their TD charges so th at in effect there is no economic advantage to staying w SDGE However wh en it comes time to pay the piper for undercollections DA and bundled custome rs would again be treated comparably Their BIG concern is that the Commission will hang them out to dry on reasonableness We agreed to keep the dialogue open Things will likely happen quickly I f folks have any recommendations or see problems with the above let me know asap Thanks

Press Release OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR L FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE September GOVERNOR DAVIS SIGNS ELECTRICITY CONSUMER RELIEF LEGISLATION SACRAMENTO Governor Gray Davis continued his commitment to easing the burden of San Diego ratepayers by signing two major pieces of legislation designed to stabilize the cost of electricity and streamline the siting process for new power plants One of the major achievements of this years legislative session is our aggressive response to Californias energy challenge Governor Davis said My Administration did not create this problem but we are percent committed to solving it And now after a long hot summer of unconscionab ly high energy prices relief is finally on the way AB by Assemblywoman Susan Davis DSan Diego and Senator Deirdre Alper t DCoronado will stabilize the price of electricity for consumers and smal l business including schools and hospitals in San Diego at cents per kilowatthour These rates will be retroactive from June and extend to December In the short term this will ease the uncertainty of San Diego energy prices Governor Davis said When it comes to predicting their electric bills San Diego consumers have been in the dark long enough This is an urgency measure I am signing this bill today so that the PUC can take immediate action at its meeting tomorrow As a result of this legislation the average monthly bill for residential customers in San Diego will be reduced to Small businesses all school s and acutecare hospitals are included will pay an average monthly bill of Medium businesses consuming up to kilowatthours a month wou ld also have a price cap of cents per kilowatthour For large businesses AB would allow for a negotiated payment plan with SDGE over a longer period of time AB by Assemblywoman Denise Ducheny DSan Diego and Assemblyman Jim Battin RLa Quinta will help California overcome the inadequate supply of energy one of the biggest obstacles to lower energy prices by expediting the siting process for new power plants and streamlining permitting for upgrades of old facilities Restrictions and red tape have presented a powerful disincentive to those who would build more power generators in California Governor Davis said This bill will benefit consumers by increasing supply to meet growing demand It will also establish new programs to reduce demand Over the last three months Governor Gray Davis leadership has been demonstrated in his response to the San Diego electricity crisis On June he called for emergency reduction of electricity use by all sta te facilities in the San Francisco Bay area in response to electricity emergen cy and rolling blackouts On June he called on chairpersons of the Public Utilities Commission PUC to analyze the conditions that led to electricity shortages in the Sa n Francisco Bay area the previous day including a statewide perspective on t he price and delivery of electricity Report was completed submitted to the governor and released on August On July Governor Davis called on federal and state regulators to take swift action to extend the caps on wholesale electric rates in California and provide San Diego ratepayers with million of dollars in refunds In letters written by the governor to two state regulatory agencies and two Californiabased panels charged with overseeing Californias power market he called for a coordinated state effort to urge federal regulators to take strong measures to reduce power rates in both the short and longterm On August Governor Davis issued three Executive Orders designed to reduce energy consumption by state government and speed up the time it take s new power generating facilities to win approval from state agencies Please go to briefingexecorderindexshtm to view copi es of Governor Davis Executive Orders On August Governor Davis called on the Public Utilities Commission PUC to establish a twoyear plan that would cut electricity rates by near ly half for residential and business customers of San Diego Gas Electric The governor also reached an agreement with the California Grocers Association that will save enough electricity to provide power to between and homes during periods of peak demand as grocers agreed to reduce power consumption by percent during Stage One emergencies On August Governor Davis wrote a letter to President Clinton urgi ng him to expedite the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions investigation to determine whether current electric rates in San Diego were unjust On August Governor Davis called on President Clinton to release emergency funds from the LowIncome Home Energy Assistance Program LIHEAP to the state to help lowincome Californians pay their rapidlyrising electricity bills On August President Clinton responded to Governor Davis request by releasing million in emergency funds to help lowincome Southern Californians cope with the surge in their electricity bills The president also asked federal regulators to speed up their investigation into the operation of US power markets and urged the Small Business Administration to use its credit programs to help small firms hurt by the price increases On August Governor Davis reached agreement with legislators on legislation to provide relief to San Diego ratepayers Todays bill signing is the culmination of that agreement GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS

PM To Michael CT Laird CT David CT Samuel CT cc West GA James D nron Subject ERC Auctions The attached memo from Goodin McBride summarizes the regulatory treatment of PGEs emission credits to date It is an interesting animal Basically PGE has kept most of the credits therefore has not divested the credits with the generating assets However these assets have been acquired for nothing therefore they have no regulatory value In other words their costs are not part of PGEs rate base and are not being recovered from ratepayers PGE has issued RFPs for sales auction of the credits in the past The credits have been sold to Duke Moss Landing and to Southern and Calpine for Morro Bay and Oakland facilities They were priceonly bids The aftertax proceeds went to benefit ratepayers through reducing the overall CTC All of these sales necessitated an application transfer of utility asset but it appears these transfers went without a hitch ORA supported the mechanism There was no CEQA requirement on the basis that the credits were associated with an existing facility or that a new or modified facility would acquire appropriate air emissions permits If PGE were to keep the ERCs it would need to file a utility retention and show that it is in the public interest for the utility to retain Considering that the utility appears to have no real use for the credits it would be a difficult showing The credits do not appear to be part of PGEs settlement proposal to transfer the hydro assets to its affiliate So PGE has sold the credits in the past They have been sold to new owners of PGE facilities The big questions is how can we encourage PGE to initiate another sale Their shareholders get no real benefit as it appears likely that PGE can recover all of their CTCs pending valuation of their hydro facilities I would suggest that we approach PGE on their willingness to auction a portion of these credits on a comparable basis to its other auctions Ive asked Mike to ascertain the amount of time involved with the previous auctions If this cooperative approach does not succeed we can discuss the possibility of applying some regulatory pressure to the valuation of the remaining credits We may also want to look at other agencies that may be anxious for the release of hoarded credits like CEC especially if such hoarding prevents new generation developments from coming on line

ES Subject HumboldtAttorneyClient Privilege After a conversation today with Dave Kates he asked me to outline some process and regulatory avenues as it relates to Humboldt It appears as though early conversations have the same problems that we encountered with other projects There appears to be no internal coordination on the project The estimates for the interconnection study are outrageous There is no evidence of a commitment from PGE to work with us cooperatively Sandi and David Parquet had met several weeks ago with Dede Hapner about various projects and the desire to work more cooperatively on interconnection issues David indicated at that meeting that if PGE is not willing to cooperate we will not abandon some of these projects After the last meeting David Parquet contacted Jim Randolph Sr VP about the possibility of an MOU between PGE and Enron This would go toward the intent to work with Enron on interconnection isues It appears as though there has been a committee formed within PGE supposedly to provide internal coordination However it is still not clear whether that committee has been given the internal direction to cooperate with us Obtaining agreement high within PGEs senior management is key to the success of this project I like the idea of an MOU We should ascertain soon PGEs willingness to pursue such an agreement Assuming we receive some positive indication from high with PGEs management I believe we need to drive the process and establish time lines by which we need information with status check points along the way This will include points by which we can rightfully stop negotiations if PGE fails to deliver its obligations in a meaningful way MikeJeanne any legal impediments to PGE entering into an MOU with us for purposes of negotiating an interconnection Are there regulatory pressures we can leverage We have not intervened in the Humboldt application filed by PGE I will find out what if any protests have been filed and by whom My guess is that this will be a low level proceeding in terms of interested parties so leverage opportunities are probably low PGE has determined the value of its existing gasfired facilities at around million Our project is reliant upon PGE shutting down those facilities If PGE is unwilling to do so that is essentially the end of the story If however PGE would accept a payment from Enron equal to its remaining book value in exchange for shutting down its facilities then our project has a chance pending the interconnection study As there is no transfer of utility facility I wouldnt think there would be a necessity for additional filings ie Section or MikeJeanne PGE and ratepayers should be neutral In fact ratepayers may be better off in the longrun because the new facilities would be much more efficient than the existing facilities I would assume the new facilities emissions would be lower Currently PGEs facilities are probably worth more in todays market than their filing indicates However raising the price would not benefit PGEs shareholders as they are likely to recover all of their CTCs subject to hydro valuation Revenues in excess of net book would go to ratepayers SUMMARY We need PGEs cooperation I think regulatory leverage is probably low Will followup with any regulatory impediments that I receive from MikeJeanne relative to PGE shutting down its existing facilities

UDCs face elimination of some of the advantages that they have in the retail market We now have a fullyconstituted commission members with two new democratic appointees with close ties to the governor This may empower the CPUC to take control of issues within their purvue which ratemaking and the PX credit clearly are Some members of the legislature are loathe to get into the CPUCs backyard and micromanage That being said we still face significant risk within the legislature We have Steve Peace who thinks a wholesale passthrough is adequate for competition and Rod Wright the chair of the Assembly Utilities and Commerce Committee who sponsored a similar bill last year and who doesnt believe in retail competition either We have our work cut out for us Last year we fought essentially the same battle and defeated the utilities at attempts to include similar provisions into law for electricity We were able to do so because we had a broad coalition of supporters including the environmental community Essentially everyone opposed the utilities proposals This year we have a different scenario SCE is attempting to peel off environmental groups by rolling in extension of the public purpose funding They are also talking to the large consumers who may perceive that they are able to get a better deal from the utilities by avoiding the markup However it doesnt appear as though the utilities are united in supporting SCEs language We are actively attempting to revive the coalition that was so effective last year We are talking to the environmental groups to try and keep them in the fold This can be done by keeping the two issues of public purpose funding and competition as separate as possible We have been encouraged to settle the PX credit case by the judge We are engaged in the beginning stages of settlement on the PX credit issue with SDGE We are a long way from settling however if we are successful the settlement would likely be precedential for both SCE and PGE There is significant room between the utility proposals for the retail portion of the PX credit and what we are supporting We also appear to have the support of the ratepayer advocates We are attempting to get the customer groups to agree on an outcome leaving the utilities isolated Adoption of our proposal for the full retail adder is a longshot From a timing perspective it is possible that we will resolve this issue at the PUC before any legislation would become effective However that would not prevent the legislation from estopping the CPUC decision We could use the help of the business units in providing documented information about the UDCs activities if its available Customer accounts are very credible however most customers are unwilling to do that We may also need some assistance from the business units in presenting testimony when these issues go to hearing before the appropriate committees We are working on this issue and will report on any developments Thanks Jim

Paul CT Subject Re Re SCE Legislative Language This is a blatant example of marketing on behalf of SCE Of course SCE does this stuff under the guise of Customer Education Do we have anything in writing provided by SCE that Enron Govt Affairs can provide to the CPUC as examples of marketing activities whereby the costs of these types of activities should be unbundled from the distribution rate Of course there is no markup what so ever because the cost of providing retail commodity is recovered in distribution rates Enron Govt Affairs is currently participating in a proceeding as part of a coalition to determine what this commodity cost adder should be Additionally the reason there is no premium markup for risk management is because these costs are all pass throughs so there is no price certainty for the customer In fact there will be price volatility from monthtomonth if not hourtohour We do not want to push this last point to much to the extent that the customers rally at the CPUC to eliminate the volatility along with the price signals in favor of interclass and intertemporal subsidies Roger Kelly Cook PM To Bruno ES cc Thomas S ES Jim ES Janel ES Lisa CT Jeff ES Douglas ES Martin ES Phyllis ES Roger ES Harry ES Susan J ES Jeff ES Mona L ES Sandra ES Paul CT Subject Re SCE Legislative Language As you would expect SCE is out telling customers that the proposed legislative language regarding default electric service is a done deal The relevant text in Brunos message below is as follows SCE believes that the UDC should be the default provider and offer commodity at a pass through PX price with no adders Apparently SCE is going one step further than a straight pass through of PX day ahead prices with no adders when in front of industry trade groups A potential EES customer has told me that since John Fiedler Sr VP of Regulatory Policy and Affairs for SCE has spoken at both CMA and CLECA meetings and presented with great assurance that in the post transition period SCE will purchase both long term and short term energy and pass through a blended wholesale energy cost with no markup to large enduse customers My interpretation is that such an offering by SCE would put them in direct competition with ESPs Kelly Bruno Gaillard AM To Thomas S ES Jim ES Janel ES Lisa CT Jeff ES Douglas ES Martin ES Phyllis ES Kelly ES Roger ES Harry ES cc Susan J ES Jeff ES Mona L ES Sandra ES Paul CT Subject Re SCE Legeslative Language SCE has submitted proposed legislative language at the California Legislation that will define the role of the utility This language has not yet found a bill However in order to be prepared Sandi McCubbin has asked me to forward the proposed language for analysis Bellow is a preliminary analysis of the bill and of our position Please expand edit and complete for legislative action Please foward to appropreate people for comments Summary SCE is defining the basic electric service to include Distribution Metering Billing and Customer Service SCE believes that the UDC should be the default provider and offer commodity at a pass through PX price with no adders Every customer will be charged a nonbypassable charge for basic electric service customer charge and a nonbypassable public goods charge Energy efficiency low income RD and renewable charge Renewable charge includes funding for production credits for renewable not under contract with utility mandatory state purchase of renewable energy minimum utility content of renewable energy PX green product Customer credit for Renewables not under contract with the utility DA customers can choose billing and metering services from their ESP and will receive an avoided cost credit from the UDC for these services Analysis SCE is trying to preempt through the legislation the role of the utility to be a Wires and Revenue Cycle Services RCS company Furthermore they see themselves as being a default provider and offer electric commodity at the wholesale price undermining any kind of competition from ESPs Their definition of what is included in the renewable credit again undermines any competition for ESPs in offering these products Furthermore although SCE allows ESPs to offer metering and billing services the credit ESPs can receive is based on an avoided cost The CPUC is currently presiding over a proceeding in which it is trying to unbundle RCS At a minimum the credits for billing and metering services should be based on Long Run Marginal Costs Position Actively Oppose The UDC should be a wires only company For a UDC Basic Electric Service should only include the distribution of the electric power and should be renamed as Basic Electric Distribution Service Revenue Cycle Services metering billing should be unbundled from the distribution function Costs allocated to these functions should be based at a minimum on a Long Run Marginal Costs or Embedded Costs The Avoided Costs allocation does not represent all the costs associated with these services The default provider function should be competitively bid out to ESPs and nonregulated affiliates The UDCs should be out of the energy service business including all electric retail functions The commodity charge for default customers should include the PX price all procurement related costs and retail marketing related costs Currently the green market is the only viable market in CA for small consumers This proposal would eliminate the competitive market and ensure marketshare dominance for UDC and PX SCEs proposal would limit or seriously restrict the development of the market to only UDCprovided green products of PXprovided green products This structure creates a subsidy for both the UDCs and the PX for green products which would disadvantage competitive offerings for the amount under contract providing the UDC with a guaranteed baseload of greenproduct demand The market available to competitors for green would be only the demand in excess of the base for which customers not ESPs would receive a credit from the UDC for the incremental green demand Again because the UDC would be in the position of doling out credits for green they would still control that market Attached is a copy of SCEs draft language

Motion for authori ty to enter into bilateral contracts The decision directs to enter into bilateral agreements that will expire by It provides similar reasonableness guidance as provided to SCE bilateral contracts must be within of actual annual procurement costs The draft decision rejects SDGEs request to allocate those contracts to residential and small commercial customers It rejects SDGEs request for an exemption from the affiliate rules which would have allowed SDGE to enter into bilateral agreements with its trading affiliate without posting those transactions or providing an opportunity for a bid process Because this decision adopts the same principles in the SCE and PGE Decisions I give a low probability to changing the decision language However if folks would still like us to weigh in on an issue please let m e know asap Thanks Mona Forwarded by Mona L PetrochkoSFOEES on PM Daniel Douglass rterHaddencom on PM To om cc Subject Draft Decision Issued in SDGE Emergency Motion ALJ Cooke has issued the attached draft decision with regard to the August emergency motion filed by SDGE to enter into bilateral power contracts SDGE sought similar authority to that granted to Edison and PGE in D The draft decision would grant the motion but would impose certain conditions different from those requested by the utility The differences are summarized below Background Under the terms of the Commissions D SDGE is currently authorized to participate in the PX forward markets for energy services subject to seasonal trading limits through the end of the last utility ra te freeze SDGE is not proposing an increase to the limits approved in D and will treat its capacity purchases under those limits although it reserves the right to request expanded authority in the future The draft decision also notes that SDGE proposes that costs associated with and gainslosses from these bilateral contracts should be attributed only to small commercial and residential customers It also notes that intervenors focused on four general areas of concern regarding the specifi c authority requested by SDGE duration of contracts reasonableness standards request for exemption from affiliate rules and ratemaking Duration of Contracts SDGE requested authority to enter into bilateral contracts that expire on or before December The ALJ notes that the Commission recently instituted an investigation into the impact of the functioning of the wholesale electric market on retail rates in SDGEs service territory and that the OII will consider whether SDGE should be removed from that defau lt provider role The ALJ states that the Commission should not compromise future longterm solutions by affording SDGE greater purchasing authority than is needed to address the current emergency situation For this reaso n we limit SDGEs authority to what we described in D as near term bilateral contracting authority that is contracts with delivery occurrin g on or before December Reasonableness Standards The draft decision suggests that the OII provides a forum to establish a common framework for all three utilities for determining the reasonablenes s of their bilateral purchases However in the interim it adopts the same reasonableness standard for nearterm contracts as it did for SCE If th e average price of SDGEs bilateral transactions delivered or requiring delivery over the course of an annual period exceeds the average price of SDGEs corresponding portfolio of transactions delivered or requiring deliver over the same period by more than then the Commission will initiate a reasonableness review Reasonableness reviews to the extent needed will take place as part of SDGEs Annual Transition Cost Proceeding Affiliate Rules Exemption SDGEs request to be exempted from the affiliate rules for any purchases from affiliates was denied Ratemaking TURN urged the Commission to reject SDGEs request to limit the ratema king impacts of the bilateral contracts to its residential and small commercial customers saying that the potential risks and benefits should be spread among all customers The draft decision states that we do not believe it prudent to limit the cost exposure for these contracts solely to residenti al and small commercial customers This aspect of SDGEs motion is denie d Transparency Considerations The ALJ orders SDGE to disclose all bilateral transactions to the Energy Division on a confidential basis in a monthly report The draft decision notes that WPTF and ARM argue that additional transparency of bilateral transactions is required compared to that proposed by SDGE We adopt consistent disclosure standards for SDGE bilateral contracts as that adopted in D for PGE and SCE This issue may be revisited on a going forward basis in I Response Time The normal response time has been shortened Parties to the proceeding ma y file comments on the draft decision no later than noon on September I suggest that comments be filed agreeing with the thrust of the decision but strongly advocating that SDGE be required to publicly post its transactions as it agreed to do in Advice Letter E with regard to SDGEs participation in the Block Forward Market In addition we should consider whether to refight the issue of limiting the ratemaking impacts o f the bilateral contracts to SDGEs residential and small commercial customers Comments or suggestions Dan ALJ Cooke Draft Decisiondoc

UDCs face elimination of some of the advantages that they have in the retail market We now have a fullyconstituted commission members with two new democratic appointees with close ties to the governor This may empower the CPUC to take control of issues within their purvue which ratemaking and the PX credit clearly are Some members of the legislature are loathe to get into the CPUCs backyard and micromanage That being said we still face significant risk within the legislature We have Steve Peace who thinks a wholesale passthrough is adequate for competition and Rod Wright the chair of the Assembly Utilities and Commerce Committee who sponsored a similar bill last year and who doesnt believe in retail competition either We have our work cut out for us Last year we fought essentially the same battle and defeated the utilities at attempts to include similar provisions into law for electricity We were able to do so because we had a broad coalition of supporters including the environmental community Essentially everyone opposed the utilities proposals This year we have a different scenario SCE is attempting to peel off environmental groups by rolling in extension of the public purpose funding They are also talking to the large consumers who may perceive that they are able to get a better deal from the utilities by avoiding the markup However it doesnt appear as though the utilities are united in supporting SCEs language We are actively attempting to revive the coalition that was so effective last year We are talking to the environmental groups to try and keep them in the fold This can be done by keeping the two issues of public purpose funding and competition as separate as possible We have been encouraged to settle the PX credit case by the judge We are engaged in the beginning stages of settlement on the PX credit issue with SDGE We are a long way from settling however if we are successful the settlement would likely be precedential for both SCE and PGE There is significant room between the utility proposals for the retail portion of the PX credit and what we are supporting We also appear to have the support of the ratepayer advocates We are attempting to get the customer groups to agree on an outcome leaving the utilities isolated Adoption of our proposal for the full retail adder is a longshot From a timing perspective it is possible that we will resolve this issue at the PUC before any legislation would become effective However that would not prevent the legislation from estopping the CPUC decision We could use the help of the business units in providing documented information about the UDCs activities if its available Customer accounts are very credible however most customers are unwilling to do that We may also need some assistance from the business units in presenting testimony when these issues go to hearing before the appropriate committees We are working on this issue and will report on any developments Thanks Jim

writing provided by SCE that Enron Govt Affairs can provide to the CPUC as examples of marketing activities whereby the costs of these types of activities should be unbundled from the distribution rate Of course there is no markup what so ever because the cost of providing retail commodity is recovered in distribution rates Enron Govt Affairs is currently participating in a proceeding as part of a coalition to determine what this commodity cost adder should be Additionally the reason there is no premium markup for risk management is because these costs are all pass throughs so there is no price certainty for the customer In fact there will be price volatility from monthtomonth if not hourtohour We do not want to push this last point to much to the extent that the customers rally at the CPUC to eliminate the volatility along with the price signals in favor of interclass and intertemporal subsidies Roger Kelly Cook PM To Bruno ES cc Thomas S ES Jim ES Janel ES Lisa CT Jeff ES Douglas ES Martin ES Phyllis ES Roger ES Harry ES Susan J ES Jeff ES Mona L ES Sandra ES Paul CT Subject Re SCE Legislative Language As you would expect SCE is out telling customers that the proposed legislative language regarding default electric service is a done deal The relevant text in Brunos message below is as follows SCE believes that the UDC should be the default provider and offer commodity at a pass through PX price with no adders Apparently SCE is going one step further than a straight pass through of PX day ahead prices with no adders when in front of industry trade groups A potential EES customer has told me that since John Fiedler Sr VP of Regulatory Policy and Affairs for SCE has spoken at both CMA and CLECA meetings and presented with great assurance that in the post transition period SCE will purchase both long term and short term energy and pass through a blended wholesale energy cost with no markup to large enduse customers My interpretation is that such an offering by SCE would put them in direct competition with ESPs Kelly Bruno Gaillard AM To Thomas S ES Jim ES Janel ES Lisa CT Jeff ES Douglas ES Martin ES Phyllis ES Kelly ES Roger ES Harry ES cc Susan J ES Jeff ES Mona L ES Sandra ES Paul CT Subject Re SCE Legeslative Language SCE has submitted proposed legislative language at the California Legislation that will define the role of the utility This language has not yet found a bill However in order to be prepared Sandi McCubbin has asked me to forward the proposed language for analysis Bellow is a preliminary analysis of the bill and of our position Please expand edit and complete for legislative action Please foward to appropreate people for comments Summary SCE is defining the basic electric service to include Distribution Metering Billing and Customer Service SCE believes that the UDC should be the default provider and offer commodity at a pass through PX price with no adders Every customer will be charged a nonbypassable charge for basic electric service customer charge and a nonbypassable public goods charge Energy efficiency low income RD and renewable charge Renewable charge includes funding for production credits for renewable not under contract with utility mandatory state purchase of renewable energy minimum utility content of renewable energy PX green product Customer credit for Renewables not under contract with the utility DA customers can choose billing and metering services from their ESP and will receive an avoided cost credit from the UDC for these services Analysis SCE is trying to preempt through the legislation the role of the utility to be a Wires and Revenue Cycle Services RCS company Furthermore they see themselves as being a default provider and offer electric commodity at the wholesale price undermining any kind of competition from ESPs Their definition of what is included in the renewable credit again undermines any competition for ESPs in offering these products Furthermore although SCE allows ESPs to offer metering and billing services the credit ESPs can receive is based on an avoided cost The CPUC is currently presiding over a proceeding in which it is trying to unbundle RCS At a minimum the credits for billing and metering services should be based on Long Run Marginal Costs Position Actively Oppose The UDC should be a wires only company For a UDC Basic Electric Service should only include the distribution of the electric power and should be renamed as Basic Electric Distribution Service Revenue Cycle Services metering billing should be unbundled from the distribution function Costs allocated to these functions should be based at a minimum on a Long Run Marginal Costs or Embedded Costs The Avoided Costs allocation does not represent all the costs associated with these services The default provider function should be competitively bid out to ESPs and nonregulated affiliates The UDCs should be out of the energy service business including all electric retail functions The commodity charge for default customers should include the PX price all procurement related costs and retail marketing related costs Currently the green market is the only viable market in CA for small consumers This proposal would eliminate the competitive market and ensure marketshare dominance for UDC and PX SCEs proposal would limit or seriously restrict the development of the market to only UDCprovided green products of PXprovided green products This structure creates a subsidy for both the UDCs and the PX for green products which would disadvantage competitive offerings for the amount under contract providing the UDC with a guaranteed baseload of greenproduct demand The market available to competitors for green would be only the demand in excess of the base for which customers not ESPs would receive a credit from the UDC for the incremental green demand Again because the UDC would be in the position of doling out credits for green they would still control that market Attached is a copy of SCEs draft language

and AB expedited siting for nonpermanent peaking I had a conversation today with Wayne Sakarias from SDGE about implementation It appears based on the press release that the Commissi on will act tomorrow to adopt an order that will begin the implementation process although the order is not available for review yet I asked Wayne how they intended to implement the bill He believes that th e optin provision for large CI customers and any associated undercollectio ns associated with the customers that optin would be handled separately from the general application of the rate cap for residential and small commercia l customers I asked how they would collect any shortfalls It didnt soun d like they had a plan yet I suggested balancing account treatment for the customers that benefit from the optin with any shortfalls recovered as quickly as possible but no later than year Relative to ResSmall Commercial He said that SDGE will propose in response to ARM comments that the cap for res and small commercial customers would not disadvantage DA customers In other words they are concerned about the appearances that SDGEs rates would be lower than market prices because of the cap and woul d make available to DA customers a comparable pricing mechanism that in effect would eliminate any pricing advantage by staying w SDGE For example If prevailing market prices were centskWh SDGEs res a nd small commercial customers would only be charged upto cents and DA customers would receive a centkWh credit against their TD charges so th at in effect there is no economic advantage to staying w SDGE However wh en it comes time to pay the piper for undercollections DA and bundled custome rs would again be treated comparably Their BIG concern is that the Commission will hang them out to dry on reasonableness We agreed to keep the dialogue open Things will likely happen quickly I f folks have any recommendations or see problems with the above let me know asap Thanks

to solving it And now after a long hot summer of unconscionab ly high energy prices relief is finally on the way AB by Assemblywoman Susan Davis DSan Diego and Senator Deirdre Alper t DCoronado will stabilize the price of electricity for consumers and smal l business including schools and hospitals in San Diego at cents per kilowatthour These rates will be retroactive from June and extend to December In the short term this will ease the uncertainty of San Diego energy prices Governor Davis said When it comes to predicting their electric bills San Diego consumers have been in the dark long enough This is an urgency measure I am signing this bill today so that the PUC can take immediate action at its meeting tomorrow As a result of this legislation the average monthly bill for

PM To Michael CT Laird CT David CT Samuel CT cc West GA James D nron Subject ERC Auctions The attached memo from Goodin McBride summarizes the regulatory treatment of PGEs emission credits to date It is an interesting animal Basically PGE has kept most of the credits therefore has not divested the credits with the generating assets However these assets have been acquired for nothing therefore they have no regulatory value In other words their costs are not part of PGEs rate base and are not being recovered from ratepayers PGE has issued RFPs for sales auction of the credits in the past The credits have been sold to Duke Moss Landing and to Southern and Calpine for Morro Bay and Oakland facilities They were priceonly bids The aftertax proceeds went to benefit ratepayers through reducing the overall CTC All of these sales necessitated an application transfer of utility asset but it appears these transfers went without a hitch ORA supported the mechanism There was no CEQA requirement on the basis that the credits were associated with an existing facility or that a new or modified facility would acquire appropriate air emissions permits If PGE were to keep the ERCs it would need to file a utility retention and show that it is in the public interest for the utility to retain Considering that the utility appears to have no real use for the credits it would be a difficult showing The credits do not appear to be part of PGEs settlement proposal to transfer the hydro assets to its affiliate So PGE has sold the credits in the past They have been sold to new owners of PGE facilities The big questions is how can we encourage PGE to initiate another sale Their shareholders get no real benefit as it appears likely that PGE can recover all of their CTCs pending valuation of their hydro facilities I would suggest that we approach PGE on their willingness to auction a portion of these credits on a comparable basis to its other auctions Ive asked Mike to ascertain the amount of time involved with the previous auctions If this cooperative approach does not succeed we can discuss the possibility of applying some regulatory pressure to the valuation of the remaining credits We may also want to look at other agencies that may be anxious for the release of hoarded credits like CEC especially if such hoarding prevents new generation developments from coming on line

ES Subject HumboldtAttorneyClient Privilege After a conversation today with Dave Kates he asked me to outline some process and regulatory avenues as it relates to Humboldt It appears as though early conversations have the same problems that we encountered with other projects There appears to be no internal coordination on the project The estimates for the interconnection study are outrageous There is no evidence of a commitment from PGE to work with us cooperatively Sandi and David Parquet had met several weeks ago with Dede Hapner about various projects and the desire to work more cooperatively on interconnection issues David indicated at that meeting that if PGE is not willing to cooperate we will not abandon some of these projects After the last meeting David Parquet contacted Jim Randolph Sr VP about the possibility of an MOU between PGE and Enron This would go toward the intent to work with Enron on interconnection isues It appears as though there has been a committee formed within PGE supposedly to provide internal coordination However it is still not clear whether that committee has been given the internal direction to cooperate with us Obtaining agreement high within PGEs senior management is key to the success of this project I like the idea of an MOU We should ascertain soon PGEs willingness to pursue such an agreement Assuming we receive some positive indication from high with PGEs management I believe we need to drive the process and establish time lines by which we need information with status check points along the way This will include points by which we can rightfully stop negotiations if PGE fails to deliver its obligations in a meaningful way MikeJeanne any legal impediments to PGE entering into an MOU with us for purposes of negotiating an interconnection Are there regulatory pressures we can leverage We have not intervened in the Humboldt application filed by PGE I will find out what if any protests have been filed and by whom My guess is that this will be a low level proceeding in terms of interested parties so leverage opportunities are probably low PGE has determined the value of its existing gasfired facilities at around million Our project is reliant upon PGE shutting down those facilities If PGE is unwilling to do so that is essentially the end of the story If however PGE would accept a payment from Enron equal to its remaining book value in exchange for shutting down its facilities then our project has a chance pending the interconnection study As there is no transfer of utility facility I wouldnt think there would be a necessity for additional filings ie Section or MikeJeanne PGE and ratepayers should be neutral In fact ratepayers may be better off in the longrun because the new facilities would be much more efficient than the existing facilities I would assume the new facilities emissions would be lower Currently PGEs facilities are probably worth more in todays market than their filing indicates However raising the price would not benefit PGEs shareholders as they are likely to recover all of their CTCs subject to hydro valuation Revenues in excess of net book would go to ratepayers SUMMARY We need PGEs cooperation I think regulatory leverage is probably low Will followup with any regulatory impediments that I receive from MikeJeanne relative to PGE shutting down its existing facilities

the terms of the Commissions D SDGE is currently authorized to participate in the PX forward markets for energy services subject to seasonal trading limits through the end of the last utility ra te freeze SDGE is not proposing an increase to the limits approved in D and will treat its capacity purchases under those limits although it reserves the right to request expanded authority in the future The draft decision also notes that SDGE proposes that costs associated with and gainslosses from these bilateral contracts should be attributed only to small commercial and residential customers It also notes that intervenors focused on four general areas of concern regarding the specifi c authority requested by SDGE duration of contracts reasonableness standards request for exemption from affiliate rules and ratemaking Duration of Contracts SDGE requested authority to enter into bilateral contracts that expire on or before December The ALJ notes that the Commission recently instituted an investigation into the impact of the functioning of the wholesale electric market on retail rates in SDGEs service territory and that the OII will consider whether SDGE should be removed from that defau lt provider role The ALJ states that the Commission should not compromise future longterm solutions by affording SDGE greater purchasing authority than is needed to address the current emergency situation For this reaso n we limit SDGEs authority to what we described in D as near term bilateral contracting authority that is contracts with delivery occurrin g on or before December Reasonableness Standards The draft decision suggests that the OII provides a forum to establish a common framework for all three utilities for determining the reasonablenes s of their bilateral purchases However in the interim it adopts the same reasonableness standard for nearterm contracts as it did for SCE If th e average price of SDGEs bilateral transactions delivered or requiring delivery over the course of an annual period exceeds the average price of SDGEs corresponding portfolio of transactions delivered or requiring deliver over the same period by more than then the Commission will initiate a reasonableness review Reasonableness reviews to the extent needed will take place as part of SDGEs Annual Transition Cost Proceeding Affiliate Rules Exemption SDGEs request to be exempted from the affiliate rules for any purchases from affiliates was denied Ratemaking TURN urged the Commission to reject SDGEs request to limit the ratema king impacts of the bilateral contracts to its residential and small commercial customers saying that the potential risks and benefits should be spread among all customers The draft decision states that we do not believe it prudent to limit the cost exposure for these contracts solely to residenti al and small commercial customers This aspect of SDGEs motion is denie d Transparency Considerations The ALJ orders SDGE to disclose all bilateral transactions to the Energy Division on a confidential basis in a monthly report The draft decision notes that WPTF and ARM argue that additional transparency of bilateral transactions is required compared to that proposed by SDGE We adopt consistent disclosure standards for SDGE bilateral contracts as that adopted in D for PGE and SCE This issue may be revisited on a going forward basis in I Response Time The normal response time has been shortened Parties to the proceeding ma y file comments on the draft decision no later than noon on September I suggest that comments be filed agreeing with the thrust of the decision but strongly advocating that SDGE be required to publicly post its transactions as it agreed to do in Advice Letter E with regard to SDGEs participation in the Block Forward Market In addition we should consider whether to refight the issue of limiting the ratemaking impacts o f the bilateral contracts to SDGEs residential and small commercial customers Comments or suggestions Dan ALJ Cooke Draft Decisiondoc
