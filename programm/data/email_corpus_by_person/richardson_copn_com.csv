<14127028.1075840383187.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,richardson@copn.com,2002-01-09 12:19:50,Judge Rosenthals Order entered this morning Cc PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL Mike Peterson asked me to send you the following note with attached order Attached is an Order signed yesterday and entered this morning by Judge Rosenthal on Plaintiffs Motion for TRO and Preliminary Injunctive Relief including a freeze of defendants insider trading proceeds ie the matter on which there was a hearing with attendant media hoopla last month You probably recall that at the end of the hearing Judge Rosenthal asked for briefing on a rather arcane legal point concerning whether or not the Court had authority to issue the requested preliminary relief and the parties submitted briefs on this matter on December and December In the attached Order Judge Rosenthal concludes that the Court does have the requisite authority but the present record does not contain evidence warranting a freeze of any individual defendants proceeds from the sale of Enron stock You might take further comfort from two additional points in the Courts opinion a at several places the Court clearly indicates that any freeze or other such injunctive relief as to any defendant would have to be predicated on an individualized evidentiary showing as to that defendant and b the Court indicates that plaintiffs would have to satisfy a very difficult tracing requirement to establish a right to a constructive trust or freeze ie trace a specific asset or fund of money held by any defendant back to the profits of an improper insider trade The aspects of the Courts opinion that arguably are favorable to the plaintiffs are a the discussion of an equitable accounting wherein the Court suggests that the plaintiffs might be able to satisfy the requirements for an order that defendants account for profits earned by trading Enron securities between October and November and b providing an opportunity through January for plaintiffs to file a brief addressing whatever expedited discovery they believe they are entitled to as to the individual defendants particularly as to Kenneth Lay Jeffrey Skilling and Andrew Fastow We will of course advise you of any further developments Mike Peterson As always please do not hesitate to call or email us if you have questions or comments Terri This email and any attached files may be confidential and subject to attorneyclient privilege If you received it in error please immediately notify the sender by return email or by calling
