energy program Stacey filed two sets of comments with the PUC and subsequently met with Chairman Wood Commissioner Judy Walsh and Evan Roe staffer to Commissioner Perlman to discuss environmental reporting and the trading program Hap Boyd was also in the meeting We got nearly everything we wanted in the renewable energy protocol except for emission data on the credit itself Stacey will

business opportunities for the Enron busniess units Pipeline safety legislation Jeff Keeler is working with members of Congress and others in industry on a strategy that would get the House of Representatives to pass the pipeline safety legislation recently passed by the Senate This strategy avoids several procedural steps in Congress and allows the House to pass a bill that is fairly acceptable to industry rather than waiting for the House to produce its own bill and move it independently This is a very fluid situation right now but we hope to have a positive result by next week MTBE legislation the Senate Environment Committee passed MTBE legislation last week containing a number of provisions that are bad for MTBE producers including a ban of MTBE granting states the ability to waive the fuel oxygen standard and mandating increased ethanol use over years Two Enron amendments were voted on liability protection and an MTBE producer transition retrofit fund and defeated but Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison received a commitment that transition fund issue would be addressed before the bill moves on to the Senate floor Jeff will be working on this issue with

Source Review rules A is expected by an EPA Administrative Appeals Board on in which TVA will likely lose TVA is appealing in Federal Court arguments to be held in early November Intelligence on this is extremely important to several Enron business units as much of the electric utililty industry is watching to see whether EPA can prevail in its enforcement activities against coal plants and utilities future decisions about fuel choice control technologies etc could be affected by action in this case EPA enforcement activities we have learned that EPA is now targeting nonutility coalfired boilers in Pennsylvania for New Source Review enforcement We will be providing more detailed information to traders that could find opportunities from this action as well as Enron originators

the EPAs appeal of the NAAQ S hour standard case which will be heard by the Supreme Court on November even though one case held for EPA and the other against If the Court decides the two cases are

acceptable to industry rather than waiting for the House to produce its own bill and move it independently This is a very fluid situation right now but we hope to have a positive result by next week MTBE legislation the Senate Environment Committee passed MTBE legislation last week containing a number of provisions that are bad for MTBE producers including a ban of MTBE granting states the ability to waive the fuel oxygen standard and mandating increased ethanol use over years Two Enron amendments were voted on liability protection and an MTBE producer transition retrofit fund and

MTBE legislation the Senate Environment Committee passed MTBE legislation last week containing a number of provisions that are bad for MTBE producers including a ban of MTBE granting states the ability to waive the fuel oxygen standard and mandating increased ethanol use over years Two Enron amendments were voted on liability protection and an MTBE producer transition retrofit fund and

is extremely important to several Enron business units as much of the electric utililty industry is watching to see whether EPA can prevail in its enforcement activities against coal plants and utilities future decisions about fuel choice control technologies etc could be affected by action in this case EPA enforcement activities we have learned that EPA is now targeting nonutility coalfired

business opportunities for the Enron busniess units Pipeline safety legislation Jeff Keeler is working with members of Congress and others in industry on a strategy that would get the House of Representatives to pass the pipeline safety legislation recently passed by the Senate This strategy avoids several procedural steps in Congress and allows the House to pass a bill that is fairly acceptable to industry rather than waiting for the House to produce its own bill and move it independently This is a very fluid situation right now but we hope to have a positive result by next week MTBE legislation the Senate Environment Committee passed MTBE legislation last week containing a number of provisions that are bad for MTBE producers including a ban of MTBE granting states the ability to waive the fuel oxygen standard and mandating increased ethanol use over years Two Enron amendments were voted on liability protection and an MTBE producer transition retrofit fund and defeated but Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison received a commitment that transition fund issue would be addressed before the bill moves on to the Senate floor Jeff will be working on this issue with

Source Review rules A is expected by an EPA Administrative Appeals Board on in which TVA will likely lose TVA is appealing in Federal Court arguments to be held in early November Intelligence on this is extremely important to several Enron business units as much of the electric utililty industry is watching to see whether EPA can prevail in its enforcement activities against coal plants and utilities future decisions about fuel choice control technologies etc could be affected by action in this case EPA enforcement activities we have learned that EPA is now targeting nonutility coalfired

a strong possibility that the House will take up the Senatepassed legislation early next week In anticipation of resistence from some Democrats who are opposing the bill for purely political reasons we have stepped up lobbying efforts with key Democratic constituencies and other interest groups who can provide support to the legislation gas users governors steel industry etc Jeff will be speaking on this topic at the ETS management conference on Wednesday October MTBE prospects for legislation this Congress are looking bleak The only possibility for legislation to move is to attach the Senate Environment Committeepassed bill to an appropriations bill and many key congressional leaders are opposed to this strategy because of the controversy surrounding the legislation We are making sure that key advocates are armed with industry transitionconversion funding amendments in case a lastminute effort to attach an MTBE ban to some moving legislation is attempted IntelligenceStrategies
