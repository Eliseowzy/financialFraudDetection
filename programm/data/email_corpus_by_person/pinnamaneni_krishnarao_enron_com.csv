<8108986.1075856768350.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,pinnamaneni.krishnarao@enron.com,2000-02-22 05:10:00,News article on EnronEnron aftermath Business Line Abhay Mehta Copyright C Kasturi Sons Ltd KSL Source World Reporter TM Asia Intelligence Wire Power Play A Study of the Enron Project Publishers Orient Longman New Delhi Price Rs THE Enron power project at Dabhol in Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra has been mired in nationwide controversy ever since the inception of the project proposal in and the sordid tale ends only in with the Supreme Court of India refusing to even admit an appeal against the Bombay High Court decision of December which while commenting that This case has highlighted to the people as to how even after years of Independence political considerations outweigh the public interest and the interest of the State and to what extent the Government can go to justify its actions not only before the public but even before the courts of law yet dismissed a public interest petition against the project on the purely technical ground of res judicata even though new facts new arguments new evidence of the violation of the laws of the land had been advanced by the petitioners The fact that the fresh violations of the law were not even considered and recorded despite the petitioners adducing the required evidence can only be termed as strange perhaps bizarre Abhay Mehtas simple factual documentation in fact a chronological narration of all events including the process of bending all rules of subverting the law for promoting a project involving unparalleled future liabilities for Maharashtra indeed for the whole of India is not only masterly it is devastating It is a short pithy book which deserves to be read from cover to cover by all thinking citizens of this country Barring the concluding chapter the epilogue there are no personal comments only facts disseminated from the original papers mostly secret documents All documentation has been carefully faithfully recorded including extracts from supposedly top secret minutes of cabinet committee meetings and the specific violations of the law which were opposed by a few public spirited civil servants much to their disadvantage have been pointed up Apart from an introductory Primer on Electricity introduced for the benefit of the layman explaining some technical issues relating to electricity generation transmission and distribution and the background of the events of the foreign exchange crisis and the aftermath of the crisis the other fifteen chapters three appendices and fourteen annexes of the small book of pages packs in an enormous volume of factual information The strange saga of the Enron project and the sheer magnitude of the future problems this one single project poses for the country need to be briefly recounted here for essentially it is the coming generation which would have to face the problem The MSEB has contracted to buy and if not used to pay for MW of electricity for a period of years from the Dabhol Power Company the legal entity set up by Enron as an unlimited liability company registered in India through a maze of intricate crossholdings of equity by half a dozen or more front companies registered in various taxfree havens Abhay Mehta has indicated the total payments to Enron over years amount to billion at exchange rates around Rs crores over the life of the project One must record that a crude oiloil product prices have as of writing more than doubled since the above calculations were made A per the doctored figures presented by the company and its advocate the charge per unit of electricity supplied at the level of prices was to cent per unit as capacity charge and cents per unit for energy costs The former is indexed to the US inflation rate and the latter to international fuel prices The former may be assumed to have gone up only marginally rounded to cents per unit we know that fuel prices have more than doubled internationally over Assuming the fuel costs to have increased less than per cent even though international prices have more than doubled we may assume for energy costs of cents per units making for a total payment of US cents per unit of electricity supplied by the Dabhol Power Company DPC to MSEB in late in Phase I of the project Within another two years at MW the annual offtake for days X hoursday would be billion KWH and at cents per unit the total payment amounts to billion annually for years this workout to billion This is not counting any further inflation in either energy costs or capacity charge At todays exchange rate about Rs per US dollar in rupee terms this works out to wore than Rs crores as compared to Rs crores indicated by Abhay Mehta This is the cost to MSEB in rupee and to the country in foreign exchange as payment to just one project authority for supply of part of the power required in Maharashtra The really significant point to note in this connection is that this payment and considerably more depending on a future increase incapacity charges depending on US inflation rate and international prices of LNGaphtha for fuel costs and b depreciation of the exchange rate of the rupee visavis the US dollar is obligatory the assets of the MSEB the Maharashtra government indeed all assets of the Government of India present and future are mortgaged to Enron by way of sovereign guarantees extended by both governments The other significant point in this connection is that as predicted by all independent Indian experts as well as the World Bank the Enron project he forced the MSEB to cut its offtake of Tata Electric Companys and its own much cheaper thermal power already in a postscript dated August Abhay Mehta has indicated that already the MSEB had stopped buying between and MW of power from Tata Electric available at Rs per unit and has had to backdown its own Chandrapur thermal power station cost of this power being Rs per unit while forced to buy more expensive Enron power at Rs per unit The loss to MSEB on this count alone comes to Rs crore per year This had in fact been predicted earlier even by the World Bank It is pointless here to go into the details of how precisely all this was contrived by a deliberate campaign of disinformation of blatant lies of sidelining of expert opinion not only of independent experts but also the GOIs own official advisers in this matter namely the Central Electricity Authority as well as that of the World Bank which was resolutely opposed to this project The detailed facts the letters exchanged in the above context the pressure tactics adopted the flouting of all procedures norms even statutory provisions of the Electricity Supply Act are all carefully documented by Abhay Mehta Mehta correctly concludes We frequently blame external agencies like the World Bank for all our problems when as a matter of fact we ourselves are our own worst enemies In the instant case the World Bank not only advised the Government of India against the project it stood resolutely firm in its assessment of the total inadvisability of this project In fact one must note here that in neighbouring Pakistan which had entered into a somewhat similar MoU with Enron cancelled the project and the Power Purchase Agreement with Enron for a million MW residual oilfuelled power plant even though that Agreement had stipulated Enron power supply at a fixed rate of US cents per KWH over a year period Note the estimated rate of cents per KWH for Dabhol power for the MSEB in December which works out to around Rs per unit One could go on but one must leave the reader to go through Abhay Mehtas crisp factual matter of fact narration of the Enron saga and switch over to the point made by him in the epilogue to the story about The Next Round of Scams For quite some time the ruling elite in India has been intent on privatising all public enterprises and even utilities are no exception The unbundling of infrastructure with a view to privatisation of all the profitable segments All this as per the current disinformation campaign is supposedly in the interest of rationalisation and greater efficiency of poorer supply The author has referred in this context to the acquisition from the Government by the Torrent Group of the Ahmedabad and Surat Electricity companies at less than onetenth of the market value of the assets of thee facilities Again much like the Enron saga all objections by the Finance Department of the Gujarat government were overruled And Abhay Mehta has predicated that this onslaught the breakup of power utilities into three segments generation transmission and distribution with a view to their privatisation is likely to be the new thrust by the ruling elite for reasons that do not require to be spelt out Though Mehta had the examples of the Torrent Group takeover of Ahmedabad and Surat Electricity companies and of the break up of the Orissa State Electricity Board before him yet his statement can be stated today to be prophetic the UPSEB is now on the firing line The recent strike by the workers and engineers of the UPSEB in protest of the announced UP government decision to trifurcate the UPSEB and the Union Minister of Power Mr Rangarajan Kumaramangalams statement that the UPSEB is a loss making inefficient unit and that privatisation of the facilities after the trifurcation need to be noted That per cent of the dues of the UPSEB are from the UP Government that tariffs for UP electricity supply are fixed by the UP government and not by the UPSEB that the UPSEB does not have the cash even for routine maintenance as a result of the above these are facts that nobody is prepared even to consider That the remedy for UPSEB lies in a different kind of reform and restructuring is not even to be debated The whole idea is to privatise the profitable segments and to leave the public sector entity with all the problem areas including rural energy supply It is against this background that Abhay Mehtas book needs to be widely disseminated read and its implications understood What is at stake is not a utility here or a PSU there What is at stake is the future of some per cent of the havenots in this country What is at stake is the pillory of the assets of the nation for private aggrandisement Arun Ghosh

Source World Reporter TM Asia Intelligence Wire Power Play A Study of the Enron Project Publishers Orient Longman New Delhi Price Rs THE Enron power project at Dabhol in Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra has been mired in nationwide controversy ever since the inception of the project proposal in and the sordid tale ends only in with the Supreme Court of India refusing to even admit an appeal against the Bombay High Court decision of December which while commenting that This case has highlighted to the people as to how even after years of Independence political considerations outweigh the public interest and the interest of the State and to what extent the Government can go to justify its actions not only before the public but even before the courts of law yet dismissed a public interest petition against the project on the purely technical ground of res judicata even though new facts new arguments new evidence of the violation of the laws of the land had been advanced by the petitioners The fact that the fresh violations of the law were not even considered and recorded despite the petitioners adducing the required evidence can only be termed as strange perhaps bizarre Abhay Mehtas simple factual documentation in fact a chronological narration of all events including the process of bending all rules of subverting the law for promoting a project involving unparalleled future liabilities for Maharashtra indeed for the whole of India is not only masterly it is devastating It is a short pithy book which deserves to be read from cover to cover by all thinking citizens of this country Barring the concluding chapter the epilogue there are no personal comments only facts disseminated from the original papers mostly secret documents All documentation has been carefully faithfully recorded including extracts from supposedly top secret minutes of cabinet committee meetings and the specific violations of the law which were opposed by a few public spirited civil servants much to their disadvantage have been pointed up Apart from an introductory Primer on Electricity introduced for the benefit of the layman explaining some technical issues relating to electricity generation transmission and distribution and the background of the events of the foreign exchange crisis and the aftermath of the crisis the other fifteen chapters three appendices and fourteen annexes of the small book of pages packs in an enormous volume of factual information The strange saga of the Enron project and the sheer magnitude of the future problems this one single project poses for the country need to be briefly recounted here for essentially it is the coming generation which would have to face the problem The MSEB has contracted to buy and if not used to pay for MW of electricity for a period of years from the Dabhol Power Company the legal entity set up by Enron as an unlimited liability company registered in India through a maze of intricate crossholdings of equity by half a dozen or more front companies registered in various taxfree havens Abhay Mehta has indicated the total payments to Enron over years amount to billion at exchange rates around Rs crores over the life of the project One must record that a crude oiloil product prices have as of writing more than doubled since the above calculations were made A per the doctored figures presented by the company and its advocate the charge per unit of electricity supplied at the level of prices was to cent per unit as capacity charge and cents per unit for energy costs The former is indexed to the US inflation rate and the latter to international fuel prices The former may be assumed to have gone up only marginally rounded to cents per unit we know that fuel prices have more than doubled internationally over Assuming the fuel costs to have increased less than per cent even though international prices have more than doubled we may assume for energy costs of cents per units making for a total payment of US cents per unit of electricity supplied by the Dabhol Power Company DPC to MSEB in late in Phase I of the project Within another two years at MW the annual offtake for days X hoursday would be billion KWH and at cents per unit the total payment amounts to billion annually for years this workout to billion This is not counting any further inflation in either energy costs or capacity charge At todays exchange rate about Rs per US dollar in rupee terms this works out to wore than Rs crores as compared to Rs crores indicated by Abhay Mehta This is the cost to MSEB in rupee and to the country in foreign exchange as payment to just one project authority for supply of part of the power required in Maharashtra The really significant point to note in this connection is that this payment and considerably more depending on a future increase incapacity charges depending on US inflation rate and international prices of LNGaphtha for fuel costs and b depreciation of the exchange rate of the rupee visavis the US dollar is obligatory the assets of the MSEB the Maharashtra government indeed all assets of the Government of India present and future are mortgaged to Enron by way of sovereign guarantees extended by both governments The other significant point in this connection is that as predicted by all independent Indian experts as well as the World Bank the Enron project he forced the MSEB to cut its offtake of Tata Electric Companys and its own much cheaper thermal power already in a postscript dated August Abhay Mehta has indicated that already the MSEB had stopped buying between and MW of power from Tata Electric available at Rs per unit and has had to backdown its own Chandrapur thermal power station cost of this power being Rs per unit while forced to buy more expensive Enron power at Rs per unit The loss to MSEB on this count alone comes to Rs crore per year This had in fact been predicted earlier even by the World Bank It is pointless here to go into the details of how precisely all this was contrived by a deliberate campaign of disinformation of blatant lies of sidelining of expert opinion not only of independent experts but also the GOIs own official advisers in this matter namely the Central Electricity Authority as well as that of the World Bank which was resolutely opposed to this project The detailed facts the letters exchanged in the above context the pressure tactics adopted the flouting of all procedures norms even statutory provisions of the Electricity Supply Act are all carefully documented by Abhay Mehta Mehta correctly concludes We frequently blame external agencies like the World Bank for all our problems when as a matter of fact we ourselves are our own worst enemies In the instant case the World Bank not only advised the Government of India against the project it stood resolutely firm in its assessment of the total inadvisability of this project In fact one must note here that in neighbouring Pakistan which had entered into a somewhat similar MoU with Enron cancelled the project and the Power Purchase Agreement with Enron for a million MW residual oilfuelled power plant even though that Agreement had stipulated Enron power supply at a fixed rate of US cents per KWH over a year period Note the estimated rate of cents per KWH for Dabhol power for the MSEB in December which works out to around Rs per unit One could go on but one must leave the reader to go through Abhay Mehtas crisp factual matter of fact narration of the Enron saga and switch over to the point made by him in the epilogue to the story about The Next Round of Scams For quite some time the ruling elite in India has been intent on privatising all public enterprises and even utilities are no exception The unbundling of infrastructure with a view to privatisation of all the profitable segments All this as per the current disinformation campaign is supposedly in the interest of rationalisation and greater efficiency of poorer supply The author has referred in this context to the acquisition from the Government by the Torrent Group of the Ahmedabad and Surat Electricity companies at less than onetenth of the market value of the assets of thee facilities Again much like the Enron saga all objections by the Finance Department of the Gujarat government were overruled And Abhay Mehta has predicated that this onslaught the breakup of power utilities into three segments generation transmission and distribution with a view to their privatisation is likely to be the new thrust by the ruling elite for reasons that do not require to be spelt out Though Mehta had the examples of the Torrent Group takeover of Ahmedabad and Surat Electricity companies and of the break up of the Orissa State Electricity Board before him yet his statement can be stated today to be prophetic the UPSEB is now on the firing line The recent strike by the workers and engineers of the UPSEB in protest of the announced UP government decision to trifurcate the UPSEB and the Union Minister of Power Mr Rangarajan Kumaramangalams statement that the UPSEB is a loss making inefficient unit and that privatisation of the facilities after the trifurcation need to be noted That per cent of the dues of the UPSEB are from the UP Government that tariffs for UP electricity supply are fixed by the UP government and not by the UPSEB that the UPSEB does not have the cash even for routine maintenance as a result of the above these are facts that nobody is prepared even to consider That the remedy for UPSEB lies in a different kind of reform and restructuring is not even to be debated The whole idea is to privatise the profitable segments and to leave the public sector entity with all the problem areas including rural energy supply It is against this background that Abhay Mehtas book needs to be widely disseminated read and its implications understood What is at stake is not a utility here or a PSU there What is at stake is the future of some per cent of the havenots in this country What is at stake is the pillory of the assets of the nation for private aggrandisement Arun Ghosh

Source World Reporter TM Asia Intelligence Wire Power Play A Study of the Enron Project Publishers Orient Longman New Delhi Price Rs THE Enron power project at Dabhol in Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra has been mired in nationwide controversy ever since the inception of the project proposal in and the sordid tale ends only in with the Supreme Court of India refusing to even admit an appeal against the Bombay High Court decision of December which while commenting that This case has highlighted to the people as to how even after years of Independence political considerations outweigh the public interest and the interest of the State and to what extent the Government can go to justify its actions not only before the public but even before the courts of law yet dismissed a public interest petition against the project on the purely technical ground of res judicata even though new facts new arguments new evidence of the violation of the laws of the land had been advanced by the petitioners The fact that the fresh violations of the law were not even considered and recorded despite the petitioners adducing the required evidence can only be termed as strange perhaps bizarre Abhay Mehtas simple factual documentation in fact a chronological narration of all events including the process of bending all rules of subverting the law for promoting a project involving unparalleled future liabilities for Maharashtra indeed for the whole of India is not only masterly it is devastating It is a short pithy book which deserves to be read from cover to cover by all thinking citizens of this country Barring the concluding chapter the epilogue there are no personal comments only facts disseminated from the original papers mostly secret documents All documentation has been carefully faithfully recorded including extracts from supposedly top secret minutes of cabinet committee meetings and the specific violations of the law which were opposed by a few public spirited civil servants much to their disadvantage have been pointed up Apart from an introductory Primer on Electricity introduced for the benefit of the layman explaining some technical issues relating to electricity generation transmission and distribution and the background of the events of the foreign exchange crisis and the aftermath of the crisis the other fifteen chapters three appendices and fourteen annexes of the small book of pages packs in an enormous volume of factual information The strange saga of the Enron project and the sheer magnitude of the future problems this one single project poses for the country need to be briefly recounted here for essentially it is the coming generation which would have to face the problem The MSEB has contracted to buy and if not used to pay for MW of electricity for a period of years from the Dabhol Power Company the legal entity set up by Enron as an unlimited liability company registered in India through a maze of intricate crossholdings of equity by half a dozen or more front companies registered in various taxfree havens Abhay Mehta has indicated the total payments to Enron over years amount to billion at exchange rates around Rs crores over the life of the project One must record that a crude oiloil product prices have as of writing more than doubled since the above calculations were made A per the doctored figures presented by the company and its advocate the charge per unit of electricity supplied at the level of prices was to cent per unit as capacity charge and cents per unit for energy costs The former is indexed to the US inflation rate and the latter to international fuel prices The former may be assumed to have gone up only marginally rounded to cents per unit we know that fuel prices have more than doubled internationally over Assuming the fuel costs to have increased less than per cent even though international prices have more than doubled we may assume for energy costs of cents per units making for a total payment of US cents per unit of electricity supplied by the Dabhol Power Company DPC to MSEB in late in Phase I of the project Within another two years at MW the annual offtake for days X hoursday would be billion KWH and at cents per unit the total payment amounts to billion annually for years this workout to billion This is not counting any further inflation in either energy costs or capacity charge At todays exchange rate about Rs per US dollar in rupee terms this works out to wore than Rs crores as compared to Rs crores indicated by Abhay Mehta This is the cost to MSEB in rupee and to the country in foreign exchange as payment to just one project authority for supply of part of the power required in Maharashtra The really significant point to note in this connection is that this payment and considerably more depending on a future increase incapacity charges depending on US inflation rate and international prices of LNGaphtha for fuel costs and b depreciation of the exchange rate of the rupee visavis the US dollar is obligatory the assets of the MSEB the Maharashtra government indeed all assets of the Government of India present and future are mortgaged to Enron by way of sovereign guarantees extended by both governments The other significant point in this connection is that as predicted by all independent Indian experts as well as the World Bank the Enron project he forced the MSEB to cut its offtake of Tata Electric Companys and its own much cheaper thermal power already in a postscript dated August Abhay Mehta has indicated that already the MSEB had stopped buying between and MW of power from Tata Electric available at Rs per unit and has had to backdown its own Chandrapur thermal power station cost of this power being Rs per unit while forced to buy more expensive Enron power at Rs per unit The loss to MSEB on this count alone comes to Rs crore per year This had in fact been predicted earlier even by the World Bank It is pointless here to go into the details of how precisely all this was contrived by a deliberate campaign of disinformation of blatant lies of sidelining of expert opinion not only of independent experts but also the GOIs own official advisers in this matter namely the Central Electricity Authority as well as that of the World Bank which was resolutely opposed to this project The detailed facts the letters exchanged in the above context the pressure tactics adopted the flouting of all procedures norms even statutory provisions of the Electricity Supply Act are all carefully documented by Abhay Mehta Mehta correctly concludes We frequently blame external agencies like the World Bank for all our problems when as a matter of fact we ourselves are our own worst enemies In the instant case the World Bank not only advised the Government of India against the project it stood resolutely firm in its assessment of the total inadvisability of this project In fact one must note here that in neighbouring Pakistan which had entered into a somewhat similar MoU with Enron cancelled the project and the Power Purchase Agreement with Enron for a million MW residual oilfuelled power plant even though that Agreement had stipulated Enron power supply at a fixed rate of US cents per KWH over a year period Note the estimated rate of cents per KWH for Dabhol power for the MSEB in December which works out to around Rs per unit One could go on but one must leave the reader to go through Abhay Mehtas crisp factual matter of fact narration of the Enron saga and switch over to the point made by him in the epilogue to the story about The Next Round of Scams For quite some time the ruling elite in India has been intent on privatising all public enterprises and even utilities are no exception The unbundling of infrastructure with a view to privatisation of all the profitable segments All this as per the current disinformation campaign is supposedly in the interest of rationalisation and greater efficiency of poorer supply The author has referred in this context to the acquisition from the Government by the Torrent Group of the Ahmedabad and Surat Electricity companies at less than onetenth of the market value of the assets of thee facilities Again much like the Enron saga all objections by the Finance Department of the Gujarat government were overruled And Abhay Mehta has predicated that this onslaught the breakup of power utilities into three segments generation transmission and distribution with a view to their privatisation is likely to be the new thrust by the ruling elite for reasons that do not require to be spelt out Though Mehta had the examples of the Torrent Group takeover of Ahmedabad and Surat Electricity companies and of the break up of the Orissa State Electricity Board before him yet his statement can be stated today to be prophetic the UPSEB is now on the firing line The recent strike by the workers and engineers of the UPSEB in protest of the announced UP government decision to trifurcate the UPSEB and the Union Minister of Power Mr Rangarajan Kumaramangalams statement that the UPSEB is a loss making inefficient unit and that privatisation of the facilities after the trifurcation need to be noted That per cent of the dues of the UPSEB are from the UP Government that tariffs for UP electricity supply are fixed by the UP government and not by the UPSEB that the UPSEB does not have the cash even for routine maintenance as a result of the above these are facts that nobody is prepared even to consider That the remedy for UPSEB lies in a different kind of reform and restructuring is not even to be debated The whole idea is to privatise the profitable segments and to leave the public sector entity with all the problem areas including rural energy supply It is against this background that Abhay Mehtas book needs to be widely disseminated read and its implications understood What is at stake is not a utility here or a PSU there What is at stake is the future of some per cent of the havenots in this country What is at stake is the pillory of the assets of the nation for private aggrandisement Arun Ghosh
