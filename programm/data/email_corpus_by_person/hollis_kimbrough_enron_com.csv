capabilities with respect to turbine performance analysis Using existing SCADA data we presently have the ability to perform both optimization and diagnostics for turbine performance In the future we can develop our capability to move into preventative repairs and maintenance If we make changes to the type of SCADA data we collect we can become more aggressive in our turbine performance preventative modeling and characterization Some examples of our current capabilities include Yaw Activity Report This report is prepared and sent to each of the kW sites on a monthly basis Although yaw activity does not affect either availability or power curve contractual items it is critical to production as slight variations in yaw activity can result in big production variances The purpose of this report is to identify at a glance the turbines which are experiencing excessive yaw activity relative to their neighbors We present this information graphically with an average solid green line and standard deviations dashed green line to quickly identify turbines which are yawing more than standard deviations from the average Any turbine which is either yawing zero hours or in excess of two standard deviations should be inspected by the field personnel for turbine defects or SCADA system defects This example is for LB March node SCADA Power Transducer Report This report is prepared and sent to each of the kW sites on a quarterly basis This report compares the SCADA kWh reading to the glass meter energy reading and looks for differences of When a difference of is detected the particular turbine is clearly identified in a table for additional field troubleshooting Although the site gets paid based on the substation glass meter readings the SCADA kWh meter readings are very important since these are what the customer and operators see when they pull production information into SCADA To facilitate a good basis for decision making and to support the integrity of the SCADA system it is important to ensure the meter readings are as accurate as possible This example is for SL Q Please note that the decision not to put pad mounted glass meters on the MW WTGs makes this analysis impossible for the MW WTG However we the Engineering Power Performance Group can and has put a high precision transducer in parallel with the SCADA kWh transducer on the MW WTG and discovered the SCADA transducer to be within SPC Analytic This report is under development but will be completed either this week or next week We are capable of generating and distributing this report as frequently as is needed Our intention is to produce this report either weekly when the new data arrives and is uploaded or monthly whichever is preferred This analytic is written for the kW WTG but we are also preparing a MW WTG version This particular report calculates an average green solid line and a standard deviation line dashed green line for the following parameters kW nacelle mounted wind speed generator rpm hub rpm blade pitch ambient temperature gearbox temperature generator temperature hydraulic oil temperature hydraulic oil pressure hydraulic pressure AC Mains voltage AC Mains current phase A AC Mains current phase B AC Mains phase C AC Mains frequency Op hours Available hours Line hours EPC hours Generator hours Hydraulic hours Yaw hours and kW hours As can be seen here we have the analytic working but we are completing the process so our clerical staff can both generate and distribute the report This particular example is for Cabazon for the month of February NonRoutine report We provide a number of nonroutine reports for both diagnostic and proof of concept purposes I have attached two examples here to illustrate these types of reports but basically we are capable of applying complex statistical and mathematical formulas to turbine performance and other data to answer very practical questions This example is a request that came from Engineering and Asset Management to determine the suitability for installation of Ride Through kits This example demonstrates some of the advanced statistical methodologies we have available for application to employ on behalf of other EWC or customer organizations This next example was prepared for the Engineering Department in their efforts to understand the blade pitch problem Engineering suspected a correlation between vibration faults and improper blade pitch so we prepared a graph which displayed the total number of vibration and blade asymmetry faults The results were provided to Engineering within hours of the request Owner Reports We prepare performance reports for each of our sites on a monthly basis These reports supply the turbine performance information needed to fulfill contractual obligations for performance reporting Included here are examples for both a MW WTG site Trent and a kW site SL Future Report As we complete the SPC analytic we will turn our attention to development of a power curve report This report will be produced on a quarterly basis and will detect degradation in the power curve over time The specification for this report has been developed and will compare relative power curves for both the and turbines The basis for the report will be a power curve which is displayed graphically on a turbine by turbine basis for the same quarter from previous years In other words for the first quarter in the graph will include Q from and The second quarter graph will include Q from and The reason for assigning the Quarters this way is to control for changes in atmospheric conditions ie density relative humidity wind etc and isolate long term turbine performance With this report we should be able to identify problem turbines and take remedial action resulting in increased production The report examples so far have all been illustrative of our ability to provide diagnostic and optimization information to the field customers and other internal organizations We have a great potential to move beyond these levels of reporting into predictive and preventative maintenance situations Here are several examples of what might be possible if we changed some of our processes or strategies Without modifying the existing SCADA system we currently have the ability to evaluate numbers of cycles of various pieces of equipment and compare that to failure data to predict component failure However our current developmentconstructionoperations process resulted in incomplete data sets for the MW WTG so we cannot fully bring this ability to bear A great example of this is the blade failures at Trent Mesa where some of the blades seem to be cracking and failing prematurely If the presumption is made that the failure is related to load cycles reasonable and those load cycles are not thermally based also reasonable then we could have compared the cycles and predicted which blade set was at the highest risk of failing next Armed with this information we could direct our field crews straight to the pertinent turbines to conduct inspections and possibly do repairs before a failure occurred If we want to have this capability in the future we must ensure that SCADA is operational when the WTG is operational and that we collect and store the data from the time the turbine commences operation If we are willing to add vibration monitoring equipment such as accelerometers to critical bearings and rotating equipment we should be able to predict the time to failure for these components Having this ability would enable us to avoid consequential damage to other components and also allow us to pick a convenient time for a scheduled outage to conduct repairs Having a methodology such as this would also enable us to service or replace components as the component came to the end of life versus maintaining a maintenance schedule which replaces components on a calendar schedule ie not the actual end of component life This would require both a modification to the turbine additional transducers and to the SCADA system If we were to engage a Reliability Engineering function in our company we would be able to develop a much more advanced ability to engage in predictive and preventative maintenance To the best of my knowledge we do not have anyone within EWC performing this role I have not provided an exhaustive list of our capabilities Rather my intention has been to equip you with knowledge and understanding of what we are capable of today and some of the possibilities for tomorrow Please let me know if you would like additional information or examples or whether you have any questions Best Regards Hollis

PM To Klaus WTDE cc Ulrich WTDE Benjamin NRON Jeff NRON Jeff nron Subject Re Antwort Availability Definitions Hello Klaus I am trying to do a comparison between the MW availability definitions used in Germany versus the one used here in the US Per your attached email we both use the Enron Availability EA definition however the definitions are different due to the number of available counters in the PLC and the placement of the MT term in the equations In Europe you are limited to counters while the US VisuPro has and in Europe you include the MT term in both the numerator and the denominator while in the US we only include it in the denominator but we deduct hours per month as a maintenance allowance With respect to the timers the differences center on how status timers are treated which result in a slightly higher availability for US turbines given the same operating conditions The status timers are Overvoltage Undervoltage Underfrequency Overfrequency Outside Temperature too low Gear oil temp too low Line fault voltage and Line fault frequency In the European EA these values are counted as Down Time and are added in the denominator but not in the numerator resulting in a larger denominator and therefore a lower overall availability In the US EA these terms are added in both the denominator and the numerator thereby resulting in no change either negative nor positive With respect to the MT term the European EA includes this number in both the numerator and denominator which means the MT term does not affect European EA regardless of how much time a European turbine stays in maintenance mode In the US the use of the MT term results in a lower EA result for values where the maintenance time exceeds hours per month hours per year This brings me to my questions Do the status timers result in very significant impact on the EA term in Germany and throughout Europe Can you quantify in percent EA the impact of these status timers for some typical turbines Can you give me an example of how much MT time you accumulate in a month for a typical turbine If you have any other thoughts or ideas on how we might quantify the differences between the two

<8972064.1075840445984.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,hollis.kimbrough@enron.com,2002-05-15 01:15:00,Re Consumption for for GE Cc LNotesnsf Kevin We routinely prepare that data and it is available for all our turbines The problem is that the consumptionproduction is a net number for a minute period so we do not know what the turbine loads are only what they are netting This leaves two questions What is the turbine consuming during normal operation including standby full power etc and What is the potential financial liability a particular site has for consumed power The first question we cannot answer with the SCADA data because the SCADA data is a net number This one will require actual measurement of data to ascertain The second question we cannot answer with the SCADA data unless the frequency of the measurement coincides with the minute SCADA periodicity Regarding the second question Since we will be charged a different rate for consumed power a retail rate versus the rate we are paid for produced power the wholesale rate we cannot depend on a net metering solution with an arbitrary frequency Taking a look at extremes by way of example If we are netting on a monthly basis then we will never owe anything under a net metering solution This is because in normal operation the turbine always produces more power than it consumes on a monthly basis On the other hand if the frequency is based on a minute periodicity then we will have instances of individual minutes One would be a minute in which we produced power and sold it at the retail rate and the other would be a minute where we consumed power and purchased it at the retail rate This is because the turbine is not producing power during every minute of the month There are an infinite number of permutations because you can set the time interval to an infinite number of values Our current value is a net number based on a minute interval If the utility is basing their measurement on a different frequency then we will certainly get a different total for power consumed The other issue is the location of the measurement If the measurement is at the substation then the net number is an aggregate of the wind turbines which dampens the impact of a particular turbine good for us If the measurement is with our SCADA system at the individual turbine then we maximize the impact if a particular turbine is down for any reason while the remaining turbines are operating bad for us Therefore to more fully understand the nd question from Mark we also need to know additional points What is the proposed frequency for the metering Where is the measurement going to take place As mentioned earlier we can provide the net productionconsumption for each minute interval However I think the only way we can fully address this question is to run a test program based on the answers to these two last questions Regards Hollis Kevin Cousineau AM To Mark NRON cc Mark nron Mark NRON Hollis NRON Subject Re Consumption for for GE Mark Mark and Mark I have reviewed the attached power curve and clearly it will not help in formulating an answer to your question I would like to ask Mark Fisher to look at a typical installation any one of our field sites and give us data on kWh consumed by several turbines over a multimonth period with data arranged month by month Perhaps one or two turbines at Monfort would be the best because we can look at a whole year of data This would tell us what was produced and what was consumed in energy Mark Eilers what do you think Regards KLC Mark Ratekin PM To Kevin NRON cc Mark nron Mark NRON Hollis NRON Subject Re Consumption for for GE Attached is the final power curve results from the Tehachapi Prototype which includes the power consumption The page was scanned from the NREL Test Report If you have any questions or need the entire document feel free to contact me Best Regards Mark

<7063879.1075840454282.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,hollis.kimbrough@enron.com,2002-04-25 06:46:00,Capabilities Memo Cc LNotesnsf Jeff This email is intended to describe our existing and potential capabilities with respect to turbine performance analysis Using existing SCADA data we presently have the ability to perform both optimization and diagnostics for turbine performance In the future we can develop our capability to move into preventative repairs and maintenance If we make changes to the type of SCADA data we collect we can become more aggressive in our turbine performance preventative modeling and characterization Some examples of our current capabilities include Yaw Activity Report This report is prepared and sent to each of the kW sites on a monthly basis Although yaw activity does not affect either availability or power curve contractual items it is critical to production as slight variations in yaw activity can result in big production variances The purpose of this report is to identify at a glance the turbines which are experiencing excessive yaw activity relative to their neighbors We present this information graphically with an average solid green line and standard deviations dashed green line to quickly identify turbines which are yawing more than standard deviations from the average Any turbine which is either yawing zero hours or in excess of two standard deviations should be inspected by the field personnel for turbine defects or SCADA system defects This example is for LB March node SCADA Power Transducer Report This report is prepared and sent to each of the kW sites on a quarterly basis This report compares the SCADA kWh reading to the glass meter energy reading and looks for differences of When a difference of is detected the particular turbine is clearly identified in a table for additional field troubleshooting Although the site gets paid based on the substation glass meter readings the SCADA kWh meter readings are very important since these are what the customer and operators see when they pull production information into SCADA To facilitate a good basis for decision making and to support the integrity of the SCADA system it is important to ensure the meter readings are as accurate as possible This example is for SL Q Please note that the decision not to put pad mounted glass meters on the MW WTGs makes this analysis impossible for the MW WTG However we the Engineering Power Performance Group can and has put a high precision transducer in parallel with the SCADA kWh transducer on the MW WTG and discovered the SCADA transducer to be within SPC Analytic This report is under development but will be completed either this week or next week We are capable of generating and distributing this report as frequently as is needed Our intention is to produce this report either weekly when the new data arrives and is uploaded or monthly whichever is preferred This analytic is written for the kW WTG but we are also preparing a MW WTG version This particular report calculates an average green solid line and a standard deviation line dashed green line for the following parameters kW nacelle mounted wind speed generator rpm hub rpm blade pitch ambient temperature gearbox temperature generator temperature hydraulic oil temperature hydraulic oil pressure hydraulic pressure AC Mains voltage AC Mains current phase A AC Mains current phase B AC Mains phase C AC Mains frequency Op hours Available hours Line hours EPC hours Generator hours Hydraulic hours Yaw hours and kW hours As can be seen here we have the analytic working but we are completing the process so our clerical staff can both generate and distribute the report This particular example is for Cabazon for the month of February NonRoutine report We provide a number of nonroutine reports for both diagnostic and proof of concept purposes I have attached two examples here to illustrate these types of reports but basically we are capable of applying complex statistical and mathematical formulas to turbine performance and other data to answer very practical questions This example is a request that came from Engineering and Asset Management to determine the suitability for installation of Ride Through kits This example demonstrates some of the advanced statistical methodologies we have available for application to employ on behalf of other EWC or customer organizations This next example was prepared for the Engineering Department in their efforts to understand the blade pitch problem Engineering suspected a correlation between vibration faults and improper blade pitch so we prepared a graph which displayed the total number of vibration and blade asymmetry faults The results were provided to Engineering within hours of the request Owner Reports We prepare performance reports for each of our sites on a monthly basis These reports supply the turbine performance information needed to fulfill contractual obligations for performance reporting Included here are examples for both a MW WTG site Trent and a kW site SL Future Report As we complete the SPC analytic we will turn our attention to development of a power curve report This report will be produced on a quarterly basis and will detect degradation in the power curve over time The specification for this report has been developed and will compare relative power curves for both the and turbines The basis for the report will be a power curve which is displayed graphically on a turbine by turbine basis for the same quarter from previous years In other words for the first quarter in the graph will include Q from and The second quarter graph will include Q from and The reason for assigning the Quarters this way is to control for changes in atmospheric conditions ie density relative humidity wind etc and isolate long term turbine performance With this report we should be able to identify problem turbines and take remedial action resulting in increased production The report examples so far have all been illustrative of our ability to provide diagnostic and optimization information to the field customers and other internal organizations We have a great potential to move beyond these levels of reporting into predictive and preventative maintenance situations Here are several examples of what might be possible if we changed some of our processes or strategies Without modifying the existing SCADA system we currently have the ability to evaluate numbers of cycles of various pieces of equipment and compare that to failure data to predict component failure However our current developmentconstructionoperations process resulted in incomplete data sets for the MW WTG so we cannot fully bring this ability to bear A great example of this is the blade failures at Trent Mesa where some of the blades seem to be cracking and failing prematurely If the presumption is made that the failure is related to load cycles reasonable and those load cycles are not thermally based also reasonable then we could have compared the cycles and predicted which blade set was at the highest risk of failing next Armed with this information we could direct our field crews straight to the pertinent turbines to conduct inspections and possibly do repairs before a failure occurred If we want to have this capability in the future we must ensure that SCADA is operational when the WTG is operational and that we collect and store the data from the time the turbine commences operation If we are willing to add vibration monitoring equipment such as accelerometers to critical bearings and rotating equipment we should be able to predict the time to failure for these components Having this ability would enable us to avoid consequential damage to other components and also allow us to pick a convenient time for a scheduled outage to conduct repairs Having a methodology such as this would also enable us to service or replace components as the component came to the end of life versus maintaining a maintenance schedule which replaces components on a calendar schedule ie not the actual end of component life This would require both a modification to the turbine additional transducers and to the SCADA system If we were to engage a Reliability Engineering function in our company we would be able to develop a much more advanced ability to engage in predictive and preventative maintenance To the best of my knowledge we do not have anyone within EWC performing this role I have not provided an exhaustive list of our capabilities Rather my intention has been to equip you with knowledge and understanding of what we are capable of today and some of the possibilities for tomorrow Please let me know if you would like additional information or examples or whether you have any questions Best Regards Hollis

PM To Klaus WTDE cc Ulrich WTDE Benjamin NRON Jeff NRON Jeff nron Subject Re Antwort Availability Definitions Hello Klaus I am trying to do a comparison between the MW availability definitions used in Germany versus the one used here in the US Per your attached email we both use the Enron Availability EA definition however the definitions are different due to the number of available counters in the PLC and the placement of the MT term in the equations In Europe you are limited to counters while the US VisuPro has and in Europe you include the MT term in both the numerator and the denominator while in the US we only include it in the denominator but we deduct hours per month as a maintenance allowance With respect to the timers the differences center on how status timers are treated which result in a slightly higher availability for US turbines given the same operating conditions The status timers are Overvoltage Undervoltage Underfrequency Overfrequency Outside Temperature too low Gear oil temp too low Line fault voltage and Line fault frequency In the European EA these values are counted as Down Time and are added in the denominator but not in the numerator resulting in a larger denominator and therefore a lower overall availability In the US EA these terms are added in both the denominator and the numerator thereby resulting in no change either negative nor positive With respect to the MT term the European EA includes this number in both the numerator and denominator which means the MT term does not affect European EA regardless of how much time a European turbine stays in maintenance mode In the US the use of the MT term results in a lower EA result for values where the maintenance time exceeds hours per month hours per year This brings me to my questions Do the status timers result in very significant impact on the EA term in Germany and throughout Europe Can you quantify in percent EA the impact of these status timers for some typical turbines Can you give me an example of how much MT time you accumulate in a month for a typical turbine If you have any other thoughts or ideas on how we might quantify the differences between the two

capabilities with respect to turbine performance analysis Using existing SCADA data we presently have the ability to perform both optimization and diagnostics for turbine performance In the future we can develop our capability to move into preventative repairs and maintenance If we make changes to the type of SCADA data we collect we can become more aggressive in our turbine performance preventative modeling and characterization Some examples of our current capabilities include Yaw Activity Report This report is prepared and sent to each of the kW sites on a monthly basis Although yaw activity does not affect either availability or power curve contractual items it is critical to production as slight variations in yaw activity can result in big production variances The purpose of this report is to identify at a glance the turbines which are experiencing excessive yaw activity relative to their neighbors We present this information graphically with an average solid green line and standard deviations dashed green line to quickly identify turbines which are yawing more than standard deviations from the average Any turbine which is either yawing zero hours or in excess of two standard deviations should be inspected by the field personnel for turbine defects or SCADA system defects This example is for LB March node SCADA Power Transducer Report This report is prepared and sent to each of the kW sites on a quarterly basis This report compares the SCADA kWh reading to the glass meter energy reading and looks for differences of When a difference of is detected the particular turbine is clearly identified in a table for additional field troubleshooting Although the site gets paid based on the substation glass meter readings the SCADA kWh meter readings are very important since these are what the customer and operators see when they pull production information into SCADA To facilitate a good basis for decision making and to support the integrity of the SCADA system it is important to ensure the meter readings are as accurate as possible This example is for SL Q Please note that the decision not to put pad mounted glass meters on the MW WTGs makes this analysis impossible for the MW WTG However we the Engineering Power Performance Group can and has put a high precision transducer in parallel with the SCADA kWh transducer on the MW WTG and discovered the SCADA transducer to be within SPC Analytic This report is under development but will be completed either this week or next week We are capable of generating and distributing this report as frequently as is needed Our intention is to produce this report either weekly when the new data arrives and is uploaded or monthly whichever is preferred This analytic is written for the kW WTG but we are also preparing a MW WTG version This particular report calculates an average green solid line and a standard deviation line dashed green line for the following parameters kW nacelle mounted wind speed generator rpm hub rpm blade pitch ambient temperature gearbox temperature generator temperature hydraulic oil temperature hydraulic oil pressure hydraulic pressure AC Mains voltage AC Mains current phase A AC Mains current phase B AC Mains phase C AC Mains frequency Op hours Available hours Line hours EPC hours Generator hours Hydraulic hours Yaw hours and kW hours As can be seen here we have the analytic working but we are completing the process so our clerical staff can both generate and distribute the report This particular example is for Cabazon for the month of February NonRoutine report We provide a number of nonroutine reports for both diagnostic and proof of concept purposes I have attached two examples here to illustrate these types of reports but basically we are capable of applying complex statistical and mathematical formulas to turbine performance and other data to answer very practical questions This example is a request that came from Engineering and Asset Management to determine the suitability for installation of Ride Through kits This example demonstrates some of the advanced statistical methodologies we have available for application to employ on behalf of other EWC or customer organizations This next example was prepared for the Engineering Department in their efforts to understand the blade pitch problem Engineering suspected a correlation between vibration faults and improper blade pitch so we prepared a graph which displayed the total number of vibration and blade asymmetry faults The results were provided to Engineering within hours of the request Owner Reports We prepare performance reports for each of our sites on a monthly basis These reports supply the turbine performance information needed to fulfill contractual obligations for performance reporting Included here are examples for both a MW WTG site Trent and a kW site SL Future Report As we complete the SPC analytic we will turn our attention to development of a power curve report This report will be produced on a quarterly basis and will detect degradation in the power curve over time The specification for this report has been developed and will compare relative power curves for both the and turbines The basis for the report will be a power curve which is displayed graphically on a turbine by turbine basis for the same quarter from previous years In other words for the first quarter in the graph will include Q from and The second quarter graph will include Q from and The reason for assigning the Quarters this way is to control for changes in atmospheric conditions ie density relative humidity wind etc and isolate long term turbine performance With this report we should be able to identify problem turbines and take remedial action resulting in increased production The report examples so far have all been illustrative of our ability to provide diagnostic and optimization information to the field customers and other internal organizations We have a great potential to move beyond these levels of reporting into predictive and preventative maintenance situations Here are several examples of what might be possible if we changed some of our processes or strategies Without modifying the existing SCADA system we currently have the ability to evaluate numbers of cycles of various pieces of equipment and compare that to failure data to predict component failure However our current developmentconstructionoperations process resulted in incomplete data sets for the MW WTG so we cannot fully bring this ability to bear A great example of this is the blade failures at Trent Mesa where some of the blades seem to be cracking and failing prematurely If the presumption is made that the failure is related to load cycles reasonable and those load cycles are not thermally based also reasonable then we could have compared the cycles and predicted which blade set was at the highest risk of failing next Armed with this information we could direct our field crews straight to the pertinent turbines to conduct inspections and possibly do repairs before a failure occurred If we want to have this capability in the future we must ensure that SCADA is operational when the WTG is operational and that we collect and store the data from the time the turbine commences operation If we are willing to add vibration monitoring equipment such as accelerometers to critical bearings and rotating equipment we should be able to predict the time to failure for these components Having this ability would enable us to avoid consequential damage to other components and also allow us to pick a convenient time for a scheduled outage to conduct repairs Having a methodology such as this would also enable us to service or replace components as the component came to the end of life versus maintaining a maintenance schedule which replaces components on a calendar schedule ie not the actual end of component life This would require both a modification to the turbine additional transducers and to the SCADA system If we were to engage a Reliability Engineering function in our company we would be able to develop a much more advanced ability to engage in predictive and preventative maintenance To the best of my knowledge we do not have anyone within EWC performing this role I have not provided an exhaustive list of our capabilities Rather my intention has been to equip you with knowledge and understanding of what we are capable of today and some of the possibilities for tomorrow Please let me know if you would like additional information or examples or whether you have any questions Best Regards Hollis

PM To Klaus WTDE cc Ulrich WTDE Benjamin NRON Jeff NRON Jeff nron Subject Re Antwort Availability Definitions Hello Klaus I am trying to do a comparison between the MW availability definitions used in Germany versus the one used here in the US Per your attached email we both use the Enron Availability EA definition however the definitions are different due to the number of available counters in the PLC and the placement of the MT term in the equations In Europe you are limited to counters while the US VisuPro has and in Europe you include the MT term in both the numerator and the denominator while in the US we only include it in the denominator but we deduct hours per month as a maintenance allowance With respect to the timers the differences center on how status timers are treated which result in a slightly higher availability for US turbines given the same operating conditions The status timers are Overvoltage Undervoltage Underfrequency Overfrequency Outside Temperature too low Gear oil temp too low Line fault voltage and Line fault frequency In the European EA these values are counted as Down Time and are added in the denominator but not in the numerator resulting in a larger denominator and therefore a lower overall availability In the US EA these terms are added in both the denominator and the numerator thereby resulting in no change either negative nor positive With respect to the MT term the European EA includes this number in both the numerator and denominator which means the MT term does not affect European EA regardless of how much time a European turbine stays in maintenance mode In the US the use of the MT term results in a lower EA result for values where the maintenance time exceeds hours per month hours per year This brings me to my questions Do the status timers result in very significant impact on the EA term in Germany and throughout Europe Can you quantify in percent EA the impact of these status timers for some typical turbines Can you give me an example of how much MT time you accumulate in a month for a typical turbine If you have any other thoughts or ideas on how we might quantify the differences between the two
