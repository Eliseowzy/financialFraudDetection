mailtoIMCEANOTESOnukoguCErnestCErnestEOnukogudowjonesEcomE NRONcom Sent Friday July PM To undisclosedrecipientsENRON Subject POWER POINTSGenerators Heres To Better Luck In Brazil NEW YORK Dow JonesLess than a month after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shot the messenger its looking for new volunteers On June the FERC totally trashed US wholesale electricity markets with price controls and an order for refunds dating back to October or to May or to whenever they later decide What is the FERC price cap on electricity throughout the western US Well its whatever the California Independent System Operator decides it is Nevertheless on Wednesday the FERC made a sharp Uturn in the direction of free markets for power With unquestioning confidence it ordered all US utilities to consolidate their transmission lines into a few independent transmission operators in order to foster free trade and movement of electricity Surely some might say the FERC didnt give the California ISO total price discretion over the western US did it After all the ISO is simply the administrator of the FERCs very precise formulas like this one for nonemergencies the cost of burning natural gas assuming a power plant is located both in northern California and southern California at the least efficient generator that was called on in the most expensive hour of the most recent Stage emergency that wasnt a Stage at any point during the hour plus for operation and maintenance multiplied by then add if the buyer is the California Department of Water Resources What could be more clear More marketbased as the FERC trumpeted its own ingenuity How could the ISO possibly manipulate that The ISOs initial cap of a megawatthour was based on a gas price of After inputting the other elements that cap turns out to be based on a quite efficient heat rate of Surely the heat rate of the least efficient unit used in the most recent emergency etc was or higher But the ISO decided it didnt want to pay more than MWh Who confirms that the ISO really used the correct heat rate Nobody Now after gas prices crashed to the ISO had full discretion based on a technicality to avoid resetting the cap At all four opportunities the ISO declined to reset the cap because the ISO staff know they cant get the power California needs for which is where the cap would have come out using the old heat rate Thats way below the costs of the marginal generators needed when things get even a little tight Sierra Pacific Resources SRP Nevada Power couldnt get all the power it needed July for even So what is the FERC price cap on western power Whatever the California ISO says it is Not surprisingly Nevada Power and others western utilities are furious with California for successfully using its political muscle to export its problem to the rest of the West Before the FERC price caps the market definitely was working When you had prices of a megawatthour people were mortgaging their restaurants to buy a diesel generator to sell power into the grid said Chelan County Public Utility Districts Chuck Berrie one of a handful of utility veterans in the US who thrived in the deregulated wholesale market Unlike those of most other western utilities Chelans customers havent seen a rate increase and wont for the next five years because Berrie and his coworkers have maximized the utilitys assets and market opportunities People were coming out of the woodwork to get generators on line Ive never seen anything like it But the FERC order killed them Berrie said Orders for hundreds of small dieselfired generators that could have helped get the West through the next months or so were canceled immediately after the FERC order because the generators cost more than MWh to operate They are expensive to run but could have patched over the shortage until big permanent power plants are finished in But who wanted to bet in late June that the California ISO would pass up the opportunity for a price cap So the orders were canceled In fact even with the cap stuck at at least megawatts of installed generators are being taken off line and sent back to the rental companies When the blackouts come hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses will be without power that the generators could have provided The biggest manufacturer of such generators Caterpillar Inc CAT said it is redirecting the units to Brazil which like the western US is highly dependent on hydroelectricity And Brazil like the West is enduring a drought this year Brazil however isnt under FERC jurisdiction But surely the generators must not be needed if we are sending them down to poor old Brazil Not so according to utility employees like Berrie as well as the quasigovernmental Northwest Power Planning Council The chances of blackouts this summer and winter is still much higher than acceptable and of course higher still without those temporary generators Price controls kill the messenger High prices say that supply should be increased and usage reduced Really high prices like those the West has endured for the past year say Hurry But the administration of George W Bush after getting a good ol political whuppin at the hands of California Gov Gray Davis agreed to shoot the messenger Why would anybody get into this industry with all the uncertainty of this ridiculousness Its the price caps as well as the rebates Or youre going to get sued Regular people were practically turning over their couches to get the nickels together to invest in a generator and they have lost their investment Berrie says I think the horse is dead Even if you removed the regulations and prices did come back up people still wont come back What certainty would you have that they wont change the rules again Who can take that risk he added Yet the FERC just ordered the restructuring of many billions of dollars of transmission lines as the foundation of a free market In the East they must be wondering what that messenger said before the FERC shot him Apparently it was Brazils economy can afford to pay more for electricity than the US economy can By Mark Golden Dow Jones Newswires END Dow Jones Newswires
