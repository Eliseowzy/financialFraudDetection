dispatched by TVA only if TVA specifically agreed to waive its rights for the specific period If the AAF is equal to or less than for a month then the Demand Charge for that month will be zero instead of kwmonth Having the potential of hours of scheduled maintenance per unit each month significantly reduces the availability of the resources and the low guaranteed availability during the nonsummer also reduces the value to TVA Should Enron desire to provide a higher level of availability such as not excluding the maintenance from the availability calculation or different product such as unit

<11293090.1075849736158.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,slgoza@tva.gov,2001-01-18 10:11:00,RE TVA s Bid Cc TVA to increase its bid there must be increased availability With the low availability of the proposed product we valued it at The main issue is the reliability of the resources Higher guaranteed availability will increase the value to us From SMTP Sent Thursday January PM To Goza Stuart L Cc Subject Re TVA s Bid Stuart Thanks for your response At this time EPMI is unable to accept TVAs bid Are the issues raised by TVA significant enough that if amended would allow TVA to provide EPMI with a bid equal to EPMIs original offer EPMI does plan to go forward with an offering to several market participants on Monday EPMI will include TVA in the process if you wish Rogers Herndon Goza Stuart L on PM To cc Creel Elizabeth A Subject TVA s Bid Rogers TVAs current bid is kwmonth for the term May through December Enron could call on units not being dispatched by TVA only if TVA specifically agreed to waive its rights for the specific period If the AAF is equal to or less than for a month then the Demand Charge for that month will be zero instead of kwmonth Having the potential of hours of scheduled maintenance per unit each month significantly reduces the availability of the resources and the low guaranteed availability during the nonsummer also reduces the value to TVA Should Enron desire to provide a higher level of availability such as not excluding the maintenance from the availability calculation or different product such as unit capacity with LD energy then that would increase the value to TVA A transaction of this duration is subject to TVA Board approval Please let me know if the bid is acceptable or if Enron want to offer a product with higher availability Thanks Stuart From SMTP Sent Tuesday January AM To Cc Subject RE Tolling Proposal Stuart The following is our response to question In situations where a unit is not available due to unexpected maintenance but the advanced notice time requirements for a Scheduled Outage hours have not yet been met or if the hours for that month have already been used for Scheduled Outages then EPMI could inform TVA that the unit is not available and TVA could not then call on the unit this would be D This prevents TVA from calling on and counting on a unit that is not available Note that EPMI would not get credit for availability during this period Note that this is considered a courtesy opportunity for the Buyer EPMI does not object to removing the term D EPMI request an indication of interest from TVA regarding the current proposal as soon as possible EPMIs current plan is to issue a bid package no later than Friday am Rogers Herndon Rogers CT To cc Subject Document link David Portz AM Stuart Thanks for the prompt response I am having someone address question and will forward as soon as possible Regarding EPMI is proposing a guaranteed heat rate and start up fuel quantities As long as TVA arranges for and delivers these fuel quantities EPMI will manage any actual imbalances However TVA would be responsible for all imbalances and potential penalties associated with underover deliveries vs the guaranteed quantities I hope this response is sufficient If not please let me know Rogers Herndon Goza Stuart L on AM To cc Subject RE Tolling Proposal Thanks for your response I have two initial commentsquestions I dont understand D in the formula shown in for AAF What is it how it is determined If D and M exclude MO SO and Force Majure what is left for D If TVA only has rights to of the units how would gas imbalance charges be handled if both TVA and Enron are supply gas for the total plant Certainly there will be situations were units trip or fail to start etc which will lead to imbalances From SMTP Sent Thursday January AM To Cc Subject Tolling Proposal Stuart Below are the responses to TVAs questions Please let me know if and how TVA would like to proceed from
