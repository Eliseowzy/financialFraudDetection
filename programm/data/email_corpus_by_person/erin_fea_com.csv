Dear Vince Kaminski This is to inform you of the release of Energy FTP download instructions are available immediately The download instructions are included at the end of this email Please see below for more information regarding this new release FEA is pleased to enclose your new version of ENERGYErgLib The accompanying documentation contains installation and other information Here is an overview of the new and changed features since Version ENERGY Forward Curve No change ENERGY Basics A control variate methodology Hull has been implemented for valuation of American options OPT Black and Meanreverting models It greatly improves accuracy at minimal cost in speed All models now supports new scalar risk measures corresponding to parallel displacement delta hedge and gamma Average pricestrike options now support an alternative way of computing theta The definition of Gamma curves has been modified for all models ENERGY Advanced A faster and more accurate methodology is used to value spread options Models affected are SPREADOPT STRIPSPREADOPT OPTSPREADOPT OPTSTRIPSPREADOPT The new methodology dramatically improves speed All models now supports new scalar risk measures corresponding to parallel displacement delta hedge and gamma Average pricestrike options now support an alternative way of computing theta The definition of Gamma curves has been modified for all models ENERGY Swing The definition of Gamma curves has been modified for all models ENERGY Weather No change See the file feaenergyergnotetxt in your distribution for a list of bug fixes Here is an overview of the new and changed features since Version ENERGY Forward Curve Jump parameters are now calibrated for use in other ENERGY functions Inputs and outputs to POWERCALIB and COMCALIB have changed See the corresponding function syntax in the User Guide for additional information speed improvement The module is now out of beta ENERGY Basics Different interpolation schemes on forward prices are now supported If you use INDEXSWAP EXOTICSWAP or OPTINDEXSWAP with floating price linked to a series of futures dates such futures dates need not be close to dates specified in the forward curve input A new utility function PATHUTIL allows you to simulate and visualize price paths consistent with the models supported by ENERGY speed improvement ENERGY Advanced Different interpolation schemes on forward prices are now supported If you use OPTDIFFSWAP or DIFFSWAP with floating price linked to a series of futures dates such futures dates need not be close to dates specified in the forward curve input CALSPREADOPT now allows for the specification of two different mean reversion rates speed improvement ENERGY Swing SWINGOPT and STRIPSWINGOPT now allow for valuation of swing straddle contracts with overall load constraints speed improvement The module is now out of beta ENERGY Weather speed improvement See the file feaenergyergnotetxt in your distribution for a list of bug fixes If you are a user of the ErgLib library please be aware of possible backward compatibility issues in calls to Eapo Easo Espreadapo Espreadaso and Ecrackapo See feaenergyergnotetxt for additional details Here is an overview of the new and changed features since Version ENERGY Basics European options and strips of European options now support valuation via a jump diffusion model see OPT and STRIPOPT functions Average price options see the APO SPREADAPO CRACKAPO functions and average strike options see the ASO SPREADASO functions now allow for a direct input of the fixing dates ENERGY Advanced Includes two new functions OPTSTRIPOPT and OPTSTRIPSPREADOPT for valuation of complex compound options If you are a user of the ErgLib library please be aware of backward compatibility issues in calls to Eapo Easo Espreadapo Espreadaso and Ecrackapo See feaenergyergnotetxt for additional details Here is an overview of the new and changed features since Version ENERGY Forward Curve ENERGY Forward Curve is the new module which includes functions designed to generate forward curves volatility curves and mean reversion rates used in many other ENERGY functions Module in beta release ENERGY Basics APOs and ASOs bug fixed when avgstarts optexpiry and numfixings ENERGY Advanced No change ENERGY Weather Additional ways of formatting the temperature data are now provided ENERGY Swing Payatend with strips previously implemented was pay at end of all periods Now implemented is pay at end of each subperiod Module still in beta release Bug fixes if maxconstminconst and maxconst in not a multiple of the maximum daily amount in previous version minconst was disregarded in this case in strip with global constraints if allowed number of swings per period changes currently this can only be due to calendar effects strip at index index was incorrectly evaluated after first subperiod New Excel Templates The following Excel workbooks and worksheets have been added powercalibxls examples of generating ENERGY parameters for power Addin Manager Now supports function help If template is open with the Addin manager and function help is requested through the manager
