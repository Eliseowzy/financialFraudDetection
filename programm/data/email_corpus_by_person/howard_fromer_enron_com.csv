CONFERENCE IS MAJOR SUCCESS From the people who attended the Tuesday night reception to statewide and national newspaper radio and television coverage IPPNYs th Annual Legislative Spring Conference was a rousing success IPPNY Executi ve Director Gavin J Donohue declared The conference whose theme was The Heat is On Preparing for Summer featured an address from Gov George E Patakis senior policy advisor J ohn P Cahill as well as remarks from Senate Energy Committee Chairman James W Wright Speakers from the Department of Public Service the New York Independent System Operator the New York Energy Research and Development Authority an d representatives of the coal oil and natural gas industries gave the conference attendees valuable insights into the energy and fuel supply picture for the summer In his lunchtime remarks Cahill emphasized Gov Patakis commitment to speeding up the process of siting generating capacity in New York The administration he said wants the Article X siting process to be effective We will redouble our efforts to make sure the staff at each agency is as prompt and responsive as they can be under the circumstances Cahill sa id I will also be asking each agency involved in the Article X process to review its current staffing allocations to determine whether an additional reallocation for Article X project review is necessary The Pataki administration wants to hear from IPPNY members on changes that should be made in the Article X law Cahill said He invited members to use IPPNY as their conduit for ideas The Pataki administration also wants renewed emphasis on increased transmission capacity and will push demand reduction Cahill said These measures are necessary to make sure the market works and stave off cries fr om politicians who want to reregulate the energy system Cahill said He also emphasized Gov Patakis commitment to environmental protection while promising to be sensitive to the issues of service reliability a nd the states need for additional power generation Sound energy policy also means sound environmental policy Cahill said Wright emphasized that the state Senate is focusing on tax cuts as a way to help energy companies compete in the marketplace The Senates goal is to keep the Legislature out of the energy regulation business he saidThe wor st thing that could happen to the energy marketplace is for state lawmakers to try to legislatively micromanage that process The state is responding to the need for additional capacity Wright said T he average time to permit new generating projects in New York has gone from an average of days for the first projects going through the Article X process to days for the most recent projects he pointed out Assembly Energy Committee Chairman Paul Tonko had looked forward to addressing conference attendees but was kept away by unavoidable legislati ve business Steven McClary principal partner in MRW Associates a California energyconsulting firm gave IPPNY members a rundown on that states ene rgy mishaps A key piece of Californias new energy policy is a requirement that he fully charge up his laptop computer in New York before hes allowed b ack home McClary joked California did everything it shouldnt have McClary told the conference Artificially low rates put Pacific Gas and Electric into bankruptcy and a three cent per kilowatt hour price increase allowed by state regulators ha sn t yet been implemented Only a state offer to buy Southern California Ediso n s transmission lines which the legislature appears unlikely to approve is keeping that utility from declaring bankruptcy he said Meanwhile California electric rates have gone up very little providing no incentive for customers to use less power McClary said The high utility prices Californians complain about on the TV news are natural gas rates he said Peter Smith vice president of programs for NYSERDA outlined demand reduction measures being advanced by the agency and emphasized the need fo r more natural gas supply in the state The reliability of the electric system hinges on the reliability of th e natural gas system Smith said Paul Powers director of the Department of Public

is a memo prepared by IPPNY summarizing a NY Court of Appeals NYs highest court decision issued last week that could impact environmen tal reviews of projects that are smaller than MW and thus not subject to the States siting law As noted by IPPNY the impact of this court ruling could be to delay the environmental review and thus the permitting time fo r these smaller plants In other generationrelated developments the NYS Siting Board last week approved the Astoria Energy project This is a MW natural gasfired combinedcycle facility to be loacted in Astoria Que ens New York City The plant is estimated to go in service the rd quarter of This brings to over MW the amount of new incity generation recently approved by the State Siting Board on top of the MwW added t his past summer by the NY Power Authority Original Message From Vanessa Anctil mailto Sent Monday November PM To IPPNY Members Cc Carolyn Brown Subject Member Alert Court of Appeals issues Potential Setbackt o SEQRA Generators In NYPA Turbine Ruling Member Alert November Court of Appeals issues Potential Setback to SEQRA Generators In NYPA Turbi ne Ruling On November the New York State Court of Appeals denied a motion b y the New York Power Authority NYPA for leave to appeal a Appellate Div ision decision Uprose v Power Authority of State of New York requiring t he preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement EIS for its install ation of GE LM turbines at several sites in New York City IPPNYs brief supporting NYPAs motion was accepted by the Court The impact of the ruling may be to delay the environmental review for projects evaluated under the State Environmental Quality Review Act SEQRA The Court of Appeals the States highest court did not affirm the Appella te Divisions decision it merely declined to consider the appeal which wa s discretionary The decision is binding only in the courts of the nd jud icial department which includes Long Island and Westchester although cour ts in other areas of the state may rely on the case for guidance Prior to the lawsuit NYPA issued a negative declaration of potential signi ficant impact with regard to the turbine projects a SEQRA prerequisite to proceeding without preparing an EIS The Appellate Division decision requi red that NYPA prepare an EIS by January because NYPAs analysis of particulate matter PM which relied on an evaluation of PM as a proxy was insufficiently detailed to support a negative declaration The potential impact for new generation projects is that applicants proposi ng power plants under MW which are subject to SEQRA may be required to prepare an EIS A State agency may still be able to issue a negative decl aration and thus avoid the requirement to prepare an EIS if an applicant demonstrates in its Environmental Assessment Form EAF that there is no potential for adverse environmental impacts from PM However as a resu lt of the Uprose decision the applicant may not be able to make this demon stration by relying on a PM proxy analysis If the demonstration cannot be made that PM will not have a potential adverse environmental impact the agency must make a positive declaration requiring the preparation of a n EIS and associated public notice and participation Potentially signific ant delay could result from this process The Appellate Division decision should have little impact on Article X appl ications The Article X process supplants the SEQRA process Essentially the Article X process requires the preparation of an EIS equivalent where in PM is analyzed At least one case Consolidated Edisons East River Repowering Project has addressed the PM issue In that case the Depar tment of Environmental Conservation DEC Department of Health and the Department of Public Service agreed that the only applicable legal standard for PM is the PM proxy standard The Board on Electric Generation Si ting and the Environment ruled that PM was not an issue in the case beca use it is within the purview of the companion DEC air permit proceeding A ruling distinguishing the Uprose case was made by the Commissioner of DEC Although the court found that the proxy analysis conducted by NYPA was no t sufficiently detailed in the EAF to support a negative declaration under SEQRA in the Uprose case the DEC Commissioner found in the East River case that the PM analysis will support the determination as to whether or not the proposed project complies with the PM standard In an unrelated development the FERC last week issued two orders addressin g issues related to market mitigation In its Order Establishing Refund Ef fective Date And Proposing To Revise MarketBased Rate Tariffs And Authoriz ations Market Rates Order FERC instituted a proceeding to investigate the justness and reasonableness of the terms and conditions of marketbased rate tariffs and authorizations of wholesale generators FERC noted that it intends to revise all existing marketbased rate tariffs and authorizati ons by adding the following language which will be included in all new aut horizations as well As a condition of obtaining and retaining marketbased rate authority the seller is prohibited from engaging in anticompetitive behavior or the exer cise of market power The sellers marketbased rate authority is subject t o refunds or other remedies as may be appropriate to address any anticompet itive behavior or exercise of market power FERC indicated that the refund effective date will be days from notice o f the Market Rates Order in the Federal Register In a second order FERC announced that it will implement an industrywide s tandard market mitigation measure that will address conditions of market sh ortage in which market power could be abused The surplus margin assessmen t SMA tool will be employed by FERC to determine what entities possess market power The SMA will replace the FERCs existing HubandSpoke met hodology for determining whether an entity possesses market power Entiti es that fail the screen are required to sell uncommitted capacity into the spot market pursuant to a form of costofservice rates The SMA order exp ressly does not apply in New York because FERC noted that it will not appl y this new mitigation procedure in markets including NY where market miti gation plans have been approved by FERC Copies of the orders are available upon

issued the attached order approving an extension of the NYISOs Automated Mitigation Procedures also known as the AMP or Circuit Breaker through April rather than until October as had been s ought by the ISO Enron had submitted comments opposing the ISOs request FERC also directs the ISO to file a comprehensive mitigation proposal that addresses FERCs concerns with the AMP as well as FERCs concerns regarding how the ISOs overall mitigation measures work together This proposal is due by March to be effective May FERC acknowledges two problems with the AMP that the NYISO has already comm itted to fix limiting the mitigation to specific zones and hours that fail the impact test and exempting bids of less than MW unless thee is a de monstrated market power concern In addition FERC directs the ISO to work with market participants to examine whether the AMP may serve as a bar rier to entry for new generation and whether such new generation should be exempted from the AMP examine whether other energy limited resources including those constrained by environmental rules should be exempted fro m or accommodated in the AMP Currently only hydro units are exempted beca use their volatile bids often reflect their opportunity costs not market p ower FERC believes this logic applies to all energy limited resources as w ell file a comprehensive mitigation proposal which also explains how t he AMP will work in conjunction with other mitigation measures already in e ffect or proposed including the incity mitigation measures FERC is conc erned here that that all the pieces may not fit together and there may be i nconsistencies and gaps and consider mustrun mitigation measures con sistent with ISONE and PJM Again FERC seems to be concerned here with tr ansmission constraints within NYC Note that the Con Ed distribution syste m is not secured by the ISO and this has been at the root of most of the ou tofmerit calls in the City Finally FERC cautions the NYISO that it ex pects one mitigation plan for the Northeast as part of the RTO process and it encourages them to collaborate with PJM and ISONE in formulating its M arch comprehensive mitigation plan Original Message From Leonardo Samuel Sent Tuesday November AMexamine To Nicolay Christi L Fulton Donna Stroup Kerry Novosel Sarah Lind berg Susan Cc Fromer Howard Subject NYISOOrder approving extension of automatic mitigation procedures subject to conditions FERC UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION Before Commissioners Pat Wood III Chairman William L Massey Linda Breathitt And Nora Mead Brownell New York Independent System Operator Inc Docket No ER ORDER APPROVING EXTENSION OF AUTOMATIC MITIGATION PROCEDURES SUBJECT TO CON DITIONS Issued November On September the New York Independent System Operator Inc NYIS O filed pursuant to section of the Federal Power Act FPA a req uest to extend the termination date for the Automated Mitigation Procedures AMP to October The Commissions June order in this proceed ing approving the AMP required those automated procedures to expire on Octo ber In this order we accept NYISOs proposed extension of the A MP until April and we direct NYISO to file a comprehensive mitiga tion proposal that addresses the Commissions concerns with the AMP set for th in this order as well as our concerns regarding how NYISOs overall mit igation measures work together NYISO is directed to file the comprehensiv e mitigation proposal by March to be effective May The Co mmissions action here benefits customers by protecting them from market po wer while establishing procedures to modify and improve the AMP mechanism as well as other mitigation measures in NYISO I Procedural Background In a November order the Commission accepted in part and rejec ted in part the market monitoring and mitigation plans filed by NYISO In instances where NYISO concludes that a specific market participant is exerc ising market power the Commission accepted NYISOs proposal to allow it to engage in discussions to resolve the issues informally or issue demand let ters requesting the participant cease certain behavior In addition the C ommission stated that NYISO could file on a casebycase basis under sectio n of the FPA to impose specific mitigation measures or to make such fi lings based on recurring types of conduct that warrant mitigation However the Commission did not allow NYISO to reduce bid flexibility impose fina ncial obligations to pay for operating reserves or impose default bids be cause this would give too much discretion to NYISO in pricesetting and oth er similar regulatory functions without Commission review The Commission determined that NYISO had not described with sufficient specificity the typ es of conduct that would trigger the imposition of these measures it had n ot established specific thresholds or bright line tests that would trigger the conclusion that market power had been exercised In a March order the Commission further clarified NYISOs aut hority under the plans Among other things the Commission accepted the sp ecific thresholds proposed by NYISO to trigger possible mitigation but rej ected NYISOs proposal to keep them confidential The Commission also allo wed NYISO limited discretion as to when to mitigate eg NYISO may choose not to impose mitigation if it is satisfied with the partys explanation f or its behavior and for how long but required NYISO to clarify that mitig ation for market power may be imposed only prospectively In a complaint filed in Docket No EL the Mirant Companies Miran t alleged that NYISO improperly intended to implement the AMP without fili ng any changes to the MMM pursuant to either section or of the FPA In its May order on Mirants complaint the Commission found that part of NYISOs proposal is within the bounds of its existing tariff in that section b of the Market Mitigation Measures MMM specifically envisions use of the Security Constrained Unit Commitment SCUC to id entify questionable conduct However the Commission also found that NYISO s AMP proposal needed to be examined in greater detail before it could be approved Further the Commission noted that section c of the FPA req uires that NYISO keep on file with the Commission practices and regulation s affecting its rates and that NYISOs tariff did not contain language ad equately specifying the timing and the process that are contained in the AM P Accordingly the Commission concluded that if NYISO wishes to implemen t its AMP proposal it must file revised tariff sheets pursuant to section of the FPA to set forth the AMP procedures In that filing the Commis sion added NYISO must address the concerns raised by the parties in the Mi rant complaint proceeding including whether the AMP provides sufficie nt opportunity for meaningful consultation whether inaccurate marketc learing prices will result even if the party whose bid was improperly mitig ated is ultimately made whole whether the AMP would establish a new threshold that never appears in the MMM and whether NYISO proposes to exclude hydro units imports and exports from the AMP On March in Docket No ER NYISO filed a new Attachmen t H to its Services Tariff which incorporated the proposed AMP procedures March Filing By order issued June the Commission accept ed NYISOs March Filing allowed NYISO to implement the AMP mechanism for summer capability period when supplies may still be tight and when th e effectiveness of new demand response mechanisms are uncertain The Commi ssion viewed the proposed mechanism as only a temporary solution and agree d with certain of the intervenors that the proposed AMP may mitigate bids i n situations where market power is not the cause for high or volatile bids and may not provide for sufficient consultation with generators to reasona bly establish that particular bids were attempts to exercise market power The Commission further explained that automatic market power mitigation ma y be most appropriate where it is tied to structural market power problems such as mustrun situations where generators would otherwise be in a posit ion to name their price and noted that both PJM and ISONE use this more l imited approach to automatic mitigation II NYISOs Market Mitigation Procedures Including AMP Under Commission orders allowing NYISO to implement its MMM NYISOs Market Monitoring Unit MMU in consultation with NYISOs Market Advisor is responsible for monitoring the markets administered or controll ed by NYISO and for mitigating a market partys conduct when NYISO determin es that market power has been exercised The MMM has specific threshold va lues for identifying generators or transmission facilities that exercise ma rket power NYISO imposes mitigation when a market partys conduct has a m aterial effect on prices or on guarantee payments Conduct and impact crit eria must be satisfied before NYISO may mitigate a generators bid NYISO may not mitigate market prices retroactively Under its manual procedures prior to implementation of the AMP NYISO is a ble to identify conduct and pricing impacts that exceed the MMM standards o nly after the SCUC runs for a given dayahead market have been completed w hich means that mitigation cannot be implemented until the next days daya head market The primary purpose of the AMP is to eliminate the oneday la g inherent in the manual application of the market mitigation thresholds th at currently exist in NYISOs market mitigation That delay can be importa nt when market conditions arise that permit an exercise of market power T he AMP procedures are activated when the SCUC that calculates dayahead mar ket prices makes a preliminary determination that prices in a given area of New York will exceed absent mitigation Once the AMP is activat ed it only mitigates bids if specific thresholds for both bidding conduct and market impact are crossed The conduct and impact thresholds used by t he AMP are the same thresholds approved by the Commission under NYISOs Mar ket Mitigation Measures Under the automated procedures of the AMP nonco mpetitive bidding behavior is still mitigated prospectively as authorized in the MMM but the mitigation will occur within the SCUC runs in which the conduct and price effect thresholds of the MMM are crossed without the on eday delay that occurs under the manual procedures III This Filing On September NYISO filed to extend the AMP which would otherwise expire on October until October NYISO requests waiver of the day prior notice requirement to permit a November effective date NYISO states that good cause exists for the waiver in orde r to prevent a gap in the availability of the AMP NYISO believes the performance of the AMP was consistent with its design w hich is to eliminate the delay of one DayAhead Market cycle inherent in ma nual application of the market mitigation thresholds NYISO explains that during Summer prices hit the level times but the AMP imposed bid caps only four times Of those four times the largest average number of megawatts mitigated was while customers were protected from more t hat million in unwarranted energy costs NYISO further states that onl y twice did AMP mitigation apply to more than one entity in one zone NYIS O concludes that while the AMP is an automated procedure it does not autom atically apply bid caps whenever prices are high Absent mitigation NYISO states that significant unwarranted wealth transfe rs from buyers to sellers could take place especially during highload summ er months when supply may be tight NYISO asserts however that transmissi on constraints can create tight market conditions in small areas even durin g shoulder months NYISO states that the conditions necessitating the need for the AMP are alm ost certain to be present this coming summer as they were this past summer and with the potential for market power problems to arise in shoulder peri ods as well it is preferable to keep the AMP in place while improvements a re implemented and additional analysis under taken rather than to summaril y terminate the AMP NYISO states that the AMP while working as intended is subject to improve ments Specifically NYISO states that it intends to make two improvements in the AMP prior to Summer The proposed modifications will have the effect of narrowing the scope of the AMP to mitigate prices only when mark et power exists First NYISO proposes to exclude from mitigation by the AMP a Market Participants bids that trigger the conduct test for mitigatio n if the total quantity of those bids is MW or less unless analysis sho ws the relevant units are in a position to exercise market power at those q uantity levels At present the AMP excludes bids by bidding entities with MW or less of capacity NYISO stated the reason for exempting such bid s was because the withholding of such small amounts will rarely have a mate rial effect on prices Second NYISO proposes to limit mitigation to zones in which the price impa ct test for mitigation is met by implementing at least one additional AMP p ass in SCUC This proposed change would finetune the application of the A MP to limit mitigation to the specified zones and hours where the price imp act test is met At present under the AMP all bids subject to the AMP t hat exceed the conduct thresholds in the areas where zonal prices exceed are tested for their impact on prices in a single SCUC pass If the pr ice impact threshold is exceeded in any hour or any zone the results of th e mitigated pass are used to determine the DayAhead prices The proposed modification will appropriately exclude mitigation from occurring in those areas or hours where the price impact test is not met NYISO states that it will be working on correcting other minor flaws i n the AMP and that it is committed to working with Market Participants to d etermine if other refinements or changes in the AMP design should be consid ered IV Notice of Filing and Pleadings Notice of NYISOs filing was published in the Federal Register Fed Reg with comments protests and

comments Although Rule a of the Commission s Rules of Practice and Procedure CFR a genera lly prohibit answers to protests we will accept the New York Commissions answer because it helps clarify issues under consideration in this proceedi ng Intervenor Protests and Comments Five parties as identified above support NYISOs proposal New York City believes that the extension of the AMP is a necessary but not sufficient measure for mitigating excessive prices It maintains that the AMP does n ot adequately protect New York City consumers from excessive wholesale pric es because it sets too high a trigger for implementing the mitigation noti ng that the AMP was not triggered on August when dayahead energy prices reached a record MWH in New York City Similarly ConEd belie ves that the AMP remains necessary to prevent or identify and mitigate the exercise of market power in New Yorks dayahead market It asserts that e xtending the AMP will permit NYISO to assess further the coordinated operat ion of the various mitigation measures that it administers The New York Commission asserts that the AMP is needed throughout the year focuses only on high prices caused by market power and has not unreasona bly disadvantaged generators It also believes that the AMP complements bu t does not duplicate the incity mitigation measures remains necessary des pite pricecapped load bidding and virtual bidding and conforms to the Com missions preference for ex ante mitigation The Consumer Board maintains that the fundamental rationale for the AMP has not changed the AMP is work ing as intended and has not unduly interfered with the performance of compe titive markets NYISO has committed to make improvements in the AMP before next summer The Multiple Intervenors also agree that the AMP is necessary to prevent the exercise of market power and believe that the Commission sh ould encourage NYISO to continue to improve the AMP Eight parties as identified above filed protests concerning NYISOs propo sal Mirant asserts that NYISO has not shown the AMP is needed or addresse d the flaws in the AMP identified by the Commission It also states that t he AMP resulted in the improper mitigation of economically justifiable bids during the Summer Capability Period and is likely to harm consumers b y discouraging efficient supplyside and demandside decisions EPSA and W illiams make similar arguments EPSA further asserts that mitigation measu res should not be a part of the discussions to form a Northeastern RTO Th e Independent Producers maintain that the AMP is flawed because it improper ly mitigates bids that do not cross the impact threshold required for mitig ation and because it mitigates a generators bids for quantities that are not large enough to represent an exercise of market power They further st ate that some units were improperly mitigated as a result of flawed calcula tions of reference level curves that the AMP has not been tied to structur al market power problems and that the AMP improperly inhibits ICAP generat ors from managing their risk by choosing whether to sell in the dayahead o r in the realtime market Enron supports the protests of EPSA and the Ind ependent Producers Aquila makes many of the arguments described above and also asserts that NY ISOs AMP extension request ignores the improvements in market conditions t hat have occurred over the summer of Aquila maintains that at a mini mum the Commission should deny NYISOs request to continue the AMP withou t prejudice to a subsequent filing by NYISO that address the flaws with the current version of the AMP Keyspan suggests as an alternative that the A MP should only be extended until April and only if the MW exem ption is extended the consultation process is revised a structural power screen is added and a firm timetable for completion of the items discussed in NYISOs filing is provided In addition to arguments made by other protesters Dynegy asserts that the AMP has not worked as designed and that on August of its daya head market bids for August for its Roseton Units and had been mitig ated Dynegy maintains that these should not have been mitigated since the y did not cross the conduct threshold in NYISOs MMP and that Dynegy sti ll has not received a direct explanation from NYISO as to why its bids were mitigated although recent NYISO reports and statements indicate that a mi stake was made with respect to Dynegys bids Dynegy states that an explan ation of the performance of the AMP was provided in a memorandum now avail able on NYISOs website made available to those that attended a joint meet ing of the Scheduling Pricing Working Group and the Market Structures Wor king Group held on October According to Dynegy at that meeting NYISO claimed that the AMP worked as designed since the coding for the comp uter programs worked as intended although certain upstream data inputs cau sed Dynegys bids to be improperly mitigated Further Dynegy asserts that NYISO has dropped the million day price spike June as just ification for the AMP and now concedes that the price spike was due to seam s problems Answers In its answer the New York Commission reaffirms its support for the propos ed extension of the AMP until October The New York Commission st ates that the AMP is necessary to ensure that wholesale prices are just and reasonable in light of the tight supply situation and transmission constra ints that continue to exist in New York In response to the arguments presented by the generators opposing the exten sion of the AMP the New York Commission submits that the AMP adequately d istinguishes between high prices associated with market power and high pric es associated with scarcity the AMP properly evaluates the combined impac t of generators and the AMP is needed through the year not just during th e summer capability period during high load periods given transmission con straints and scheduled and unscheduled outages during shoulder months Fin ally in response to generators concerns that the AMP may mitigate in cert ain situations where mitigation should not have taken place the New York C ommission says that it is just as important to protect against the occurren ce of market power that goes unmitigated should the AMP not be extended A bsent the AMP the New York Commission states the harm of permitting unmiti gated market power would be far greater than any harm caused by improper mi tigation The New York Commission compares the million withheld from g enerators as a result of the AMP being in effect during Summer with th e million resulting from a single day of unmitigated market power in V Discussion NYISO has proposed to extend the same AMP the Commission approved in the Ju ne Order without modification NYISO states that it is committed to ma king further refinements to narrow the impact of the mitigation performed u nder the AMP and states it is committed to making what it refers to as two major improvements prior to Summer limiting the mitigation to specif ic zones and hours that fail the impact test and exempting bids of less tha n MW unless there is a demonstrated market power concern Our review of the AMP indicates that it appropriately attempts to distingui sh between market power and scarcity The AMP closes the one day lag inhe rent in the manual application of mitigation measures in the current MMM an d thus advances the ability of NYISO to mitigate market power Implementat ion of the AMP is not without concerns however The AMP as noted by NYIS O and other market participants requires some refinements and additional r eview eg determination of Reference Prices unnecessary mitigation app lication to energy limited resources Also AMP may be one of the many barriers to entry for new generating facil ities We direct NYISO to work with market participants especially the Ne w York Commission to examine barriers to entry for new generation As par t of this process the NYISO may consider exempting new generators from AMP in its March filing We note that generators in PJM have an exemption fro m mustrun mitigation If NYISO chooses to exempt new units NYISO should address whether the exemption would encourage more rapid entry of new gener ators and the effect of such exemption would have on NYISOs comprehensive mitigation proposal NYISO proposes to exempt hydro units from the AMP NYISO believes that hyd ro units should not be subject to such mitigation because their volatile bi ds often reflect their opportunity costs not market power The Commission believes this logic applies to all energy limited resources including tho se constrained by environmental rules Therefore we direct NYISO to work with market participants to determine whether there are other energy limite d resources and to develop an appropriate accommodation within the AMP proc edures This coordination should develop both standing protocols as well a s an accounting for possible daytoday considerations affecting bids Accordingly we will extend the AMP until April subject to the fo llowing conditions We note that NYISO has already indicated that it is co mmitted to working with market participants to determine if other refinemen ts or changes in the AMP design should be considered We direct NYISO meet with market participants and to file a comprehensive mitigation proposal w hich addresses the Commissions concerns expressed in this order concerning the AMP as well as explain how AMP will work in conjunction with other mi tigation measures already in effect or proposed for NYISO In this regard we note that NYISO has several mitigation measures in place or proposed including its existing MMM and its proposed AMP as well as InCity mitigation We are concerned that these measures may not fully fi t together in a way that adequately addresses market power problems while a voiding unnecessary mitigation On the one hand these measure may not mit igate all significant exercises of market power For example the existing MMM allows suppliers to exercise market power for one day before mitigatio n goes into effect On the other hand other measures may create the poten tial for unnecessary mitigation We also direct NYISO to consider mustrun mitigation measures consistent wi th ISONE and PJM The InCity mitigation measures address market power p roblems created by transmission constraints into New York City but not tho se created by transmission constraints within New York City or elsewhere PJM and ISONE both have mitigation measures which provide for automatic mi tigation in defined mustrun situations Accordingly we direct NYISO to file a comprehensive mitigation proposal by March to be effective May When developing a comprehensiv e mitigation plan NYISO should bear in mind that the Commission expects on e mitigation plan for the Northeast as part of the RTO process Therefore we strongly urge NYISO to collaborate with PJM and ISONE in formulating it s comprehensive mitigation plan The Commission orders A NYISOs request to extend the AMP is granted until April sub ject to the conditions set forth in

FYI is a memo prepared by IPPNY summarizing a NY Court of Appeals NYs highest court decision issued last week that could impact environmen tal reviews of projects that are smaller than MW and thus not subject to the States siting law As noted by IPPNY the impact of this court ruling could be to delay the environmental review and thus the permitting time fo r these smaller plants In other

The plant is estimated to go in service the rd quarter of This brings to over MW the amount of new incity generation recently approved by the State Siting Board on top of the MwW added t his past

SEQRA Generators In NYPA Turbine Ruling Member Alert November Court of Appeals issues Potential Setback to SEQRA Generators In NYPA Turbi ne Ruling On November the New York State Court of Appeals denied a motion b y the New York Power Authority NYPA for leave to appeal a Appellate Div ision decision Uprose v Power Authority of State of New York requiring t he preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement EIS for its install ation of GE LM turbines at several sites in New York City IPPNYs brief supporting NYPAs motion was accepted by the Court The impact of the ruling may be to delay the environmental review for projects evaluated under the State Environmental Quality Review Act SEQRA The Court of Appeals the States highest court did not affirm the Appella te Divisions decision it merely declined to consider the appeal which wa s discretionary The decision is binding only in the courts of the nd jud icial department which includes Long Island and Westchester although cour ts in other areas of the state may rely on the case for guidance Prior to the lawsuit NYPA issued a negative declaration of potential signi ficant impact with regard to the turbine projects a SEQRA prerequisite to proceeding without preparing an EIS The Appellate Division decision requi red that NYPA prepare an EIS by January because NYPAs analysis of particulate matter PM which relied on an evaluation of PM as a proxy was insufficiently detailed to support a negative declaration The potential impact for new generation projects is that applicants proposi ng power plants under MW which are subject to SEQRA may be required to prepare an EIS A State agency may still be able to issue a negative decl aration and thus avoid the requirement to prepare an EIS if an applicant demonstrates in its Environmental Assessment Form EAF that there is no potential for adverse environmental impacts from PM However as a resu lt of the Uprose decision the applicant may not be able to make this demon stration by relying on a PM proxy analysis If the demonstration cannot be made that PM will not have a potential adverse environmental impact the agency must make a positive declaration requiring the preparation of a n EIS and associated public notice and participation Potentially signific ant delay could result from this process The Appellate Division decision should have little impact on Article X appl ications The Article X process supplants the SEQRA process Essentially the Article X process requires the preparation of an EIS equivalent where in PM is analyzed At least one case Consolidated Edisons East River Repowering Project has addressed the PM issue In that case the Depar tment of Environmental Conservation DEC Department of Health and the Department of Public Service agreed that the only applicable legal standard for PM is the PM proxy standard The Board on Electric Generation Si ting and the Environment ruled that PM was not an issue in the case beca use it is within the purview of the companion DEC air permit proceeding A ruling distinguishing the Uprose case was made by the Commissioner of DEC Although the court found that the proxy analysis conducted by NYPA was no t sufficiently detailed in the EAF to support a negative declaration under SEQRA in the Uprose case the DEC Commissioner found in the East River case that the PM analysis will support the determination as to whether or not the proposed project complies with the PM standard In an unrelated development the FERC last week issued two orders addressin g issues related to market mitigation In its Order Establishing Refund Ef fective Date And Proposing To Revise MarketBased Rate Tariffs And Authoriz ations Market Rates Order FERC instituted a proceeding to investigate the justness and reasonableness of the terms and conditions of marketbased rate tariffs and authorizations of wholesale generators FERC noted that it intends to revise all existing marketbased rate tariffs and authorizati ons by adding the following language which will be included in all new aut horizations as well As a condition of obtaining and retaining marketbased rate authority the seller is prohibited from engaging in anticompetitive behavior or the exer cise of market power The sellers marketbased rate authority is subject t o refunds or other remedies as may be appropriate to address any anticompet itive behavior or exercise of market power FERC indicated that the refund effective date will be days from notice o f the Market Rates Order in the Federal Register In a second order FERC announced that it will implement an industrywide s tandard market mitigation measure that will address conditions of market sh ortage in which market power could be abused The surplus margin assessmen t SMA tool will be employed by FERC to determine what entities possess market power The SMA will replace the FERCs existing HubandSpoke met hodology for determining whether an entity possesses market power Entiti es that fail the screen are required to sell uncommitted capacity into the spot market pursuant to a form of costofservice rates The SMA order exp ressly does not apply in New York because FERC noted that it will not appl y this new mitigation procedure in markets including NY where market miti gation plans have been approved by FERC Copies of the orders are available upon request If you have any questions please dont hesitate to contact IPPNY

issued the attached order approving an extension of the NYISOs Automated Mitigation Procedures also known as the AMP or Circuit Breaker through April rather than until October as had been s ought by the ISO Enron had submitted comments opposing the ISOs request FERC also directs the ISO to file a comprehensive mitigation proposal that addresses FERCs concerns with the AMP as well as FERCs concerns regarding how the ISOs overall mitigation measures work together This proposal is due by March to be effective May FERC acknowledges two problems with the AMP that the NYISO has already comm itted to fix limiting the mitigation to specific zones and hours that fail the impact test and exempting bids of less than MW unless thee is a de monstrated market power concern In addition FERC directs the ISO to work with market participants to examine whether the AMP may serve as a bar rier to entry for new generation and whether such new generation should be exempted from the AMP examine whether other energy limited resources including those constrained by environmental rules should be exempted fro m or accommodated in the AMP Currently only hydro units are exempted beca use their volatile bids often reflect their opportunity costs not market p ower FERC believes this logic applies to all energy limited resources as w ell file a comprehensive mitigation proposal which also explains how t he AMP will work in conjunction with other mitigation measures already in e ffect or proposed including the incity mitigation measures FERC is conc erned here that that all the pieces may not fit together and there may be i nconsistencies and gaps and consider mustrun mitigation measures con sistent with ISONE and PJM Again FERC seems to be concerned here with tr ansmission constraints within NYC Note that the Con Ed distribution syste m is not secured by the ISO and this has been at the root of most of the ou tofmerit calls in the City Finally FERC cautions the NYISO that it ex pects one mitigation plan for the Northeast as part of the RTO process and it encourages them to collaborate with PJM and ISONE in formulating its M arch comprehensive mitigation plan Original Message From Leonardo Samuel Sent Tuesday November AMexamine To Nicolay Christi L Fulton Donna Stroup Kerry Novosel Sarah Lind berg Susan Cc Fromer Howard Subject NYISOOrder approving extension of automatic mitigation procedures subject to conditions FERC UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION Before Commissioners Pat Wood III Chairman William L Massey Linda Breathitt And Nora Mead Brownell New York Independent System Operator Inc Docket No ER ORDER APPROVING EXTENSION OF AUTOMATIC MITIGATION PROCEDURES SUBJECT TO CON DITIONS Issued November On September the New York Independent System Operator Inc NYIS O filed pursuant to section of the Federal Power Act FPA a req uest to extend the termination date for the Automated Mitigation Procedures AMP to October The Commissions June order in this proceed ing approving the AMP required those automated procedures to expire on Octo ber In this order we accept NYISOs proposed extension of the A MP until April and we direct NYISO to file a comprehensive mitiga tion proposal that addresses the Commissions concerns with the AMP set for th in this order as well as our concerns regarding how NYISOs overall mit igation measures work together NYISO is directed to file the comprehensiv e mitigation proposal by March to be effective May The Co mmissions action here benefits customers by protecting them from market po wer while establishing procedures to modify and improve the AMP mechanism as well as other mitigation measures in NYISO I Procedural Background In a November order the Commission accepted in part and rejec ted in part the market monitoring and mitigation plans filed by NYISO In instances where NYISO concludes that a specific market participant is exerc ising market power the Commission accepted NYISOs proposal to allow it to engage in discussions to resolve the issues informally or issue demand let ters requesting the participant cease certain behavior In addition the C ommission stated that NYISO could file on a casebycase basis under sectio n of the FPA to impose specific mitigation measures or to make such fi lings based on recurring types of conduct that warrant mitigation However the Commission did not allow NYISO to reduce bid flexibility impose fina ncial obligations to pay for operating reserves or impose default bids be cause this would give too much discretion to NYISO in pricesetting and oth er similar regulatory functions without Commission review The Commission determined that NYISO had not described with sufficient specificity the typ es of conduct that would trigger the imposition of these measures it had n ot established specific thresholds or bright line tests that would trigger the conclusion that market power had been exercised In a March order the Commission further clarified NYISOs aut hority under the plans Among other things the Commission accepted the sp ecific thresholds proposed by NYISO to trigger possible mitigation but rej ected NYISOs proposal to keep them confidential The Commission also allo wed NYISO limited discretion as to when to mitigate eg NYISO may choose not to impose mitigation if it is satisfied with the partys explanation f or its behavior and for how long but required NYISO to clarify that mitig ation for market power may be imposed only prospectively In a complaint filed in Docket No EL the Mirant Companies Miran t alleged that NYISO improperly intended to implement the AMP without fili ng any changes to the MMM pursuant to either section or of the FPA In its May order on Mirants complaint the Commission found that part of NYISOs proposal is within the bounds of its existing tariff in that section b of the Market Mitigation Measures MMM specifically envisions use of the Security Constrained Unit Commitment SCUC to id entify questionable conduct However the Commission also found that NYISO s AMP proposal needed to be examined in greater detail before it could be approved Further the Commission noted that section c of the FPA req uires that NYISO keep on file with the Commission practices and regulation s affecting its rates and that NYISOs tariff did not contain language ad equately specifying the timing and the process that are contained in the AM P Accordingly the Commission concluded that if NYISO wishes to implemen t its AMP proposal it must file revised tariff sheets pursuant to section of the FPA to set forth the AMP procedures In that filing the Commis sion added NYISO must address the concerns raised by the parties in the Mi rant complaint proceeding including whether the AMP provides sufficie nt opportunity for meaningful consultation whether inaccurate marketc learing prices will result even if the party whose bid was improperly mitig ated is ultimately made whole whether the AMP would establish a new threshold that never appears in the MMM and whether NYISO proposes to exclude hydro units imports and exports from the AMP On March in Docket No ER NYISO filed a new Attachmen t H to its Services Tariff which incorporated the proposed AMP procedures March Filing By order issued June the Commission accept ed NYISOs March Filing allowed NYISO to implement the AMP mechanism for summer capability period when supplies may still be tight and when th e effectiveness of new demand response mechanisms are uncertain The Commi ssion viewed the proposed mechanism as only a temporary solution and agree d with certain of the intervenors that the proposed AMP may mitigate bids i n situations where market power is not the cause for high or volatile bids and may not provide for sufficient consultation with generators to reasona bly establish that particular bids were attempts to exercise market power The Commission further explained that automatic market power mitigation ma y be most appropriate where it is tied to structural market power problems such as mustrun situations where generators would otherwise be in a posit ion to name their price and noted that both PJM and ISONE use this more l imited approach to automatic mitigation II NYISOs Market Mitigation Procedures Including AMP Under Commission orders allowing NYISO to implement its MMM NYISOs Market Monitoring Unit MMU in consultation with NYISOs Market Advisor is responsible for monitoring the markets administered or controll ed by NYISO and for mitigating a market partys conduct when NYISO determin es that market power has been exercised The MMM has specific threshold va lues for identifying generators or transmission facilities that exercise ma rket power NYISO imposes mitigation when a market partys conduct has a m aterial effect on prices or on guarantee payments Conduct and impact crit eria must be satisfied before NYISO may mitigate a generators bid NYISO may not mitigate market prices retroactively Under its manual procedures prior to implementation of the AMP NYISO is a ble to identify conduct and pricing impacts that exceed the MMM standards o nly after the SCUC runs for a given dayahead market have been completed w hich means that mitigation cannot be implemented until the next days daya head market The primary purpose of the AMP is to eliminate the oneday la g inherent in the manual application of the market mitigation thresholds th at currently exist in NYISOs market mitigation That delay can be importa nt when market conditions arise that permit an exercise of market power T he AMP procedures are activated when the SCUC that calculates dayahead mar ket prices makes a preliminary determination that prices in a given area of New York will exceed absent mitigation Once the AMP is activat ed it only mitigates bids if specific thresholds for both bidding conduct and market impact are crossed The conduct and impact thresholds used by t he AMP are the same thresholds approved by the Commission under NYISOs Mar ket Mitigation Measures Under the automated procedures of the AMP nonco mpetitive bidding behavior is still mitigated prospectively as authorized in the MMM but the mitigation will occur within the SCUC runs in which the conduct and price effect thresholds of the MMM are crossed without the on eday delay that occurs under the manual procedures III This Filing On September NYISO filed to extend the AMP which would otherwise expire on October until October NYISO requests waiver of the day prior notice requirement to permit a November effective date NYISO states that good cause exists for the waiver in orde r to prevent a gap in the availability of the AMP NYISO believes the performance of the AMP was consistent with its design w hich is to eliminate the delay of one DayAhead Market cycle inherent in ma nual application of the market mitigation thresholds NYISO explains that during Summer prices hit the level times but the AMP imposed bid caps only four times Of those four times the largest average number of megawatts mitigated was while customers were protected from more t hat million in unwarranted energy costs NYISO further states that onl y twice did AMP mitigation apply to more than one entity in one zone NYIS O concludes that while the AMP is an automated procedure it does not autom atically apply bid caps whenever prices are high Absent mitigation NYISO states that significant unwarranted wealth transfe rs from buyers to sellers could take place especially during highload summ er months when supply may be tight NYISO asserts however that transmissi on constraints can create tight market conditions in small areas even durin g shoulder months NYISO states that the conditions necessitating the need for the AMP are alm ost certain to be present this coming summer as they were this past summer and with the potential for market power problems to arise in shoulder peri ods as well it is preferable to keep the AMP in place while improvements a re implemented and additional analysis under taken rather than to summaril y terminate the AMP NYISO states that the AMP while working as intended is subject to improve ments Specifically NYISO states that it intends to make two improvements in the AMP prior to Summer The proposed modifications will have the effect of narrowing the scope of the AMP to mitigate prices only when mark et power exists First NYISO proposes to exclude from mitigation by the AMP a Market Participants bids that trigger the conduct test for mitigatio n if the total quantity of those bids is MW or less unless analysis sho ws the relevant units are in a position to exercise market power at those q uantity levels At present the AMP excludes bids by bidding entities with MW or less of capacity NYISO stated the reason for exempting such bid s was because the withholding of such small amounts will rarely have a mate rial effect on prices Second NYISO proposes to limit mitigation to zones in which the price impa ct test for mitigation is met by implementing at least one additional AMP p ass in SCUC This proposed change would finetune the application of the A MP to limit mitigation to the specified zones and hours where the price imp act test is met At present under the AMP all bids subject to the AMP t hat exceed the conduct thresholds in the areas where zonal prices exceed are tested for their impact on prices in a single SCUC pass If the pr ice impact threshold is exceeded in any hour or any zone the results of th e mitigated pass are used to determine the DayAhead prices The proposed modification will appropriately exclude mitigation from occurring in those areas or hours where the price impact test is not met NYISO states that it will be working on correcting other minor flaws i n the AMP and that it is committed to working with Market Participants to d etermine if other refinements or changes in the AMP design should be consid ered IV Notice of Filing and Pleadings Notice of NYISOs filing was published in the Federal Register Fed Reg with comments protests and

issues under consideration in this proceedi ng Intervenor Protests and Comments Five parties as identified above support NYISOs proposal New York City believes that the extension of the AMP is a necessary but not sufficient measure for mitigating excessive prices It maintains that the AMP does n ot adequately protect New York City consumers from excessive wholesale pric es because it sets too high a trigger for implementing the mitigation noti ng that the AMP was not triggered on August when dayahead energy prices reached a record MWH in New York City Similarly ConEd belie ves that the AMP remains necessary to prevent or identify and mitigate the exercise of market power in New Yorks dayahead market It asserts that e xtending the AMP will permit NYISO to assess further the coordinated operat ion of the various mitigation measures that it administers The New York Commission asserts that the AMP is needed throughout the year focuses only on high prices caused by market power and has not unreasona bly disadvantaged generators It also believes that the AMP complements bu t does not duplicate the incity mitigation measures remains necessary des pite pricecapped load bidding and virtual bidding and conforms to the Com missions preference for ex ante mitigation The Consumer Board maintains that the fundamental rationale for the AMP has not changed the AMP is work ing as intended and has not unduly interfered with the performance of compe titive markets NYISO has committed to make improvements in the AMP before next summer The Multiple Intervenors also agree that the AMP is necessary to prevent the exercise of market power and believe that the Commission sh ould encourage NYISO to continue to improve the AMP Eight parties as identified above filed protests concerning NYISOs propo sal Mirant asserts that NYISO has not shown the AMP is needed or addresse d the flaws in the AMP identified by the Commission It also states that t he AMP resulted in the improper mitigation of economically justifiable bids during the Summer Capability Period and is likely to harm consumers b y discouraging efficient supplyside and demandside decisions EPSA and W illiams make similar arguments EPSA further asserts that mitigation measu res should not be a part of the discussions to form a Northeastern RTO Th e Independent Producers maintain that the AMP is flawed because it improper ly mitigates bids that do not cross the impact threshold required for mitig ation and because it mitigates a generators bids for quantities that are not large enough to represent an exercise of market power They further st ate that some units were improperly mitigated as a result of flawed calcula tions of reference level curves that the AMP has not been tied to structur al market power problems and that the AMP improperly inhibits ICAP generat ors from managing their risk by choosing whether to sell in the dayahead o r in the realtime market Enron supports the protests of EPSA and the Ind ependent Producers Aquila makes many of the arguments described above and also asserts that NY ISOs AMP extension request ignores the improvements in market conditions t hat have occurred over the summer of Aquila maintains that at a mini mum the Commission should deny NYISOs request to continue the AMP withou t prejudice to a subsequent filing by NYISO that address the flaws with the current version of the AMP Keyspan suggests as an alternative that the A MP should only be extended until April and only if the MW exem ption is extended the consultation process is revised a structural power screen is added and a firm timetable for completion of the items discussed in NYISOs filing is provided In addition to arguments made by other protesters Dynegy asserts that the AMP has not worked as designed and that on August of its daya head market bids for August for its Roseton Units and had been mitig ated Dynegy maintains that these should not have been mitigated since the y did not cross the conduct threshold in NYISOs MMP and that Dynegy sti ll has not received a direct explanation from NYISO as to why its bids were mitigated although recent NYISO reports and statements indicate that a mi stake was made with respect to Dynegys bids Dynegy states that an explan ation of the performance of the AMP was provided in a memorandum now avail able on NYISOs website made available to those that attended a joint meet ing of the Scheduling Pricing Working Group and the Market Structures Wor king Group held on October According to Dynegy at that meeting NYISO claimed that the AMP worked as designed since the coding for the comp uter programs worked as intended although certain upstream data inputs cau sed Dynegys bids to be improperly mitigated Further Dynegy asserts that NYISO has dropped the million day price spike June as just ification for the AMP and now concedes that the price spike was due to seam s problems Answers In its answer the New York Commission reaffirms its support for the propos ed extension of the AMP until October The New York Commission st ates that the AMP is necessary to ensure that wholesale prices are just and reasonable in light of the tight supply situation and transmission constra ints that continue to exist in New York In response to the arguments presented by the generators opposing the exten sion of the AMP the New York Commission submits that the AMP adequately d istinguishes between high prices associated with market power and high pric es associated with scarcity the AMP properly evaluates the combined impac t of generators and the AMP is needed through the year not just during th e summer capability period during high load periods given transmission con straints and scheduled and unscheduled outages during shoulder months Fin ally in response to generators concerns that the AMP may mitigate in cert ain situations where mitigation should not have taken place the New York C ommission says that it is just as important to protect against the occurren ce of market power that goes unmitigated should the AMP not be extended A bsent the AMP the New York Commission states the harm of permitting unmiti gated market power would be far greater than any harm caused by improper mi tigation The New York Commission compares the million withheld from g enerators as a result of the AMP being in effect during Summer with th e million resulting from a single day of unmitigated market power in V Discussion NYISO has proposed to extend the same AMP the Commission approved in the Ju ne Order without modification NYISO states that it is committed to ma king further refinements to narrow the impact of the mitigation performed u nder the AMP and states it is committed to making what it refers to as two major improvements prior to Summer limiting the mitigation to specif ic zones and hours that fail the impact test and exempting bids of less tha n MW unless there is a demonstrated market power concern Our review of the AMP indicates that it appropriately attempts to distingui sh between market power and scarcity The AMP closes the one day lag inhe rent in the manual application of mitigation measures in the current MMM an d thus advances the ability of NYISO to mitigate market power Implementat ion of the AMP is not without concerns however The AMP as noted by NYIS O and other market participants requires some refinements and additional r eview eg determination of Reference Prices unnecessary mitigation app lication to energy limited resources Also AMP may be one of the many barriers to entry for new generating facil ities We direct NYISO to work with market participants especially the Ne w York Commission to examine barriers to entry for new generation As par t of this process the NYISO may consider exempting new generators from AMP in its March filing We note that generators in PJM have an exemption fro m mustrun mitigation If NYISO chooses to exempt new units NYISO should address whether the exemption would encourage more rapid entry of new gener ators and the effect of such exemption would have on NYISOs comprehensive mitigation proposal NYISO proposes to exempt hydro units from the AMP NYISO believes that hyd ro units should not be subject to such mitigation because their volatile bi ds often reflect their opportunity costs not market power The Commission believes this logic applies to all energy limited resources including tho se constrained by environmental rules Therefore we direct NYISO to work with market participants to determine whether there are other energy limite d resources and to develop an appropriate accommodation within the AMP proc edures This coordination should develop both standing protocols as well a s an accounting for possible daytoday considerations affecting bids Accordingly we will extend the AMP until April subject to the fo llowing conditions We note that NYISO has already indicated that it is co mmitted to working with market participants to determine if other refinemen ts or changes in the AMP design should be considered We direct NYISO meet with market participants and to file a comprehensive mitigation proposal w hich addresses the Commissions concerns expressed in this order concerning the AMP as well as explain how AMP will work in conjunction with other mi tigation measures already in effect or proposed for NYISO In this regard we note that NYISO has several mitigation measures in place or proposed including its existing MMM and its proposed AMP as well as InCity mitigation We are concerned that these measures may not fully fi t together in a way that adequately addresses market power problems while a voiding unnecessary mitigation On the one hand these measure may not mit igate all significant exercises of market power For example the existing MMM allows suppliers to exercise market power for one day before mitigatio n goes into effect On the other hand other measures may create the poten tial for unnecessary mitigation We also direct NYISO to consider mustrun mitigation measures consistent wi th ISONE and PJM The InCity mitigation measures address market power p roblems created by transmission constraints into New York City but not tho se created by transmission constraints within New York City or elsewhere PJM and ISONE both have mitigation measures which provide for automatic mi tigation in defined mustrun situations Accordingly we direct NYISO to file a comprehensive mitigation proposal by March to be effective May When developing a comprehensiv e mitigation plan NYISO should bear in mind that the Commission expects on e mitigation plan for the Northeast as part of the RTO process Therefore we strongly urge NYISO to collaborate with PJM and ISONE in formulating it s comprehensive mitigation plan The Commission orders A NYISOs request to extend the AMP is granted until April sub ject to the conditions set forth in

SEQRA Generators In NYPA Turbine Ruling Member Alert November Court of Appeals issues Potential Setback to SEQRA Generators In NYPA Turbi ne Ruling On November the New York State Court of Appeals denied a motion b y the New York Power Authority NYPA for leave to appeal a Appellate Div ision decision Uprose v Power Authority of State of New York requiring t he preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement EIS for its install ation of GE LM turbines at several sites in New York City IPPNYs brief supporting NYPAs motion was accepted by the Court The impact of the ruling may be to delay the environmental review for projects evaluated under the State Environmental Quality Review Act SEQRA The Court of Appeals the States highest court did not affirm the Appella te Divisions decision it merely declined to consider the appeal which wa s discretionary The decision is binding only in the courts of the nd jud icial department which includes Long Island and Westchester although cour ts in other areas of the state may rely on the case for guidance Prior to the lawsuit NYPA issued a negative declaration of potential signi ficant impact with regard to the turbine projects a SEQRA prerequisite to proceeding without preparing an EIS The Appellate Division decision requi red that NYPA prepare an EIS by January because NYPAs analysis of particulate matter PM which relied on an evaluation of PM as a proxy was insufficiently detailed to support a negative declaration The potential impact for new generation projects is that applicants proposi ng power plants under MW which are subject to SEQRA may be required to prepare an EIS A State agency may still be able to issue a negative decl aration and thus avoid the requirement to prepare an EIS if an applicant demonstrates in its Environmental Assessment Form EAF that there is no potential for adverse environmental impacts from PM However as a resu lt of the Uprose decision the applicant may not be able to make this demon stration by relying on a PM proxy analysis If the demonstration cannot be made that PM will not have a potential adverse environmental impact the agency must make a positive declaration requiring the preparation of a n EIS and associated public notice and participation Potentially signific ant delay could result from this process The Appellate Division decision should have little impact on Article X appl ications The Article X process supplants the SEQRA process Essentially the Article X process requires the preparation of an EIS equivalent where in PM is analyzed At least one case Consolidated Edisons East River Repowering Project has addressed the PM issue In that case the Depar tment of Environmental Conservation DEC Department of Health and the Department of Public Service agreed that the only applicable legal standard for PM is the PM proxy standard The Board on Electric Generation Si ting and the Environment ruled that PM was not an issue in the case beca use it is within the purview of the companion DEC air permit proceeding A ruling distinguishing the Uprose case was made by the Commissioner of DEC Although the court found that the proxy analysis conducted by NYPA was no t sufficiently detailed in the EAF to support a negative declaration under SEQRA in the Uprose case the DEC Commissioner found in the East River case that the PM analysis will support the determination as to whether or not the proposed project complies with the PM standard In an unrelated development the FERC last week issued two orders addressin g issues related to market mitigation In its Order Establishing Refund Ef fective Date And Proposing To Revise MarketBased Rate Tariffs And Authoriz ations Market Rates Order FERC instituted a proceeding to investigate the justness and reasonableness of the terms and conditions of marketbased rate tariffs and authorizations of wholesale generators FERC noted that it intends to revise all existing marketbased rate tariffs and authorizati ons by adding the following language which will be included in all new aut horizations as well As a condition of obtaining and retaining marketbased rate authority the seller is prohibited from engaging in anticompetitive behavior or the exer cise of market power The sellers marketbased rate authority is subject t o refunds or other remedies as may be appropriate to address any anticompet itive behavior or exercise of market power FERC indicated that the refund effective date will be days from notice o f the Market Rates Order in the Federal Register In a second order FERC announced that it will implement an industrywide s tandard market mitigation measure that will address conditions of market sh ortage in which market power could be abused The surplus margin assessmen t SMA tool will be employed by FERC to determine what entities possess market power The SMA will replace the FERCs existing HubandSpoke met hodology for determining whether an entity possesses market power Entiti es that fail the screen are required to sell uncommitted capacity into the spot market pursuant to a form of costofservice rates The SMA order exp ressly does not apply in New York

issued the attached order approving an extension of the NYISOs Automated Mitigation Procedures also known as the AMP or Circuit Breaker through April rather than until October as had been s ought by the ISO Enron had submitted comments opposing the ISOs request FERC also directs the ISO to file a comprehensive mitigation proposal that addresses FERCs concerns with the AMP as well as FERCs concerns regarding how the ISOs overall mitigation measures work together This proposal is due by March to be effective May FERC acknowledges two problems with the AMP that the NYISO has already comm itted to fix limiting the mitigation to specific zones and hours that fail the impact test and exempting bids of less than MW unless thee is a de monstrated market power concern In addition FERC directs the ISO to work with market participants to examine whether the AMP may serve as a bar rier to entry for new generation and whether such new generation should be exempted from the AMP examine whether other energy limited resources including those constrained by environmental rules should be exempted fro m or accommodated in the AMP Currently only hydro units are exempted beca use their volatile bids often reflect their opportunity costs not market p ower FERC believes this logic applies to all energy limited resources as w ell file a comprehensive mitigation proposal which also

Breathitt And Nora Mead Brownell New York Independent System Operator Inc Docket No ER ORDER APPROVING EXTENSION OF AUTOMATIC MITIGATION PROCEDURES SUBJECT TO CON DITIONS Issued November On September the New York Independent System Operator Inc NYIS O filed pursuant to section of the Federal Power Act FPA a req uest to extend the termination date for the Automated Mitigation Procedures AMP to October The Commissions June order in this proceed ing approving the AMP required those automated procedures to expire on Octo ber In this order we accept NYISOs proposed extension of the A MP until April and we direct NYISO to file a comprehensive mitiga tion proposal that addresses the Commissions concerns with the AMP set for th in this order as well as our concerns regarding how NYISOs overall mit igation measures work together NYISO is directed to file the comprehensiv e mitigation proposal by March to be effective May The Co mmissions action here benefits customers by protecting them from market po wer while establishing procedures to modify and improve the AMP mechanism as well as other mitigation measures in NYISO I Procedural Background In a November order the Commission accepted in part and rejec ted in part the market monitoring and mitigation plans filed by NYISO In instances where NYISO concludes that a specific market participant is exerc ising market power the Commission accepted NYISOs proposal to allow it to engage in discussions to resolve the issues informally or issue demand let ters requesting the participant cease certain behavior In addition the C ommission stated that NYISO could file on a casebycase basis under sectio n of the FPA to impose specific mitigation measures or to make such fi lings based on recurring types of conduct that warrant mitigation However the Commission did not allow NYISO to reduce bid flexibility impose fina ncial obligations to pay for operating reserves or impose default bids be cause this would give too much discretion to NYISO in pricesetting and oth er similar regulatory functions without Commission review The Commission determined that NYISO had not described with sufficient specificity the typ es of conduct that would trigger the imposition of these measures it had n ot established specific thresholds or bright line tests that would trigger the conclusion that market power had been exercised In a March order the Commission further clarified NYISOs aut hority under the plans Among other things the Commission accepted the sp ecific thresholds proposed by NYISO to trigger possible mitigation but rej ected NYISOs proposal to keep them confidential The Commission also allo wed NYISO limited discretion as to when to mitigate eg NYISO may choose not to impose mitigation if it is satisfied with the partys explanation f or its behavior and for how long but required NYISO to clarify that mitig ation for market power may be imposed only prospectively In a complaint filed in Docket No EL the Mirant Companies Miran t alleged that NYISO improperly intended to implement the AMP without fili ng any changes to the MMM pursuant to either section or of the FPA In its May order on Mirants complaint the Commission found that part of NYISOs proposal is within the bounds of its existing tariff in that section b of the Market Mitigation Measures MMM specifically envisions use of the Security Constrained Unit Commitment SCUC to id entify questionable conduct However the Commission also found that NYISO s AMP proposal needed to be examined in greater detail before it could be approved Further the Commission noted that section c of the FPA req uires that NYISO keep on file with the Commission practices and regulation s affecting its rates and that NYISOs tariff did not contain language ad equately specifying the timing and the process that are contained in the AM P Accordingly the Commission concluded that if NYISO wishes to implemen t its AMP proposal it must file revised tariff sheets pursuant to section of the FPA to set forth the AMP procedures In that filing the Commis sion added NYISO must address the concerns raised by the parties in the Mi rant complaint proceeding including whether the AMP provides sufficie nt opportunity for meaningful consultation whether inaccurate marketc learing prices will result even if the party whose bid was improperly mitig ated is ultimately made whole whether the AMP would establish a new threshold that never appears in the MMM and whether NYISO proposes to exclude hydro units imports and exports from the AMP On March in Docket No ER NYISO filed a new Attachmen t H to its Services Tariff which incorporated the proposed AMP procedures March Filing By order issued June the Commission accept ed NYISOs March Filing allowed NYISO to implement the AMP mechanism for summer capability period when supplies may still be tight and when th e effectiveness of new demand response mechanisms are uncertain The Commi ssion viewed the proposed mechanism as only a temporary solution and agree d with certain of the intervenors that the proposed AMP may mitigate bids i n situations where market power is not the cause for high or volatile bids and may not provide for sufficient consultation with generators to reasona bly establish that particular bids were attempts to exercise market power The Commission further explained that automatic market power mitigation ma y be most appropriate where it is tied to structural market power problems such as mustrun situations where generators would otherwise be in a posit ion to name their price and noted that both PJM and ISONE use this more l imited approach to automatic mitigation II NYISOs Market Mitigation Procedures Including AMP Under Commission orders allowing NYISO to implement its MMM NYISOs Market Monitoring Unit MMU in consultation with NYISOs Market Advisor is responsible for monitoring the markets administered or controll ed by NYISO and for mitigating a market partys conduct when NYISO determin es that market power has been exercised The MMM has specific threshold va lues for identifying generators or transmission facilities that exercise ma rket power NYISO imposes mitigation when a market partys conduct has a m aterial effect on prices or on guarantee payments Conduct and impact crit eria must be satisfied before NYISO may mitigate a generators bid NYISO may not mitigate market prices retroactively Under its manual procedures prior to implementation of the AMP NYISO is a ble to identify conduct and pricing impacts that exceed the MMM standards o nly after the SCUC runs for a given dayahead market have been completed w hich means that mitigation cannot be implemented until the next days daya head market The primary purpose of the AMP is to eliminate the oneday la g inherent in the manual application of the market mitigation thresholds th at currently exist in NYISOs market mitigation That delay can be importa nt when market conditions arise that permit an exercise of market power T he AMP procedures are activated when the SCUC that calculates dayahead mar ket prices makes a preliminary determination that prices in a given area of New York will exceed absent mitigation Once the AMP is activat ed it only mitigates bids if specific thresholds for both bidding conduct and market impact are crossed The conduct and impact thresholds used by t he AMP are the same thresholds approved by the Commission under NYISOs Mar ket Mitigation Measures Under the automated procedures of the AMP nonco mpetitive bidding behavior is still mitigated prospectively as authorized in the MMM but the mitigation will occur within the SCUC runs in which the conduct and price effect thresholds of the MMM are crossed without the on eday delay that occurs under the manual procedures III This Filing On September NYISO filed to extend the AMP which would otherwise expire on October until October NYISO requests waiver of the day prior notice requirement to permit a November effective date NYISO states that good cause exists for the waiver in orde r to prevent a gap in the availability of the AMP NYISO believes the performance of the AMP was consistent with its design w hich is to eliminate the delay of one DayAhead Market cycle inherent in ma nual application of the market mitigation thresholds NYISO explains that during Summer prices hit the level times but the AMP imposed bid caps only four times Of those four times the largest average number of megawatts mitigated was while customers were protected from more t hat million in unwarranted energy costs NYISO further states that onl y twice did AMP mitigation apply to more than one entity in one zone NYIS O concludes that while the AMP is an automated procedure it does not autom atically apply bid caps whenever prices are high Absent mitigation NYISO states that significant unwarranted wealth transfe rs from buyers to sellers could take place especially during highload summ er months when supply may be tight NYISO asserts however that transmissi on constraints can create tight market conditions in small areas even durin g shoulder months NYISO states that the conditions necessitating the need for the AMP are alm ost certain to be present this coming summer as they were this past summer and with the potential for market power problems to arise in shoulder peri ods as well it is preferable to keep the AMP in place while improvements a re implemented and additional analysis under taken rather than to summaril y terminate the AMP NYISO states that the AMP while working as intended is subject to improve ments Specifically NYISO states that it intends to make two improvements in the AMP prior to Summer The proposed modifications will have the effect of narrowing the scope of the AMP to mitigate prices only when mark et power exists First NYISO proposes to exclude from mitigation by the AMP a Market Participants bids that trigger the conduct test for mitigatio n if the total quantity of those bids is MW or less unless analysis sho ws the relevant units are in a position to exercise market power at those q uantity levels At present the AMP excludes bids by bidding entities with MW or less of capacity NYISO stated the reason for exempting such bid s was because the withholding of such small amounts will rarely have a mate rial effect on prices Second NYISO proposes to limit mitigation to zones in which the price impa ct test for mitigation is met by implementing at least one additional AMP p ass in SCUC This proposed change would finetune the application of the A MP to limit mitigation to the specified zones and hours where the price imp act test is met At present under the AMP all bids subject to the AMP t hat exceed the conduct thresholds in the areas where zonal prices exceed are tested for their impact on prices in a single SCUC pass If the pr ice impact threshold is exceeded in any hour or any zone the results of th e mitigated pass are used to determine the DayAhead prices The proposed modification will appropriately exclude mitigation from occurring in those areas or hours where the price impact test is not met NYISO states that it will be working on correcting other minor flaws i n the AMP and that it is committed to working with Market Participants to d etermine if other refinements or changes in the AMP design should be consid ered IV Notice of Filing and Pleadings Notice of NYISOs filing was published in the Federal Register Fed Reg with comments protests and

comments Although Rule a of the Commission s Rules of Practice and Procedure CFR a genera lly prohibit answers to protests we will accept the New York Commissions answer because it helps clarify issues under consideration in this proceedi ng Intervenor Protests and Comments Five parties as identified above support NYISOs proposal New York City believes that the extension of the AMP is a necessary but not sufficient measure for mitigating excessive prices It maintains that the AMP does n ot adequately protect New York City consumers from excessive wholesale pric es because it sets too high a trigger for implementing the mitigation noti ng that the AMP was not triggered on August when dayahead energy prices reached a record MWH in New York City Similarly ConEd belie ves that the AMP remains necessary to prevent or identify and mitigate the exercise of market power in New Yorks dayahead market It asserts that e xtending the AMP will permit NYISO to assess further the coordinated operat ion of the various mitigation measures that it administers The New York Commission asserts that the AMP is needed throughout the year focuses only on high prices caused by market power and has not unreasona bly disadvantaged generators It also believes that the AMP complements bu t does not duplicate the incity mitigation measures remains necessary des pite pricecapped load bidding and virtual bidding and conforms to the Com missions preference for ex ante mitigation The Consumer Board maintains that the fundamental rationale for the AMP has not changed the AMP is work ing as intended and has not unduly interfered with the performance of compe titive markets NYISO has committed to make improvements in the AMP before next summer The Multiple Intervenors also agree that the AMP is necessary to prevent the exercise of market power and believe that the Commission sh ould encourage NYISO to continue to improve the AMP Eight parties as identified above filed protests concerning NYISOs propo sal Mirant asserts that NYISO has not shown the AMP is needed or addresse d the flaws in the AMP identified by the Commission It also states that t he AMP resulted in the improper mitigation of economically justifiable bids during the Summer Capability Period and is likely to harm consumers b y discouraging efficient supplyside and demandside decisions EPSA and W illiams make similar arguments EPSA further asserts that mitigation measu res should not be a part of the discussions to form a Northeastern RTO Th e Independent Producers maintain that the AMP is flawed because it improper ly mitigates bids that do not cross the impact threshold required for mitig ation and because it mitigates a generators bids for quantities that are not large enough to represent an exercise of market power They further st ate that some units were improperly mitigated as a result of flawed calcula tions of reference level curves that the AMP has not been tied to structur al market power problems and that the AMP improperly inhibits ICAP generat ors from managing their risk by choosing whether to sell in the dayahead o r in the realtime market Enron supports the protests of EPSA and the Ind ependent Producers Aquila makes many of the arguments described above and also asserts that NY ISOs AMP extension request ignores the improvements in market conditions t hat have occurred over the summer of Aquila maintains that at a mini mum the Commission should deny NYISOs request to continue the AMP withou t prejudice to a subsequent filing by NYISO that address the flaws with the current version of the AMP Keyspan suggests as an alternative that the A MP should only be extended until April and only if the MW exem ption is extended the consultation process is revised a structural power screen is added and a firm timetable for completion of the items discussed in NYISOs filing is provided In addition to arguments made by other protesters Dynegy asserts that the AMP has not worked as designed and that on August of its daya head market bids for August for its Roseton Units and had been mitig ated Dynegy maintains that these should not have been mitigated since the y did not cross the conduct threshold in NYISOs MMP and that Dynegy sti ll has not received a direct explanation from NYISO as to why its bids were mitigated although recent NYISO reports and statements indicate that a mi stake was made with respect to Dynegys bids Dynegy states that an explan ation of the performance of the AMP was provided in a memorandum now avail able on NYISOs website made available to those that attended a joint meet ing of the Scheduling Pricing Working Group and the Market Structures Wor king Group held on October According to Dynegy at that meeting NYISO claimed that the AMP worked as designed since the coding for the comp uter programs worked as intended although certain upstream data inputs cau sed Dynegys bids to be improperly mitigated Further Dynegy asserts that NYISO has dropped the million day price spike June as just ification for the AMP and now concedes that the price spike was due to seam s problems Answers In its answer the New York Commission reaffirms its support for the propos ed extension of the AMP until October The New York Commission st ates that the AMP is necessary to ensure that wholesale prices are just and reasonable in light of the tight supply situation and transmission constra ints that continue to exist in New York In response to the arguments presented by the generators opposing the exten sion of the AMP the New York Commission submits that the AMP adequately d istinguishes between high prices associated with market power and high pric es associated with scarcity the AMP properly evaluates the combined impac t of generators and the AMP is needed through the year not just during th e summer capability period during high load periods given transmission con straints and scheduled and unscheduled outages during shoulder months Fin ally in response to generators concerns that the AMP may mitigate in cert ain situations where mitigation should not have taken place the New York C ommission says that it is just as important to protect against the occurren ce of market power that goes unmitigated should the AMP not be extended A bsent the AMP the New York Commission states the harm of permitting unmiti gated market power would be far greater than any harm caused by improper mi tigation The New York Commission compares the million withheld from g enerators as a result of the AMP being in effect during Summer with th e million resulting from a single day of unmitigated market power in V Discussion NYISO has proposed to extend the same AMP the Commission approved in the Ju ne Order without modification NYISO states that it is committed to ma king further refinements to narrow the impact of the mitigation performed u nder the AMP and states it is committed to making what it refers to as two major improvements prior to Summer limiting the mitigation to specif ic zones and hours that fail the impact test and exempting bids of less tha n MW unless there is a demonstrated market power concern Our review of the AMP indicates that it appropriately attempts to distingui sh between market power and scarcity The AMP closes the one day lag inhe rent in the manual application of mitigation measures in the current MMM an d thus advances the ability of NYISO to mitigate market power Implementat ion of the AMP is not without concerns however The AMP as noted by NYIS O and other market participants requires some refinements and additional r eview eg determination of Reference Prices unnecessary mitigation app lication to energy limited resources Also AMP may be one of the many barriers to entry for new generating facil ities We direct NYISO to work with market participants especially the Ne w York Commission to examine barriers to entry for new generation As par t of this process the NYISO may consider exempting new generators from AMP in its March filing We note that generators in PJM have an exemption fro m mustrun mitigation If NYISO chooses to exempt new units NYISO should address whether the exemption would encourage more rapid entry of new gener ators and the effect of such exemption would have on NYISOs comprehensive mitigation proposal NYISO proposes to exempt hydro units from the AMP NYISO believes that hyd ro units should not be subject to such mitigation because their volatile bi ds often reflect their opportunity costs not market power The Commission believes this logic applies to all energy limited resources including tho se constrained by environmental rules Therefore we direct NYISO to work with market participants to determine whether there are other energy limite d resources and to develop an appropriate accommodation within the AMP proc edures This coordination should develop both standing protocols as well a s an accounting for possible daytoday considerations affecting bids Accordingly we will extend the AMP until April subject to the fo llowing conditions We note that NYISO has already indicated that it is co mmitted to working with market participants to determine if other refinemen ts or changes in the AMP design should be considered We direct NYISO meet with market participants and to file a comprehensive mitigation proposal w hich addresses the Commissions concerns expressed in this order concerning the AMP as well as explain how AMP will work in conjunction with other mi tigation measures already in effect or proposed for NYISO In this regard we note that NYISO has several mitigation measures in place or proposed including its existing MMM and its proposed AMP as well as InCity mitigation We are concerned that these measures may not fully fi t together in a way that adequately addresses market power problems while a voiding unnecessary mitigation On the one hand these measure may not mit igate all significant exercises of market power For example the existing MMM allows suppliers to exercise market power for one day before mitigatio n goes into effect On the other hand other measures may create the poten tial for unnecessary mitigation We also direct NYISO to consider mustrun mitigation measures consistent wi th ISONE and PJM The InCity mitigation measures address market power p roblems created by transmission constraints into New York City but not tho se created by transmission constraints within New York City or elsewhere PJM and ISONE both have mitigation measures which provide for automatic mi tigation in defined mustrun situations Accordingly we direct NYISO to file a comprehensive mitigation proposal by March to be effective May When developing a comprehensiv e mitigation plan NYISO should bear in mind that the Commission expects on e mitigation plan for the Northeast as part of the RTO process Therefore we strongly urge NYISO to collaborate with PJM and ISONE in formulating it s comprehensive mitigation plan The Commission orders A NYISOs request to extend the AMP is granted until April sub ject to the conditions set forth in the body of this order B Waiver is granted to permit the proposal to take effect November C NYISO is directed to file a comprehensive proposal for mitigation as d iscussed herein on or before March to
