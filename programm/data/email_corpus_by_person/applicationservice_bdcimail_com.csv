PROVIDERS Todays focus Full circle ASPs the new Big Blue Dear Wincenty Kaminski Todays focus Full circle ASPs the new Big Blue By Mike Jude and Nancy Meachim The terms ASP and IBM may have more in common than being th ree letter acronyms Remember Big Blue of the early s The vision then was centralized computing Mainframe computers hosted complex expensive applications that end users accessed via dumb terminals IT infrastructure especially memory was expensive and needed to be controlled With computing resources centralized IBM reasoned they were easier to maintain Of course IBM got it wrong in that computers became a cheap commodity And users werent happy simply using dumb terminals They wanted a bigger share in all that technology offered So as memory prices fell so did the idea of central control Dumb terminals were transformed into intelligent desktop machines that could store applications and data The glass house populated by whitesmocked technicians went out of fashion Looking back on those times many of us would shake our heads and wonder how IBM could have been so wrong But maybe Big Blue wasnt so far off Thanks to the advent of application service providers centralized computing is making a comeback ASPs offer centralized application management The market started as a way to offer the benefits of Server Advertisement Protocol and other complex enterprise resource planning software to small companies or companies with less technical savvy But ASPs now host all kinds of applications including small multilicensed programs whose images are downloaded to end users on demand But the principle remains the same Central control makes support much more efficient and usually cheaper How about that IBM To be fair the dynamics of an ASP are very different from old centralized mainframe operations An ASP doesnt just host and support an application for general distribution over an inhouse proprietary network Unlike the IBM vision an ASP is very dependent on network service It is also very sensitive to service levels In the s if the mainframe let you down you ended up twiddling your thumbs for an hour or so and your only recourse was that whitesmocked fellow Nowadays users start to scream if service is interrupted for even a minute And woe to the ASP who brings down a customer operation The world of the ASP is much more complex than that of the old s shop However if one could magically transport a computer user from the s to the wonderful new s would it seem all that different to him In an ideal ASP world a la Scott McNealys vision users would sit down at a semidumb terminal download the application du jour and start working What did the s user do Kind of the same thing So you are probably wondering what is the point Just this IBMs problem was leaving the customer out of the equation And look what happened Customers rebelled They didnt buy IBMs spiel It became the in thing to hate IBM Why Because the guys in white smocks couldnt spell service and didnt care about customers To be successful ASPs need to learn from the past They need to tattoo service on the forehead of each of their employees There are too many choices today for customers to put up with inferior service Thats one big difference from the s Customers now can literally choose any service provider in the world Just being big doesnt cut it these days To contact

many options on the market it can be difficult for customers and ASPs to pick the right kinds of security for storage and transmission of sensitive corporate information Perhaps the ideal security product for ASPs is one that gives customers the most comfort is reasonably costeffective and can be managed by a staff that may not be expert in security The toughest part for ASPs is that their customers hold them to a security double standard These customers often expect better security for their remotely hosted systems and data than they provide for their local systems I find this ironic considering most security infractions occur from inside an organization not outside Conventional wisdom places the percentage of breaches at internal and external though I havent independently verified these statistics Based on that information I would think customers considering an ASP model for applications and data would be stumbling over one another to locate their systems at an ASP thus reducing their exposure to system compromises Instead prospective customers typically hit the ASP with security questions that may not be outside the expertise of the ASP in question and may be only marginally understood by the customers themselves ASP business development staff have to become versed in the technology workings of VPNs for data transfer and publickey infrastructure for authentication and encryption for example just so they can get in the door with a potential customer Unfortunately comprehensive security procedures and technologies are typically very expensive to implement and require a level of security expertise that most ASPs cannot hope to implement and maintain And Im not so sure these technology answers are really solving the problem of security for ASPs and their customers Again of security breaches come from the inside In a lot of cases that means that the true threat is from people who are already inside the security demilitarized zones It seems to me that security technology is really only part of the answer to the overall security question In my opinion ASPs and large enterprises should look beyond the latest security technology and hire security experts from the Department of Defense NSA or the CIA who can help implement security policies and procedures that will be effective in eliminating the internal breaches There are several documented systems publicly available from the government that outline the policies and procedures necessary to meet certain levels of security For example there is a series of trusted systems books available from INFOSEC each named after a color the Teal Book the Orange Book and the Bright Blue Book all of which are great resources for a variety of security topics No doubt there are some commercial enterprises that also adhere to recognized security standards and can provide the procedures and technology necessary to ensure the integrity of critical business information inside and outside corporate networks Partnerships between ASPs and these emerging companies would make a lot of sense I dont mean to exclude technology solutions from this discussion I believe that there are significant strides being made to make security technology more usable and affordable But I fear that ASPs are setting up servicelevel agreements with their customers that guarantee certain levels of security and intrusion detection but are really only covering the most visible problem To contact Jeb Bolding Jeb Bolding is senior consultant with Enterprise Management Associates in Boulder Colo an

Trade show malaise hits ASPs goASPhtml Jon Price vice president of service provider events at Penton Technology Media offered some interesting elaborations on the mediocre success of xSPoriented trade shows Previously I mentioned that service providers should go to trade shows that are verticallyoriented in order to capitalize on their specific industry expertise However I didnt put much of a framework behind that assertion Price commented that there are a couple of reasons for treating service provider software like you would any other outsourcing option First most service providers have not been in business very long Trade shows typically follow cohesive market messages and service providers have not yet had time to pull their messages together Consider Java I went to the first JavaONE show and it was fairly lame because only a few companies saw the power of using Java for enterprise applications let alone had developed applications using Java The first JavaONE was primarily a Javasoft and Sun evangelizing event To its credit JavaONE was the only Java show so there wasnt any cannibalization But service providers havent been so lucky The poor economy and the fragmentation of the service provider industry almost assured most xSP trade show failures But Price argues that there is even a deeper issue that has been ignored in the trade show arena which goes to the heart of hosted service selection versus traditional clientserver software selection and that is fear in the IT department Price says Why doesnt IT consider application service providers ASP as an alternative to software ASP service is a strategic outsourcing move that potentially eliminates the need for building a more expansive IT staff its supporting infrastructure and the management requirements of both This is a very tough career decision for any IT manager because any success demonstrated by the ASP can also be viewed as the failure of a managers development and delivery team If thats not bad enough corporate management may like what they see so much in short term savings and quick deployment that they begin to outsource everything along with the poor IT manager making the recommendation in the first place Neither Jon nor I are arguing that IT will actually face its Waterloo by adopting an ASP solution However that does not change the concern within IT Any time someone outsources development and I mean the development of anything be it a business or marketing plan or software development the person using outsourcing as a crutch is taking a risk The people doing the outsourced work might do it better than the salaried employees To make matters worse Price notes that As an added support mechanism or peripheral project its possible that some IT managers would strongly consider using an ASP to allow more time to focus on core initiatives But most ASPs application infrastructure providers and managed service providers are gunning right for the core services that are provided by in house IT ASPs might find their sales easier if they focus on peripheral applications that are not at the core of IT competency I would argue that many vertical ASPs are doing just that They provide solutions that most IT staff doesnt want to undertake and so are not threatening Fortunately this attitude is probably temporary Applications and services are becoming blurred as the distributed thin client nature of the Web permeates all software Price comments that Before long Web sites Web software Web applications Web services and the remaining Internetenabled traditional software applications will soon be viewed as one in the same just plain old applications that provide utility and service driving business forward But for now there is the issue of culture that must be handled delicately You can reach Jon Price at mailto To contact Jeb Bolding Jeb Bolding is senior consultant with Enterprise Management Associates in Boulder Colo an analyst and market research

Touched by an angel Dear Wincenty Kaminski In this issue BMC enters MSP market with GuardianAngel Links related to ASPs Featured reader resource TAKE IT OFFLINE The hightech industry has always run at breakneck pace Even a wheezing economy will hardly slow it In the past year business theory surrounding technology has been reinvented and redefined multiple times Check out the latest mustread books for technologyrelated business theories goadhtml Todays focus Touched by an angel By Jeb Bolding BMC released its GuardianAngel managed service provider offering at Comdex last week While many managed service providers MSP struggle I think GuardianAngel just might succeed One of my pet peeves about the ASP industry is the lack of software solutions that offer network systems and application management solutions to reveal ASP service levels for customers Most ASPs monitor their systems in some fashion However they rarely publicize that data out to their customers If they do commonly that information comes from a homegrown set of tools that report primarily on basic availability information about the hosted applications or systems This really isnt service level management though it may purport to be In fact the availability and performance numbers that are pushed out to customers through homegrown systems are probably not all that indicative of true service levels since the solutions are designed by developers who are application experts at their ASP not systems management experts So why cant ASPs go out and buy a good management solution that gives their customers a reasonable understanding of ASP system performance I think there are three things that have inhibited ASPs from making that investment First and foremost is cost Most independent software vendors create their management solutions from a sales perspective to be sold into the enterprise space where the purchasers pay a steep upfront licensing cost and then a relatively minimal support fee per year Since the vast majority of service providers have business models that focus on regular monthly or quarterly payments theyve had a hard time rationalizing their cash flow to purchase a best of breed management product I suppose that this is the kind of purchase one might argue that those high IPO valuations were supposed to cover months ago Nowadays spending million on a management product including licensing deployment and customization is out of the question Another problem is integration For most ASPs there simply is no management integration Whatever applications or systems an enterprise outsources to an ASP those are treated as islands of management technology separate from the applications that enterprises manage internally Even if an ASP has a monitoring and management product deployed those solutions are not designed architecturally to populate a central console with event and data information nor transmit information across a wire to a database inside the corporate firewall Finally traditional management solutions are designed to give an IT administrator a centralized view of whats going on with their enterprise systems Theyre not designed to display customercentric data to multiple customers who are protected from viewing the event and systems data of other customers To address many of these problems MSPs have approached the ASP market need with solutions that are priced based on a subscription service designed specifically for integrating event and data information across a distributed network and developed with an interactive Web interface for customer and administrator views However MSPs just like ASPs have had their own troubles and lately there has been consolidation within the MSP ranks I admit that Ive pondered why some of the systems management companies have not offered MSP solutions themselves It may be culture that prevents them from addressing the needs of extended enterprises and service providers But with BMC one of the big management players launching GuardianAngel that will hopefully address many of the infrastructure management needs that service providers have Most importantly this service offering is supported by BMC a company with deep pockets and the ability to stay the MSP course financially unlike many of its smaller more specialized MSP brethren With the larger BMC corporation behind it I think that GuardianAngel can make a strong go of the MSP space To contact Jeb Bolding Jeb Bolding is senior consultant with Enterprise Management Associates in Boulder Colo an analyst and market

new services and more Webinar from RiverSoftNetwork World goriverbhtml Todays focus Buying beyond your means By Jeb Bolding USinternetworking earlier this month announced that it has filed for Chapter bankruptcy protection It joins an unfortunate list of other ASPs who also have begun bankruptcy protection proceedings including FutureLink and Breakaway Solutions No doubt there are dozens of other ASPs with the same troubles but did not have wide media play and so have quietly disappeared into anonymity According to an article I read about USis financial issues Bain Capital Partners promised an investment if USi could erase million off its existing debt From what Ive seen about this recent turn of events it is assumed that two issues led to USis situation its huge investment in its multiple datacenters and the slow adoption rate of the ASP model It appears that by erasing the bulk of its debt USi will have the financial wherewithal to last through the economic downturn were now experiencing Existing investors jumped on this opportunity and USi customers should not experience any loss of service during the restructuring period All well and good But does Chapter and further investment really solve the problems that plagued USi and its unfortunate bankrupt brethren Im not sure that it does Has the behavior and value proposition for USi been reevaulated and altered to accommodate new market opportunities I mean you know Ive been really eyeing the new flat panel iMacs that are on the market for I would also really like a new Powerbook G which costs about And those Sony Picturebooks are really cool too To top it off though Id really like to have one of Suns SunBlade s with an Intel daughterboard inside and a flat panel display that would set me back about Finally Id have to network all these machines together so that I could get effective use of my Sprint Broadband connection yes I really do have that Hmmm I dont make enough money to afford all that Maybe I should just buy it all and then declare bankruptcy I understand that even with that bad mark I can still get credit cards So once Ive bought all this I could focus on my motorcycle needs Ive got a nice but old Honda VFRat heart though Im a BMW rider and Id really like to buy one of the new RGS that sell for about Of course Ill need some bags heated grips I live in Colorado after all a new helmet and updated body armor I suppose that by now you get the point I could probably continue this process of buying beyond my means for quite a bit never changing my behavior and always being sunk in debt Eventually USi is going to have to do more than wipe out its debt and get more equity If it doesnt change its business model its behavior and the way it manages its assets then this cycle will be repeated soon again The first things that Id look at are the cost of its datacenters and how reliance upon them can be minimized Id also consider what hosted applications have been profitable so far and get rid of the dead weight that has no traction I also would do some strategic research into the technology developments that are going to take place within the enterprise in the next months and see how I as a company could address those implementation needs with my existing infrastructure as well as investing in nonexistent infrastructure that could be leveraged to sell into those

news in the Wall Street Journal but about a month ago Relera a hosted service provider in the secondtier marketplaces said it was getting out of the managed services business and laid off about of its workforce No doubt the company is headed the same direction as Exodus I know Relera which now plans to offer customers space in its data centers is joining an esteemed group of failed Internet businesses in the class of but I felt this one particularly hard Part of the reason is that Relera is located here in Denver so the company is more part of my landscape than the firms in Silicon Valley where I left a few years back Releras collapse as a managed service provider is tough because Id spent some time visiting the company and got to know several of the people working there I toured its brand spanking sq ft data center located just south of Denver Id been to the data centers of Exodus and Level but the Relera facility was absolutely incredible It boasted two substations stateoftheart security mantraps the whole works but it was also empty No strike that it had one x cage filled with hardware Another reason and the most important one that makes Releras failure seem so heavy to me is that I actually bought into its business model Releras argument was that it was not going to go after dotcoms which were dropping like flies at the same time Relera was opening its data centers Nor was it going to target the toptier cities in the world like London Paris New York and San Jose where they are saturated by the likes of Exodus Level and Abovenet Instead it was going to focus on selling facilities space to enterprises that were interested in developing ebusiness systems or collocating their internal infrastructure Relera was targeting these enterprises in second tier cities such as Memphis St Louis Denver and Salt Lake City It all seemed like a pretty good idea In fact it still seems like a good business plan even with the excess capacity that the failure of some service providers such as Exodus and the disappearance of startups that were potential customers are causing Most of that excess is in the toptier cities while the second and third tier cities are still strapped for local data center space However one thing I didnt know though I should have guessed was how much money Relera had spent on opening up these state oftheart collocation facilities I suspect that the tens of millions of dollars Relera spent upfront and the subsequent operational costs killed it before it really had a chance to test its business model and target market This situation reminded me of something in my past When I used to move antique furniture wed inevitably break off a leg or damage a table edge because of dryrot in the furniture To this day I will not sit on antique French chairs give me a good ol th century boring English country furniture any day When we did break something our common mantra was good enough for government work I did work at the Voice of America so I dont feel too bad in saying something like that The point is and the lesson for Relera is that sometimes just good enough is good enough If itd taken a few shortcuts in its data center implementations and not tried to bowl prospective customers over with the complexity and obvious cost of its systems it might have lasted long enough to really test out a business model that I think had a reasonable chance to succeed To contact Jeb Bolding Jeb Bolding is senior consultant with Enterprise Management Associates in Boulder Colo an analyst and market research firm focusing

Network Worlds FREE Town Meeting State of the LANMAN Embracing Disruptive Technologies Register today at golanhtml Todays focus Service guaranteed By Jeb Bolding I spend a lot of my time at EMA focusing on servicelevel agreements and the servicelevel management tools that attempt to guarantee those contractual relationships Generally speaking everyone enterprises xSPs and ISVs are candidates for purchasing servicelevel management SLM products to ensure their servicelevel agreements with their customers However most toolsets on the market are in a nascent period of development as they get a handle on how their prospective customers want to see the reported SLM information and what kind of action they want to take based on the metrics theyve gathered One thing we at EMA stress is that business transaction should be the center of the service level agreement While SLM tools need to have a clear understanding of the integrity performance and availability of components that support that transaction ultimately the goal of SLM tools is to provide the data and the automated actions that will guarantee a consistent user experience As straightforward as this goal may sound the vendor landscape in support of this is quite scattered Most vendors have a product roadmap that leads toward a business transaction monitoring solution but many are still heavily focused on providing detailed metrics about components regardless of their impact on the business process Assuming that an xSP has deployed some good businessfocused SLM tools things will still go wrong transactions will be lost content will not be served up properly and users will leave because performance doesnt meet their expectations Since an xSPs business is dependent on its digital presence always being there xSPs need to implement solutions that engage the user while there are problems so that the users dont simply disappear into the Internet One potential solution that Ive come across is a product called RainAssure created by Rainfinity RainAssure software sits between a companys Web servers and the switch or load balancer RainAssure correlates transactions to faulty infrastructure components and as it watches the transactions coming into the site that are answered by errors or incorrect content it serves up configurable Web content designed to ensure user experience continuity For example in a faulty financial transaction series RainAssure could display pages that provide the users with a mirror of where they were in the transaction process and then either a phone number or email address that they can use to complete their transaction Alternatively a Web page could be displayed that tells the user there was a problem completing the transaction but that their session state was maintained and if they should retry their transaction submission once again Finally on the administrative side of things RainAssure provides detailed reports of completed and incomplete or dropped transactions In this way xSPs can tie direct dollar value to the transactions that they support and more importantly RainAssure can provide financial value to transactions that were not completed In the end SLM tools are there to give IT some breathing space for fixing the problems that occur along their infrastructure If a technology solution can give IT an extra minutes to fix a problem while

listserv called PhysicianASP The ASP solutions discussed in this group are the niche vertical kinds of ASPs that I have ad nauseum said that I really like Scanning through the messages Ive received I came across this exchange which I thought was interesting Its interesting because I believe that many ASPs jump several flaming hoops when putting together detailed ROI studies easeofuse analyses and featurebenefit comparisons yet sometimes the decision to go with an ASP is all about simple value and timing I did get permission to quote this just so that everyones comfortable with the fact that Im not a messageboard lurker waiting to print what people say actually I am but I do ask the composers first The questioned posed in the message was the following What criteria didwill you look at to decide whether or not ASP is right for your practice such as Financial returnenhance finances of practice Able to solve current problems with PM system Allow staff to be more productive Allow physicians to be more productive Eliminate IT headache from practice With such a question you might expect a complex set of spreadsheets in return However here is Dr Jeannie Marcus response I decided to use an ASP because I had a personnel crisis that an ASP solved My office managerbilling manager quit yet the role had to be filled An ASP solution also eliminated the IT headache for that part of system We were not looking for increased productivity as much as we were looking for a competent solution for the billingpractice management part The finances of the practice have been enhanced by using an ASPour previous system was about to sink us We had nowhere to go but up We made a good choice I dont know an ASP around that wouldnt like to have this quote However this one belongs to Athena Health an ASP to healthcare practitioners Athena Health offers several services including Billing and collections Payables management Payroll management Financial reporting Cash management No doubt many of the proof points for ASP services are required to make a typical enterprise sale But there are still sales being made based upon a good value proposition for a service that solves a specific

OPTIONS Ever since September th spending on storage has increased How are you ensuring that youre choosing the right network storage options Network Worlds Deni Connor evaluates the networked storage options Before you start spending next years budget check out what Connor has to say at goadhtml Todays focus Service providers in a postSept world By Mike Jude Something profound occurred on Sept On that day a new paradigm for business was illuminated in an unambiguous way Centralizing business operations was finally shown to be a remarkably bad idea for business survival in both the financial and the horrifyingly obvious sense It turns out that service providers which have been looking for a reason for their value proposition finally have an example of what can happen to businesses that do not outsource critical IT functions For many businesses in the World Trade Center towers Sept meant more than devastation of their place of business it meant loss of critical intellectual property customer and billing information and critical infrastructuresupporting business operations Service providers are in a position to mitigate many of the risks that businesses face in the new world of terrorism However they have been slow to preach this message The reason for the slowness is probably because of a perception that the IT infrastructure actually worked pretty well on Sept so why is anything more required Additionally service providers like many other businesses recognize that the public would find it very poor taste if they tried to capitalize on the tragedy As to the first point the fact is that the WTC illustrated not the strengths of the present system but its weaknesses Witness the stories of vendors such as Sun having to truck in workstations And who can forget that half of the switching capacity of Manhattan was lost when Verizons central office was contaminated IT infrastructure is no longer an adjunct to business it is the business operation of the enterprise If IT is lost so is the business As to the point of sensitivity to human suffering who could argue with the sentiment However while many service providers would rather not use Sept as a marketing tool it is still necessary to point out that businesses that outsource IT become less of a target for terrorists or subject to the vagaries of natural disaster Service providers offer the astute enterprise a way of mitigating risks and reducing the exposure to disasters Of course enterprise IT organizations need to ensure that the service providers they pick offer more security than can be found internally Thus things like diversity and backup procedures as well as data security become important Service providers can do more of course than just offer disaster recovery support By outsourcing things such as email and customer relationship management a basis for operations is established that can be reactivated as quickly as new terminals can be acquired Additional outsourced applications such as enterprise resource planning functions can ensure that the care of employees will not falter during recovery Although many functions probably would not be outsourced it is still possible to envision a process by which IT mirrors some key functions so that in a disaster at least most of the business can continue unchecked Sept illustrated just how vulnerable we all are It is also a wake up call for IT to reconsider outsourcing Service providers can be a large part of the solution Now is the time to start the dialogue To contact Mike Jude Mike Jude is senior analyst at Enterprise

PROVIDERS Todays focus Full circle ASPs the new Big Blue Dear Wincenty Kaminski Todays focus Full circle ASPs the new Big Blue By Mike Jude and Nancy Meachim The terms ASP and IBM may have more in common than being th ree letter acronyms Remember Big Blue of the early s The vision then was centralized computing Mainframe computers hosted complex expensive applications that end users accessed via dumb terminals IT infrastructure especially memory was expensive and needed to be controlled With computing resources centralized IBM reasoned they were easier to maintain Of course IBM got it wrong in that computers became a cheap commodity And users werent happy simply using dumb terminals They wanted a bigger share in all that technology offered So as memory prices fell so did the idea of central control Dumb terminals were transformed into intelligent desktop machines that could store applications and data The glass house populated by whitesmocked technicians went out of fashion Looking back on those times many of us would shake our heads and wonder how IBM could have been so wrong But maybe Big Blue wasnt so far off Thanks to the advent of application service providers centralized computing is making a comeback ASPs offer centralized application management The market started as a way to offer the benefits of Server Advertisement Protocol and other complex enterprise resource planning software to small companies or companies with less technical savvy But ASPs now host all kinds of applications including small multilicensed programs whose images are downloaded to end users on demand But the principle remains the same Central control makes support much more efficient and usually cheaper How about that IBM To be fair the dynamics of an ASP are very different from old centralized mainframe operations An ASP doesnt just host and support an application for general distribution over an inhouse proprietary network Unlike the IBM vision an ASP is very dependent on network service It is also very sensitive to service levels In the s if the mainframe let you down you ended up twiddling your thumbs for an hour or so and your only recourse was that whitesmocked fellow Nowadays users start to scream if service is interrupted for even a minute And woe to the ASP who brings down a customer operation The world of the ASP is much more complex than that of the old s shop However if one could magically transport a computer user from the s to the wonderful new s would it seem all that different to him In an ideal ASP world a la Scott McNealys vision users would sit down at a semidumb terminal download the application du jour and start working What did the s user do Kind of the same thing So you are probably wondering what is the point Just this IBMs problem was leaving the customer out of the equation And look what happened Customers rebelled They didnt buy IBMs spiel It became the in thing to hate IBM Why Because the guys in white smocks couldnt spell service and didnt care about customers To be successful ASPs need to learn from the past They need to tattoo service on the forehead of each of their employees There are too many choices today for

many options on the market it can be difficult for customers and ASPs to pick the right kinds of security for storage and transmission of sensitive corporate information Perhaps the ideal security product for ASPs is one that gives customers the most comfort is reasonably costeffective and can be managed by a staff that may not be expert in security The toughest part for ASPs is that their customers hold them to a security double standard These customers often expect better security for their remotely hosted systems and data than they provide for their local systems I find this ironic considering most security infractions occur from inside an organization not outside Conventional wisdom places the percentage of breaches at internal and external though I havent independently verified these statistics Based on that information I would think customers considering an ASP model for applications and data would be stumbling over one another to locate their systems at an ASP thus reducing their exposure to system compromises Instead prospective customers typically hit the ASP with security questions that may not be outside the expertise of the ASP in question and may be only marginally understood by the customers themselves ASP business development staff have to become versed in the technology workings of VPNs for data transfer and publickey infrastructure for authentication and encryption for example just so they can get in the door with a potential customer Unfortunately comprehensive security procedures and technologies are typically very expensive to implement and require a level of security expertise that most ASPs cannot hope to implement and maintain And Im not so sure these technology answers are really solving the problem of security for ASPs and their customers Again of security breaches come from the inside In a lot of cases that means that the true threat is from people who are already inside the security demilitarized zones It seems to me that security technology is really only part of the answer to the overall security question In my opinion ASPs and large enterprises should look beyond the latest security technology and hire security experts from the Department of Defense NSA or the CIA who can help implement security policies and procedures that will be effective in eliminating the internal breaches There are several documented systems publicly available from the government that outline the policies and procedures necessary to meet certain levels of security For example there is a series of trusted systems books available from INFOSEC each named after a color the Teal Book the Orange Book and the Bright Blue Book all of which are great resources for a variety of security topics No doubt there are some commercial enterprises that also adhere to recognized security standards and can provide the procedures and technology necessary to ensure the integrity of critical business information inside and outside corporate networks Partnerships between ASPs and these emerging companies would make a lot of sense I dont mean to exclude technology solutions from this discussion I believe that there are significant strides being made to make security technology more usable and affordable But I fear that ASPs are setting up servicelevel agreements with their customers that guarantee certain levels of security and intrusion detection but are really only covering the most visible problem To contact Jeb Bolding Jeb Bolding is senior consultant with Enterprise Management Associates in Boulder Colo an

Bolding In October I talked about Relera which at that time announced that it was getting out of the managedservices business Before it made the announcement I visited its Internet data center in Denver and what comes to my mind when I think about the discussion I had with its CEO and my impression of the facilities is one word scale Everything was about having the best partners the biggest data center massive systems redundancy rates etc No doubt there is a place for that corporate mentality and Releras focus on scale should be a comfort to many enterprise companies Relera may have just been unfortunate with its timing in the market and it may yet be successful with its focus As a counterpoint yesterday I visited another local Internet data center provider Inflow Like Relera Inflow is headquartered in Denver and like Relera it is focused at secondtier cities such as Nashville and Minneapolis though it does have some firsttier city locations The similarities in my opinion end there Inflows corporate esprit de corps seems to revolve around smaller is better As an example the data centers are smaller somewhere between and square feet Not only does this bring data center profitability sooner based upon allocated space but it also gives in the words of Inflow executives a more personal touch to the relationship between the datacenter managers and Inflows customers Further to this point instead of effectively building its own substations Inflow ensures that each of its data centers there are three in Denver are located on different power grids While this may not put you in complete control over your own destiny its a reasonable and costefficient solution based upon the statistical likelihood of a disaster While Inflows costs are considerably less the features of its facilities do not appear to be diminished All data centers are mirror images of one another other than the square footage so that a customer walking into a Nashville facility will be just as at home in a Denver center All the services from simple colocation to managed security services and monitoring are replicated similarly across the various locations And your single operational account representative is your focal service point regardless of how many Inflow data centers youre in Management is fully integrated between the data centers so that your customer representative does not have to be local to your issues in order to solve them No doubt there is a place in the business world for Relera and Inflow Inflow may have just lucked out that its focus on costs will help the company better weather a long downturn To contact Jeb Bolding Jeb Bolding is senior consultant with Enterprise Management Associates in Boulder Colo an analyst and market research firm focusing

considering most security infractions occur from inside an organization not outside Conventional wisdom places the percentage of breaches at internal and external though I havent independently verified these statistics Based on that information I would think customers considering an ASP model for applications and data would be stumbling over one another to locate their systems at an ASP thus reducing their exposure to system compromises Instead prospective customers typically hit the ASP with security questions that may not be outside the expertise of the ASP in question and may be only marginally understood by the customers themselves ASP business development staff have to become versed in the technology workings of VPNs for data transfer and publickey infrastructure for authentication and encryption for example just so they can get in the door with a potential customer Unfortunately comprehensive security procedures and technologies are typically very expensive to implement and require a level of security expertise that most ASPs cannot hope to implement and maintain And Im not so sure these technology answers are really solving the problem of security for ASPs and their customers Again of security breaches come from the inside In a lot of cases that means that the true threat is from people who are already inside the security demilitarized zones It seems to me that security technology is really only part of the answer to the overall security question In my opinion ASPs and large enterprises should look beyond the latest security technology and hire security experts from the Department of Defense NSA or the CIA who can help implement security policies and procedures that will be effective in eliminating the internal breaches There are several documented systems publicly available from the government that outline the policies and procedures necessary to meet certain levels of security For example there is a series of trusted systems books available from INFOSEC each named after a color the Teal Book the Orange Book and the Bright Blue Book all of which are great resources for a variety of security topics No doubt there are some commercial enterprises that also adhere to recognized security standards and can provide the procedures and technology necessary to ensure the integrity of critical business information inside and outside corporate networks Partnerships between ASPs and these emerging companies would make a lot of sense I dont mean to exclude technology solutions from this discussion I believe that there are significant strides being made to make security technology more usable and affordable But I fear that ASPs are setting up servicelevel agreements with their customers that guarantee certain levels of security and intrusion detection but are really only covering the most visible problem To contact Jeb Bolding Jeb Bolding is senior consultant with Enterprise Management Associates in Boulder Colo an
