No Wind Market Power As strong winds blew in from the west on October th Community Energy and Exelon Power Team executives announced the five largest retail wind purchases in Americas history to a large crowd of excited onlookers gathered for the dedication of two new Pennsylvania wind farms Amidst cheers and applause Mike Freeman of Exelon Power Team and Brent Alderfer of Community Energy announced that the University of Pennsylvania now leads the nation for the largest retail purchase of wind The Penn Quakers are buying million kilowatthours kWh the output of five turbines or the equivalent of percent of its electricity from the Community EnergyExelon Power Teams MW and MW wind farms at Mill Run and Somerset Township With these turbines only just beginning to turn multiple conversations were heard about the need to build even more wind farms to meet retail consumer demand for wind energy All those standing on the reclaimed mine land that is now a dairy farm could see before them the merging of wind power and the power of the retail marketplace Not far behind the Quakers in their purchase are the roaring Nittany Lions of Penn State University Penn State University is purchasing more than million kWh the production of three turbines from Community Energy For a land grant university its hard to beat clean energy made on a dairy farm In third place is Carnegie Mellon University which created crucial momentum by becoming the first major wind purchaser acquiring million kWh Having exercised real leadership and gotten this market moving Carnegie Mellon is seriously considering increasing its wind energy buy next year Rounding out the top five are the Philadelphia Suburban Water Company and Giant Eagle with purchases of about million and million kWh respectively We urge more companies and utilities to follow their examples If you are interested in buying wind energy contact Community Energy at wwwnewwindenergycom In fact if just institutions buy at least the output of one large wind turbine Pennsylvanias retail consumers can insure that MW of new wind energy are built and operating By harnessing the power of the retail market to wind power development that goal is very achievable Though not in the top five the Environmental Protection Agency Western Pennsylvania Conservancy and the White Dog Cafe in Philadelphia have all also made major purchases Every one of these purchasers understands the price of wind energy but more importantly they understand its environmental public health and energy security value showing that Oscar Wilde wasnt right about everyone when he said nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing Stunningly percent of the wind power from these two wind farms was sold out as soon as Public Utility Commission Chairman Glen Thomas and Department of Environmental Protection Secretary David Hess flipped the switch of the first of what are sixteen Enron Wind MW machines These turbines which make full revolutions per minute are the largest manufactured in the United States and their blades are longer than previously used to be more efficient in the moderatebutsteady wind at these locations All told they will generate enough electricity for homes or about million kWh of electricity with no soot mercury carbon dioxide nitrogen oxide or sulfur dioxide In contrast typical system power in this region would emit about million pounds of carbon dioxide pounds of sulfur dioxide and pounds per year of nitrogen oxide in order to provide the same amount of electricity But aside from the important environmental benefits the wind projects also reflect substantial economic development in Fayette and Somerset counties Both the Mill Run and Somerset turbines are on working farms with the owners receiving to for each tower erected on their land which they continue to farm Several of the Somerset turbines are situated on reclaimed strip and deep mines Construction of the two wind farms required about labor years of employment and will require about four fulltime equivalent workers to maintain and operate the sites The sites generate local property taxes and if yesterdays dedication ceremonies and the nearby Green Mountain wind farm in Garrett are any indication at least a modest tourist industry This was all made possible by a great project team and every member deserves a hearty well done Although construction only took about months project development by Atlantic Renewable Energy Corporation began about two years ago Zilkha Renewable Energy Atlantics development partner provided project financing as did The Reinvestment Funds Sustainable Development Fund with money made available as a result of the PECO Energy and Unicom merger settlement negotiated by PennFuture and others Exelon Power Team is the wholesaler and Community Energy markets wind energy to retail customers On a sad note Nick Humber an Enron Wind employee who was instrumental in moving the projects to fruition died when his hijacked plane crashed into the World Trade Center on Sept Another plane that crashed in Somerset County was only about miles from the wind farm Nicks contribution to the project leaves a stunning memorial reaching into the sky with clean affordable homegrown electricity that supports our communities We are glad that Nicks brother was able to attend the dedication As the tragic events of Sept spur renewed patriotism and interest in domestic safety it is important to recognize that the Community EnergyExelon wind farms will help to increase Americas energy independence and security More wind farms can only do us more good Conservation is a moral issue said President Teddy Roosevelt for it involves the patriotic duty to insure the safety and continuance of the nation In these times conservation of Americas environment and protecting the nations safety cannot be done without an accelerated shift to wind and other renewable energy resources To all involved with this project but especially the University of Pennsylvania and the other purchasers who have acted in keeping with Teddy Roosevelts words we salute you ECubed is

FERC ruled that the three N ortheastern ISOs the PennsylvaniaNew JerseyMaryland Independent System Operator PJM the New England ISO NEISO and the New York ISO NYISO should become a Regional Transmission Organization RTO some hoped that these birds of a feather would flock together After all PJM NEISO and N YISO are examples for the country teaching that RTOs are an essential cond ition for the creation of competitive wholesale markets The three ISOs als o individually oversee very small markets that are vulnerable to market pow er have higher than necessary transaction costs and other problems precis ely because of the scope of their individual markets Indeed even once all three markets are merged the combined market will account for less than percent of the nations generation All these factors would drive rationa l participants focused on creating genuinely competitive markets toward mer ger At least one would think so Yet so far an intensive mediation process reveals that nobody is checking parochial interests at the negotiatingroom door In terms of the new RTO b oard and membership participants are haggling about whether D inde pendent board or whether does Such equations will never balance no matter how hard one tries The greater good is getting lost in turf battles and worse If this myopic behavior continues the result will be that all regions and all states lose because they cannot see beyond their own noses Consequently the ball is squarely back in FERCs court to direct the devel opment of a successful RTO It now faces some key decisions as it attempts to make good on the promise of the merger to improve market efficiency di minish market power concerns improve interconnection rules for renewable e nergy resources and reduce costs to consumers For demand response and ren ewable energy advocates the stakes are especially high Indeed the expansio n of PJM into the Allegheny Energy control area was crucial to resolving in terconnection issues that allowed development of the Mill Run Pennsylvania MW wind farm and enables future wind development in West Virginia that will in January be significantly within PJM The ability of the Northeast RTO to make effective decisions and follow thr ough on those decisions will determine its eventual success or failure But the debate over RTO governance begins and ends with the fact that FERC dir ected that PJM be the platform for the new organization utilizing the bes t practices from NYISO and NEISO PJM has the greatest experience and most successful track record of the three ISOs and is about the same size as NY ISO and NEISO combined At the same time NYISO and NEISO have performed we ll and have addressed some issues more successfully than PJM The recent PJ M report to the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission confirming that PJM s thoroughly discredited ICAP market was indeed manipulated by a single ma rket participant which exercised undue market power in early is a tim ely reminder that PJM does not walk on water Unfortunately rather than tackling implementation issues solely on their m erits debates have retained the persistent undercurrent of ISO regional stakeholder and corporate turf wars or selfinterests Only FERC can get the process moving swiftly in the right direction by dire cting that the new RTO be an independent entity with superior board experie nce and clear decisionmaking authority responsive to genuine stakeholder i nput There is no place for perpetuation of existing ISO selfinterests se lfserving stakeholder vetoes or regional power brokering Four principles are critical in the formation of any governance structure board experience and independence effective input of all stakeholders suf ficient board decisionmaking authority and sufficient monitoring of marke t power An Independent and Experienced Board Happily the three proposals which emerged from the mediation process requi re members of the board to be independent from any of the market participan ts precluding working for any of the companies doing business in the North east RTO markets owning stock in member companies or participating on any affiliated boards In contrast to this good news is the bad news that the three proposals focu s too heavily on giving each existing ISO proper representation on the new RTO board and what the proper representation would be This regional focus undercuts independence and treats the RTO board like the United States Sen ate where each Senator comes from a state and argues for its interests Loy alty to the home ISO becomes the real requirement in such cases not indepe ndence Independence for the new RTO board membership should also mean independence from the institutional interests of the existing PJM NYISO and NEISO Ev en if the existing ISOs retain operation for an extended period it would b e for practical technical reasons not because the ISOs themselves are a n ecessary constituency To take a seat on the Northeast RTO board all new R TO board members should resign any existing ISO board positions The only f iduciary responsibility these board officers should have is to the new orga nization The new RTO board should include the most qualified individuals without un due emphasis on whether or not they previously served on a particular ISO b oard It makes sense that some but perhaps not all of the individuals on the new RTO board will have previously served on ISO boards Such experienc e is invaluable Yet it appears that some parties are stuck in the rut that ISO experience must bring ISO baggage If the fiduciary duty of RTO board members is clearly to the RTO instead of to a prior ISO it will be easier to get beyond ISO power issues To encourage the movement of the most quali fied ISO board members to the new RTO board the transition board also sh ould be or become the initial permanent Northeast RTO board Rather than on representation selection of RTO board members should focus primarily on the breadth of issues that will be facing the new RTO A well rounded set of board experience and skills is essential to addressing such important issues as demand response interconnection of generators cost re covery mechanisms system planning and reliability The new RTO board should have members with regulatory financial environme ntal consumer and reliability backgrounds Besides providing voices genuin ely without the baggage of prior ISO affiliation the initial RTO board sho uld probably for example include someone with substantial experience in m erging organizations The search process for new board members should be do ne in an open manner with input from all stakeholders to ensure adequate ex pertise in the diversity of issues that will face the new RTO Stakeholder Input Meaningful stakeholder input is crucial because the RTO will be fundamental ly charged with serving the public interest in an industry that is at the h eart of our economy security and environment Moreover no board or manag ement team can adequately predict all of the impacts brought on by rule cha nges without close coordination with market participants The RTO will ulti mately survive only if it maintains its credibility and the confidence of t he public The three existing ISOs have made a substantial transition from a narrow co nception of stakeholders as transmission owners to encompass market part icipants and even to include public representatives PJM has recently expa nded the types of parties that can participate in the process by facilitati ng the ability of State Consumer Advocates to join and be voting members O ther ISOs have gone even further by specifying specific categories for envi ronmental agencies and individual consumers and minimizing the costs of jo ining Of course many stakeholder processes require so much time and expe nse that it is difficult or even impossible for such stakeholders to meanin gfully participate But while opportunities for genuine and appropriate stakeholder input are e ssential stakeholder processes cannot become an excuse or a means to avoid problem solving There is a fine line between genuine stakeholder input an d de facto special interest veto power Over the past four years PJM relie d heavily on its membership to make improvements to market rules and has th e best though still flawed wholesale energy market in the country Yet it is equally clear that stakeholder input can impede positive changes such as eliminating the ICAP requirements or implementing demandresponse propos als These concerns are balanced by having stakeholder opportunities for input b uilt into RTO problem solving without allowing stakeholder processes to ha ve a life of their own or the pretense of being the board Stakeholders sho uld not only be able to comment on proposed changes but also should constan tly look for ways to improve the market and be able to communicate these su ggestions to the RTO board In turn the board should take these suggestion s seriously This healthy relationship is hard to reduce to rules and rules alone cannot create it Ultimately only a combination of rules incentives and personal leadership can make it happen DecisionMaking Authority Ultimately the RTO board should be able to file changes with FERC on all m arket rule changes and reliability changes with stakeholder input but with out specific stakeholder approval The RTO board must have the ability to f ile under the more broadly defined Section of the FPA One example of the effective use of this type of intervention came earlier this spring After months of negotiation on an economic demandresponse pro gram several PJM market participants chose to block passage The PJM board reviewed the results of the various votes on the demandresponse programs determined that the programs were justified and important and filed the p roposed rule changes which FERC approved Since individual ISO boards will likely remain during a transition phase a ll FERC filings should be made through the RTO board which would have fina l decisionmaking authority Market Monitoring Effective independent market monitoring is essential to identifying market power problems and fixing them But an effective market monitoring presenc e also requires close observation from inside the RTO PJMs Market Monitor ing Unit MMU works for and reports to PJM As more parties attempt to merge and contractually control more assets mon itoring market power will become more important The market would be better served if the MMU were more independent of PJM perhaps reporting directly to FERC and the board The MMU must have both the ability to identify mark et flaws and the authority to make corrections in a timely manner without being subjected to a committee process that could delay or avoid effective responses Next Steps Since the mediation process FERC has been working to incorporate state reg ulatory agencies into the development of the RTO But as with other stakeho lders too many states are allowing parochial interests to interfere To keep the process moving an independent search firm should review existi ng board members and potential new candidates to determine what would make for an effective RTO board which meets the criteria outlined above FERC sh ould then direct the new RTO Board to start the long process of creating a fully functional and effective RTO The first task of the RTO board is to c ommission an implementation team and set out the overall direction Second FERC should establish an inclusive stakeholder process that can eff ectively communicate to the board Finally FERC should empower a Market Monitoring Unit that reports directly to the Commission as well as the board With these steps the birds of a feather that PJM NYISO and NEISO really are could finally flock together ECubed is available for reprint in newspapers and other publications Auth ors are

and federal level public education and assisting citizens in public advocacy September Vol No Pittsburgh v San Diego First and Goal Pittsburgh like San Diego will soon be served by an electric utility that has divested its generation and paid off its stranded costs Despite these important similarities the different public policies implemented by Pennsylvania and California are producing electricity markets that have little in common In the Pittsburgh area where Duquesne Lights distribution service territory delivers electricity residential customers have several choices and an impressive have switched to a competitive generation supplier In the electricity transition game Pittsburghers have a first and goal By contrast suffering from a market which features a dominant retail utility that is passing through the hourly wholesale spot market price San Diego s residents need a completed hailMary pass to escape wholesale pric e spikes and a lack of choices Some crucial changes nonetheless to the Duquesne service territorys transition from monopoly to competitive wholesale and retail markets generation should soon be made Now pending before the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission at Docket No R is Duquesne Lights Petitio n for approval of its Provider of Last Resort plan POLR This filing may be a model for the nation on how to manage a transition once stranded cost charges have been paid off Also in the boardrooms of the three main western Pennsylvania utilities that are not presently part of the PJM power pool utility executives will soon decide whether they will voluntarily join PJM If they do not ways o f compelling inclusion within PJM are under discussion in Harrisburg On expanding PJM there can be no compromise Western Pennsylvania does not currently have and will not have a viable competitive wholesale market unless its service territories become part of PJM If the western Pennsylvania utilities are included one way or another in PJM and if the Duquesne POLR is approved with at most little change Pittsburgh will have the most competitive wholesale and retail markets in the country At that point rate regulation of default service could be successfully ended as long as widespread deployment of timeofuse meters and appliance control technology that together increase demand response t o price has occurred On the other hand if incorrect decisions are made on POLR PJM or increasing demand response Pittsburgh will be on the road to San Diego An d that is an electricity market that no Pennsylvanian or Californian should experience Duquesnes POLR transition plan would end the collection of stranded cos ts from residential customers as early as February As a result it would provide a system average and residential rate cut for customers whether or not they are shopping Transmission and generation rates will then be capped until December and possibly until December In addition to the rate cuts and caps the Duquesne plan would increase present shopping credits by on a system average basis to over six cents per kilowatthour giving shopping customers the opportunity to save as much as another off the bundled rate in effect on January Between the rate cut and savings from shopping residential customers may be able to reduce their rates by when compared to those in effect prior t o competition Indeed based on current price offerings the end of the stranded cost charge means consumers could even purchase a renewable Greene product and still save about on their total electric bill compared to what customers previously paid for fossil and nuclearfueled monopoly generatio n from Duquesne For this reason the Pittsburgh market can be the hottest renewable energy market in the world Aggressive public education and marketing are all that is needed to turn that prediction into reality The POLR plan which was developed by Duquesne in collaboration with sever al interested parties also provides more customer usage data to competitive suppliers and better allocates load responsibility and losses between competitive suppliers and Orion the new provider of last resort Flags Thrown on POLR Nevertheless the plan is Duquesnes not a settlement Some may object to the proposed rule that customers not be permitted to switch to POLR servic e for belowmarket summer rates although Orion insists it will not supply wholesale power without the protection A second controversial component o f the plan is to permit Duquesne to avoid a TD rate case by allowing Duques ne to charge four mills above the price of POLR service from Orion effective ly raising TD rates by about from the existing rates that were set in Whether or not everyone likes every part of the plan Duquesnes custome rs would save as much as from prerestructuring rates The new higher shopping credits effectively would become the highest in the country and encourage greater retail competition in the service territory It could op en the door for new entrants renewable products and valueadded services tha t genuinely compete for customers Pittsburgh could be the first region in t he nation to see what a competitive market really can provide in the electric industry Why Pittsburgh The PUC restructuring decision in May based substantially on the cornerstone PECO decision in December established shopping credits that have given the Pittsburgh area the most successful residential retail choice plan in the US so far Duquesnes plan also included its exit from the generation business and the divestiture of its generation assets In April Duquesne completed its sale of generation facilities totaling megawatts MW to Orion Power MidWest for billion This successful generation auction greatly reduced Duquesnes actual strande d costs compared to the projected levels Avoiding Interception Even with an end to stranded cost recovery and high shopping credits in there will be no genuinely competitive retail market without a genuinely competitive wholesale market nor a workably competitive wholesa le market without a workably competitive retail market Successful electricit y competition requires both competitive wholesale and retail markets see ou r prior issue entitled California Bad Dreaming However even high shopping credits provide consumers with small retail savings if power cannot economically be transmitted into the region and such transmission is very limited in the tiny Duquesne control area Duquesne has a large number of shopping customers primarily because Duques ne wanted to exit the generation supply business Duquesne made some capacity available at belowmarket rates and Allegheny Energy did a particularly good job aggregating communities and picking off customers Only a few suppliers compete though and offer only limited savings mainly because Pittsburgh and the rest of western Pennsylvania the Duquesne Penn Power and Allegheny Energy service territories still lack a functional Independent System Operator To remedy these problems and help create a competitive wholesale market western Pennsylvanias utilities must join PJM a power pool that is independently operated and contains over megawatts of generation Duquesnes POLR filing itself drives home the urgency of requiring weste rn Pennsylvanias utilities to join PJM Duquesne directly states there is no liquid visible wholesale electric market in Duquesnes area and tha t none is likely to exist in the near future These statements strongly under score the need for state action and the failure of policy at the federal level The absence of a competitive wholesale market makes the issue of basing prices on competitive market rates one of the stickiest issues among those working to develop the POLR plan Duquesne correctly insists that it would be fruitless to move POLR service to market rates without a competitive wholesale market Ultimately the plan provides for marketbased POLR prici ng no sooner than if a proceeding establishes during that a competitive wholesale market exists Yet while supporting the conclusion that no competitive wholesale market exists and identifying the lack of an Independent System Operator or regional power exchange as particular problems the POLR filing has no discussion of the obvious solution expansion of PJM to include western Pennsylvania Duquesne may be willing to support this solution if only AP S and perhaps First Energy with which the Duquesne system is interconnected would join as well Joining PJM would eliminate transmission rate pancakin g avoid multiple control areas expand the number of generators and supplier s serving the market and enable new generation including renewable generation to serve the Pittsburgh area In the End Zone Duquesne Light should be congratulated for its stewardship of the transiti on in its service territory and for its POLR filing Due to its work so far a nd that of others including the Public Utility Commission Pittsburgh will s ee huge reductions in the costs of electricity starting in and continuin g until at least Pittsburgh will also be the best place to buy and sel l renewable energy in America as residential customers will be able to swit ch to a renewable power product and still save about when compared t o bundled rates in effect on January All that is a triumph of policy and will make Pittsburgh a better place to live and work But the biggest victory that now can and must be won is in Pittsburghs grasp Winning will award Pittsburgh the most competiti ve wholesale and retail markets in the nation But to secure the win POLR mu st be approved with no or at most minor modifications PJM must be expanded and demand side response to price must be increased Only then can Pittsburgh truly declare victory in the electric competition game Ecubed is available for reprint in newspapers and other publications Authors are available for print or broadcast Support Ecubed by

families and businesses in the southeast region of Pennsylvania In a brandnew program that will debut later this summer consumers in the PECO Energy service territory will be able to apply for financial support to purchase and install solar photovoltaic PV systems The key elements of the new program are grants of up to for solar PV systems sized between and kW consumer loans to help residential consumers pay for PV solar water heating systems or energy efficiency improvements financial incentives to encourage housing developers to include PV in their housing projects and loans and other financial incentives to help commercial and industrial customers install PV This is terrific news for any homeowner or business that is interested in using clean power but cant afford the still relatively high cost of solar The program was developed by the Sustainable Development Fund SDF which was created by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission as part of the transition to electric competition The SDFs mission is to promote renewable energy energy conservation and sustainable energy businesses The SDF recently issued a Request for Proposals to select a PV program administrator who will be responsible for managing the PV grant program If you are interested in the PV program or in submitting a proposal to serve as program administrator visit their website at wwwtrfundcomsdf Also be sure to contact SDF by email at so that you can be put on a contact list and given updated information about the PV program For more information about solar power in the

hosted a hearing on greenhouse gas emissions and global warming in Pennsylvania which was attended by environmental advocates concerned citizens and industry representatives The hearing sponsored by the House Democratic Policy Committee focused on Vitalis recently introduced House Resolution which requests the Department of Environmental Protection to investigate the causes and effects of global warming in Pennsylvania and to develop a strategy for reducing the states greenhouse gas emissions John Dernbach Environmental Law Professor at Widener University Dr Tom Delworth of the Geophysical Dynamics Laboratory at Princeton University John Hanger President and CEO of PennFuture and the Reverend Joy Kaufmann Director of Public Advocacy for the Pennsylvania Council of Churches all testified as to the need for a statewide strategy to attack global warming Pennsylvania currently emits a whopping percent of the worlds greenhouse gas emissions These emissions are contributing worldwide to rising temperatures and seas loss of crops and species and increased disease and starvation Several regional assessments predict that Pennsylvanias average summer temperature will rise between to degrees by the year Biodiversity will diminish including the loss of maple beech and birch forests and cold water fishes such as trout There will be increases in vectorborne diseases and more frequent extreme weather such as storms and droughts There is great news however As several of the testifiers pointed out Pennsylvania is in a unique position to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions by using energy efficiently and developing renewable energy resources After all a single household switching to renewable energy can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an amount equal to planting trees or not driving miles In fact the four bills recently introduced by the Renewable Energy Caucus HB and provide incentives for building renewable energy supply encouraging the use of personal power and energy efficiency and building greener more efficient buildings Testifiers repeatedly stressed that passing this package of bills along with House Resolution will be a critical step in reducing our greenhouse gas emissions Help ensure that Pennsylvania takes a leadership role on global warming Ask your representative to support House Resolution and the Renewable Energy Bills To see

University CMU is making the nations largest single retail purchase of wind energy CMU will buy percent of its total electricity next year from new wind power generated in western Pennsylvania The purchase of windgenerated electricity equivalent to the energy required by nearly homes per year is part of Carnegie Mellons commitment to cleaner energy and the environment CMU is using their research and education programs as well as their own campus practices to improve environmental quality while also supporting the development of wind power generation in Western Pennsylvania Carnegie Mellons wind energy will be generated by the ExelonCommunity Energy Wind Farm at Mill Run under construction in Springfield and Stewart Townships in Fayette County about miles southeast of Pittsburgh The Carnegie Mellon wind energy purchase of megawatthours will require more than an entire dedicated turbine to meet the demand CMUs decision to buy locally generated wind energy makes a contribution both locally and globally With the current attention on an impending energy crisis it is both satisfying and responsible to use energy that generates no pollution and uses no fuel The universitys actions show that doing right by the environment is also a good business decision Their vision is one that can and should be copied by educational institutions government businesses and individuals throughout the Commonwealth By moving from local coalfired power plant production to wind power CMUs purchase will eliminate the equivalent of tons of nitrogen oxides per year a precursor of ozone smog tons of sulfur dioxide which leads to acid rain tons of carbon dioxide the primary contributor to global warming and pounds of mercury a pollutant that is toxic to humans and the environment The reduction in carbon dioxide emissions is equivalent to planting nearly acres of trees or taking more than cars off the road PECO CUSTOMERS WILL SOON SEE HOMEGROWN WIND ENERGY ADDED TO THEIR MENU PECO customers will soon have the option to buy homegrown wind energy as a result of an exciting new business venture between PECO Energy Company and Community Energy Inc CEI a local renewable energy marketing company PECO will buy the output of the Somerset Wind Farm and Mill Run Wind Farm which will be built in western Pennsylvania and the new Waymart Wind Farm which is planned for Scranton PA This purchase agreement will make PECO the largest wind marketer east of the Mississippi and gives consumers a chance to support regional development of new renewable energy supply Homes and businesses will be able to buy the wind energy in blocks based on kilowatthours allowing them to ensure that a certain amount of their power comes from the new Pennsylvania wind farms Customers will be able determine how much extra they want to spend each month depending on how many blocks they buy providing a flexible new way to support renewable energy An additional five dollars would represent about a third of a typical residential customers monthly usage PECO and CEI will soon be presubscribing these wind blocks to interested customers in advance of these new wind farms anticipated energy

blowing in the wind In fact about MW of new wind generation will be operating in Pennsylvania by a small portion of the Commonwealths total wind resource which is enough to produce about billion kWh or of Pennsylvanias total electricity consumption But challenges must be overcome to keep this crop from fading into thin air Why are obstacles being overcome to make wind power part of Pennsylvania s energy future Customers want clean energy and wind is readily available especially in the northeastern central and southwestern areas of our state While some other states have better wind resources Pennsylvania has plenty of Class wind resources and a good bit of Class much of which is located in rural communities Ironically sufficient wind resources are al so often found in formerly important coal centers that were decimated when machines replaced human labor and mines were emptied of marketable coal I t could offer these communities a sustainable economic future as the wind i s never mined out Just one year ago when Ecubed discussed reasons to Go With the Wind Vol I No no commercial wind farms were operating in Pennsylvania but our state had and still has the most vibrant customer choice program in America Today there are already two new clean renewab le wind generation facilities that were built in direct response to consumer demand The MW Green Mountain Farm in Garrett Somerset County can produce about MWh of electricity enough to serve about households eac h year The kW Pennsylvania Wind Energy Project in Hazleton Luzerne County can produce about kWh of electricity and will double in siz e this fall But even when additional kW turbines are installed Community Energys wind block sales will have served only about half of th e small commercial customer load that subscribed to its limited pilot marke ting program These two operating wind farms avoid tons of S tons of CO and tons of NOx Two larger wind farms are expected to be operating next year Atlantic Renewable and International Wind are developing a MW Mill Run wind far m in Fayette County and National Wind Power is developing a facility near Scranton Lackawanna County which will produce at least MW initially Although not all will be completed by the end of seven other project s by five active wind developers are scheduled to provide an additional MW of new wind generation in Pennsylvania during and after The wind industry expects that about MW could be built in Pennsylvania within t wo to three years If MW of additional wind generation replaced system power Pennsylvania would avoid tons of SO tons of CO a nd tons of NOx These new wind developments are fueled not just by wind but by investment dollars and consumer demand as well The Pennsylvania Wind Development Program recently announced the availability of wind energy production incentives for new facilities that become operational by the end of of up to centskwh for five years The program operated for the Sustainable Development Fund by The Reinvestment Fund will receive million from settlement of the PECOUnicom merger which is expected to become final in November Construction by the end of is also important because the federal Production Tax Credit for new wind development expires at that time and it is unclear if it will be renewed Production incentives are crucial for wind power especially in Pennsylvania where wind resources tend to peak in both the winter and during the late evening hours when the demand for electricity is low In t he current market the estimated average energy value from wind power is only about to centskWh The green attribute can fetch about an other centskwh for total market revenues of around cents per kilowatthour California wind production on the other hand generally peaks in the afternoon when the demand for electricity is high resulting in average electric sales value of approximately centskWh By comparison wind costs about cents per kilowatthour to produce in Pennsylvania The cost is on the way down although it could be some time before it dips as low as the cents and less mark in those areas of the country with the very best wind resources However total generation costs of Pennsylvania wind compare favorably to allin nuclear generation costs such as Limericks centskwh and Susquehannas near cent allin cost but still cost about more than total costs of a new fossil fuel plant Of course existing nuclear plants do not have to recover the allin production costs through the market because those costs are subsidized by stranded costs payments The million of funding in the Pennsylvania Wind Development Program is a drop in the bucket compared to the billions of dollars that subsidize nuclear powe r plants Another challenge to new wind power is that the exploding demand for wind turbines throughout the world and the rush to build American wind farms by December are stressing the capacity of turbine manufacturers to meet orders Only five qualified wind manufacturers do business in the US Of the five two are taking no new orders through while two others have limited capacity remaining for additional orders The leading manufacturer s are unfortunately not American but European many are just beginning t o have enough business in the US and Pennsylvania in particular to support necessary sales and operating support If turbines are available to harvest the wind Pennsylvanias wind resou rce is sufficient for commercial development but does not generate as much or as valuable electricity as in other states For example some states may have Class wind that blows strong and steady during peak electric load times The best sites in Pennsylvania are only Class and the wind often blows intermittently In addition to the lower average price for the electricity generated at offpeak times the resource at a site is crucial to project finances and requires detailed assessment A site generally mus t be metered for a full year before investors will make a commitment to a project Although there are no technical barriers to interconnection of wind generation to the grids in Pennsylvania the intermittent nature of wind also makes interconnection with a system based on predictable generation more difficult and less economic For example some operating systems stil l have rules that impose substantial penalties for inaccurate scheduling of generation even though the real time balancing markets required under FER C Order should eliminate the need for these penalties The intermittent nature of wind makes such rules especially burdensome for wind projects On the bright side some of the early problems with wind generation are successfully being overcome New wind turbines now purr along quietly compared to older technologies New turbines also turn quite slowly and developers are sensitive to the rights of birds to fly While wind turbine s were once considered eyesores the sleek postmodern look is increasingly found attractive especially in comparison to transmission lines cell towers or the strip mining that often occurred on the same land upon whic h the turbines are now being built Communities also are welcoming wind projects not just because problems related to noise birds or view sheds can be minimized but as important rural economic development and supplementary income to farmers A farmer c an receive rental income of about per year per turbine erected on a ti ny portion of farmland without significant interference to farming operations A turbine wind farm could add in annual income to a hardpresse d small farmer A rural township can also expect a boost in its tax base For example whe n the wind farm was built the Garrett tax base increased about And local construction contracts comprise about of the cost of a new wind development so that a million wind farm generates about million Conservation Consultants Wind Farm USA Project works in farming areas w ith the best wind development potential to help rural communities understand the economic as well as environmental benefits of new wind development Pennsylvania will never have the best wind resources but the remaining challenges facing its wind industry can readily be overcome The federal Production Tax Credit should be extended for several years the Pennsylvani a Wind Development Program should be expanded and system operators should correct their rules in order to eliminate unnecessary barriers to the development of our burgeoning wind industry Ultimately consumer demand may resolve these

in the energy market October Vol No Electricitys Oktoberfest Pennsylvania retail market survives summer and grows The latest shopping statistics on Pennsylvanias market show that as of October more customers than ever have switched to a competitive supplie r in Pennsylvania Up from the customers that had switched by July now more than customers have chosen competitive suppliers This increase in customers that have switched is impressive given the unfavorabl e summer wholesale market conditions Even more impressively in Duquesne Lig ht s service territory of residential customers have now switched Nineteen suppliers are competing for residential customers in the PECO service territory New Power entered the PECO market in September and is aggressively advertising and marketing including offering frequent flyer miles to its customers Do not expect that any of this good news will make headlines around the country But count on those that support the Californ ia approach to restructuring they are still peddling their snake oil to kee p misrepresenting Pennsylvanias electric competition policy and bashing Pennsylvanias market Mack and ECAP reenter the green market The Energy Cooperative Association of Pennsylvania ECAP and Mack Service s have reentered the green power market in the PECO Energy service territor y offering a Greene certified renewable energy product for centskWh A typical residential consumer would pay a mere cents more p er day to purchase a renewable power product from one of these suppliers Mack and ECAP join Green Mountain Energy Company which continued to accep t new customers throughout the summer as the three suppliers offering Green e products in the PECO area Green Mountain also has dropped the per month customer service charge in the PECO service territory thereby cutti ng the cost of its renewable energy product by more than This is a good time to switch to these attractive renewable energy products which avoid an amount of pollution equal to not driving miles taking cars off the road or planting trees See our website at wwwpennfutureorg for a switching kit New investment for Green Mountain This week Green Mountain Energy Company announced that it has received a million investment from Nuon the largest utility company in the Netherlands Nuon joins BP Amoco with significant stakes in Green Mountain Energy Sam Wyly also announced that he was resigning as the Chairman of Green Mountain Energys Board of Directors Hopefully the new investment and board membership are preludes to more marketing activity in Pennsylvania for renewable energy products Adversity to triumph In another striking development in the renewable market one of Pennsylvanias early modernera renewable generators will most likely stay in business despite the recent ending of a longterm PURPA contract Sinc e the Lebanon Methane Recovery project has been operating effectively to convert into electricity the landfill methane that would have gone directl y into the atmosphere After the year PURPA contract ended last year the facility was not able to sell its output in the PJM wholesale market at prices high enough to stay in business Its closing was imminent when PennFuture was first contacted The plant will likely now remain open as PennFuture arranged a project that will keep middleman expenses to a minimum The methane generator will sell directly to Mack Services Group a licensed wholesaler and retailer which will sell a renewable Greene certified product to an aggregation of churches in the PECO service territory By averting the shutdown of the facility this project directly avoids the emission of methane a greenhouse gas that is four times mo re potent than carbon dioxide CO The generation of electricity from this project also produces approximately fewer tons of nitrogen oxide tons less sulfur dioxide and tons less CO than are emitted by th e generation of average system power Lebanon Methane and Mack Services have agreed to price the transactions so that a reasonable profit is made while selling at a price that enables mos t congregations to save as much as off the price they would pay for mostl y coal and nuclear generation from PECO Adding more small renewable generators and additional congregations may expand this project in the future Allegheny Energy joining PJM Allegheny Energy operating in Pennsylvania western Maryland and West Virginia must by October th inform FERC and the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission PUC about which Regional Transmission Organization or Independent System Operator that it will join Important legislators like Rep Tulli and key regulators like the PUC have been sending the unmistakable message that Allegheny Energy would be well advised to join PJM Last month on the verge of briefing the PUC about its ISO plans Allegheny Energy was told not to come to Harrisburg unless it was going to give two thumbs up on PJM No car from Hagerstown MD headed northeast tha t day If Allegheny Energy does become part of PJM Duquesne Light would likely follow suit Expanding PJM to cover western Pennsylvania is vital to Pennsylvanias economy and future Encouragingly officials in Harrisbur g increasingly understand the importance and urgency of this matter Hopefully Allegheny Energy also understands the determination to ensure that PJM expands to include western Pennsylvania Trouble blowing in the wind Recently Allegheny Energy was asked to provide the same energy scheduling treatment for a proposed wind farm in Fayette County that is accorded to a similar wind farm now operating in neighboring Garrett Somerset County T he Garrett wind farm is located within PJM and its need for scheduling treatment that reflects the intermittent nature of wind power has been accommodated by GPU and PJM Allegheny Energy refused to provide the same treatment given to the Garrett facility and as a result has certainly delayed the project and put at risk the income to farmers local tax revenues good jobs and clean energy which the nearly megawatt wind farm would create The primary reasons Allegheny Energy gave for its refusal wer e that its control area is too small and that it lacks a liquid spot market Guess what Both problems would vanish if Allegheny Energy joins PJM The only glimmer of hope for avoiding an unfortunate regulatory fight is that Allegheny Energy said it would discuss this matter further after October th Lets hope for all concerned that the ides of October bring glad tidings Duquesne POLR II collaborative to begin October The recent decision by the Pennsylvania PUC to send the Duquesne POLR II proceeding to a collaborative commences with the first session October t h The collaborative is expected to wrap up in November At stake is the most ambitious and successful retail choice transition of any EGS in the US see E Vol No Sept The Duquesne plan would increase prese nt shopping credits by on a system average basis as well as provide a system average and residential rate cut for customers whether or not they are shopping Between the rate cut and savings from shopping residential customers may be able to reduce their rates by when compar ed to those in effect prior to competition Among a host of other issues parties to the collaborative are now raising the issue of Duquesnes membership in PJM Presumably if Duquesnes transmission assets are moved into PJM then Orions generation bundle will also be in PJM If Allegheny and First Energy were to join PJM Duquesnes membership in PJM would brin g all Pennsylvania generation mWs into the same ISO GPUFirst Energy merger In another ISOrelated decision First Energy part of the flawed Alliance ISO filing will file their merger plans with FERC and the Pennsylvania PUC this month First Energy as a possible Alliance member is not slated to join a fully functioning ISO for some time The GPU merger gives First Energy a chance to join PJM This would expand PJMs geographic coverag e to Toledo Ohio Whatever the reason for First Energys delay in joining P JM it is not for lack of cash flow or merger synergies First Energys presentation to Wall Street on the GPU merger notes that in their previous merger s Ohio EdisonCenterior union First Energy promised synergie s of billion and states that it has already delivered million with millionyear in annual recurring savings The presentation tells only half the story First Energys promise to the Ohio PUC in that merger was to join a functioning ISO That promise now can be kept with First Energy joining PJM Little known fact about PECO shopping credits A recent analysis of seven churches in the PECO service territory showed that because of usage variations and the demand factor charge shopping credits ranged from to centskWh Looks like a good opportunity for savings in green power ICAP update As high as mWday this past summers ICAP prices were due substantially to delisting of capacity resources for sale into neighborin g power pools The delisting of capacity resources can explain why ICAP prices skyrocketed this summer when daily energy prices were lower than expected as were yearahead energy prices in the forward market The impa ct of delisting on prices and reliability was discussed in a recent PJM Futu re Adequacy Working Group FAWG meeting where it was revealed that delisti ng could have presented a problem had demand in PJM been consistently high Despite the FAWG acronym even with a northJersey accent there is no clou d in this groups direction Most forwardlooking participants expect that t he delisting market maneuver will be limited by a requirement that ICAP be bi d once or twice a year with a daily market for changes in ICAP responsibility This way if a generation owner decides to delist his resource to chase higher energy prices in other markets the owner foregoe s ICAP for a full year or most of the year if the commitment period is semiannual as opposed to annual Beyond this fix for next summer we predict that the FAWG will embrace the elimination of ICAP for Ecubed is available for reprint in newspapers and other publications

in the energy market October Vol No North By Southwest Allegheny joins PJM others to follow In the s Horace Greeley urged a generation to go West One hundred sixty years later thanks to the cooperation of Allegheny Energy PJM is expanding westward and increasing the likelihood that a wholesale electricity market that is liquid transparent and genuinely competitive will stake a claim in western Pennsylvania and beyond On October th Allegheny Energy and PJM agreed to develop PJM West a separate entity that should spur reform and substantial expansion of the original PJM PJM West will not utilize the discredited Installed Capacity ICAP rules now employed by PJM On ICAP the biggest consumer ripoff in the wholesale electric marketplace PJM becomes a house divided and ICAP s days are numbered For this reason alone PJM West is a welcome sight on the horizon Initially PJM West will contain Allegheny Energys service territory wh ich includes parts of Pennsylvania Maryland West Virginia and Ohio But soon more control areas will follow Allegheny Energys trail and go West Serving the Pittsburgh area Duquesne Light Company is also actively considering joining PJM West In its October th filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC Duquesne states If Allegheny s memorandum of understanding with PJM results in Alleghenys affiliation with PJM Duquesne also will be contiguous with PJM In anticipation of that event Duquesne has commenced discussions with PJM to discuss the process by which PJM might admit Duquesne to PJMWest Although Duquesne states that it is also considering membership in the Alliance RTO we would bet the ranch that PJM West will become a reality an d that Duquesne will join it Moreover not far behind Allegheny Energy and Duquesne Light may well be First Energy and some other utilities that are now part of the Alliance RTO proposal Congratulations to Allegheny Energy for giving the people of its service territory access to the existing megawatt PJM wholesale market a market that is much more transparent liquid and competitive than its present control area In turn the successful integration of Allegheny Energy and Duquesne Light into the PJM market would effectively increase i t by about megawatts PJM West the proposal PJM and Allegheny Energys Memorandum of Understanding establishes a vi sion for PJM West Allegheny Energy and PJM will form an independent transmissi on company that will regain from PJM subject to FERC acceptance those operational and management functions that are needed for the successful operation of an independent transmission business PJM West will set up its own office and the PJM West Transmission Owners would transfer monitoring and functional control of their transmission systems to PJM It will also expand the PJM system management concepts beyond a single control area with the potential for a significantly larger energy market that could include Ohios First Energy Corp Allegheny will adopt PJMs market operations policies It will cede functional control of its transmission assets to PJM eliminate pancake d transmission rates utilize locational marginal pricing and work with the FERC and other regional RTOs to develop rate reciprocity agreements and a transitional rate structure that will be revenue neutral PJM will be the OASIS operator for PJM West Allegheny Energy will operate under the existing ECAR rules regarding operating reserve requirements reserve sharing and other operating standards and will work with PJM to develop a regime to ensure that PJM West receives full credit for its capacity anywhere within the PJM market ICAP will not be expanding into PJM West PJM will retain certain functions related to the operation of the energy market including the PJM market congestion management protocol and marke t monitoring responsibilities Allegheny Energy will freely participate in th e PJM energy market including the necessary wholesale price cap By providi ng access to PJMs energy market PJM West may also give Allegheny Energy a means of meeting the scheduling needs of several proposed wind farms in it s control areas and avoiding an unfortunate regulatory battle see Electricitys Oktoberfest Trouble blowing in the wind PennFut ures E Vol No Oct In what is hopefully just a politically necessary fig leaf the Memorandum of Understanding states that Allegheny Energy will remain a distinct contro l area from PJM The purpose of this language is not clear and appears inconsistent with the whole purpose of PJM This point needs clarification and bears watching The timeline set out in the agreement includes negotiation for a definitive contract to be completed by February execution prior to March and implementation by December PJM West unravels Alliance The rise of PJM West spells the demise of the marketbalkanizing Alliance RTO proposal With its proven record of competency and governance independence PJM offers a much better vehicle for bringing RTO services t o the service territories that would be served with the untested unknown Alliance start up To us the only certainty about the Alliance proposal i s that it will create one otherwise avoidable transmission rate tollbooth an d constrain the size of the wholesale market With the alternative of PJM West FERC and state utility commissions should now use their authority to shoot down the Alliance RTO proposal Placing RT O conditions that protect the public interest on the proposed merger of First Energy and GPU would be a good start down that road First Energy should be given no choice but to leave the Alliance and join PJM at least if they wa nt to merge with GPU First Energy itself has reportedly signaled to its Alliance partners that the merger with GPU comes before the Alliance First Energys departure from the Alliance RTO the principal strategic purpose of which appears to be keeping its member utilities out of PJM and the Midwest ISO and to fracture the wholesale market between Philadelphia and Chicago would help unravel that counterproductive proposal and have several benefits All of Orions generation that was purchased from Duq uesne and still serves Duquesnes customers would be within one RTO Converse ly if First Energy were to remain in the Alliance some of Orions generat ion would be located in the Alliance and some in PJM West assuming Duquesne joins PJM West Requiring First Energy to join PJM West would not only de al with that seams issue but would also further expand the size and liquidit y of the wholesale market in the eastern United States First Energys ISO games While the agreement between Allegheny and PJM paves the way for Duquesne t o join PJM what about PennPower the subsidiary of First Energy that serves some suburbs of Pittsburgh and up to the New Castle area of the Commonwealth Is there any hope for PennPower customers or worse might First Energy try to balkanize PJM by taking GPU out of PJM Moving GPU out of PJM would be the electric utility equivalent of suggesti ng that one of the states should secede from the Union and join Mexico Ye t First Energy may well have planned to remove GPU from PJM and collapse it into the Alliance or simply a larger First Energy Such a bold move would undoubtedly be vigorously opposed by the Pennsylvania and New Jersey Publi c Utility Commissions The state commissions have great leverage while the merger is pending but once the merger is approved the state commissions power to protect the public interest diminishes Moreover as a result of the Centerior and Fir st Energy merger First Energy has a track record with RTOs and mergers that does not inspire confidence It brings to mind the saying Fool me onc e shame on you fool me twice shame on me Consequently the only way to make sure that First Energy will not remove GPU from PJM is for the commissions of Pennsylvania and New Jersey to craft a set of conditions on the merger that make any such decision impossibly painful Those conditions must also be effectively securitized by the equivalent of a liquidated damages clause that would compensate Pennsylvan ia and New Jersey were First Energy subsequently to renege on its agreement n ot to withdraw GPU from PJM The public interest must be guaranteed With the creation of PJM West by Allegheny Energy and PJM it can and should Ecubed

current themes and trends in the energy market June Vol No A Rock and a Hard Place Today the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission PUC voted to appro ve a settlementproposed by FirstEnergy GPU the Office of Consumer Advoc ate the Industrial Intervenor groups and PennFutureto resolve the FirstEnergyGPU merger and provider of last resort rate increase requests The PUC was faced with a seemingly intractable choice grant a rate increa se that violates the rate cap and risk unraveling every utility rate cap and stranded cost recovery decision in Pennsylvania or just saying no and riskaccording to GPUcreating a financially unstable distribution u tility In approving the settlement the PUC resolved the thorny issues raised by the cases without excusing GPUs failure to adequately plan its provide r of last resort service Considering the circumstances the result is good for consumers the companies and the environment But while Pennsylvania PUC approval was a major hurdle the New Jersey Boa rd of Public Utilities must still approve the merger as well and such approv al is anything but a sure thing Now that the PUC has made its decision lets break through the rhetori c assess the real issues in the proceeding and see how the settlement addresses them The Problem No matter who you are how you look at it or who you might blame the fundamental problem in this case is that GPU divested its generating asset s in and failed to protect its shareholders and customers from the possibility of rising wholesale prices In fact wholesale prices did rise the retail generation rate caps remained intact no competitive default service was established and GPU had insufficient longterm or lowerprice d generation contracts in place Alone among Pennsylvanias major utiliti es GPU was spending much more to buy wholesale generation than it was paid to sell that generation to its native load customers The real problem then was that GPU was running out of cash or credit to bu y wholesale generation to meet its obligations Although the company as a whole continued to fare well financially it became clear only towards the end of the proceedings that the Commission and the public interest require d a solution which would enable GPU to continue to deliver provider of last resort generation service and to do so without breaking the rate caps If the Commission didnt find a solution by June GPU could have been fr ozen out of the capital markets and would have come back to the Commission for emergency rate reliefrequiring a whole new set of proceedings concerni ng the same facts The Solution The preferred solution was to merge GPU and FirstEnergy and to establish a n accounting deferral for GPU energy costs The merger is a good solution in part because it overcomes the cash flow necessary to buy generation on the market Any cash generated by a modest rate increase trickles in over time and is of secondary importance so any modest rate increase wasnt goin g to solve the problem FirstEnergy a huge generation owner can provide some of the needed generationeven at market priceswithout requiring the GP U utilities to pay cash on time With a merged company there is plenty of room for internal accounting flexibility And as a huge wholesale generation player FirstEnergy can also better manage wholesale purchasing The deferral is a good solution too because the rate caps remain intact Consumers wont pay more for electricity Finally GPU will be able to reenter the capital markets and although they are given a lifeline G PU shareholders are not taken off the hook for the companys past performa nce Thus on May the Commission approved the merger itself and allow ed GPU to establish deferral of generation expenses for accounting purposes The issues to be addressed in the settlement as directed by the Commissio n in its Order concerned passing on mergerrelated benefits to consumers an d GPUs generation costs Todays settlement addresses these directive s by extending the distribution rate cap from through rather than violating the generation rate caps providing a mechanism for GPU to write off andor recover its generation expenses from existing revenues over time establishing a demandside response program to minimize future generation expenses for the company and all consumers and committing the company to contribute million now to the GPU Sustainable Development Funds and invest another million in renewable energy projects How the Deferral Accounting Works The deferral provisions allow GPU to retain unrecovered generation costs o n its books until but doesnt require GPU consumers to pay more as a result The rate caps are left intact Some excess generation costs will be reduced on the companys books if future energy prices decrease sufficiently The settlement also increases the shopping credit modestly while correspondingly reducing the Competitive Transition Charge CTC so some of the possible excess generation costs also may be recovered from existing C TC revenue which otherwise would have been applied against company stranded costs Doing so does not increase consumer payments however because the GPU Restructuring Settlement allowed CTC collection to continue as lo ng as in order to take into account the unknown level of nonutility generation NUG costs and divestiture proceeds that were a major portion o f total GPU stranded costs The settlement cuts off CTC collection for GPU in rather than permitting CTC collection from Met Ed customers to continue until as long as Best current estimates are that the Met Ed CTC would have continued to about Now any stranded costs not recovered by must be written off reducing consumer payment of stranded costs This will provide a modest improvement in the opportunity to shop and for a competitive mark et to develop Any remaining excess generation costs must be written off by The settlement also redefines the way that NUG stranded costs are calculated Under the Restructuring Settlement the amount by which N UG payments exceed the market value capped rate are stranded costs As change d only the portion of a NUG payment that exceeds the higher of the capped ra te or the market price is recoverable as stranded costs This change corrects what turned out to be an inaccurate assumption that the market price of generation would always be below the capped rate but it does not affect NU G contracts in any way The NUGs still get whatever they are entitled to unde r their contracts without changes and even benefit because their payor will become the financially stronger merged FirstEnergy instead of GPU The Benefits The primary and crucial benefit to the consumer is that provider of last resort generation service will continue within capped rates The primary benefit to the company is that the deferral accounting allows the company maximum flexibility to recover costs and to write off unrecovered costs But perhaps the most important aspect of the settlement is that it establishes a firm commitment and mechanism for FirstEnergy to address the underlying problem by reducing its exposure to high energy costs with a comprehensive demand side response program While the details of the progra m remain to be developed the company commitment includes an effort to maximize the costeffective reduction of peak load through interva l and timeofuse metering appliance control technologies and open architecture Its goals are to include participation by all customer classes and competitive suppliers and to be available by next summer If no program agreement is reached all parties may address the issues in a future Commission proceeding The other environmental benefits are real if not as comprehensive as one might have preferred FirstEnergy will give million in company money to the GPU Sustainable Development Funds within days This contribution is in addition to those already made by GPU but replaces the centskwh o f GPU ratepayer money that might have been provided between and IF the Commission did not change distribution rates by that time FirstEnergy in consultation with PennFuture will also invest an addition al million in renewable energy Like all provisions of the settlement th e environmental provisions are subject to PUC oversight What the Settlement Does Not Do First the settlement does not really resolve what would happen in the eve nt that the merger falls throughif for example the New Jersey BPU rejec ts the merger All of the agreements would be tossed except the agreement to deal with the deferral account for generation costs authorized by the Commission on May GPU would write off all generation costs prior to Ju ne while it would recover the costs incurred after June in a manner and at a time to be determined in Commission proceedings Nothing i n this provision assumes a rate increase or breaking the rate caps For example the costs could be recovered in a manner comparable to the deferr al accounting in the event that the merger is completed The settlement also does not allow FirstEnergy to raid any pension funds Federal law and union contracts govern pension plan funding and tolerate some withdrawals with major tax penalties GPU unions support the settlement The settlement does not shut down or clean up all of FirstEnergys foss il generation plants or figure out how to safely eliminate FirstEnergys nuclear waste Finally the settlement does not establish lower competitive wholesale and retail market prices in the FirstEnergy and GPU territories or jump start the competitive market Yeah that would have been nice too Ecubed is available for reprint in newspapers and other publications Authors are available for print or broadcast PennFuture wwwpennfutureorg with

current themes and trends in the energy market July Vol No Market Lessons from Schools still out for summer but just as the new and improved Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC issued a watershed RTO decision last week which could lead to substantial expansion of PJM into the Northeast P JM s State of the Market Report contains some interesting information an d lessons for us After the California experience demonized spot electricity markets it wou ld surprise many that PJMs spot energy market was a bargain Spot pr ices in were below per megawatthour MWh or three cents per kilowatthour kWh percent of the hours in the year The single highest hourly price was per MWh or cents per kWh but prices reached or exceeded per MWh during only hours in the entire year download charts on our website by typing wwwpennfutureorgitemshourlypricechartspdf in your browser By contrast California experienced spot prices that often exceeded per MWh for most of the last months Authored by the PJM Market Monitoring Unit but likely reviewed and ed ited by top PJM management the Report delivered to FERC concludes that all of the markets operated by PJM were reasonably competitive It cautions however that there are potential threats to competition in the energy capacity and regulation markets that require ongoing scrutiny and in some cases may require action in order to maintain competition Market participants do possess some ability to exercise market power under certain conditions in PJM markets In order to maintain and improve the functioning of the PJM markets the Report recommends Retention of the MWh bid cap in the PJM energy market and investigation of other rule changes to reduce incentives to exercise marke t power Retention of the mw bid cap in the PJM regulation market Evaluation of additional actions to increase demandside responsiveness to price in both energy and capacity markets Modification of incentives in the capacity market to require all Load Serving Entities LSEs to meet their obligations to serve load on a longerterm basis and require all capacity resources to be offered on a comparable longerterm basis The Report uses several analytical methods to reach these recommendations and conclusions including looking at the net revenue for generation from all sources the increase in bid amount over marginal cost market concentration as measured using the HHI index and lastly an analysis of the resulting prices See Spot go to market Perhaps the Reports most intriguing information on price trends concer ns the spot energy market where average prices declined by percent from levels Driven by lower peak prices in the most expensive hours o f the year the average locational marginal price LMP in was p er MWh cents per kWh falling from the average of per MWh cents per kWh This average price decline in the spot market was more significant because it occurred even though fuel costs were sharply higher in Indeed the average fueladjusted LMP in declined to per MWh or percent from the price of per MWh And when one compares spot market prices to competitive future prices for the year and to regulated rates for generation it becomes clear that spot market prices in were significantly lower than future contracts Even with appropriate price adjustments to facilitate comparison they were also much lower than regulated residential generation rates for all hours charged by Pennsylvanias six major elec tric utilities which ranged from about dollars to dollars per MWh or to cents per kWh The lesson Spot market prices which received so much bad publicity as a result of th e California fiasco can be a bargain and customers who are able to manage their demand to reduce or avoid the hours of high spot prices can reap maj or savings by purchasing electricity from the spot market In fact spot market prices in were below most of Pennsylvanias shopping credits or prices to compare Thats saying something since th e shopping credits in turn are as much as cents per kWh less than the regulated rate for just generation paid by customers to the monopoly utilities But Since spot market prices in were well below both the generation rate paid to monopolies and the much lower shopping credits why were ener gy suppliers increasingly unable to offer electricity at prices below the shopping credits ICAP pricing and reliance by electricity suppliers on higher priced future or forward market contracts supply most of the answer The spot market gives a good indication of what the forward markets should be under typical circumstances As the data below indicate the average sp ot market price for all market locations in was MWh almost percent less than during and more than percent lower upon adjusti ng for higher year fuel prices PJM LoadWeighted Average LMP MWh Change Average LMP Median LMP Standard Deviation Average Fuel Adjusted LMP Median Fuel Adjusted LMP Standard Deviation While the dramatically lower standard deviation in indicates that prices were much less volatile than in there remained a substantial gap between average and median prices indicating that extreme prices durin g a small number of hours continued to substantially skew overall average prices Grading on a curve The PJM price duration curves measuring the percent of time prices were at or below a particular level tell an interesting story As one wou ld expect with higher fuel prices especially for natural gas the general trend was for prices to be slightly higher during periods where natural ga s was the marginal fuel For approximately percent of all hours energy prices were more expensive than in Yet with relatively low peak demand the price for the most expensive percent of demand during was considerably lower in than in accounting for the entir e percent average reduction in prices from If not for the reduced prices for the most expensive percent of demand overall prices for likely would have risen approximately percent over due largely to higher fuel costs For these reasons the Report recommendation to evaluate additional actions to increase demandside responsiveness is SEVERELY understated PJ M and all consumers have an essential interest in implementing demandside response programs to the maximum economic level with dramatic implication s for saving individual consumers money improving system reliability keepi ng market prices lower for everyone and improving market competitiveness Can everyone say ICAP So with the lower wholesale energy prices and plenty of supply why did th e retail market sputter Installed capacity ICAP price increases are a partial explanation In addition to energy the controversial charge for ICAP is the other significant cost born by electricity consumers within PJM ICAP represents a call option on physical generation resources by PJM during system emergencies All LSEs are required to purchase an amount of installed capacity equivalent to their customers peak load contribution plus an adequate reserve margin currently percent But although it exists for reliability purposes PJM curtailed the export of energy outside PJM from PJMcommitted installed capacity on only one day during Logically the price for installed capacity like the price of energy mig ht have been expected to decrease during Yet that didnt occur As ener gy prices decreased within PJM they remained high or continued to increase i n surrounding control areas Higher prices in the surrounding markets led so me generation owners to delist their generation committed to PJM in order to sell out to other control areas without the risk of being curtailed by PJM The result was an increase in ICAP prices from an average of in to in The increase was concentrated over the summer with pric es in the daily markets rising to or more for most of June July and August The increase in ICAP prices raised the cost of supplying many reta il customers by about cent per kWh The Market Monitoring Unit concluded th at the price spikes over the summer months were a direct result of the opportunity cost associated with the prices in neighboring control areas But the Reports finding that the ICAP market was reasonably competiti ve seems inconsistent with PJMs conclusion last year that the ICAP m arket performed so poorly that it needed a major overhaul This inconsistency raises questions about the reasonableness of that portion of the Repo rt or giving the ICAP market the PJM seal of approval PJM has invested substantial time and resources since last summer in an extensive stakeholder process to revise its ICAP rules especially concerning the allocation of deficiency revenues and the interval over whic h ICAP is purchased But since the reformed ICAP market began operating onl y recently on July its too soon to know whether it is functioning well or competitively We remain skeptical that the PJM prescription cures the disease or is merely life support for a dying program See Spot offer lower prices Apart from the ICAP market the differing prices in forward and spot marke ts provide substantial explanations for why electricity suppliers have found it easy to beat the regulated generation rate for most utilities but difficult or even impossible to beat the lower shopping credits Shopping credit D regulated generation rate stranded generation cost Prior to the summer season prices in the forward markets before anyone kn ew how mild the weather was going to be substantially reflected the highpriced experience of Because of the high prices in energy that was purchased through forward markets about percent of all en ergy was considerably more expensive than the spot prices turned out to be Since customers often prefer to lock in a price in advance competitive suppliers generally didnt want to provide fixed prices below the retail shopping credits If suppliers had relied on the spot market they could have offered lower prices Also customers who can reduce or shift demand may well benefit from purchasing more power from the spot market Recent developments Both in the East and West coast markets this week electricity in daily trading has been near its low for the week period Several developments are pushing down the price of wholesale electricity Mild weather falling gas prices new generation coming online increasing demand response and conservation as well as a FERC which understands that competition must exi st prior to price deregulation are all pushing prices lower Moreover forwa rd market prices for within PJM are beginning to fall and are under downward price pressure The new downward trend in forward markets partially results from moderate prices this summer even during high demand periods with prices generally staying under MWh kWh A good example of this was July a relatively hot day with significant demand which saw prices reach per MWh for one hour but average per MWh for all onpeak hours Whats driving forward prices lower More efficient generation being installed below btukWh as opposed t o btukWh More ICAP in the market new capacity estimated at over MW with load growth at only percent or MW More demandresponsive load in the form of additional MW of Active Loa d Management The addition of PJM West slated for with lower prices generally Lower natural gas prices falling from mmBtu in July to mmBtu as of July This good news which suggests that retail customers in late or may again see retail competitive offers below the Pennsylvania shopping credits must be weighed against the troubled ICAP market ICAP remains an anachronism ICAP prices have not returned to competitive levels and remain one of the significant obstacles to serving retail customers The forward prices for ICAP alone have remained above percent of the typical shoppi ng credit Yet even in the world of ICAP there is hope ICAP prices may be beginning to soften in the face of a substantial amount of new generation that is comin g online and increased demand response from customers PJM has instituted bo th an emergency and an economic demandresponse program through which more customers can respond to prices and reduce the price that all customers pa y for electricity Tomorrows homework The State of the Market Report contains plenty of data which confirms that PJM is the countrys bestrun independent system operator and best tho ugh still flawed wholesale market Prices in the spot energy market were well below regulated generation rates even with appropriate adjustments But none of this warrants complacency Only when PJM becomes the first market to give consumers the tools they need to change their demand for electricity will the wholesale and retail markets within PJM be FULLY as opposed to reasonably competitive A link to download in pdf the PJM MMU Report can be found on the Intern et at marketmonitoringreportshtml Ecubed is available for

in the energy market November Vol No Pennsylvanias First Successful CDS Auction An important new regulatory skirmish has broken out before the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission PUC over which company has won the right to provide default generation service to customers of PECO Energy an Exelon Company This skirmish is actually good news for consumers and is t he fruit of the PECO Energy restructuring settlement agreement a landma rk document that ended a ferocious regulatory war when all combatants signed it The peace treaty includes a requirement that PECO Energy bid out de fault service for of its customers and PECO has done so Green Mountain Energy Company is now challenging PECO Energys decision that New Power won the auction to provide the settlements mandated default service Both Green Mountain and New Power are offering those consumers sma ll rate reductions compared to customers receiving default service from PECO and more electricity generated from renewable energy resources Specifically New Power and Green Mountain are offering generation service to Rate R residential customers for approximately cents per kilowatthour That offer is cents per kilowatthour less than PECO Energys unbundled generation and transmission rate of cents per kilowatthour and cents per kilowatthour less than the shopping cred it of The consumer savings that these offers represent is masked or reduced by t he stranded cost payments that consumers must pay PECO Energy Indeed were it not for stranded cost payments the New Power and Green Mountain offers would reduce total bills by about cents per kilowatthour or The dispute between New Power and Green Mountain is noteworthy because it proves that companies will compete vigorously to provide default service if shopping credits and lengths of contracts are set at reasonable levels It also shows that renewable energy portfolio standards can be met economically Finally the result of this case will switch more customers to competitive suppliers in one day than the total number who switched in California over a period of nearly three years When the PUC anoints New Power or Green Mountain as the winner if all consumers opt to stay with the CDS provider the total number of customers in Pennsylvania that will be served by a competitive supplier wil l jump to more than Of this total will be residential customers of PECO a number equal to of the PECO residential class CDS Background In Pennsylvania there must always be a default sup plier or provider of last resort to assure that service is always availab le to all customers The incumbent utility is the default supplier unless the P UC decides otherwise The default supplier must provide generation service to customers who do not have a competitive supplier either because they chose not to shop or did not find a willing supplier at an acceptable price The PECO Restructuring Case Settlement initially defined CDS service in paragraph On January of all of PECOs residential customers determined by random selection including lowincome and inabilitytopay customers and without regard to whether such customers are obtaining generation service from an EGS shall be assigned to a provider of last resortdefault supplier other than PECO that will be selected on the basis of a Commissionapproved energy and capacity market price bidding process This service shall be referred to as Competitive Default Service CDS The same approach was used in the other Settlements in the GPU PPL and APS restructuring cases CDS reflects an effort to assure that there is at leas t one other large competitor in each market CDS also has a renewable portfolio standard RPS even though there is no RPS for regulated utilities in Pennsylvania The winning bidder must supply of its offered energy supply for CDS service from renewable r esources of solar wind sustainable biomass including landfill gas but excluding incineration of Municipal Solid Waste geothermal or ocean power The renewable energy increment shall increase by annual increments of thereafter This increasing renewable requirement continues indefinitely meaning that in year four of the CDS there will be a renewable requirement in year five and so on This is significant as each extra percent of renewab le energy used to serve the customer block prevents approximately tons of NOx tons of SO and tons of CO from being emitted by fossil fuel burning power plants PECOs CDS RFP Importantly the PECOUnicom merger case modified the CD S bidding process as established by the settlement Of particular note the revisions eliminated the customer care functions from CDS mad e the contract three years long to help spread out return of startup costs and instituted several rounds of selection in the event that prior efforts yielded no successful CDS contract PECO issued its initial RFP for CDS on April and Shell Energy Services submitted the only bid However the PUC rejected the bid as nonconforming and denied Shells Petition for Reconsideration of its decision Pursuant to the modifications in the merger settlement PECO entered into bilateral negotiations based on an August RFP Three suppliers submitted conforming bids and PECO selected New Power as the winner on October New Power is the new competitive supplier actively marketing residential and small commercial customers in the PECO service territory and is backed by Enron AOL and IBM PECO and New Power negotiated a complete contract that is before the PUC f or approval on November Under the proposal PECO and New Power expanded the size of the CDS requirement to include of nonshopping residential customers instead of of all residential customers whether shopping or not This change was designed to implement paragraph of the Restructuring Settlement requiring adjustments to the numbers assigned to CDS in order to have of all PECO residential and commercial customers obtaining competitive generation as of January There also will be a second round of assignment of nonshopping customers as of October if New Power is providing CDS to fewer than of all PECO residential customers New Power electricity will be renewable in renewable in and renewable in as required but does not include a commitment to exceed the requirements or provide cleaner power for the nonrenewable portion of the product The price for New Powers CDS for Rate R customers would be below the shopping credit while residential heating customers on Rate RH would pay less than their shopping credit For a Rate R customer this would mean that overall rates would fall as energy and transmission falls from to for Rate RH rates would fall Customers assigned to CDS may still choose any competitive supplier or opt out and retain defau lt service from PECO without penalty or charge New Power will be able to off er its full slate of energy and nonenergy related products to these customer s Green Mountain asserts that approval of the PECONew Power contract is not in the public interest arguing that PECO ignored Green Mountains o ffer that included CDS pricing below the shopping credit for all residential customers including those on residential heating or offpeak service Lik e the New Power proposal the Green Mountain proposal would lower Rate R and RH rates and respectively Green Mountain asserts that the New Power rate cut for Rate R is only and not and argues that its product is better for the environment because the nonrenewable portion of the product would come from natural gas and hydro instead of system power generated primarily from coal and nuclear fuels If not declared the winni ng bidder Green Mountain proposes in the alternative that both they and New Power receive CDS contracts In response PECO states that all three bidders had the opportunity to submit revised bids and that the Green Mountain revised bid was not submitted until October days after the deadline and nine days after the selection of New Power as the winning bidder The PUC will sort out the facts and arguments on November Some think th at the PUC may very well split the customer block between Green Mountain and New Power Whatever the result customers in the Philadelphia area should receive yet another small price reduction more renewable energy and the opportunity f or a more competitive electricity market

in the energy market November Vol No No Pardon for this Turkey In Pennsylvania had the fourth dirtiest air in the nation For years Governor Ridge and Secretary Seif of the Department of Environmental Protection DEP have blamed power plants in Ohio for the Commonwealth s dirty air which damages our environment our economy and most importantl y the public health of Pennsylvanians But now the Governor DEP and most directly the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission PUC have the chance to apply Pennsylvania law to a major polluter of Pennsylvanias environmen t FirstEnergy of Ohio Having for years spewed soot and smogcausing pollution across the OhioPennsylvania border particularly victimizing Pittsburgh and western Pennsylvania FirstEnergy has come before the PUC in search of an official stamp of approval for its proposed merger with GPU Our officials should make it clear this merger wont just be rubberstamped They must hold this outofstate polluter accountable by ensuring that the price of merger approval is real benefits for consumers competition and the environment Since the August announcement of the proposed merger we have hoped that FirstEnergy would recognize the harm it has caused and have the grace to propose real concessions that would protect the public interest Silly us Last weeks merger Application filing by FirstEnergy proposes nothi ng that would benefit consumers or undo its damage to Pennsylvanias environment FirstEnergy apparently believes that it is still in Ohio where it is an pound political gorilla which gets all the bananas Perhaps with the he lp of GPUs political influence it thinks it has the same command here Pennsylvanians will soon see on whose side are our state officials The stakes are high and involve life and death According to a recent study air pollution from power plants specific ally fine particles resulting from emissions of nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide kills more than Americans each year nearly twice as m any as die from drunken driving accidents or homicides This study ranks Ohio second in the nation with annual deaths from health problems attributed to power plants Only Pennsylvania with deaths had more In total FirstEnergys plants are among the nations worst air pollu ters In FirstEnergy power plants pumped into the air over tons of SO and tons of NOx newsindexssfnewspdwpowerhtml as well a s million tons of CO a principal cause of global warming It alone is responsible for approximately and respectively of Ohio utilities SO CO and NOx emissions FirstEnergys sole fossil fuel plan t in Pennsylvania Bruce Mansfield contributes approximately and of all of Pennsylvania power plant SO CO and NOx emissions Not surprisingly given that record in November the United States Department of Justice and EPA brought suit against FirstEnergy subsidiaries Ohio Edison and Pennsylvania Power charging that modifications at the Sammis Plant in Jefferson County Ohio violated the Clean Air Act According to the United States the defendants made improvements at each o f the seven units at Sammis without applying required pollution control technology that would have sharply reduced emissions of nitrogen oxides sulfur dioxide and particulate matter Reducing these emissions would significantly reduce public health threats and environmental effects including acid rain and smog There should be no merger approval unless FirstEnergy agrees to clean up Sammis and settles this suit as Virginia Electric Power recently resolved a similar case The Turkey is Served The FirstEnergyGPU merger Application acknowledges that the PA PUC may approve the merger only if the commission shall find or determine that the granting of such certificate is necessary or proper for the service accommodation convenience or safety of the public Yet the proposal does not attempt to show that the merger would provide any specific public benefits Rather it attempts to put a spin on the requirement arguing th at the merger wont cause any harm because it wont change things very much The merger proposal itself places the companies between a rock and a hard place in gaining PUC approval The transaction represents the acquisition o f the GPU holding company by the FirstEnergy holding company The individual public utilities that are holdingcompany subsidiaries Met Ed Penele c and PennPower in Pennsylvania will continue to operate as they have without corporate or operational changes But the Public Utility Code does not allow PUC approval based on the wellbeing of the holding companies involved or their unregulated businesses Neither does the Code allow PUC approval based on the absence of significant harm to public service The proposal does however claim that the merger would provide substantial strategic company benefits and is expected to enhance FirstEnergys cash flow and earnings per share But for consumers the best the companies can muster is a vague claim that the larger company will be financially stronge r and more profitable and that the several regionally operated utilities wil l be able to share best practices It may be obvious to FirstEnergy that a bigger more profitable company is good for the company and its shareholders and therefore whats good for the shareholders is good for public service But these are not truths that we hold selfevident Before the PUC approves the merger it must be given affirmative reasons concerning the public benefit to do so Recently the PUC approved the PECOUnicom merger settlement which provid ed a long list of additional public benefits As modified from PECOs init ial proposal the PECOUnicom merger puts substantial muscle and dollars into rate cuts service improvements cleaner air affordable service for low income customers improving the competitiveness of the electricity market and many other identifiable tangible public benefits See Ecubed of Apri l Vol No Slicing the Turkey There are ways in which the merger could provide public benefits Lets look at the key benefits outlined in the merger proposal and briefly co nsider whether they provide a basis for public benefits and if not how they could FirstEnergy Becomes Big The merger would create the nations sixth largest investorowned electric system based on number of customers Bigger is not inherently better for consumers In fact it could make thin gs worse for consumers Access to the Wholesale Electric Market The companies point out that FirstEnergy would have the largest customer base in the PJM Power Pool and its customer base in the state region that FirstEnergy has targeted for growth would double How will that benefit consumers in Pennsylvania There are ways discussed below but FirstEnergy doesnt seem to have identified them let alone m ade any commitment Transmission System Integration The companies identify that joining their contiguous transmission and distribution systems provides the basis for wholesale market opportunities and that the companies intend to keep GPU in PJM GPU is currently part of PJM the most effective ISO in the nation FirstEnergy is not a part of any functioning ISO In fact the Application affirms that FirstEnergy continues to hold onto hopes that the Alliance RTO will become operational although there is no basis at this time to expect that it will become a fully functioning ISO which would serve the market a nd consumers as required The merged companies would not be able to integrate their transmission systems serving the public interest and obtaining the companies anticipated wholesale market benefits unless FirstEnergy jo ins PJM FirstEnergy has no viable nearterm alternative to joining PJM And the recent announcement that APS will join and create PJMWest precludes any attempt to argue to the contrary Neither wholesale nor retail competition can work without a fully functioning ISO to ensure that the wholesale electric market is workably competitive the power supply is reliable and consumers are protected fro m anticompetitive market manipulation If FirstEnergy were to join PJM it would expand the size of the market in which electricity could be freely traded benefiting FirstEnergy its customers and all consumers within the PJM market from New Jersey to the Indiana state line The Application also states that the companies intend that GPU will remain in PJM but includes no firm commitment If GPU were pulled out of PJM th e merger would be categorically contrary to the public interest no matter what other benefits might be provided In order for the merger to provide public benefits it cannot be approved without an ironclad requirement that GPU will remain in PJM and that FirstEnergy will join Solve GPUs POLR Disaster The proposal vaguely suggests that the me rger may help contribute to meeting GPUs provideroflastresort requirement s for electricity customers in its Pennsylvania and New Jersey service areas GPU made its POLR bed and should be made to lie in it The rate cap is a promise that cannot be broken and is a consumer right that exists with or without this merger it is not a merger benefit Expanding customer opportunities to shop and demandside response should be a major part of the plan to reduce company POLR exposure FirstEnergy shoul d commit to deploying realtime meters and appliance control technology which would empower customers to save money by changing their demand in response to market prices Selling FirstEnergy Generation in the PJM Market The companies emphasi ze the important wholesale market opportunity to sell MW of generation capacity in the east FirstEnergy cannot improve on its present ability to sell into the PJM market without first joining PJM Additionally expanding the PJM market can make it much more competitive a nd provide public benefits but there must be strong and specific commitments to improve competitive market conditions clean up FirstEnergys dirty power plants and substantially expand the availability of cleaner renewable generation Expand Unregulated Business Opportunities The proposal identifies increased market and growth opportunities for FirstEnergys natural gas resources and both companies mechanical contracting and construction telecommunications and eprocurement resources That may well be a benefit of the merger to the companies and their shareholders but it has nothing to do with public service or merger approval If anything unregulated business growth and profits up the ante for providing more regulated business savings and other benefits to consumers Merger Savings The proposal vaguely argues merger savings but presents only a crude estimate of million that are expected to come from the elimination of duplicative activities improved operating efficiencies mo re efficient use of generation assets and the combination of the companies work forces Only a portion of such savings would be from regulated service in Pennsylvania If the merger wont provide real opportunities for cost savings the companies have a heavy burden to demonstrate why not and to provide other ways in which the merger will provide alternative public benefits For example FirstEnergy claims that its creation in upon the merger of Ohio Edison and Centerior already has delivered million of the promis ed billion in savings with million in annual recurring savings And cost savings should mean rate cuts the most basic consumer benefit from a utility merger but the proposal promises nothing Therefore th e merger must not be approved unless a substantial portion of economic benefits are shared with consumers or provide other public benefits Other key points The proposal states that the companies will maintain separate utility operations and seek to minimize the effects of workforce reductions through hiring limits attrition and separation programs and honoring all labor agreements Wow What a commitment to their workers and our communities The only specific commitment made is to retain GPU charitable giving levels for thr ee years Even that represents a lack of immediate harm not a public benefit What would actually happen in Reading and Johnstown Were Still Hungry The FirstEnergyGPU merger as proposed will not be in the public interest and should not be approved The PUC must make consumer savings service improvements more competitive choices cleaner energy and similar public service gains the requirements for merger approval And the PUC must ensur e improved demandside response opportunities and a more competitive wholesa le and retail market by compelling First Energy to join PJM That is the very least that should be expected and the very least that FirstEnergy owes the people and

current themes and trends in the energy market December Vol No Demand Sides Promise The coldest days of the year are when wholesale electricity prices are amo ng their highest and when the risks of blackouts are greatest least welcome and even dangerous On these days frequently around the holidays our electric system and wallets are stressed to the limit As energy demand surges prices in the wholesale electric market skyrocket with price caps serving as the only limits to the pricing power of wholesale suppliers An d as more electricity is generated old fossil fuel power plants emit more a nd more pollution into our environment At the other extreme the hottest days of the year present the same scenario often with the added designation of being the smoggiest days Sometimes the smog caused in part by the sun heating up pollutants emi tted from power plants is so bad that people are advised to stay indoors a nd thousands with respiratory illness crowd emergency rooms across the nation Yet we could all breathe easier save money and worry less about our pow er going out if many more consumers were given the opportunity to change the ir electric usage in response to escalating prices and to profit from doing so In electric restructuring vocabulary demandside response is typically used to describe these consumer actions to reduce or shift their electric usage in response to changes in prices For years encouraging demand reduction or energy efficiency has been the holy grail for the environmental community because many of our country s most pressing environmental and public health problems cannot be solved if the nation simply guzzles ever more dirty power But these days the case for fostering demandside response has never been stronger and there is a n emerging consensus that goes well beyond the environmental community about the importance of increasing demandside response More and more experts now agree that empowering consumers to modify their electricity usage in response to price will powerfully address the triple threat of pollution high electric bills and rolling blackouts all of which are now plaguing California Indeed electric restructuring in California or any other state will not be complete until consumers are abl e to modify their usage in response to realtime prices But while greater demandside response would deliver numerous benefits to consumers the economy system reliability and the environment most electric markets presently provide far too few opportunities even wit hin Pennsylvania and PJM where retail and wholesale electricity competition have been the most successful Therefore as the next crucial stage in its electricity restructuring Pennsylvania and PJM must now lead the way in creating policies and market mechanisms to increase opportunities for demandside response Encouragingly both the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission PUC wher e Commissioner Fitzpatrick sponsored a November st conference on the subject and PJMs management understand the stakes DemandSide Benefits A legitimate demandside market would serve as a check on high prices in t he hourly and forward PJM energy markets PJMs Market Monitoring Unit calculates that a percent reduction in demand during peak periods about mW can reduce market prices by about percent Empowering customers to participate in the demandside market limits wholesale and retail price s impacting the forward market and making the retail market more competitive In addition a demandside response reduction of mW would enable PJM to once again retain its onedayinten reliability standard an historic reliability benchmark which has been put at risk due to the offsystem sale s of generators this past summer The Technology Three types of technologies are required to achieve mW of reliable demandside participation Each is readily available and more importantly pays for itself Yet not enough of these technologies are being installed in homes and businesses to safeguard the public interest Remote appliance controls These controls enable a consumer to voluntarily curtail hisher electric usage during peak periods in exchange for an economic benefit For example in its On Call program FPL installs an energy management device in consumers homes connecting it to one or mo re qualifying appliances Through this program FPL pays consumers up to per year in credits on their electric bills More than FPL custome rs are currently participating Here in PJM BGE pays residential consumers per summer month for installing an Energy Saver Switch on their central air conditioners During periods of high demand for electricity BGE sends a radio signal which activates the switch cycling the compressor in minute increments More than BGE residential customers currently use the Energy Saver Switch and help BGE manage summer peak load Consumers who choose to similarly cycle their electric water heater receive an additional credi t per summer month Also in PJM PEPCOs mWsized kilowatchers plus program off ers participants about year for the right to remotely cycle hours of residential air conditioning In another example The Allegheny Electric Cooperative in Pennsylvania remotely switches air conditioners and water heaters from a central location in downtown Harrisburg For most consumers in these programs its money in the bank without noticeable impact These programs demonstrate that many small consumers wan t the opportunity to voluntary save money in return for agreeing to brief interruptions of selected appliances and that its fairly simple to pro vide the technology and operate the program The Pennsylvania PUC and other state Commissions should encourage and if necessary direct jurisdictional EDCs to offer remote appliance devices to consumers Its not difficult to imagine that if remote appliance devic es were implemented throughout PJM mW of small commercial and residential remotely cycled load could be bid in a demandside market Metering SetTop Devices or Advanced Metering Advanced metering or meteri ng settop devices register load decrements enabling consumers andor their suppliers to sell firm power into the peak market instead of using it Fo r example a supplier either the local utility or a competitive supplier could offer a lower price to a large consumer willing to reduce usage durin g peak load enabling the supplier to sell a relatively small amount of electricity to those requiring firm service during the peak load The consumer need not agree to limit usage except upon specific approval Already Duquesne and soon PECO Energy will have deployed advanced metering systemwide demonstrating that it can be economic even without the benefi ts of demandside response There are also various devices or meter addons that modify existing meters and allow recording of load decrements see for example wwwstonewatersoftwarecom These devices or meter addons appear to pay for themselves when the energy is sold during periods when prices are abov e the price the consumer is paying the EDC The need to ensure reliability in PJM combined with the current availability of technology to enable demandside participation by all consumers dictate that by all Pennsylvania customers should be equipped with a metering or appliance control device Internetbased Energy Management Platforms Computer software is necessary to maximize the effectiveness of advanced metering Programs have already been developed and used by major international corporations which enable them to make precise decisions on when to sell power back into the market decrease usage and use onsite generation BGE for one recently announce d deployment of the OmniLink platform wwwpowerwebtechnologiescomnewshtm DemandSide Barriers There are no inherent obstacles to obtaining the benefits of demandside responses but there are several important commitments necessary to make t he promise of demandside market participation a reality PJM and other ISOs as well as utilities and suppliers must all be able to offer demandside platforms without discrimination In addition PJM and other ISOs have the direct responsibility to manage system reliability and the wholesale energy market Demandside responses directly impact reliability and wholesale market prices including undesirable market powe r during peak load There can be no doubt that ISOs have an inherent role indeed an inherent responsibility to maximize the effective deployment of demandside market responses especially to offer a platform for LSEs to sell load decrements created in response to price signals PJM is on board but consumers who want to sell directly into the PJM demandside market fa ce opposition from some EDCs To unlock the potential of demandside markets the Pennsylvania PUC other state commissions and the FERC must support the role of PJM and other ISOs in creating such a market PJM must be permitted and encouraged to offer a demandside platform Finally EDCs must be required to fully deploy advanced metering and remote appliance control programs These small but important public policies will help to protect the reliability

downloaded in pdf format under the Pressroom Publications section of our website wwwpennfutureorg by clicking on the Reports button August Vol No On the Watch for Icebergs The voyage The real danger for Pennsylvania in observing Californias illfated approach to electric restructuring is that it tempts smugness to which Pennsylvania could easily fall prey since it has chartered a different a nd so far much more successful path from monopoly to competition Pennsylvan ia primarily differs from California by its sincere commitment to create genuinely competitive retail markets While many states say that they want competition and have even passed laws that supposedly require it only Pennsylvania and a handful of other states have matched their words with procompetition policies To deliver on its commitment of a genuinely competitive retail market the Commonwealth is implementing unique and specific policies that should give customers real choices and break the dominance of incumbent utilities Amon g Pennsylvanias more notable transition measures are much higher shopping credits rejection of accelerated stranded cost recovery longer transition periods competitive default service for a portion of the nonshopping load and retail rate caps that continue until at least and as late as But despite the different route taken this is no time for smugness Pennsylvania must be alert and learn from but not follow Californias wak e On electric policy Californias ship of state has sailed like the Titanic ignoring warnings of icebergs ahead while maintaining high speed on the open sea The national press of course flocks to cover news of the shipwreck As always bad news is more dramatic therefore judged to be the better story than the good news of Pennsylvanias success Unfortunately the nation as a whole may draw the incorrect lesson from Californias voyage that electric restructuring is unsafe at any speed or on any course That would be as erroneous an assumption as deciding based on the Titanics illfated voyage that ocean travel is too dangerous Calm waters now but dangers ahead Pennsylvania however would be just as incorrect to conclude that its successful first three years and ten months of transition means no more icebergs lie ahead At least two big obstacles are now visible First the wholesale market in western Pennsylvania is not genuinely competitive primarily because no Independent System Operator ISO covers the regions utility service territories The absence of a competitive transparent and liquid wholesale market in western Pennsylvania creates a major threat to the success of retail competition there Taking strong action now to require that Allegheny Energy Duquesne Light and Pennsylvania Power join the already functioning PJM Independent System Operator will keep the transition on course in western Pennsylvania Second throughout Pennsylvania there is now inadequate demandside response to market prices This problem partly results from too little deployment of timeofuse meters uncertainty about terms for competitive access to those timeofuse meters that are deployed and too little use o f available appliance control technology In order to give customers more control over their bills and to limit wholesale market price spikes customers must be able to change their demand in response to wholesale prices Even though the poor state of the wholesale market in Western Pennsylvania and the limited demandside response to price are substantial difficulties Pennsylvanias success may cause us to ignore their presence Since Pennsylvania began its transition to retail electric competition on January the Commonwealth has built the most successful retail mark et in the nation and possibly the world According to the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue see wwwrevenuestatepaus electric competitio n has saved consumers billion and will create new jobs by An d since January customers have chosen a competitive supplie r even though high wholesale market prices this summer encouraged some most ly larger customers to return to their utility Despite those difficulties more customers have switched to a new supplier in Pennsylvania than in the rest of the nation combined An incredible percent of Duquesne Lights residential customers have switched Allegheny Energys innovative municip al aggregation program and Duquesne Lights transition policies deserve much praise for this result Equally noteworthy are the approximately customers that have purchased cleaner or renewable energy products mainly thanks to the green trailblazing by GreenMountaincom Of course GreenMountaincom is not alone in the marketplace More compani es are actively competing for accounts in Pennsylvania than in any other stat e New Internet retailers of electricity and other products like Utilitycom and OnlineChoice have entered the market Just yesterday The New Power Company a joint venture of Enron AOL and IBM announced it had entered t he PECO Energy service territory and guaranteed residential customers savings up to on the electricity portion of the bill Between traditional suppliers Internet retailers and green marketers sufficient market entry has occurred to make competition intense at times In the PECO Energy market as many as suppliers at one time have competed for residential customers In this competitive intensity built megawatts of new generation within the PJM power pool By PJM expects another megawatts to be generated mainly from natural gas power plants which are to cleaner in emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide than many coal plants Renewable energy technologies will provide the remaining new suppl y that does not come from natural gas Indeed the year ushered in Pennsylvanias first two operating wind energy farms Both wind farms were financed as a result of successful marketing of renewable energy products to retail customers primarily by GreenMountaincom with a helping hand from Community Energy Inc The Green Mountain megawatt wind farm in Somerset County is one of the largest ea st of the Mississippi Through their purchases of renewable energy and cleaner energy products Pennsylvanias families and businesses are acting powerfully to change t he electricity industry and to reduce smog acid rain and emission of global warming gases Switching to renewable energy products to power their homes and businesses is the single most effective thing Pennsylvanians can do to clean their environment Every residential customer that switches to a renewable product on average prevents an amount of pollution that is equivalent to not driving miles taking cars off the road or planting trees All this is indeed a remarkable record of success of which Pennsylvania should be proud But to avoid peril Pennsylvanias policymakers must quickly identify the icebergs ahead continue forward at a safe speed and change course as needed Proceeding in this sensible fashion is easier because Pennsylvania began as early as January its journey into competition By beginning early Pennsylvania could opt for a steady transition pace and transition periods that are long enough to allow the development of genuinely competitive wholesale and retail markets before fully ending rate regulation of generation The transition to full generation price deregulation will last until at least and as long as in the various service territories While allowing utilities to recover approved stranded costs Pennsylvania generally has not accelerated stranded cost recovery To balance stranded cost payments to utilities electric rates offered by those utilities are capped Utilities transmission and distribution rates are capped at Ja nuary levels until December in PPL GPU and probably Duquesne until December in Allegheny Energy and until Dec in PE CO Energy Generation rates of utilities are also capped The generation rate caps la st at least until and as long as Specifically generation rates are capped in Duquesne until December December in Allegheny Energy December in PPL and December in PECO Energy and GPU The rates are normally capped at January levels until a t which point the rate cap period continues with modest increases allowed during the remainder of it Avoiding the obstacles Although this rate of speed is sensible Pennsylvania must make an immedia te course correction to ensure that by the service territories and customers of Allegheny Energy Duquesne Light Company and Pennsylvania Power are served by PJM an effective approved Independent System Ope rator ISO that now serves twothirds of Pennsylvania Presently Allegheny Duquesne and Penn Power are not part of any ISO and the absence of an ISO makes it impossible to build healthy competitive wholesale and retail markets in those regions To repeat neither wholesale nor retail competition can work if all service territories in Pennsylvania are not part of an ISO The ISO ensures that th e wholesale electric market is workably competitive the power supply is reliable and consumers are protected from anticompetitive market manipulation Presently the wholesale market in western Pennsylvania is not genuinely competitive The poor state of wholesale competition exists because its utilities are not part of an ISO that would expand the size of the market i n which electricity could be freely traded The Duquesne service territory in particular would have more choices and possibly lower prices were it part of a viable ISO At this point the only viable ISO that Allegheny Duquesne Light and Penn Power could join is PJM Yet no progress in requiring Allegheny and Duques ne to join PJM has been made since when the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission PUC made membership in PJM or an effective ISO a condition of the proposed AlleghenyDuquesne merger When the merger plans collapsed ISO membership and expansion of PJM disappeared from the radar screen However it is PennFutures understanding that Chairman Quain has put PJM expansion back on the PUCs agenda If so he is doing the right thing PennFuture knows that APS and Duquesne Light in part due to Chairman Quains prodding will soon decide whether they will voluntarily join PJM Indeed we believe that Duquesne Light would like to become a PJM member but needs Allegheny to join as well for Duquesnes customers to gain the full benefits of PJM membership In order to expand into western Pennsylvania PJM itself must remove a barrier by abolishing its installed capacity ICAP rule Allegheny Duquesne and Penn Power have never adopted PJMs peculiar ICAP rule O f course without ICAP the western Pennsylvania utilities have operated as reliably or more so than the existing PJM utilities PJM expansion would b e the final nail in the ICAP coffin yet another benefit of expanding PJM The recently announced proposed merger between First Energy and GPU creates another chapter in the PJM tale GPU is part of PJM First Energy is not Therein lies the seed of a possibly disastrous conflict The First Energy and GPU merger will not be in the public interest and not be approved unle ss more competitive choices more consumer savings more clean energy or mor e demandside response is added or without ironclad commitments that GPU will remain within PJM and that First Energy will join PJM Given the uncertain outcome of the ongoing informal discussions about the expansion of PJM Pennsylvanias officials need to let all concerned know that if they do not join PJM voluntarily they will be ordered to do so The PUC may be able to do this with existing authority If not the Pennsylvania General Assembly must act The second iceberg that lies in Pennsylvanias path to electric transition is enabling first larger customers and eventually all consumers to change their electric usage in response to market prices All consumers must be given the ability to alter their demand in real time and before they get their electricity bills They must be immediately empowered in this way a nd prior to the expiration of generation rate caps Enabling retail consumers to change demand in response to market prices wi ll powerfully limit wholesale and retail prices The market monitoring unit of PJM calculates that a percent reduction about mW in demand can reduce market prices by about centskWh Customerdetermined demand modification and reduction is vital to protecting consumers businesse s and families from unreasonable price spikes Increasing the ability of consumers to change demand in response to price also offers environmental benefits from reduced emissions of pollutants from power plants Empowering consumers to change their demand in response to price requires installation of advanced meters that record usage hourly and appliance control technology Equipment that allows the remote resetting of thermostats is now available and should be made widely available to consumers So far few if any competitive suppliers are offering meterin g services Market forces have not been sufficient to universally deploy timeofuse meters though Duquesne and PECO Energy should be complimented for widely deploying the technology in their service territories PennFuture therefore recommends that Pennsylvania require the installati on of advanced meters by January for all commercial and industrial customers with demand greater than kW By all customers must have their usage recorded by an advanced meter The distribution utilities shou ld install meters for consumers who are not offered advanced meters by competitive suppliers Given the investments already made by Duquesne and PECO Energy this recommendation is not onerous and it is achievable As important as installing timeofuse meters is ensuring reasonable access to those meters by all market participants Competitive suppliers when serving customers should be allowed to lease the use of any timeofuse meters that have been deployed Terms for leasing must be reasonable and allow the offering of competitive power products that allow customers to decide whether and how to change their usage Other recommendations In addition to expanding PJM to western Pennsylvania and increasing demandside response to market prices PennFuture recommends that a summit of the Pennsylvania Congressional delegation be convened so that it may pu sh for comprehensive federal legislation that would remove barriers to wholesale competition and cleaner energy on a national level Pennsylvania has a lot at stake in ensuring that national markets are competitive and cleaner Unfortunately restructuring legislation is now in the grips of Washington gridlock The Pennsylvania delegation can play an important rol e in fashioning national markets that help Pennsylvania steer clear of icebergs We further recommend that PJM or the PUC investigate whether its auction rules for the hourly spot market promote healthy wholesale competition Questions have been raised about whether the existing rules that allow the last unit dispatched to set the price of the whole pool are susceptible to anticompetitive strategic bidding This matter is complicated and importan t It should be considered carefully The best means of doing so is to create a formal process that allows all concerned parties an opportunity to comment Either PJM of the PUC should create this opportunity Finally the recent Pennsylvania Department of Revenue study provides ample reason to repeal the Revenue Neutral Reconciliation RNR surcharge to the electricity Gross Receipts Tax GRT The RNR shrinks the purchasing power of the shopping credit and produces uncertainty in yeartoyear supplier offers because the RNR changes each year to make up a deficit in direct electricity tax revenues to the General Fund According to the Department of Revenue by fiscal year sales tax and personal income tax gains alon e from electric competition are estimated to be over million Given that an additional million in state tax revenues would reduce the RNR rate by one mill and that the decision on whether to eliminate the RNR will be ma de in the Legislature should consider phasing out the RNR at this time PennFuture believes that making these course corrections will avoid the icebergs that lie ahead and continue Pennsylvanias

concerning the current themes and trends in the energy market September Vol No Straight to the Source Last year when PECO Energy and Unicom merged to form Exelon it was big news Importantly the merger settlement provided million to fund the development of renewable energy in Pennsylvania This year the companys wholesale trading and marketing unit Power Team presented renewable energy advocates with a big surprise signing longterm contracts to purchase the output of three new wind farms in Pennsylvania These contracts were not required as part of the merger settlement and are not included in the million earmarked for renewable energy funding Now a key force in renewable energy development in the East the Power Team contracts are essential to bringing MW of generation online from these new wind farms two of which will be operational next month The MW Mill Run wind farm is scheduled to being operation next week and the MW Somerset wind farm is scheduled to begin commercial operation the following week Mike Freeman the Power Team trader who made the burgeoning wind energy business in Pennsylvania possible gave us some insight into Exelons renewable energy commitment as well as how wind energy can be integrated into Americas power grids Whats in Power Teams renewable portfolio We have MW of hydro that is not pumped storage MW of wind MW of landfill methane MW of Municipal Solid Waste MW of wood waste and MW of scrap tires All of the wind is Greene certifiable as new resources All of the landfill methane is qualified under Greene but only MW is new generation Of the hydro all of the generation is in larger projects that have been or are eligible for certification under the lowimpact hydro standards The MSW and tire projects are not qualified under Greene but the biomass plant is Why is Power Team developing a renewable portfolio There were two principal reasons a perceived demand for renewable energy products in the wholesale marketplace and a desire to diversify our portfolio from the perspectives of fuel emissions and cost Was there internal resistance or other issues to overcome I think the initial reaction was that renewable projects would be a very minor sidelight to our overall business I dont think many people paid attention to the implications of renewable portfolio standards or external corporate mandates for renewable purchases Part of the handsoff approach was due to I believe a sense that renewable products only meant the repackaging of existing generation not changing the power system in any way Over time I think many people got comfortable with the idea that the creation of products potentially could initiate new projects that would change the power system For me thats the most important part of our participation to help encourage new development I also think that management began to get comfortable with the idea that renewable energy products could be profitable and that demand for these products could be sustaining Will this encourage new development Generators get a creditworthy counterparty that is not only willing to buy all of the energy at the generator location but is also willing to talk about additional new projects Over time other market intermediaries such as power marketers and retail suppliers may become interested in doing the same If this chain of events occurs I think we may even see renewable credits traded over the counter just like other energy products now How do renewables fit into Power Teams overall business strategy We are a growth company and are constantly in search of ways to sensibly increase our overall generating portfolio So bringing on new renewable generation into our supply mix really is part of that overall strategy More specifically we believe there is sustainable demand for renewable energy not only because of mandates such as renewable portfolio standards but also because of natural demand The average person may not think of it this way but in supporting the idea of paying a premium for renewable energy I think that people implicitly are accepting the notion that renewable energy is an essential component of how we as a country intend to manage our future energy requirements Why Wind Theres no question that the momentum for wind projects began to build as a result of the PECO restructuring and merger settlements under which PECO provided funds for new wind projects A second reason is that the forward electric markets began a steep upward climb beginning in and especially the offpeak power market beginning in and continuing into this year A third reason was the rapid increase in electric demand in the last five years and a realization that we need to develop a wideranging set of answers to meeting the demand including supplyside and demandside solutions We felt that wind generation could play a role on the supply side while meeting what seems to be a growing demand for renewable sources What are the primary financial considerations for a wind deal The first is probably the need for a longterm contract Wind generators typically want to enter into fixedprice longterm agreements to make it easier and cheaper to borrow money and to provide a stable revenue source over a long period We dont have a problem with longterm deals per se although we do want to emphasize diversity in our contracting as well We dont want to hold multiple longterm agreements and nothing else In my discussions with generators so far there has been some flexibility on contract length In fact our willingness to enter into a longterm contract is perhaps the key ingredient to getting a wind project financed and built Beyond the longterm contract the wind developers want to do business with a creditworthy company that has an investmentgrade rating Exelon Generation is rated A by SP so we are a natural counterparty for project financing Right now there are not very many long term buyers out there with the kind of creditworthiness that we have Will that always will be the case No If were right about longlasting demand I think other large companies including distribution companies will participate in the purchase of energy from these projects Weve teamed up with a retail marketer Community Energy to stimulate demand and market wind energy in ways that will move companies to buy it In the development of conventional generation it is not always necessary to enter into year agreements for a project to get built For example a developer may want to hedge off a portion of the output on a longterm basis but will be willing to sell the rest of the output for shorter periods And in some cases the financing source may be comfortable with a shorterterm agreement for the whole thing Is there a financial advantage for wind If ones view is that the future value of energy is higher than the present value a generation source with no fuel risk obviously is good to have Wind has one key advantage over other resources perpetual availability without any fuel costs or price volatility This helps mitigate the other risks that wind does present It is of course difficult to predict what will happen even in the near term But I am a believer in broad trends or cycles that are relatively easier to project outside of significant advances in technology Over a long period of time or years I think the probability of fixedprice wind energy riding out the low cycles while providing a greater amount of benefits in the high cycles is higher than the opposite I do believe that the demand for wind generation will be sustained at a moderate premium over generic electricity prices for the next to years Is it difficult to integrate wind into your portfolio With conventional generation and firm transmission paths a power marketing entity such as Power Team can bring its resources to the highest markets whether they are hourly daily monthly or longer Such transactions are supported by a complex communications network that notifies transmission providers of the timing amount and ultimate sink of expected output The contracts that we enter into on conventional generators depend to a great extent on economic structures that ensure as much as possible that the generator will fulfill our dispatch schedule as close to of the time as possible so we can avoid the punitive imbalance fees that transmission providers impose when delivered energy doesnt match scheduled energy The approach we take on wind generation must be quite different because wind plants provide intermittent output that is difficult to predict within reasonable boundaries of accuracy I think the serious wind developers know we are serious about incorporating wind energy into our portfolio Were one of the biggest physical movers of power in the country and have a significant amount of assets that must count for something in terms of our ability to more easily integrate a MW wind project into our overall mix How does intermittent generation add complexity A wind farm generates electricity when the wind blows not when you flip the switch on It takes a lot more than I expected to accommodate intermittency even for an experienced organization like ours because the transmission system and the operational rules and procedures were not developed with wind generation in mind You dont have the ability to give transmission providers realtime information for purposes of regulating the system between supply and demand In PJM where generators can offer increments of generation on a dayahead or realtime basis and receive or pay marketclearing prices depending on actual generation wind energy can be offered into the system in one of several different ways without experiencing significant imbalance penalties An obstacle and were working with PJM on this right now is that PJM as the transmission provider typically requires no shorter than minute notice when selfscheduled or mustrun generators expect to produce electricity or expect to stop producing electricity For purposes of regulating the system PJM then has the ability to tell the selfscheduled generator to go ahead and generate or to hold off until the energy is needed as a result of the realtime balance of supply and demand This will not be practical with wind generation Wed literally have to assign a trader to the task of monitoring highly suspect expected output from our wind plants and then calling PJM every hour to determine what to do In the mustrun scenario wed still have to notify PJM of expected output so PJM can regulate the system with other generators Either way wed have to predict output which is a dicey proposition Does that make wind generation unreliable Not at all Weve got excellent modeling to predict the output from wind generation over a longer period of time such as a full year Those predictions underlie our contracts But its another thing to tell the wind when to blow The wind energy industry is working on this from the perspective of improved wind forecasting and a more automated approach than what Ive described In PJM a MW system this may not seem to be a problem when there is only about MW of wind generation in the system right now but PJM wants to institute market rules that will be appropriate for a larger amount of wind generation when it arrives A certain magnitude of wind generation will cause PJM to change the way it now regulates the system The complexity cannot be underestimated and we will be part of the solution How can scheduling and other rules better accommodate intermittent resources like wind An alternative is for the transmission provider to model the output from a wind plant as negative load instead of generation Which is to say when the plant is generating electricity the system load will be reduced by the amount the plant is generating When the plant is not generating the load will increase A tradeoff of that approach is that load typically pays ancillary services expenses such as regulation and spinning reserve In this unique circumstance which of the ancillary services apply to negative load and at what level Were working with PJM on these questions Im uncertain whether a significant amount of socalled negative load will require any kind of realtime notice to the transmission provider Of course the transmission systems are operated to react to the unpredictability of load and one can view the unpredictability of wind generation in the same way Other countries and the western US transmission systems have figured out how to handle large amounts of wind generation and so can we Are you working on other approaches Another possibility is to dynamically schedule the output from a wind plant that is situated in a control area without a realtime energy market to a control area that does have such a market The output signal from the plant would be available to the transmission provider in the second control area on an automated basis The output then becomes part of available supply from moment to moment However notice requirements would not be sidestepped with this approach Will PJM resolve these problems Yes PJM is progressive and innovative and has indicated to us that they are willing to work with us to find solutions to the schedulingimbalance issue Its hard now because were breaking new ground I expect that it will be much easier for the next projects developed How big might your renewable portfolio get Will you keep signing more contracts for new projects As long as we continue to see demand for renewable energy well continue to look at projects where there are energy markets whose longterm forward economics support the purchase of energy Id like to aggregate a significant amount of wind generation in a single market such as PJM to be able to provide PJM with a more diversified supply curve with multiple projects it may be possible to smooth the output We need to do business with companies that have the financing and the organizational will to get these projects completed We are looking to form relationships with companies that we can build on If we execute a contract successfully wed like to apply the same concepts to additional projects with the same company Examples of that are Atlantic Renewable Energy Corp and National Wind Power What are some key developments to make the industry grow faster We need technological efficiencies to drive down the cost of the equipment standardized approaches to the transmission of wind generation financial innovations to allow more risksharing and hybrid approaches such as wind and energy storage Perhaps most importantly we need consumers to buy the wind energy Ecubed is available for reprint in newspapers and other

publication concerning the current themes and trends in the energy market If you have trouble rea ding this email please see the document on our website wwwpennfutureorg under Pressroom Publications August Vol No A Cool Heat Wave From August to August record peak electricity demand driven by a swel tering heat wave severely tested the reliability of the competitive PJM mar ket The PJM market passed its stress test with little public notice or cre dit As usual only ships that sink or planes that crash draw headlines With airconditioners battling near degree temperatures consumers set three new peak usage records on August and with demand hitting megawatts MW MW and MW respectively These new recor ds smashed the old peak of approximately MW set in a and contr ibuted to unhealthy air in large parts of the MidAtlantic region They als o highlight the need to enact better demand response programs and energy ef ficiency policies in order to reduce the strain placed on power supplies as well as to protect the environment and public health The ability of the PJM competitive market to meet record demands and keep c onsumers cool sharply contrast with Californias inability to keep the ligh ts on even in periods of lowseasonal usage from late through March of this year Speaking of PJMs impressive reliability performance PJM Presi dent Phil Harris concluded This weeks accomplishment is testimony to how effective markets and efficient operations work in harmony to reliably ser ve the electric customer But keeping the lights on should never be taken for granted Prior to restructuring in January rolling blackouts occurred through out the PJM power pool when demand for about MW couldnt be met The se blackouts occurred primarily because huge numbers of plants which were rate based and operated by fully regulated monopolies or nonutility genera tors with PURPA contracts experienced mechanical and fuel problems at the same time This painful experience ensured that policymakers made reliability a top pr iority and a major topic of discussion when enacting the states Electricit y Competition and Customer Choice Act in asking questions like would a competitive market attract sufficient investment to build necessary plan ts Would existing plants perform better or worse and experience less or mo re outages Could consumers be paid market prices to reduce demand at peak usage times in order to increase incentives for energy conservation The last five years and meeting record peaks both in and answer t hose questions and prove the reliability of the competitive PJM market The market is producing lots of new generation most of it new natural gas pl ants and some wind power and all of it much cleaner than the coal and nucl ear plants which dominated the generation market more than years ago Pl ants in PJM have never operated better and have reduced their forced outage rate by about percent since Additionally a few customers partici pated in PJMs emerging demand response programs during the August hea t wave But many more customers would reduce usage in peak periods in return for ma rketbased compensation if they only had the ability Though demand respons e has its nose under the generation tent it still hasnt reached most Penn sylvanians Neither Pennsylvania nor any other state has taken policy steps to ensure that a necessary infrastructure of timeofuse meters and applia nce control devices is deployed throughout every home and business a failu re which amounts to regulatory malpractice Until the Pennsylvania Public U tility Commission requires the deployment of these available technologies o ver a reasonable period prices for electricity will remain higher than the y need be pollution will be worse than it should be and reliability will be less than it could be Keeping the lights on During the recent heat wave PJM encouraged general restraint in usage imp lemented its demand response programs and reduced voltage by percent to percent for brief periods undetectable to most customers Beyond not fa iling the system performed so well in large part because of the competitiv e market not despite it Several factors worked to maintain system reliabi lity including better power plant performance new generation imports sk illful management of the operation of the transmission system and demand re sponse Improved Generation Plant Operation Of all these factors dramatically bet ter plant performance is the single biggest key to competitive PJMs impre ssive reliability performance during the last five years Generating plants are operating much more reliably now than during the monopoly era In the forced outage rate at PJM generation plants was percent meaning that a plant scheduled to be available was in fact unavailable for operati onal reasons percent of the time The forced outage rate of generating facilities in PJM declined to percent in percent in percent in and to percent in In when you really nee ded a generator there was a in chance that the unit wouldnt be availa ble But in the odds that a generator would be forced out of service at any particular time had fallen to in Under price regulation generators for the most part got paid even if their plants were unavailable to generate electricity because of operational or maintenance problems With the move to marketbased prices generators have a builtin incentive to be there especially when demand and prices are hi gh Even the PJM capacity payment still a relic of ratebased generation has moved from a payment simply because a plant was physically built to one based upon the generating units historical availability to provide gen eration when needed The decline in unforced outage rates is a testament to the change in how generators get paid At the percent average for ced outage rate about MW would have been unavailable at the p ercent average forced outage rate for more than MW would have b een unavailable Every generation owner deserves credit for this superb per formance New Generation Another reason the lights are staying on despite record pea ks is the new generation built to serve the MidAtlantic market The develo pment of competitive power plants continues to accelerate in PJM with over MW scheduled to come online in and even more for In con trast demand in is expected to grow by less than MW The MidAtlantic experience documents that new generation can be supplied i n a competitive market The market is delivering plenty of new generation t hat is dramatically cleaner and more efficient than that built during the m onopoly era Transparent prices in a competitive efficient market are enco uraging investors to build Unlike the previous generations of power plants no captive monopoly consumer had to guarantee any investor in a new gener ation plant a single penny return of the investment or a single penny retur n on the investment Unlike many of the previous generation of power plants these new plants use mostly natural gas instead of coal or nuclear fuel cost billions less to build can be planned and built more quickly and don t pollute nearly as much And these plants will never receive a penny in s tranded costs Imports The PJM transparent competitive market sends price signals to gene rators in its territory to encourage them to build new supply and to keep their plants in service and available especially at peak demand as well as to national electricity markets especially in the Midwest and Virginia Peak demand and relatively high peak prices in PJM enabled PJM to benefit from surplus supplies in adjacent regions and import significant amounts o f electricity often over MW of net imports when it was needed mos t PJM Operations Properly managing the electric grid isnt an easy task on a typical day but during a heat wave its particularly challenging In Augu st PJM showed exceptional restraint and skill in managing a potential cris is without overreacting relying on the market and voluntary reductions whi le avoiding the more intrusive controls at their disposal The percent to percent reduced voltage levels for a few hours were the only nonvolunta ry reductions measures imperceptible to most consumers Demand Response PJM called upon industrial customers to curtail usage thro ugh traditional interruptible service in which large customers receive a di scounted rate in exchange for having service interrupted when supply is lim ited and requested that all customers especially large industrial custome rs voluntarily limit consumption and turn on onsite generation PJM also successfully utilized several new market based curtailment programs and e stimates that approximately MW of peak load was avoided through incent ive programs and implementation of its pilot demandside response program There was an increase of nearly MW of Active Load Management ALM whi ch accounted for a good portion of the demand response programs instituted by PJM Unlike the previous year ALM was not excluded from participating i n the PJM demand response programs Additionally about MW of nonALM re sources have enrolled in PJMs emergency and economic programs While this represents a humble start the effects during the peak hours can still be s ignificant Prices Peak demand produces peak prices in a competitive market but PJM m arket prices remained well under control because new development imports a nd plants in service provided adequate supply and because PJM has a market rule limiting bids to per MWh Average peak hour prices am to pm at the PJM western hub were about MWh In many hours prices remained less than MWh while during a few hours prices were constrain ed by the rate cap These peak prices are quite moderate compared to the extreme volatility that was seen in the Midwest in with prices r ising to several thousand dollars per MWh or the recent price spikes in Ca lifornia Indeed oneyear forward contract prices within PJM have collapsed since Ju ne and the August heat wave hasnt reversed the sharp declines An allhou rs PJM contract now can be had for about per MWh June July a nd August contracts have fallen percent from summer prices These forward prices are now reflecting the PJM spot market prices that fel l in compared to and have hovered around per MWh for the last months Both the PJM spot price and the forward contract price are up to percent less than what most Pennsylvania customers paid their mono polies for generation in If they were paying only competitive prices instead of competitive prices plus stranded costs primarily for nuclear plants every Pennsylvania customer would have a huge rate cut And the award goes to Congratulations to PJM and its staff for operating the PJM market reliably and competitively in the most difficult challenging circumstances it has f aced so far Their service to the public is unfortunately not widely recogn ized and is taken for granted Thanks as well to the plant operators who ha ve never operated their plants better and to those fortunate consumers who had the ability to participate in demand response programs and reduced thei r usage for compensation Public safety economic competitiveness consumer savings and environmenta l protection demand that all consumers not a fortunate few have the chanc e to save real money by

and inspiring Look for more details in your mailbox soon September Vol No Whats It Worth To You Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing Oscar Wilde Certainly too few consumers and policymakers understand the value of renewable energy products products that avoid the acid rain smog global warming and soot pollution caused by mainly coalburning power plants Perhaps with the removal of stranded cost charges from consumers bills next year the Duquesne Light service territory will be the first market where both price and value of renewable energy are understood and motivate large numbers of customers to buy see case studies that follow Moreover a new study published in the August edition of Science by Mark Z Jacobson and Gilbert M Masters of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Stanford University shows that the cost gap between coal power and the cheapest forms of renewable energy is narrowing sharply down to about cents per kilowatthour kWh Most importantly professors Jacobson and Masters document that the apparently slightly lower cost of coal generation is more illusion than reality due to its real costs When coal generations environmental and health costs like damage to air water and forests as well as human illness and death are included in the calculation coal generations real price jumps to about cents to cents per kWh By comparison the cents to cents cost of wind energy makes it a bargain Wind energy is unequivocally less expensive than is coal energy say Jacobson and Masters How Much Is That KilowattHour Its not surprising that few know the value of renewable energy products in electricity markets where many real pollution costs from burning fossil fuels are not included in the price of electricity and where many consumers still dont know the link between electricity generation and environmental and health damage Yet lack of knowledge goes beyond value in electricity markets Consumer inexperience with these markets and the complex transition to competition make electricity an exception to the rule that people know the price of everything Even sophisticated observers dont know the price of comparative products regardless of the added environmental and public health costs Price transparency is a bad joke because stranded cost charges make understanding price as easy as getting a clear view on a smoggy day in Houston In those states that allow customers to choose a generation supplier few consumers and policymakers know what their local utility charged for generation prior to competition including what are now called stranded costs Perhaps even fewer know how prices alone not including the stranded cost charges of todays competitive products compare to their utilities unbundled generation rates charged prior to competition Or how todays renewable energy prices compare to utilities precompetition generation rates And how many know how todays price to compare or default rate compares to the precompetition monopoly generation rate which includes stranded costs Confusion on these basic questions is widespread and distorts perception and policy It is vital for policymakers to know the answers in order to formulate wise policy see for answers Its All in the Numbers E Vol No But even thats only the foundation of what is perhaps a much tougher question about electricity What is it worth An important change that will affect the answer is on the horizon Beginning in February stranded cost charges will be eliminated from electric bills in the Pittsburgh area These are payments made to Duquesne primarily to cover its prior investments in uneconomic nuclear generation recovered from consumers through the Competitive Transition Charge CTC The following examples of typical types of customer bills in the Duquesne Light territory illustrate comparative prices at prerestructuring or present default rates the new default rates that will take effect next year and for various renewable energy products These examples will hopefully clear away some of the haze surrounding the true price of renewable products Residential Customers A typical residential customer rate RS using kWh per month has been paying Duquesne Light about per month since rates were capped in Of this monthly bill about is for total generation costs and the rest is for distribution services In turn more than of the total generation cost reflects stranded cost charges Since customer choice began all kWh residential customers including those choosing a competitive supplier have had to pay Duquesne the same for stranded costs If customers were not required to pay Duquesne for its stranded costs this typical customers total bill would be less than a whopping percent less than it is now As a result of stranded cost charges customers choosing a competitive supplier can only avoid paying Duquesne about of its generation rate where the reflects the shopping credit or price to compare that has been available So only if a customer could buy kWh per month for less than including transmission would she save money by switching to a competitive supplier As you can see stranded cost charges and the weird economics and pricing they produce make it difficult to know the price of electricity let alone the value of renewable generation If our typical residential consumer purchased renewable generation today for centskWh the consumer would pay for generation per month less than the historic regulated generation rate of At a rate of centskWh the same consumer would pay for renewable generation or per month less The price for renewable generation must be over centskWh for the consumer to pay more for it than what residential consumers paid their regulated utility for mostly coal and nuclear power There are presently four competitive suppliers offering five renewable energy products in Duquesnes territory three are Greene certified for prices ranging from cents to centskWh Renewable generation today costs substantially less than coal and nuclear generation did prior to competition Yet the stranded cost charge that a kWh renewable energy residential customer must pay in the Duquesne service territory has concealed not just the value of renewable energy but also its real price Until February a customer buying renewable generation for centskWh or less than the precompetition rate will still have a total bill including CTCs and distribution charges that is more than their current bill While many might find that more per month for cleaner energy and its associated benefits is still reasonable many more who are motivated by their wallets alone probably would not But a great opportunity is about to open up for renewable products as CTCs in the Duquesne Light territory are about to be eliminated While the Public Utility Commission still hasnt established what the new regulated rates will be it appears that a typical kWh per month customer who buys generation from DuquesneOrion will receive a rate reduction of about percent saving about per month However customers wont receive the full savings from the elimination of CTCs because a portion will cover the costs of Duquesnes integration into the PJMWest Independent System Operator But as soon as the stranded cost charges are removed a typical residential consumer could buy renewable energy products and pay less than what she paid for electricity under default rates and less than she paid in Both the price and value will then be motivating factors for buying renewable energy When the CTC is removed the residential customer using kWh per month will soon be able to use the savings to buy wind energy to serve onethird of hisher load for a total of or a savings of compared to todays default rate Even if the customer were to buy all of hisher electricity from one of the new wind farms being built in southwestern Pennsylvania the customer would pay less than more per month than she is currently paying for default generation If the customer chooses a blended product with both renewable and nonrenewable content for centskWh the monthly bill would be less than what it is today Even at a price of centskWh the monthly bill for a blended product would be less than per month more or only about more per year than the price currently paid for default service of mostly nuclear and dirty coalgenerated power The end of CTCs in Duquesnes territory will allow a residential customer to switch from traditional dirty generation to renewable generation and still save money or pay only pennies more Business and Institutional Customers The dollar impact for larger customers is somewhat higher but equally small in the context of total electricity bills or company budgets For example a small commercial customer on rate GSM such as a restaurant or convenience store using kWh per month and with a demand of kW has been paying per month for regulated or default service With elimination of the CTC and the PJMWest integration costs their bills will likely decrease about percent for a total monthly bill of about a savings of about per month A small commercial customer could use the savings to buy enough wind energy to meet percent of its load saving about per month compared to present bills and still paying less for electricity than in A large commercialindustrial customer on rate GL such as a large hotel hospital or a small college or manufacturer using million kWhmonth and a demand of kW has been paying about per month for regulated or default service With elimination of the CTC the bill will likely decrease about percent beginning around September for a total monthly bill of around a savings of about per month Those substantial savings could then be invested in purchasing renewable energy without increasing electricity bills above either current or levels For example a hospital could serve percent of its load with a blended product for centskWh and still save about per month compared to its current default bill Two hospitals could purchase the entire output of one of the new wind turbines in southwestern Pennsylvania to supply over percent of their total electricity requirements and still save about per month compared to their present bills Even if a single hospital purchased the output of an entire wind turbine enough to serve percent of its load the total additional cost of per month would be only about more per year than their current default bill For hospitals which must fight the devastating health effects of dirty coalgenerated power every day how much is that worth Municipal consumers on rate SM for street lighting using kWh per month have been paying per month for regulated and default electricity With elimination of the CTC the bill would decrease to but with the PJMWest transition costs the bill may decrease about percent for a total monthly bill of a savings of about per month About three municipal customers with that consumption level could join together to purchase the output of one of the new wind turbines in southwestern Pennsylvania to meet their entire electricity load and still save about per month each compared to their current default costs A single municipal customer could still save about per month compared to their current bill if they purchased a blended product at cents per kWh What is it worth What will renewable energy be worth to Pittsburghs families businesses institutions and governments Buying renewable is the single best thing any consumer can do to protect our environment and public health Its value is great and its price in Pittsburgh will become less distorted with the removal of stranded cost charges from consumers bills next year The savings of per month for a typical residential customer and much more for typical commercial industrial and municipal accounts gives Pittsburgh a great opportunity to become Americas first greenpowered city The price of that opportunity will cost less than what consumers paid for dirty power in or even what many are paying now The value of that opportunity is priceless Ecubed is available for reprint in newspapers and

Commission FERC ruled that the three N ortheastern ISOs the PennsylvaniaNew JerseyMaryland Independent System Operator PJM the New England ISO NEISO and the New York ISO NYISO should become a Regional Transmission Organization RTO some hoped that these birds of a feather would flock together After all PJM NEISO and N YISO are examples for the country teaching that RTOs are an essential cond ition for the creation of competitive wholesale markets The three ISOs als o individually oversee very small markets that are vulnerable to market pow er have higher than necessary transaction costs and other problems precis ely because of the scope of their individual markets Indeed even once all three markets are merged the combined market will account for less than percent of the nations generation All these factors would drive rationa l participants focused on creating genuinely competitive markets toward mer ger At least one would think so Yet so far an intensive mediation process reveals that nobody is checking parochial interests at the negotiatingroom door In terms of the new RTO b oard and membership participants are haggling about whether D inde pendent board or whether does Such equations will never balance no matter how hard one tries The greater good is getting lost in turf battles and worse If this myopic behavior continues the result will be that all regions and all states lose because they cannot see beyond their own noses Consequently the ball is squarely back in FERCs court to direct the devel opment of a successful RTO It now faces some key decisions as it attempts to make good on the promise of the merger to improve market efficiency di minish market power concerns improve interconnection rules for renewable e nergy resources and reduce costs to consumers For demand response and ren ewable energy advocates the stakes are especially high Indeed the expansio n of PJM into the Allegheny Energy control area was crucial to resolving in terconnection issues that allowed development of the Mill Run Pennsylvania MW wind farm and enables future wind development in West Virginia that will in January be significantly within PJM The ability of the Northeast RTO to make effective decisions and follow thr ough on those decisions will determine its eventual success or failure But the debate over RTO governance begins and ends with the fact that FERC dir ected that PJM be the platform for the new organization utilizing the bes t practices from NYISO and NEISO PJM has the greatest experience and most successful track record of the three ISOs and is about the same size as NY ISO and NEISO combined At the same time NYISO and NEISO have performed we ll and have addressed some issues more successfully than PJM The recent PJ M report to the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission confirming that PJM s thoroughly discredited ICAP market was indeed manipulated by a single ma rket participant which exercised undue market power in early is a tim ely reminder that PJM does not walk on water Unfortunately rather than tackling implementation issues solely on their m erits debates have retained the persistent undercurrent of ISO regional stakeholder and corporate turf wars or selfinterests Only FERC can get the process moving swiftly in the right direction by dire cting that the new RTO be an independent entity with superior board experie nce and clear decisionmaking authority responsive to genuine stakeholder i nput There is no place for perpetuation of existing ISO selfinterests se lfserving stakeholder vetoes or regional power brokering Four principles are critical in the formation of any governance structure board experience and independence effective input of all stakeholders suf ficient board decisionmaking authority and sufficient monitoring of marke t power An Independent and Experienced Board Happily the three proposals which emerged from the mediation process requi re members of the board to be independent from any of the market participan ts precluding working for any of the companies doing business in the North east RTO markets owning stock in member companies or participating on any affiliated boards In contrast to this good news is the bad news that the three proposals focu s too heavily on giving each existing ISO proper representation on the new RTO board and what the proper representation would be This regional focus undercuts independence and treats the RTO board like the United States Sen ate where each Senator comes from a state and argues for its interests Loy alty to the home ISO becomes the real requirement in such cases not indepe ndence Independence for the new RTO board membership should also mean independence from the institutional interests of the existing PJM NYISO and NEISO Ev en if the existing ISOs retain operation for an extended period it would b e for practical technical reasons not because the ISOs themselves are a n ecessary constituency To take a seat on the Northeast RTO board all new R TO board members should resign any existing ISO board positions The only f iduciary responsibility these board officers should have is to the new orga nization The new RTO board should include the most qualified individuals without un due emphasis on whether or not they previously served on a particular ISO b oard It makes sense that some but perhaps not all of the individuals on the new RTO board will have previously served on ISO boards Such experienc e is invaluable Yet it appears that some parties are stuck in the rut that ISO experience must bring ISO baggage If the fiduciary duty of RTO board members is clearly to the RTO instead of to a prior ISO it will be easier to get beyond ISO power issues To encourage the movement of the most quali fied ISO board members to the new RTO board the transition board also sh ould be or become the initial permanent Northeast RTO board Rather than on representation selection of RTO board members should focus primarily on the breadth of issues that will be facing the new RTO A well rounded set of board experience and skills is essential to addressing such important issues as demand response interconnection of generators cost re covery mechanisms system planning and reliability The new RTO board should have members with regulatory financial environme ntal consumer and reliability backgrounds Besides providing voices genuin ely without the baggage of prior ISO affiliation the initial RTO board sho uld probably for example include someone with substantial experience in m erging organizations The search process for new board members should be do ne in an open manner with input from all stakeholders to ensure adequate ex pertise in the diversity of issues that will face the new RTO Stakeholder Input Meaningful stakeholder input is crucial because the RTO will be fundamental ly charged with serving the public interest in an industry that is at the h eart of our economy security and environment Moreover no board or manag ement team can adequately predict all of the impacts brought on by rule cha nges without close coordination with market participants The RTO will ulti mately survive only if it maintains its credibility and the confidence of t he public The three existing ISOs have made a substantial transition from a narrow co nception of stakeholders as transmission owners to encompass market part icipants and even to include public representatives PJM has recently expa nded the types of parties that can participate in the process by facilitati ng the ability of State Consumer Advocates to join and be voting members O ther ISOs have gone even further by specifying specific categories for envi ronmental agencies and individual consumers and minimizing the costs of jo ining Of course many stakeholder processes require so much time and expe nse that it is difficult or even impossible for such stakeholders to meanin gfully participate But while opportunities for genuine and appropriate stakeholder input are e ssential stakeholder processes cannot become an excuse or a means to avoid problem solving There is a fine line between genuine stakeholder input an d de facto special interest veto power Over the past four years PJM relie d heavily on its membership to make improvements to market rules and has th e best though still flawed wholesale energy market in the country Yet it is equally clear that stakeholder input can impede positive changes such as eliminating the ICAP requirements or implementing demandresponse propos als These concerns are balanced by having stakeholder opportunities for input b uilt into RTO problem solving without allowing stakeholder processes to ha ve a life of their own or the pretense of being the board Stakeholders sho uld not only be able to comment on proposed changes but also should constan tly look for ways to improve the market and be able to communicate these su ggestions to the RTO board In turn the board should take these suggestion s seriously This healthy relationship is hard to reduce to rules and rules alone cannot create it Ultimately only a combination of rules incentives and personal leadership can make it happen DecisionMaking Authority Ultimately the RTO board should be able to file changes with FERC on all m arket rule changes and reliability changes with stakeholder input but with out specific stakeholder approval The RTO board must have the ability to f ile under the more broadly defined Section of the FPA One example of the effective use of this type of intervention came earlier this spring After months of negotiation on an economic demandresponse pro gram several PJM market participants chose to block passage The PJM board reviewed the results of the various votes on the demandresponse programs determined that the programs were justified and important and filed the p roposed rule changes which FERC approved Since individual ISO boards will likely remain during a transition phase a ll FERC filings should be made through the RTO board which would have fina l decisionmaking authority Market Monitoring Effective independent market monitoring is essential to identifying market power problems and fixing them But an effective market monitoring presenc e also requires close observation from inside the RTO PJMs Market Monitor ing Unit MMU works for and reports to PJM As more parties attempt to merge and contractually control more assets mon itoring market power will become more important The market would be better served if the MMU were more independent of PJM perhaps reporting directly to FERC and the board The MMU must have both the ability to identify mark et flaws and the authority to make corrections in a timely manner without being subjected to a committee process that could delay or avoid effective responses Next Steps Since the mediation process FERC has been working to incorporate state reg ulatory agencies into the development of the RTO But as with other stakeho lders too many states are allowing parochial interests to interfere To keep the process moving an independent search firm should review existi ng board members and potential new candidates to determine what would make for an effective RTO board which meets the criteria outlined above FERC sh ould then direct the new RTO Board to start the long process of creating a fully functional and effective RTO The first task of the RTO board is to c ommission an implementation team and set out the overall direction Second FERC should establish an inclusive stakeholder process that can eff ectively communicate to the board Finally FERC should empower a Market Monitoring Unit that reports directly to the Commission as well as the

is a commentary biweekly email publication concerning the current themes and trends in the energy market If you have trouble reading this email please see the document on our website wwwpennfutureorg under Pressroom Publications August Vol No Pittsburgh A Golden Opportunity For Renewable Energy The end of large stranded cost charges to consumers will usher in a golden opportunity next year for the Pittsburgh area to become the renewable energy capital of America In the Duquesne Light Service Territory in rates for some customers approached percent above the national average with residential customers paying more than cents per kilowatthour kWh Of this cents plus total about cents was for just generation And what did consumers get for this premium cents generation price well above any price including for todays percent renewable energy products seen in Pennsylvanias competitive retail market since Did they get clean and safe energy Not unless you believe that coal and uranium are renewable resources In fact the Pittsburgh area was powered by incredibly expensive nuclear plants that often were shut down more than they ran as well as some of the highly polluting coal plants that kill Pennsylvanians each year with microscopic dirt cause acid rain produce smog and contribute to global warming Both the pollution and the high costs were jammed down the throats of consumers by monopolyfriendly regulators Those who challenged the legacy of high rates and dirty power and asked the old Pennsylvania monopoly utilities about renewable energy were often lectured that renewable energy technology would cost more or was not practical Todays competitive retail market shows how wrong those lectures were Right now in Pittsburgh four competitive suppliers two are Greene certified are offering percent renewable energy products for prices ranging from cents to cents per kWh Those prices are less than the cents Duquesnes customers paid for coal and nuke generation five years ago In fact they are more than a full cent less per kWh Since renewable energy products exist in the marketplace are exponentially cleaner and cost less than Duquesnes traditional power products why have they so far not swept the marketplace Can You Say Stranded Costs or Competitive Transition Charges Customers who switch to renewable energy products pay not just the price of the product but also a regulatory stranded cost charge of up to cents per kWh On a system average basis the stranded cost charge is percent of each customers total electric bill and for residential customers it is a whopping percent of the total electric bill The stranded cost charge is paid even if you switch from Duquesne Light to another company and allows Duquesne to recover uneconomic investments in nuclear power made when it was a regulated generation monopoly Without the collection of stranded cost charges Duquesne may have gone bankrupt Yet adding the stranded cost charge to the otherwise less costly renewable energy products has the effect of increasing a customers total bill when she bought renewable energy products Thus stranded cost charges are a real barrier to renewable energy products and other competitive retail electric products But in in the Duquesne Light service territory the regulatory ball and chain of stranded cost charges will be eliminated by giving a large total rate cut of probably percent to all residential customers and by increasing the shopping credit from cents to about cents for residential customers The removal of stranded cost charges means many Pittsburgharea customers will soon be able to switch to renewable energy products and pay less or no more than what they were paying for electricity in Yes they could save even more by buying even lower cost dirty power products But the coming opportunity to power Pittsburgh with renewable energy and pay less than bills is a onceinacentury chance The Duquesne Transition The reason why Duquesne will be the first Pennsylvania utility to eliminate stranded cost charges is its successful sale of its generation plant Duquesne first swapped some generating assets with FirstEnergy and then sold all of its generating assets to Orion while contracting with Orion to continue to provide default service to Duquesnes native load customers Duquesne has provided distribution service and Orion has provided default generation service at capped rates without notable problems Without a former monopoly utility with a vested interest in keeping generation customers a far greater portion of customers switched to a competitive supplier than anywhere else in the US Competitive suppliers now serve about percent of all Duquesne customers The number of Duquesne customers served by competitive suppliers rose steadily until peaking in late at about held steady through spring and then declined to about as of July The recent decline occurred when retail offers exceeded the systems shopping credit but remained well below Duquesnes generation rate of cents Today there are four competitive suppliers offering six different products to residential customers in the Duquesne territory one of which is priced below the shopping credit and enables customers to switch and save and four of which are renewable energy products Recent sharp declines of more than percent in forward electric markets make it likely that more products will soon be able to beat the current Duquesne shopping credit of cents and of course the cent monopoly rate After the two remaining principal impediments of completing a successful transition to competition in the Duquesne Light service territory will be the full integration of its control area and wholesale market into PJM and wide deployment of demandresponse technologies Timeofuse meters and appliancecontrol devices allow customers to profit from reducing usage in summer peak hours protect reliability reduce market power and can lessen pollution The failure to achieve PJM integration and demand response could derail the benefits of stranded cost elimination and what has been so far a successful transition for the Duquesne Service territory No More Stranded Costs Stranded cost charges will likely be first removed for residential customers starting in March Up until now average system customers have had to pay cents on every dollar paid for total electric service so that Duquesne could recover its stranded costs With the end of stranded cost charges different classes of customers and different individual customers depending on their usage will receive a substantial rate cut Current Prices for Electric Service from Duquesne Light Rates in centskWh RS Rate GS GL Distribution Transmission Generation CTC portion of Gen Shopping Credit Total The portion of the bill that is the Competitive Transition Charge represents the basic rate reduction that each class will enjoy when the charges are terminated The charges are scheduled to end in March for general residential customers RS April for smaller commercial customers GS and September for larger commercial customers GL The charges end for other customer classes as late as April Residential customers using kWhmonth for example will stop paying centskWh for stranded costs reducing their total electric bill by percent Real Market Prices Generation rates will still be regulated for customers receiving default generation service under Duquesnes contract with Orion However the rates will no longer reflect the remnants of prerestructuring costofservice rates Instead they will be based imprecisely on market rates When the PUC approved the sale of Duquesnes generating plants and the transfer of the default service to Orion it approved tentative default rates at market prices as determined by the Duquesne contract with Orion The precise level of default rates remains unknown however Consumers would see total rate reductions of about percent if the default rate is set at centskWh and a total rate cut of percent if it is pegged at cents Again these default rates are well below the cent monopoly rate Although the DuquesneOrion contract set and the PUC approved the default rates the rates did not assume that Duquesne would be joining PJM West There have been some nonpublic discussions taking place between the PUC Orion and Duquesne as well as some public discussions but at this point it is unclear whether the existing rates should or will be adjusted Whatever the precise answer the PUC needs to move these proceedings to the public domain and resolve the issues expeditiously so that customers and suppliers may plan to take advantage of the new market opportunities Competitive Market Opportunities In the shopping credit will increase for customers who choose to buy generation from a competitive supplier instead of Orions default service Given reasonable assumptions about market prices and what the shopping credit may be it appears that competitive suppliers will have substantial opportunities to provide competitive service at prices below the shopping credit For example if the present residential shopping credit of centskWh is raised to centskWh as presently scheduled consumers would have a modest opportunity to save by shopping in addition to the savings that all customers including those remaining on default generation service will experience from the end of stranded cost charges If the residential shopping credit is increased to about centskWh suppliers competing on price would have a substantial opportunity to offer consumers meaningful savings by shopping One might presume that the percent of all customers already shopping in the Duquesne service territory include many of those most interested in shopping Will the opportunity to save a bit more after receiving a percent rate decrease without shopping be sufficient to entice many of the remaining customers to shop Setting the rate too low will provide a disincentive to shop by delivering even more savings to nonshopping customers who already will be getting a huge rate cut because of the end of the stranded cost charges Given that market rates are a prediction that no one has been making accurately perhaps the PUC should err on the high side to increase competitive market opportunities There is no better time for doing so than when all customers are about to receive a huge rate cut from the elimination of stranded cost charges Renewable Energys Time is Now Even moderate additional shopping based on price does not mean a noncompetitive market however Perhaps the most successful competitive suppliers will be those that offer products or services that encourage customers to switch for reasons other than price Renewable energy energy efficiency and demandside response products may well provide suppliers with the competitive edge The opportunity for renewable energy market penetration is in fact unprecedented Two new wind farms are under construction at this time in Somerset and Fayette counties bringing the total installed wind capacity in the region to about megawatts MW Two additional wind farms are under development in the same area and another is under development about miles across the state line in West Virginia potentially bringing an additional MW of wind power to serve the Pittsburgh market Depending on the precise shopping credit it is likely that wind electricity from these developments could be sold to retail customers at prices close to or not too far above the shopping credit Even if buying renewable energy is not the lowest cost option consumers would still be investing a portion of their percent rate cut in renewable generation and still receive a reduction in their electric bill from what is now paid For example a residential customer could buy one of the five renewable products presently available to consumers in the Duquesne territory and still save from cent to cents per kWh Alternatively consumers probably will be able to buy percent wind energy and still receive a total electric bill more than percent less than it is today and was in Large institutions government agencies businesses and families can without increasing their current electricity bills become renewable energy consumers With their choices they can make Pittsburgh known far and wide as the first

commentary biweekly email publication concerning the current themes and trends in the energy market July Vol No Market Lessons from Schools still out for summer but just as the new and improved Federal En ergy Regulatory Commission FERC issued a watershed RTO decision last wee k which could lead to substantial expansion of PJM into the Northeast PJM s State of the Market Report contains some interesting information an d lessons for us After the California experience demonized spot electricity markets it wou ld surprise many that PJMs spot energy market was a bargain Spot pr ices in were below per megawatthour MWh or three cents per kilowatthour kWh percent of the hours in the year The single h ighest hourly price was per MWh or cents per kWh but prices reach ed or exceeded per MWh during only hours in the entire year downl oad charts on our website by typing wwwpennfutureorgitemshourlypricecha rtspdf in your browser By contrast California experienced spot prices that often exceeded per MWh for most of the last months Authored by the PJM Market Monitoring Unit but likely reviewed and edite d by top PJM management the Report delivered to FERC concludes that all of the markets operated by PJM were reasonably competitive It cautions however that there are potential threats to competition in the energy capacity and re gulation markets that require ongoing scrutiny and in some cases may requi re action in order to maintain competition Market participants do possess some ability to exercise market power under certain conditions in PJM mar kets In order to maintain and improve the functioning of the PJM markets the R eport recommends Retention of the MWh bid cap in the PJM energy market and investigat ion of other rule changes to reduce incentives to exercise market power Retention of the mw bid cap in the PJM regulation market Evaluation of additional actions to increase demandside responsiveness to price in both energy and capacity markets Modification of incentives in the capacity market to require all Load Serv ing Entities LSEs to meet their obligations to serve load on a longerte rm basis and require all capacity resources to be offered on a comparable longerterm basis The Report uses several analytical methods to reach these recommendations and conclusions including looking at the net revenue for generation from all sources the increase in bid amount over marginal cost market concent ration as measured using the HHI index and lastly an analysis of the re sulting prices See Spot go to market Perhaps the Reports most intriguing information on price trends concerns the spot energy market where average prices declined by percent from levels Driven by lower peak prices in the most expensive hours of the year the average locational marginal price LMP in was per MWh cents per kWh falling from the average of p er MWh cents per kWh This average price decline in the spot marke t was more significant because it occurred even though fuel costs were sha rply higher in Indeed the average fueladjusted LMP in decline d to per MWh or percent from the price of per MW h And when one compares spot market prices to competitive future prices for the year and to regulated rates for generation it becomes clear that spot market prices in were significantly lower than f uture contracts Even with appropriate price adjustments to facilitate com parison they were also much lower than regulated residential generati on rates for all hours charged by Pennsylvanias six major electric utilit ies which ranged from about dollars to dollars per MWh or to cents per kWh The lesson Spot market prices which received so much bad publicity as a result of th e California fiasco can be a bargain and customers who are able to manage their demand to reduce or avoid the hours of high spot prices can reap ma jor savings by purchasing electricity from the spot market In fact spot market prices in were below most of Pennsylvanias shop ping credits or prices to compare Thats saying something since the sh opping credits in turn are as much as cents per kWh less than the regulated rate for just generation paid by customers to the monopoly util ities But Since spot market prices in were well below both the generation rate paid to monopolies and the much lower shopping credits why were ener gy suppliers increasingly unable to offer electricity at prices below the shopping credits ICAP pricing and reliance by electricity suppliers on higher priced future or forward market contracts supply most of the answer The spot market gives a good indication of what the forward markets should be under typical circumstances As the data below indicate the average s pot market price for all market locations in was MWh almost percent less than during and more than percent lower upon adjus ting for higher year fuel prices PJM LoadWeighted Average LMP MWh Change Average LMP Median LMP Standard Deviation Average Fuel Adjusted LMP Median Fuel Adjusted LMP Standard Deviation While the dramatically lower standard deviation in indicates that pri ces were much less volatile than in there remained a substantial gap between average and median prices indicating that extreme prices during a small number of hours continued to substantially skew overall average pri ces Grading on a curve The PJM price duration curves measuring the percent of time prices w ere at or below a particular level tell an interesting story As one woul d expect with higher fuel prices especially for natural gas the general trend was for prices to be slightly higher during periods where natural ga s was the marginal fuel For approximately percent of all hours e nergy prices were more expensive than in Yet with relatively low pe ak demand the price for the most expensive percent of demand during was considerably lower in than in accounting for the entire percent average reduction in prices from If not for the red uced prices for the most expensive percent of demand overall prices for likely would have risen approximately percent over due larg ely to higher fuel costs For these reasons the Report recommendation to evaluate additional acti ons to increase demandside responsiveness is SEVERELY understated PJM an d all consumers have an essential interest in implementing demandside res ponse programs to the maximum economic level with dramatic implications f or saving individual consumers money improving system reliability keepin g market prices lower for everyone and improving market competitiveness Can everyone say ICAP So with the lower wholesale energy prices and plenty of supply why did th e retail market sputter Installed capacity ICAP price increases are a partial explanation In ad dition to energy the controversial charge for ICAP is the other significa nt cost born by electricity consumers within PJM ICAP represents a call o ption on physical generation resources by PJM during system emergencies A ll LSEs are required to purchase an amount of installed capacity equivalent to their customers peak load contribution plus an adequate reserve margi n currently percent But although it exists for reliability purposes PJM curtailed the export of energy outside PJM from PJMcommitted installe d capacity on only one day during Logically the price for installed capacity like the price of energy mig ht have been expected to decrease during Yet that didnt occur As e nergy prices decreased within PJM they remained high or continued to incr ease in surrounding control areas Higher prices in the surrounding markets led some generation owners to delist their generation committed to PJM i n order to sell out to other control areas without the risk of being curta iled by PJM The result was an increase in ICAP prices from an average of in to in The increase was concentrated over the s ummer with prices in the daily markets rising to or more for most of June July and August The increase in ICAP prices raised the cost of supp lying many retail customers by about cent per kWh The Market Monitoring Unit concluded that the price spikes over the summer months were a direct result of the opportunity cost associated with the prices in neighboring control areas But the Reports finding that the ICAP market was reasonably competitive seems inconsistent with PJMs conclusion last year that the ICAP mar ket performed so poorly that it needed a major overhaul This inconsistenc y raises questions about the reasonableness of that portion of the Re port or giving the ICAP market the PJM seal of approval PJM has invested substantial time and resources since last summer in an ex tensive stakeholder process to revise its ICAP rules especially concernin g the allocation of deficiency revenues and the interval over which ICAP i s purchased But since the reformed ICAP market began operating only rec ently on July its too soon to know whether it is functioning well or competitively We remain skeptical that the PJM prescription cures the disease or is merely life support for a dying program See Spot offer lower prices Apart from the ICAP market the differing prices in forward and spot marke ts provide substantial explanations for why electricity suppliers have fou nd it easy to beat the regulated generation rate for most utilities b ut difficult or even impossible to beat the lower shopping credits Shopp ing credit D regulated generation rate stranded generation cost Prior to the summer season prices in the forward markets before an yone knew how mild the weather was going to be substantially reflected th e highpriced experience of Because of the high prices in ener gy that was purchased through forward markets about percent of all en ergy was considerably more expensive than the spot prices turned out to be Since customers often prefer to lock in a price in advance competitiv e suppliers generally didnt want to provide fixed prices below the retail shopping credits If suppliers had relied on the spot market they could have offered lower prices Also customers who can reduce or shift demand m ay well benefit from purchasing more power from the spot market Recent developments Both in the East and West coast markets this week electricity in daily tr ading has been near its low for the week period Several developments a re pushing down the price of wholesale electricity Mild weather falling gas prices new generation coming online increasing demand response and c onservation as well as a FERC which understands that competition must exis t prior to price deregulation are all pushing prices lower Moreover for ward market prices for within PJM are beginning to fall and are under downward price pressure The new downward trend in forward markets partially results from moderate prices this summer even during high demand periods with prices generally staying under MWh kWh A good example of this was July a r elatively hot day with significant demand which saw prices reach per MWh for one hour but average per MWh for all onpeak hours Whats driving forward prices lower More efficient generation being installed below btukWh as opposed t o btukWh More ICAP in the market new capacity estimated at over MW with load growth at only percent or MW More demandresponsive load in the form of additional MW of Active Loa d Management The addition of PJM West slated for with lower prices generally Lower natural gas prices falling from mmBtu in July to mmBtu as of July This good news which suggests that retail customers in late or may again see retail competitive offers below the Pennsylvania shopping cr edits must be weighed against the troubled ICAP market ICAP remains an a nachronism ICAP prices have not returned to competitive levels and remain one of the significant obstacles to serving retail customers The forward prices for ICAP alone have remained above percent of the typical shoppi ng credit Yet even in the world of ICAP there is hope ICAP prices may be beginning to soften in the face of a substantial amount of new generation that is co ming online and increased demand response from customers PJM has institut ed both an emergency and an economic demandresponse program through whic h more customers can respond to prices and reduce the price that all custo mers pay for electricity Tomorrows homework The State of the Market Report contains plenty of data which confirms that PJM is the countrys bestrun independent system operator and best thoug h still flawed wholesale market Prices in the spot energy market were we ll below regulated generation rates even with appropriate adjustment s But none of this warrants complacency Only when PJM becomes the first market to give consumers the tools they need to change their

No Wind Market Power As strong winds blew in from the west on October th Community Energy and Exelon Power Team executives announced the five largest retail wind purchases in Americas history to a large crowd of excited onlookers gathered for the dedication of two new Pennsylvania wind farms Amidst cheers and applause Mike Freeman of Exelon Power Team and Brent Alderfer of Community Energy announced that the University of Pennsylvania now leads the nation for the largest retail purchase of wind The Penn Quakers are buying million kilowatthours kWh the output of five turbines or the equivalent of percent of its electricity from the Community EnergyExelon Power Teams MW and MW wind farms at Mill Run and Somerset Township With these turbines only just beginning to turn multiple conversations were heard about the need to build even more wind farms to meet retail consumer demand for wind energy All those standing on the reclaimed mine land that is now a dairy farm could see before them the merging of wind power and the power of the retail marketplace Not far behind the Quakers in their purchase are the roaring Nittany Lions of Penn State University Penn State University is purchasing more than million kWh the production of three turbines from Community Energy For a land grant university its hard to beat clean energy made on a dairy farm In third place is Carnegie Mellon University which created crucial momentum by becoming the first major wind purchaser acquiring million kWh Having exercised real leadership and gotten this market moving Carnegie Mellon is seriously considering increasing its wind energy buy next year Rounding out the top five are the Philadelphia Suburban Water Company and Giant Eagle with purchases of about million and million kWh respectively We urge more companies and utilities to follow their examples If you are interested in buying wind energy contact Community Energy at wwwnewwindenergycom In fact if just institutions buy at least the output of one large wind turbine Pennsylvanias retail consumers can insure that MW of new wind energy are built and operating By harnessing the power of the retail market to wind power development that goal is very achievable Though not in the top five the Environmental Protection Agency Western Pennsylvania Conservancy and the White Dog Cafe in Philadelphia have all also made major purchases Every one of these purchasers understands the price of wind energy but more importantly they understand its environmental public health and energy security value showing that Oscar Wilde wasnt right about everyone when he said nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing Stunningly percent of the wind power from these two wind farms was sold out as soon as Public Utility Commission Chairman Glen Thomas and Department of Environmental Protection Secretary David Hess flipped the switch of the first of what are sixteen Enron Wind MW machines These turbines which make full revolutions per minute are the largest manufactured in the United States and their blades are longer than previously used to be more efficient in the moderatebutsteady wind at these locations All told they will generate enough electricity for homes or about million kWh of electricity with no soot mercury carbon dioxide nitrogen oxide or sulfur dioxide In contrast typical system power in this region would emit about million pounds of carbon dioxide pounds of sulfur dioxide and pounds per year of nitrogen oxide in order to provide the same amount of electricity But aside from the important environmental benefits the wind projects also reflect substantial economic development in Fayette and Somerset counties Both the Mill Run and Somerset turbines are on working farms with the owners receiving to for each tower erected on their land which they continue to farm Several of the Somerset turbines are situated on reclaimed strip and deep mines Construction of the two wind farms required about labor years of employment and will require about four fulltime equivalent workers to maintain and operate the sites The sites generate local property taxes and if yesterdays dedication ceremonies and the nearby Green Mountain wind farm in Garrett are any indication at least a modest tourist industry This was all made possible by a great project team and every member deserves a hearty well done Although construction only took about months project development by Atlantic Renewable Energy Corporation began about two years ago Zilkha Renewable Energy Atlantics development partner provided project financing as did The Reinvestment Funds Sustainable Development Fund with money made available as a result of the PECO Energy and Unicom merger settlement negotiated by PennFuture and others Exelon Power Team is the wholesaler and Community Energy markets wind energy to retail customers On a sad note Nick Humber an Enron Wind employee who was instrumental in moving the projects to fruition died when his hijacked plane crashed into the World Trade Center on Sept Another plane that crashed in Somerset County was only about miles from the wind farm Nicks contribution to the project leaves a stunning memorial reaching into the sky with clean affordable homegrown electricity that supports our communities We are glad that Nicks brother was able to attend the dedication As the tragic events of Sept spur renewed patriotism and interest in domestic safety it is important to recognize that the Community EnergyExelon wind farms will help to increase Americas energy independence and security More wind farms can only do us more good Conservation is a moral issue said President Teddy Roosevelt for it involves the patriotic duty to insure the safety and continuance of the nation In these times conservation of Americas environment and protecting the nations safety cannot be done without an accelerated shift to wind and other renewable energy resources To all involved with this project but especially the University of Pennsylvania and the other purchasers who have acted in keeping with Teddy Roosevelts words we salute you ECubed is

informative and inspiring Look for more details in your mailbox soon September Vol No Whats It Worth To You Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing Oscar Wilde Certainly too few consumers and policymakers understand the value of renewable energy products products that avoid the acid rain smog global warming and soot pollution caused by mainly coalburning power plants Perhaps with the removal of stranded cost charges from consumers bills next year the Duquesne Light service territory will be the first market where both price and value of renewable energy are understood and motivate large numbers of customers to buy see case studies that follow Moreover a new study published in the August edition of Science by Mark Z Jacobson and Gilbert M Masters of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Stanford University shows that the cost gap between coal power and the cheapest forms of renewable energy is narrowing sharply down to about cents per kilowatthour kWh Most importantly professors Jacobson and Masters document that the apparently slightly lower cost of coal generation is more illusion than reality due to its real costs When coal generations environmental and health costs like damage to air water and forests as well as human illness and death are included in the calculation coal generations real price jumps to about cents to cents per kWh By comparison the cents to cents cost of wind energy makes it a bargain Wind energy is unequivocally less expensive than is coal energy say Jacobson and Masters How Much Is That KilowattHour Its not surprising that few know the value of renewable energy products in electricity markets where many real pollution costs from burning fossil fuels are not included in the price of electricity and where many consumers still dont know the link between electricity generation and environmental and health damage Yet lack of knowledge goes beyond value in electricity markets Consumer inexperience with these markets and the complex transition to competition make electricity an exception to the rule that people know the price of everything Even sophisticated observers dont know the price of comparative products regardless of the added environmental and public health costs Price transparency is a bad joke because stranded cost charges make understanding price as easy as getting a clear view on a smoggy day in Houston In those states that allow customers to choose a generation supplier few consumers and policymakers know what their local utility charged for generation prior to competition including what are now called stranded costs Perhaps even fewer know how prices alone not including the stranded cost charges of todays competitive products compare to their utilities unbundled generation rates charged prior to competition Or how todays renewable energy prices compare to utilities precompetition generation rates And how many know how todays price to compare or default rate compares to the precompetition monopoly generation rate which includes stranded costs Confusion on these basic questions is widespread and distorts perception and policy It is vital for policymakers to know the answers in order to formulate wise policy see for answers Its All in the Numbers E Vol No But even thats only the foundation of what is perhaps a much tougher question about electricity What is it worth An important change that will affect the answer is on the horizon Beginning in February stranded cost charges will be eliminated from electric bills in the Pittsburgh area These are payments made to Duquesne primarily to cover its prior investments in uneconomic nuclear generation recovered from consumers through the Competitive Transition Charge CTC The following examples of typical types of customer bills in the Duquesne Light territory illustrate comparative prices at prerestructuring or present default rates the new default rates that will take effect next year and for various renewable energy products These examples will hopefully clear away some of the haze surrounding the true price of renewable products Residential Customers A typical residential customer rate RS using kWh per month has been paying Duquesne Light about per month since rates were capped in Of this monthly bill about is for total generation costs and the rest is for distribution services In turn more than of the total generation cost reflects stranded cost charges Since customer choice began all kWh residential customers including those choosing a competitive supplier have had to pay Duquesne the same for stranded costs If customers were not required to pay Duquesne for its stranded costs this typical customers total bill would be less than a whopping percent less than it is now As a result of stranded cost charges customers choosing a competitive supplier can only avoid paying Duquesne about of its generation rate where the reflects the shopping credit or price to compare that has been available So only if a customer could buy kWh per month for less than including transmission would she save money by switching to a competitive supplier As you can see stranded cost charges and the weird economics and pricing they produce make it difficult to know the price of electricity let alone the value of renewable generation If our typical residential consumer purchased renewable generation today for centskWh the consumer would pay for generation per month less than the historic regulated generation rate of At a rate of centskWh the same consumer would pay for renewable generation or per month less The price for renewable generation must be over centskWh for the consumer to pay more for it than what residential consumers paid their regulated utility for mostly coal and nuclear power There are presently four competitive suppliers offering five renewable energy products in Duquesnes territory three are Greene certified for prices ranging from cents to centskWh Renewable generation today costs substantially less than coal and nuclear generation did prior to competition Yet the stranded cost charge that a kWh renewable energy residential customer must pay in the Duquesne service territory has concealed not just the value of renewable energy but also its real price Until February a customer buying renewable generation for centskWh or less than the precompetition rate will still have a total bill including CTCs and distribution charges that is more than their current bill While many might find that more per month for cleaner energy and its associated benefits is still reasonable many more who are motivated by their wallets alone probably would not But a great opportunity is about to open up for renewable products as CTCs in the Duquesne Light territory are about to be eliminated While the Public Utility Commission still hasnt established what the new regulated rates will be it appears that a typical kWh per month customer who buys generation from DuquesneOrion will receive a rate reduction of about percent saving about per month However customers wont receive the full savings from the elimination of CTCs because a portion will cover the costs of Duquesnes integration into the PJMWest Independent System Operator But as soon as the stranded cost charges are removed a typical residential consumer could buy renewable energy products and pay less than what she paid for electricity under default rates and less than she paid in Both the price and value will then be motivating factors for buying renewable energy When the CTC is removed the residential customer using kWh per month will soon be able to use the savings to buy wind energy to serve onethird of hisher load for a total of or a savings of compared to todays default rate Even if the customer were to buy all of hisher electricity from one of the new wind farms being built in southwestern Pennsylvania the customer would pay less than more per month than she is currently paying for default generation If the customer chooses a blended product with both renewable and nonrenewable content for centskWh the monthly bill would be less than what it is today Even at a price of centskWh the monthly bill for a blended product would be less than per month more or only about more per year than the price currently paid for default service of mostly nuclear and dirty coalgenerated power The end of CTCs in Duquesnes territory will allow a residential customer to switch from traditional dirty generation to renewable generation and still save money or pay only pennies more Business and Institutional Customers The dollar impact for larger customers is somewhat higher but equally small in the context of total electricity bills or company budgets For example a small commercial customer on rate GSM such as a restaurant or convenience store using kWh per month and with a demand of kW has been paying per month for regulated or default service With elimination of the CTC and the PJMWest integration costs their bills will likely decrease about percent for a total monthly bill of about a savings of about per month A small commercial customer could use the savings to buy enough wind energy to meet percent of its load saving about per month compared to present bills and still paying less for electricity than in A large commercialindustrial customer on rate GL such as a large hotel hospital or a small college or manufacturer using million kWhmonth and a demand of kW has been paying about per month for regulated or default service With elimination of the CTC the bill will likely decrease about percent beginning around September for a total monthly bill of around a savings of about per month Those substantial savings could then be invested in purchasing renewable energy without increasing electricity bills above either current or levels For example a hospital could serve percent of its load with a blended product for centskWh and still save about per month compared to its current default bill Two hospitals could purchase the entire output of one of the new wind turbines in southwestern Pennsylvania to supply over percent of their total electricity requirements and still save about per month compared to their present bills Even if a single hospital purchased the output of an entire wind turbine enough to serve percent of its load the total additional cost of per month would be only about more per year than their current default bill For hospitals which must fight the devastating health effects of dirty coalgenerated power every day how much is that worth Municipal consumers on rate SM for street lighting using kWh per month have been paying per month for regulated and default electricity With elimination of the CTC the bill would decrease to but with the PJMWest transition costs the bill may decrease about percent for a total monthly bill of a savings of about per month About three municipal customers with that consumption level could join together to purchase the output of one of the new wind turbines in southwestern Pennsylvania to meet their entire electricity load and still save about per month each compared to their current default costs A single municipal customer could still save about per month compared to their current bill if they purchased a blended product at cents per kWh What is it worth What will renewable energy be worth to Pittsburghs families businesses institutions and governments Buying renewable is the single best thing any consumer can do to protect our environment and public health Its value is great and its price in Pittsburgh will become less distorted with the removal of stranded cost charges from consumers bills next year The savings of per month for a typical residential customer and much more for typical commercial industrial and municipal accounts gives Pittsburgh a great opportunity to become Americas first greenpowered city The price of that opportunity will cost less than what consumers paid for dirty power in or even what many are paying now The value of that opportunity is priceless Ecubed is available for reprint in newspapers and

publication concerning the current themes and trends in the energy market September Vol No Straight to the Source Last year when PECO Energy and Unicom merged to form Exelon it was big news Importantly the merger settlement provided million to fund the development of renewable energy in Pennsylvania This year the companys wholesale trading and marketing unit Power Team presented renewable energy advocates with a big surprise signing longterm contracts to purchase the output of three new wind farms in Pennsylvania These contracts were not required as part of the merger settlement and are not included in the million earmarked for renewable energy funding Now a key force in renewable energy development in the East the Power Team contracts are essential to bringing MW of generation online from these new wind farms two of which will be operational next month The MW Mill Run wind farm is scheduled to being operation next week and the MW Somerset wind farm is scheduled to begin commercial operation the following week Mike Freeman the Power Team trader who made the burgeoning wind energy business in Pennsylvania possible gave us some insight into Exelons renewable energy commitment as well as how wind energy can be integrated into Americas power grids Whats in Power Teams renewable portfolio We have MW of hydro that is not pumped storage MW of wind MW of landfill methane MW of Municipal Solid Waste MW of wood waste and MW of scrap tires All of the wind is Greene certifiable as new resources All of the landfill methane is qualified under Greene but only MW is new generation Of the hydro all of the generation is in larger projects that have been or are eligible for certification under the lowimpact hydro standards The MSW and tire projects are not qualified under Greene but the biomass plant is Why is Power Team developing a renewable portfolio There were two principal reasons a perceived demand for renewable energy products in the wholesale marketplace and a desire to diversify our portfolio from the perspectives of fuel emissions and cost Was there internal resistance or other issues to overcome I think the initial reaction was that renewable projects would be a very minor sidelight to our overall business I dont think many people paid attention to the implications of renewable portfolio standards or external corporate mandates for renewable purchases Part of the handsoff approach was due to I believe a sense that renewable products only meant the repackaging of existing generation not changing the power system in any way Over time I think many people got comfortable with the idea that the creation of products potentially could initiate new projects that would change the power system For me thats the most important part of our participation to help encourage new development I also think that management began to get comfortable with the idea that renewable energy products could be profitable and that demand for these products could be sustaining Will this encourage new development Generators get a creditworthy counterparty that is not only willing to buy all of the energy at the generator location but is also willing to talk about additional new projects Over time other market intermediaries such as power marketers and retail suppliers may become interested in doing the same If this chain of events occurs I think we may even see renewable credits traded over the counter just like other energy products now How do renewables fit into Power Teams overall business strategy We are a growth company and are constantly in search of ways to sensibly increase our overall generating portfolio So bringing on new renewable generation into our supply mix really is part of that overall strategy More specifically we believe there is sustainable demand for renewable energy not only because of mandates such as renewable portfolio standards but also because of natural demand The average person may not think of it this way but in supporting the idea of paying a premium for renewable energy I think that people implicitly are accepting the notion that renewable energy is an essential component of how we as a country intend to manage our future energy requirements Why Wind Theres no question that the momentum for wind projects began to build as a result of the PECO restructuring and merger settlements under which PECO provided funds for new wind projects A second reason is that the forward electric markets began a steep upward climb beginning in and especially the offpeak power market beginning in and continuing into this year A third reason was the rapid increase in electric demand in the last five years and a realization that we need to develop a wideranging set of answers to meeting the demand including supplyside and demandside solutions We felt that wind generation could play a role on the supply side while meeting what seems to be a growing demand for renewable sources What are the primary financial considerations for a wind deal The first is probably the need for a longterm contract Wind generators typically want to enter into fixedprice longterm agreements to make it easier and cheaper to borrow money and to provide a stable revenue source over a long period We dont have a problem with longterm deals per se although we do want to emphasize diversity in our contracting as well We dont want to hold multiple longterm agreements and nothing else In my discussions with generators so far there has been some flexibility on contract length In fact our willingness to enter into a longterm contract is perhaps the key ingredient to getting a wind project financed and built Beyond the longterm contract the wind developers want to do business with a creditworthy company that has an investmentgrade rating Exelon Generation is rated A by SP so we are a natural counterparty for project financing Right now there are not very many long term buyers out there with the kind of creditworthiness that we have Will that always will be the case No If were right about longlasting demand I think other large companies including distribution companies will participate in the purchase of energy from these projects Weve teamed up with a retail marketer Community Energy to stimulate demand and market wind energy in ways that will move companies to buy it In the development of conventional generation it is not always necessary to enter into year agreements for a project to get built For example a developer may want to hedge off a portion of the output on a longterm basis but will be willing to sell the rest of the output for shorter periods And in some cases the financing source may be comfortable with a shorterterm agreement for the whole thing Is there a financial advantage for wind If ones view is that the future value of energy is higher than the present value a generation source with no fuel risk obviously is good to have Wind has one key advantage over other resources perpetual availability without any fuel costs or price volatility This helps mitigate the other risks that wind does present It is of course difficult to predict what will happen even in the near term But I am a believer in broad trends or cycles that are relatively easier to project outside of significant advances in technology Over a long period of time or years I think the probability of fixedprice wind energy riding out the low cycles while providing a greater amount of benefits in the high cycles is higher than the opposite I do believe that the demand for wind generation will be sustained at a moderate premium over generic electricity prices for the next to years Is it difficult to integrate wind into your portfolio With conventional generation and firm transmission paths a power marketing entity such as Power Team can bring its resources to the highest markets whether they are hourly daily monthly or longer Such transactions are supported by a complex communications network that notifies transmission providers of the timing amount and ultimate sink of expected output The contracts that we enter into on conventional generators depend to a great extent on economic structures that ensure as much as possible that the generator will fulfill our dispatch schedule as close to of the time as possible so we can avoid the punitive imbalance fees that transmission providers impose when delivered energy doesnt match scheduled energy The approach we take on wind generation must be quite different because wind plants provide intermittent output that is difficult to predict within reasonable boundaries of accuracy I think the serious wind developers know we are serious about incorporating wind energy into our portfolio Were one of the biggest physical movers of power in the country and have a significant amount of assets that must count for something in terms of our ability to more easily integrate a MW wind project into our overall mix How does intermittent generation add complexity A wind farm generates electricity when the wind blows not when you flip the switch on It takes a lot more than I expected to accommodate intermittency even for an experienced organization like ours because the transmission system and the operational rules and procedures were not developed with wind generation in mind You dont have the ability to give transmission providers realtime information for purposes of regulating the system between supply and demand In PJM where generators can offer increments of generation on a dayahead or realtime basis and receive or pay marketclearing prices depending on actual generation wind energy can be offered into the system in one of several different ways without experiencing significant imbalance penalties An obstacle and were working with PJM on this right now is that PJM as the transmission provider typically requires no shorter than minute notice when selfscheduled or mustrun generators expect to produce electricity or expect to stop producing electricity For purposes of regulating the system PJM then has the ability to tell the selfscheduled generator to go ahead and generate or to hold off until the energy is needed as a result of the realtime balance of supply and demand This will not be practical with wind generation Wed literally have to assign a trader to the task of monitoring highly suspect expected output from our wind plants and then calling PJM every hour to determine what to do In the mustrun scenario wed still have to notify PJM of expected output so PJM can regulate the system with other generators Either way wed have to predict output which is a dicey proposition Does that make wind generation unreliable Not at all Weve got excellent modeling to predict the output from wind generation over a longer period of time such as a full year Those predictions underlie our contracts But its another thing to tell the wind when to blow The wind energy industry is working on this from the perspective of improved wind forecasting and a more automated approach than what Ive described In PJM a MW system this may not seem to be a problem when there is only about MW of wind generation in the system right now but PJM wants to institute market rules that will be appropriate for a larger amount of wind generation when it arrives A certain magnitude of wind generation will cause PJM to change the way it now regulates the system The complexity cannot be underestimated and we will be part of the solution How can scheduling and other rules better accommodate intermittent resources like wind An alternative is for the transmission provider to model the output from a wind plant as negative load instead of generation Which is to say when the plant is generating electricity the system load will be reduced by the amount the plant is generating When the plant is not generating the load will increase A tradeoff of that approach is that load typically pays ancillary services expenses such as regulation and spinning reserve In this unique circumstance which of the ancillary services apply to negative load and at what level Were working with PJM on these questions Im uncertain whether a significant amount of socalled negative load will require any kind of realtime notice to the transmission provider Of course the transmission systems are operated to react to the unpredictability of load and one can view the unpredictability of wind generation in the same way Other countries and the western US transmission systems have figured out how to handle large amounts of wind generation and so can we Are you working on other approaches Another possibility is to dynamically schedule the output from a wind plant that is situated in a control area without a realtime energy market to a control area that does have such a market The output signal from the plant would be available to the transmission provider in the second control area on an automated basis The output then becomes part of available supply from moment to moment However notice requirements would not be sidestepped with this approach Will PJM resolve these problems Yes PJM is progressive and innovative and has indicated to us that they are willing to work with us to find solutions to the schedulingimbalance issue Its hard now because were breaking new ground I expect that it will be much easier for the next projects developed How big might your renewable portfolio get Will you keep signing more contracts for new projects As long as we continue to see demand for renewable energy well continue to look at projects where there are energy markets whose longterm forward economics support the purchase of energy Id like to aggregate a significant amount of wind generation in a single market such as PJM to be able to provide PJM with a more diversified supply curve with multiple projects it may be possible to smooth the output We need to do business with companies that have the financing and the organizational will to get these projects completed We are looking to form relationships with companies that we can build on If we execute a contract successfully wed like to apply the same concepts to additional projects with the same company Examples of that are Atlantic Renewable Energy Corp and National Wind Power What are some key developments to make the industry grow faster We need technological efficiencies to drive down the cost of the equipment standardized approaches to the transmission of wind generation financial innovations to allow more risksharing and hybrid approaches such as wind and energy storage Perhaps most importantly we need consumers to buy the wind energy Ecubed is available for reprint in newspapers and other

Clean Energy Choice Coming this Fall As a more than footlong wind power blade arrived by truck in front of Philadelphias City Hall Thursday morning the MidAtlantic Renewable Energy Coalition MAREC held a press conference to announce the near completion of Mill Run the largest wind farm in the East which will help power Pennsylvania homes and businesses by this fall Sitting atop Laurel Mountain in Fayette County Mill Run will generate enough Greene certified clean electricity to power over homes The wind farms output is already available to large business and commercial customers One of the first local institutions to put their money on homegrown wind is Carnegie Mellon University who recently announced the largest retail wind purchase in the United States and plans to buy percent of its electricity from Greene certified wind power generated at Mill Run beginning this year While generating electricity with no emissions and requiring no fuel the wind farm is also bringing jobs and tax revenue to a rural area as well as providing lease payments to the farm owner who profits from an additional crop The wind turbines actually use very little land and farming and other agricultural activities can continue right up to the base of the turbines Mill Run is one of a growing number of new wind projects that are under development in Pennsylvania Two other wind farms are scheduled for construction in Somerset and Wayne Counties and are expected to begin commercial operation in late or early And at least four additional wind farms are in development and may provide as much as MW in or All told as much as MW of new wind energy alone is likely to be ready to serve Pennsylvania by This is enough clean energy to power at least average Pennsylvania households with percent wind The energy produced at Mill Run is being sold for the next twenty years to wholesaler Exelon Power Team who in turn sells it to Community Energy Inc a local retailer specializing in new wind energy More information about the Mill Run site is available on the Atlantic Renewable Energy website at If interested in purchasing wind energy contact John Halley of CEI at or sign up at wwwnewwindenergycom See the attached document for a photo of the giant wind blade Pittsburghers Anticipate Tremendous Opportunity to Buy Green Power and Still Save A golden opportunity lies just around the bend for Pittsburgh area residents and businesses to buy renewable energy and still save money Currently customers who switch to renewable energy products pay not just the price of the product but also an added regulatory stranded cost charge of up to cents per kWh This charge was imposed after the electricity industry opened to competition and is supposed to enable utilities in this case Duquesne to recover uneconomic investments in nuclear power made when it was a regulated monopoly Without the collection of stranded cost charges Duquesne may have gone bankrupt The good news is that charge will be eliminated early in slashing consumers electricity rates across by as much as percent Even if buying renewable energy is not the lowest cost option consumers will be able to invest some of their savings in switching to renewable energy and still pay less than what theyre paying now For example once the stranded cost charge is removed a residential customer could buy one of the five renewable products presently available in the Duquesne territory and still save from cent to cents per kWh Thats equal to savings of over a year Buying renewable energy is one the best things that any home or business can do to clean our environment and ensure a more sustainable future and avoids an amount of pollution equal to planting trees not driving miles or taking cars off the road Pittsburgh area residents will be some of the first in the country to enjoy the elimination of the stranded cost charge See the attached document to view a complete listing of Greene certified renewable energy products currently available in Pennsylvania The European Commission Evaluates the External Costs of Energy Production The European Commission EC recently reported that the cost of generating electricity from coal is up to times more expensive than wind and times more expensive than generating from solar photovoltaics In a study quantifying what would happen to the cost of generating electricity from various fuel sources if environmental damage health damage and other external costs were taken into account the EC concluded that the cost to generate electricity from coal or oil would double while the cost of production from natural gas would increase by percent This is the first research project of its kind to calculate financial costs of socioeconomic damages resulting from different fuel sources for the entire continent The report concludes that the cost of environmental and health damage could be addressed by either taxing damaging fuels and technologies or by encouraging or subsidizing cleaner technologies that avoid socioenvironmental costs Since taxation on a continental level is difficult to achieve the Commission has agreed to encourage renewables In February it published guidelines on state aid for environmental protection which explicitly said Member States may grant operating aid to new plants producing renewable energy that will be calculated on the basis of the external costs avoided To conduct the study the EC contributed million Eurodollars to analyze research projects from the past decade and all member states of the European Union participated as well as the United States The EC will build on the results of this analysis with its recent launch of the NEWEXT new elements for the assessment of external costs from energy technologies research project which will study additional elements for the evaluation of external costs including the monetary valuation of mortality risk evaluation of acidification and eutrophication on the ecosystem and biodiversity and effects of major accidents in nonnuclear fuel chains such as oil spills For more information about the project visit their website at MidAtlantic Renewable Energy Coalition Preps for Major Campaign The MidAtlantic Renewable Energy Coalition MAREC is gearing up to hit the airwaves to tout the terrific benefits of renewable energy A coalition of clean energy advocates renewable energy businesses and government officials MAREC is developing a mass media campaign designed to increase consumer demand for renewable energy Because Pennsylvania has the most vibrant renewable energy market in the MidAtlantic the first year of the campaign will focus on reaching audiences in the greater metropolitan Pittsburgh and Philadelphia regions MAREC is currently working with a consultant to develop the messages and images that will inform people about the benefits of green power and motivate people to take action as well as raising funds and developing outreach efforts that will kick off in Pennsylvania this fall Be on the lookout for the debut of this exciting new campaign For more information about MAREC contact Peter Adels at or Renewable Energy Bills Await Hearings In March members of the renewable energy caucus introduced four bills in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives which provide incentives tax credits and funding for renewable energy and energy efficiency If passed this package of bills will allow Pennsylvania to become a national leader in the move to a clean energy future The bills were referred to the Consumer Affairs Committee chaired by Rep Wogan who indicated that he would hold hearings on them this summer Unfortunately the hearings were not scheduled We hope that they will be scheduled in the fall Please send letters to Rep Wogan asking him to schedule hearings on these important bills this fall If you live in the Philadelphia area you can do more by sending a letter to the editor of

consisting of representatives from various state agencies recently released a Draft Energy Policy for Pennsylvania which contains recommendations PennFuture applauded the Governors Energy Task Force for recognizing the importance of developing a state energy policy that respects the economic public health and environmental considerations which are essential to our quality of life We also recognize that much work needs to be done in order to ensure a reliable affordable and cleaner energy supply for Pennsylvania and have submitted comments on the plan outlining our recommendations Highlighted below are some of the recommendations we made with respect to renewable energy Pennsylvania should adopt a specific goal that percent of Pennsylvanias electric generation be supplied from renewable resources by and take concrete policy and consumer action to achieve that goal adopt HB which would commit the Commonwealth to purchase electricity generated from renewable resources and provide grants in support of renewable energy require all electricity suppliers to provide a portion of their supply from increasing amounts of renewable resources achieving at least percent of their electricity incrementally from renewable resources by state buildings throughout Pennsylvania should buy at least percent of their electricity from renewable resources by all savings that the Commonwealth gains as stranded costs are eliminated from its electric bills should be directed to buy renewable energy Pennsylvania should adopt a clear goal of developing MW of wind generation in Pennsylvania by and adopt policies and programs that directly support that goal adopt HB the Wind Energy Enterprise Act which provides grants for infrastructure improvements sales tax exemptions and investment tax credits for wind power Buy Pennsylvania wind as a consumer support marketing and public education programs that encourage others to do so and promote and enforce market rules that support interconnection or otherwise eliminate discrimination against renewable and intermittent generation The recommended policies would lessen Pennsylvanias leading environmental and public health

market October Vol No The Million Rip Off Running back Ricky Walters a native of Harrisburg once responded to a que stion about why he did not lay his body on the line to catch a ball over th e middle by saying For who For what Residential and business customers in the Duquesne Light service territory should also cry For who For wha t to the news that starting in January when Duquesne Light joins PJ M West they will be charged million per year to meet PJM Wests new ca pacity requirement called ACAP the close relative of the rogue PJM ICAP ru le Actually in this instance for who is clear PJM and Orion are the parti es for whom customers will pony up million or per year for a kWh monthly customer Orion is charging per MWday for capacity the equivalent of cents per kWh The cash goes into Orions pocket and is a windfall for a product that typically has a marginal cost of zero see the affidavit of Professor Peter Cramton filed with FERC on behalf of the New England Independent System Operator who properly concluded that ICAP s hould be scrapped But the windfall to Orion is delivered courtesy of the PJM Independent System Operator that stubbornly clings to its failed ICAP m arket and wont replace it with forward operating reserve markets and requ irements The real mystery is for what will customers be paying million Has a nyone shown that Duquesnes reliability record has been unsatisfactory Has PJM demonstrated that the million would reduce Duquesnes loss of load probability There are no good answers to those questions ICAPACAP remai n the biggest consumer ripoff in the wholesale market Its past time for FERC public utility commissions and especially the offices of consumer ad vocate to insist on their abolition and replacement A few things must be remembered about ICAP Along with the huge ECAR region an area twice the size of PJM the Duquesn e Light Control Area prior to January had no ACAP or ICAP rules And y et for the last years the lights have stayed on in Pittsburgh as well as or better than in PJM Even when PJM had rolling blackouts on January the Duquesne control area continued to provide reliable power So what will the million buy consumers More reliability No ACAP won t increase the Duquesne control areas historic level of reliability And e ven if it would why is it necessary Reliability in the Duquesne control a rea has been excellent In fact Duquesne and the rest of the ECAR area ens ure reliability through different equally effective but lowercost reliabi lity rules The Current ECAR Model The ECAR model could be summarized by the phrase pay only for what you nee d The current reliability mechanism is met through purchasing percent o perating reserves These are made up of Load and Frequency Regulating Spin ning Reserves percent and Contingency Reserves of percent divided in to percent of contingency Spinning Reserves and percent of Continge ncy Supplemental Reserves These reserves margins have served western Penns ylvanians well resulting in reliable service equal to and in some cases exceeding PJM Reserve payments compensate only those units that are not operating at the time but have the capability of generating in less than minutes The cos t for these reserves is not easily calculated due to lack of a transparent market Yet they appear to be approximately less than MWday during onp eak periods and often less than MWday This would result in costs of le ss than MWday based on the Allegheny Power peak load The cost for a typical residential customer would be cents per kWh The Current PJM Model The PJM model could similarly be described as pay for everything and stil l pay extra for what you need Generators receive three payments the rese rve payments mentioned above a capacity payment and an energy payment PJ M like ECAR has a need for operating reserves and purchases these in orde r to maintain reliability Additionally the PJM model provides an Unforced Capacity payment to all generators based on their historical performance Generators receive this payment whether or not they are able to operate on a particular day or are already being compensated for providing electricity PJM currently compensates generators based on a percent reserve margin The overall cost of ICAP has varied considerably over the three years of competition The average since has been MWday This results in overall costs of over billion per year Residential customers have ex perienced ICAP costs ranging from about to cents per kWh Moreover on top of ICAP a PJM customer must purchase additional spinning reserves costing approximately the same as the reserves in ECAR Ending the Ripoff PJM should move to a reservebased reliability methodology similar to ECAR An Operating Reservebased methodology used in tandem with PJMs competiti ve electricity market will furnish the same level of reliability but at gre atly reduced prices This methodology should pay for those products that ar e really needed excess reserves to be used during peak demand periods A strong forward energy and operating reserve market can send the right price signals to build new generation a fact that is readily apparent as we lo ok to the Midwest where thousands of megawatts of new generation have been built in response to clear price signals over the past few years All this tells us that ICAP has its selfinterested defenders

for Pennsylvania in observing Californias illfated approach to electric restructuring is that it tempts smugness to which Pennsylvania could easily fall prey since it has chartered a different a nd so far much more successful path from monopoly to competition Pennsylvan ia primarily differs from California by its sincere commitment to create genuinely competitive retail markets While many states say that they want competition and have even passed laws that supposedly require it only Pennsylvania and a handful of other states have matched their words with procompetition policies To deliver on its commitment of a genuinely competitive retail market the Commonwealth is implementing unique and specific policies that should give customers real choices and break the dominance of incumbent utilities Amon g Pennsylvanias more notable transition measures are much higher shopping credits rejection of accelerated stranded cost recovery longer transition periods competitive default service for a portion of the nonshopping load and retail rate caps that continue until at least and as late as But despite the different route taken this is no time for smugness Pennsylvania must be alert and learn from but not follow Californias wak e On electric policy Californias ship of state has sailed like the Titanic ignoring warnings of icebergs ahead while maintaining high speed on the open sea The national press of course flocks to cover news of the shipwreck As always bad news is more dramatic therefore judged to be the better story than the good news of Pennsylvanias success Unfortunately the nation as a whole may draw the incorrect lesson from Californias voyage that electric restructuring is unsafe at any speed or on any course That would be as erroneous an assumption as deciding based on the Titanics illfated voyage that ocean travel is too dangerous Calm waters now but dangers ahead Pennsylvania however would be just as incorrect to conclude that its successful first three years and ten months of transition means no more icebergs lie ahead At least two big obstacles are now visible First the wholesale market in western Pennsylvania is not genuinely competitive primarily because no Independent System Operator ISO covers the regions utility service territories The absence of a competitive transparent and liquid wholesale market in western Pennsylvania creates a major threat to the success of retail competition there Taking strong action now to require that Allegheny Energy Duquesne Light and Pennsylvania Power join the already functioning PJM Independent System Operator will keep the transition on course in western Pennsylvania Second throughout Pennsylvania there is now inadequate demandside response to market prices This problem partly results from too little deployment of timeofuse meters uncertainty about terms for competitive access to those timeofuse meters that are deployed and too little use o f available appliance control technology In order to give customers more control over their bills and to limit wholesale market price spikes customers must be able to change their demand in response to wholesale prices Even though the poor state of the wholesale market in Western Pennsylvania and the limited demandside response to price are substantial difficulties Pennsylvanias success may cause us to ignore their presence Since Pennsylvania began its transition to retail electric competition on January the Commonwealth has built the most successful retail mark et in the nation and possibly the world According to the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue see wwwrevenuestatepaus electric competitio n has saved consumers billion and will create new jobs by An d since January customers have chosen a competitive supplie r even though high wholesale market prices this summer encouraged some most ly larger customers to return to their utility Despite those difficulties more customers have switched to a new supplier in Pennsylvania than in the rest of the nation combined An incredible percent of Duquesne Lights residential customers have switched Allegheny Energys innovative municip al aggregation program and Duquesne Lights transition policies deserve much praise for this result Equally noteworthy are the approximately customers that have purchased cleaner or renewable energy products mainly thanks to the green trailblazing by GreenMountaincom Of course GreenMountaincom is not alone in the marketplace More compani es are actively competing for accounts in Pennsylvania than in any other stat e New Internet retailers of electricity and other products like Utilitycom and OnlineChoice have entered the market Just yesterday The New Power Company a joint venture of Enron AOL and IBM announced it had entered t he PECO Energy service territory and guaranteed residential customers savings up to on the electricity portion of the bill Between traditional suppliers Internet retailers and green marketers sufficient market entry has occurred to make competition intense at times In the PECO Energy market as many as suppliers at one time have competed for residential customers In this competitive intensity built megawatts of new generation within the PJM power pool By PJM expects another megawatts to be generated mainly from natural gas power plants which are to cleaner in emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide than many coal plants Renewable energy technologies will provide the remaining new suppl y that does not come from natural gas Indeed the year ushered in Pennsylvanias first two operating wind energy farms Both wind farms were financed as a result of successful marketing of renewable energy products to retail customers primarily by GreenMountaincom with a helping hand from Community Energy Inc The Green Mountain megawatt wind farm in Somerset County is one of the largest ea st of the Mississippi Through their purchases of renewable energy and cleaner energy products Pennsylvanias families and businesses are acting powerfully to change t he electricity industry and to reduce smog acid rain and emission of global warming gases Switching to renewable energy products to power their homes and businesses is the single most effective thing Pennsylvanians can do to clean their environment Every residential customer that switches to a renewable product on average prevents an amount of pollution that is equivalent to not driving miles taking cars off the road or planting trees All this is indeed a remarkable record of success of which Pennsylvania should be proud But to avoid peril Pennsylvanias policymakers must quickly identify the icebergs ahead continue forward at a safe speed and change course as needed Proceeding in this sensible fashion is easier because Pennsylvania began as early as January its journey into competition By beginning early Pennsylvania could opt for a steady transition pace and transition periods that are long enough to allow the development of genuinely competitive wholesale and retail markets before fully ending rate regulation of generation The transition to full generation price deregulation will last until at least and as long as in the various service territories While allowing utilities to recover approved stranded costs Pennsylvania generally has not accelerated stranded cost recovery To balance stranded cost payments to utilities electric rates offered by those utilities are capped Utilities transmission and distribution rates are capped at Ja nuary levels until December in PPL GPU and probably Duquesne until December in Allegheny Energy and until Dec in PE CO Energy Generation rates of utilities are also capped The generation rate caps la st at least until and as long as Specifically generation rates are capped in Duquesne until December December in Allegheny Energy December in PPL and December in PECO Energy and GPU The rates are normally capped at January levels until a t which point the rate cap period continues with modest increases allowed during the remainder of it Avoiding the obstacles Although this rate of speed is sensible Pennsylvania must make an immedia te course correction to ensure that by the service territories and customers of Allegheny Energy Duquesne Light Company and Pennsylvania Power are served by PJM an effective approved Independent System Ope rator ISO that now serves twothirds of Pennsylvania Presently Allegheny Duquesne and Penn Power are not part of any ISO and the absence of an ISO makes it impossible to build healthy competitive wholesale and retail markets in those regions To repeat neither wholesale nor retail competition can work if all service territories in Pennsylvania are not part of an ISO The ISO ensures that th e wholesale electric market is workably competitive the power supply is reliable and consumers are protected from anticompetitive market manipulation Presently the wholesale market in western Pennsylvania is not genuinely competitive The poor state of wholesale competition exists because its utilities are not part of an ISO that would expand the size of the market i n which electricity could be freely traded The Duquesne service territory in particular would have more choices and possibly lower prices were it part of a viable ISO At this point the only viable ISO that Allegheny Duquesne Light and Penn Power could join is PJM Yet no progress in requiring Allegheny and Duques ne to join PJM has been made since when the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission PUC made membership in PJM or an effective ISO a condition of the proposed AlleghenyDuquesne merger When the merger plans collapsed ISO membership and expansion of PJM disappeared from the radar screen However it is PennFutures understanding that Chairman Quain has put PJM expansion back on the PUCs agenda If so he is doing the right thing PennFuture knows that APS and Duquesne Light in part due to Chairman Quains prodding will soon decide whether they will voluntarily join PJM Indeed we believe that Duquesne Light would like to become a PJM member but needs Allegheny to join as well for Duquesnes customers to gain the full benefits of PJM membership In order to expand into western Pennsylvania PJM itself must remove a barrier by abolishing its installed capacity ICAP rule Allegheny Duquesne and Penn Power have never adopted PJMs peculiar ICAP rule O f course without ICAP the western Pennsylvania utilities have operated as reliably or more so than the existing PJM utilities PJM expansion would b e the final nail in the ICAP coffin yet another benefit of expanding PJM The recently announced proposed merger between First Energy and GPU creates another chapter in the PJM tale GPU is part of PJM First Energy is not Therein lies the seed of a possibly disastrous conflict The First Energy and GPU merger will not be in the public interest and not be approved unle ss more competitive choices more consumer savings more clean energy or mor e demandside response is added or without ironclad commitments that GPU will remain within PJM and that First Energy will join PJM Given the uncertain outcome of the ongoing informal discussions about the expansion of PJM Pennsylvanias officials need to let all concerned know that if they do not join PJM voluntarily they will be ordered to do so The PUC may be able to do this with existing authority If not the Pennsylvania General Assembly must act The second iceberg that lies in Pennsylvanias path to electric transition is enabling first larger customers and eventually all consumers to change their electric usage in response to market prices All consumers must be given the ability to alter their demand in real time and before they get their electricity bills They must be immediately empowered in this way a nd prior to the expiration of generation rate caps Enabling retail consumers to change demand in response to market prices wi ll powerfully limit wholesale and retail prices The market monitoring unit of PJM calculates that a percent reduction about mW in demand can reduce market prices by about centskWh Customerdetermined demand modification and reduction is vital to protecting consumers businesse s and families from unreasonable price spikes Increasing the ability of consumers to change demand in response to price also offers environmental benefits from reduced emissions of pollutants from power plants Empowering consumers to change their demand in response to price requires installation of advanced meters that record usage hourly and appliance control technology Equipment that allows the remote resetting of thermostats is now available and should be made widely available to consumers So far few if any competitive suppliers are offering meterin g services Market forces have not been sufficient to universally deploy timeofuse meters though Duquesne and PECO Energy should be complimented for widely deploying the technology in their service territories PennFuture therefore recommends that Pennsylvania require the installati on of advanced meters by January for all commercial and industrial customers with demand greater than kW By all customers must have their usage recorded by an advanced meter The distribution utilities shou ld install meters for consumers who are not offered advanced meters by competitive suppliers Given the investments already made by Duquesne and PECO Energy this recommendation is not onerous and it is achievable As important as installing timeofuse meters is ensuring reasonable access to those meters by all market participants Competitive suppliers when serving customers should be allowed to lease the use of any timeofuse meters that have been deployed Terms for leasing must be reasonable and allow the offering of competitive power products that allow customers to decide whether and how to change their usage Other recommendations In addition to expanding PJM to western Pennsylvania and increasing demandside response to market prices PennFuture recommends that a summit of the Pennsylvania Congressional delegation be convened so that it may pu sh for comprehensive federal legislation that would remove barriers to wholesale competition and cleaner energy on a national level Pennsylvania has a lot at stake in ensuring that national markets are competitive and cleaner Unfortunately restructuring legislation is now in the grips of Washington gridlock The Pennsylvania delegation can play an important rol e in fashioning national markets that help Pennsylvania steer clear of icebergs We further recommend that PJM or the PUC investigate whether its auction rules for the hourly spot market promote healthy wholesale competition Questions have been raised about whether the existing rules that allow the last unit dispatched to set the price of the whole pool are susceptible to anticompetitive strategic bidding This matter is complicated and importan t It should be considered carefully The best means of doing so is to create a formal process that allows all concerned parties an opportunity to comment Either PJM of the PUC should create this opportunity Finally the recent Pennsylvania Department of Revenue study provides ample reason to repeal the Revenue Neutral Reconciliation RNR surcharge to the electricity Gross Receipts Tax GRT The RNR shrinks the purchasing power of the shopping credit and produces uncertainty in yeartoyear supplier offers because the RNR changes each year to make up a deficit in direct electricity tax revenues to the General Fund According to the Department of Revenue by fiscal year sales tax and personal income tax gains alon e from electric competition are estimated to be over million Given that an additional million in state tax revenues would reduce the RNR rate by one mill and that the decision on whether to eliminate the RNR will be ma de in the Legislature should consider phasing out the RNR at this time PennFuture believes that making these course corrections will avoid the icebergs that lie ahead and continue Pennsylvanias

in the energy market October Vol No North By Southwest Allegheny joins PJM others to follow In the s Horace Greeley urged a generation to go West One hundred sixty years later thanks to the cooperation of Allegheny Energy PJM is expanding westward and increasing the likelihood that a wholesale electricity market that is liquid transparent and genuinely competitive will stake a claim in western Pennsylvania and beyond On October th Allegheny Energy and PJM agreed to develop PJM West a separate entity that should spur reform and substantial expansion of the original PJM PJM West will not utilize the discredited Installed Capacity ICAP rules now employed by PJM On ICAP the biggest consumer ripoff in the wholesale electric marketplace PJM becomes a house divided and ICAP s days are numbered For this reason alone PJM West is a welcome sight on the horizon Initially PJM West will contain Allegheny Energys service territory wh ich includes parts of Pennsylvania Maryland West Virginia and Ohio But soon more control areas will follow Allegheny Energys trail and go West Serving the Pittsburgh area Duquesne Light Company is also actively considering joining PJM West In its October th filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC Duquesne states If Allegheny s memorandum of understanding with PJM results in Alleghenys affiliation with PJM Duquesne also will be contiguous with PJM In anticipation of that event Duquesne has commenced discussions with PJM to discuss the process by which PJM might admit Duquesne to PJMWest Although Duquesne states that it is also considering membership in the Alliance RTO we would bet the ranch that PJM West will become a reality an d that Duquesne will join it Moreover not far behind Allegheny Energy and Duquesne Light may well be First Energy and some other utilities that are now part of the Alliance RTO proposal Congratulations to Allegheny Energy for giving the people of its service territory access to the existing megawatt PJM wholesale market a market that is much more transparent liquid and competitive than its present control area In turn the successful integration of Allegheny Energy and Duquesne Light into the PJM market would effectively increase i t by about megawatts PJM West the proposal PJM and Allegheny Energys Memorandum of Understanding establishes a vi sion for PJM West Allegheny Energy and PJM will form an independent transmissi on company that will regain from PJM subject to FERC acceptance those operational and management functions that are needed for the successful operation of an independent transmission business PJM West will set up its own office and the PJM West Transmission Owners would transfer monitoring and functional control of their transmission systems to PJM It will also expand the PJM system management concepts beyond a single control area with the potential for a significantly larger energy market that could include Ohios First Energy Corp Allegheny will adopt PJMs market operations policies It will cede functional control of its transmission assets to PJM eliminate pancake d transmission rates utilize locational marginal pricing and work with the FERC and other regional RTOs to develop rate reciprocity agreements and a transitional rate structure that will be revenue neutral PJM will be the OASIS operator for PJM West Allegheny Energy will operate under the existing ECAR rules regarding operating reserve requirements reserve sharing and other operating standards and will work with PJM to develop a regime to ensure that PJM West receives full credit for its capacity anywhere within the PJM market ICAP will not be expanding into PJM West PJM will retain certain functions related to the operation of the energy market including the PJM market congestion management protocol and marke t monitoring responsibilities Allegheny Energy will freely participate in th e PJM energy market including the necessary wholesale price cap By providi ng access to PJMs energy market PJM West may also give Allegheny Energy a means of meeting the scheduling needs of several proposed wind farms in it s control areas and avoiding an unfortunate regulatory battle see Electricitys Oktoberfest Trouble blowing in the wind PennFut ures E Vol No Oct In what is hopefully just a politically necessary fig leaf the Memorandum of Understanding states that Allegheny Energy will remain a distinct contro l area from PJM The purpose of this language is not clear and appears inconsistent with the whole purpose of PJM This point needs clarification and bears watching The timeline set out in the agreement includes negotiation for a definitive contract to be completed by February execution prior to March and implementation by December PJM West unravels Alliance The rise of PJM West spells the demise of the marketbalkanizing Alliance RTO proposal With its proven record of competency and governance independence PJM offers a much better vehicle for bringing RTO services t o the service territories that would be served with the untested unknown Alliance start up To us the only certainty about the Alliance proposal i s that it will create one otherwise avoidable transmission rate tollbooth an d constrain the size of the wholesale market With the alternative of PJM West FERC and state utility commissions should now use their authority to shoot down the Alliance RTO proposal Placing RT O conditions that protect the public interest on the proposed merger of First Energy and GPU would be a good start down that road First Energy should be given no choice but to leave the Alliance and join PJM at least if they wa nt to merge with GPU First Energy itself has reportedly signaled to its Alliance partners that the merger with GPU comes before the Alliance First Energys departure from the Alliance RTO the principal strategic purpose of which appears to be keeping its member utilities out of PJM and the Midwest ISO and to fracture the wholesale market between Philadelphia and Chicago would help unravel that counterproductive proposal and have several benefits All of Orions generation that was purchased from Duq uesne and still serves Duquesnes customers would be within one RTO Converse ly if First Energy were to remain in the Alliance some of Orions generat ion would be located in the Alliance and some in PJM West assuming Duquesne joins PJM West Requiring First Energy to join PJM West would not only de al with that seams issue but would also further expand the size and liquidit y of the wholesale market in the eastern United States First Energys ISO games While the agreement between Allegheny and PJM paves the way for Duquesne t o join PJM what about PennPower the subsidiary of First Energy that serves some suburbs of Pittsburgh and up to the New Castle area of the Commonwealth Is there any hope for PennPower customers or worse might First Energy try to balkanize PJM by taking GPU out of PJM Moving GPU out of PJM would be the electric utility equivalent of suggesti ng that one of the states should secede from the Union and join Mexico Ye t First Energy may well have planned to remove GPU from PJM and collapse it into the Alliance or simply a larger First Energy Such a bold move would undoubtedly be vigorously opposed by the Pennsylvania and New Jersey Publi c Utility Commissions The state commissions have great leverage while the merger is pending but once the merger is approved the state commissions power to protect the public interest diminishes Moreover as a result of the Centerior and Fir st Energy merger First Energy has a track record with RTOs and mergers that does not inspire confidence It brings to mind the saying Fool me onc e shame on you fool me twice shame on me Consequently the only way to make sure that First Energy will not remove GPU from PJM is for the commissions of Pennsylvania and New Jersey to craft a set of conditions on the merger that make any such decision impossibly painful Those conditions must also be effectively securitized by the equivalent of a liquidated damages clause that would compensate Pennsylvan ia and New Jersey were First

current themes and trends in the energy market July Vol No Market Lessons from Schools still out for summer but just as the new and improved Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC issued a watershed RTO decision last week which could lead to substantial expansion of PJM into the Northeast P JM s State of the Market Report contains some interesting information an d lessons for us After the California experience demonized spot electricity markets it wou ld surprise many that PJMs spot energy market was a bargain Spot pr ices in were below per megawatthour MWh or three cents per kilowatthour kWh percent of the hours in the year The single highest hourly price was per MWh or cents per kWh but prices reached or exceeded per MWh during only hours in the entire year download charts on our website by typing wwwpennfutureorgitemshourlypricechartspdf in your browser By contrast California experienced spot prices that often exceeded per MWh for most of the last months Authored by the PJM Market Monitoring Unit but likely reviewed and ed ited by top PJM management the Report delivered to FERC concludes that all of the markets operated by PJM were reasonably competitive It cautions however that there are potential threats to competition in the energy capacity and regulation markets that require ongoing scrutiny and in some cases may require action in order to maintain competition Market participants do possess some ability to exercise market power under certain conditions in PJM markets In order to maintain and improve the functioning of the PJM markets the Report recommends Retention of the MWh bid cap in the PJM energy market and investigation of other rule changes to reduce incentives to exercise marke t power Retention of the mw bid cap in the PJM regulation market Evaluation of additional actions to increase demandside responsiveness to price in both energy and capacity markets Modification of incentives in the capacity market to require all Load Serving Entities LSEs to meet their obligations to serve load on a longerterm basis and require all capacity resources to be offered on a comparable longerterm basis The Report uses several analytical methods to reach these recommendations and conclusions including looking at the net revenue for generation from all sources the increase in bid amount over marginal cost market concentration as measured using the HHI index and lastly an analysis of the resulting prices See Spot go to market Perhaps the Reports most intriguing information on price trends concer ns the spot energy market where average prices declined by percent from levels Driven by lower peak prices in the most expensive hours o f the year the average locational marginal price LMP in was p er MWh cents per kWh falling from the average of per MWh cents per kWh This average price decline in the spot market was more significant because it occurred even though fuel costs were sharply higher in Indeed the average fueladjusted LMP in declined to per MWh or percent from the price of per MWh And when one compares spot market prices to competitive future prices for the year and to regulated rates for generation it becomes clear that spot market prices in were significantly lower than future contracts Even with appropriate price adjustments to facilitate comparison they were also much lower than regulated residential generation rates for all hours charged by Pennsylvanias six major elec tric utilities which ranged from about dollars to dollars per MWh or to cents per kWh The lesson Spot market prices which received so much bad publicity as a result of th e California fiasco can be a bargain and customers who are able to manage their demand to reduce or avoid the hours of high spot prices can reap maj or savings by purchasing electricity from the spot market In fact spot market prices in were below most of Pennsylvanias shopping credits or prices to compare Thats saying something since th e shopping credits in turn are as much as cents per kWh less than the regulated rate for just generation paid by customers to the monopoly utilities But Since spot market prices in were well below both the generation rate paid to monopolies and the much lower shopping credits why were ener gy suppliers increasingly unable to offer electricity at prices below the shopping credits ICAP pricing and reliance by electricity suppliers on higher priced future or forward market contracts supply most of the answer The spot market gives a good indication of what the forward markets should be under typical circumstances As the data below indicate the average sp ot market price for all market locations in was MWh almost percent less than during and more than percent lower upon adjusti ng for higher year fuel prices PJM LoadWeighted Average LMP MWh Change Average LMP Median LMP Standard Deviation Average Fuel Adjusted LMP Median Fuel Adjusted LMP Standard Deviation While the dramatically lower standard deviation in indicates that prices were much less volatile than in there remained a substantial gap between average and median prices indicating that extreme prices durin g a small number of hours continued to substantially skew overall average prices Grading on a curve The PJM price duration curves measuring the percent of time prices were at or below a particular level tell an interesting story As one wou ld expect with higher fuel prices especially for natural gas the general trend was for prices to be slightly higher during periods where natural ga s was the marginal fuel For approximately percent of all hours energy prices were more expensive than in Yet with relatively low peak demand the price for the most expensive percent of demand during was considerably lower in than in accounting for the entir e percent average reduction in prices from If not for the reduced prices for the most expensive percent of demand overall prices for likely would have risen approximately percent over due largely to higher fuel costs For these reasons the Report recommendation to evaluate additional actions to increase demandside responsiveness is SEVERELY understated PJ M and all consumers have an essential interest in implementing demandside response programs to the maximum economic level with dramatic implication s for saving individual consumers money improving system reliability keepi ng market prices lower for everyone and improving market competitiveness Can everyone say ICAP So with the lower wholesale energy prices and plenty of supply why did th e retail market sputter Installed capacity ICAP price increases are a partial explanation In addition to energy the controversial charge for ICAP is the other significant cost born by electricity consumers within PJM ICAP represents a call option on physical generation resources by PJM during system emergencies All LSEs are required to purchase an amount of installed capacity equivalent to their customers peak load contribution plus an adequate reserve margin currently percent But although it exists for reliability purposes PJM curtailed the export of energy outside PJM from PJMcommitted installed capacity on only one day during Logically the price for installed capacity like the price of energy mig ht have been expected to decrease during Yet that didnt occur As ener gy prices decreased within PJM they remained high or continued to increase i n surrounding control areas Higher prices in the surrounding markets led so me generation owners to delist their generation committed to PJM in order to sell out to other control areas without the risk of being curtailed by PJM The result was an increase in ICAP prices from an average of in to in The increase was concentrated over the summer with pric es in the daily markets rising to or more for most of June July and August The increase in ICAP prices raised the cost of supplying many reta il customers by about cent per kWh The Market Monitoring Unit concluded th at the price spikes over the summer months were a direct result of the opportunity cost associated with the prices in neighboring control areas But the Reports finding that the ICAP market was reasonably competiti ve seems inconsistent with PJMs conclusion last year that the ICAP m arket performed so poorly that it needed a major overhaul This inconsistency raises questions about the reasonableness of that portion of the Repo rt or giving the ICAP market the PJM seal of approval PJM has invested substantial time and resources since last summer in an extensive stakeholder process to revise its ICAP rules especially concerning the allocation of deficiency revenues and the interval over whic h ICAP is purchased But since the reformed ICAP market began operating onl y recently on July its too soon to know whether it is functioning well or competitively We remain skeptical that the PJM prescription cures the disease or is merely life support for a dying program See Spot offer lower prices Apart from the ICAP market the differing prices in forward and spot marke ts provide substantial explanations for why electricity suppliers have found it easy to beat the regulated generation rate for most utilities but difficult or even impossible to beat the lower shopping credits Shopping credit D regulated generation rate stranded generation cost Prior to the summer season prices in the forward markets before anyone kn ew how mild the weather was going to be substantially reflected the highpriced experience of Because of the high prices in energy that was purchased through forward markets about percent of all en ergy was considerably more expensive than the spot prices turned out to be Since customers often prefer to lock in a price in advance competitive suppliers generally didnt want to provide fixed prices below the retail shopping credits If suppliers had relied on the spot market they could have offered lower prices Also customers who can reduce or shift demand may well benefit from purchasing more power from the spot market Recent developments Both in the East and West coast markets this week electricity in daily trading has been near its low for the week period Several developments are pushing down the price of wholesale electricity Mild weather falling gas prices new generation coming online increasing demand response and conservation as well as a FERC which understands that competition must exi st prior to price deregulation are all pushing prices lower Moreover forwa rd market prices for within PJM are beginning to fall and are under downward price pressure The new downward trend in forward markets partially results from moderate prices this summer even during high demand periods with prices generally staying under MWh kWh A good example of this was July a relatively hot day with significant demand which saw prices reach per MWh for one hour but average per MWh for all onpeak hours Whats driving forward prices lower More efficient generation being installed below btukWh as opposed t o btukWh More ICAP in the market new capacity estimated at over MW with load growth at only percent or MW More demandresponsive load in the form of additional MW of Active Loa d Management The addition of PJM West slated for with lower prices generally Lower natural gas prices falling from mmBtu in July to mmBtu as of July This good news which suggests that retail customers in late or may again see retail competitive offers below the Pennsylvania shopping credits must be weighed against the troubled ICAP market ICAP remains an anachronism ICAP prices have not returned to competitive levels and remain one of the significant obstacles to serving retail customers The forward prices for ICAP alone have remained above percent of the typical shoppi ng credit Yet even in the world of ICAP there is hope ICAP prices may be beginning to soften in the face of a substantial amount of new generation that is comin g online and increased demand response from customers PJM has instituted bo th an emergency and an economic demandresponse program through which more customers can respond to prices and reduce the price that all customers pa y for electricity Tomorrows homework The State of the Market Report contains plenty of data which confirms that PJM is the countrys bestrun independent system operator and best tho ugh still flawed wholesale market Prices in the spot energy market were well below regulated generation rates even with appropriate adjustments But none of this warrants complacency Only when PJM becomes the first market to give consumers the tools they need to change their demand for electricity will the wholesale and retail

current themes and trends in the energy market June Vol No A Rock and a Hard Place Today the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission PUC voted to appro ve a settlementproposed by FirstEnergy GPU the Office of Consumer Advoc ate the Industrial Intervenor groups and PennFutureto resolve the FirstEnergyGPU merger and provider of last resort rate increase requests The PUC was faced with a seemingly intractable choice grant a rate increa se that violates the rate cap and risk unraveling every utility rate cap and stranded cost recovery decision in Pennsylvania or just saying no and riskaccording to GPUcreating a financially unstable distribution u tility In approving the settlement the PUC resolved the thorny issues raised by the cases without excusing GPUs failure to adequately plan its provide r of last resort service Considering the circumstances the result is good for consumers the companies and the environment But while Pennsylvania PUC approval was a major hurdle the New Jersey Boa rd of Public Utilities must still approve the merger as well and such approv al is anything but a sure thing Now that the PUC has made its decision lets break through the rhetori c assess the real issues in the proceeding and see how the settlement addresses them The Problem No matter who you are how you look at it or who you might blame the fundamental problem in this case is that GPU divested its generating asset s in and failed to protect its shareholders and customers from the possibility of rising wholesale prices In fact wholesale prices did rise the retail generation rate caps remained intact no competitive default service was established and GPU had insufficient longterm or lowerprice d generation contracts in place Alone among Pennsylvanias major utiliti es GPU was spending much more to buy wholesale generation than it was paid to sell that generation to its native load customers The real problem then was that GPU was running out of cash or credit to bu y wholesale generation to meet its obligations Although the company as a whole continued to fare well financially it became clear only towards the end of the proceedings that the Commission and the public interest require d a solution which would enable GPU to continue to deliver provider of last resort generation service and to do so without breaking the rate caps If the Commission didnt find a solution by June GPU could have been fr ozen out of the capital markets and would have come back to the Commission for emergency rate reliefrequiring a whole new set of proceedings concerni ng the same facts The Solution The preferred solution was to merge GPU and FirstEnergy and to establish a n accounting deferral for GPU energy costs The merger is a good solution in part because it overcomes the cash flow necessary to buy generation on the market Any cash generated by a modest rate increase trickles in over time and is of secondary importance so any modest rate increase wasnt goin g to solve the problem FirstEnergy a huge generation owner can provide some of the needed generationeven at market priceswithout requiring the GP U utilities to pay cash on time With a merged company there is plenty of room for internal accounting flexibility And as a huge wholesale generation player FirstEnergy can also better manage wholesale purchasing The deferral is a good solution too because the rate caps remain intact Consumers wont pay more for electricity Finally GPU will be able to reenter the capital markets and although they are given a lifeline G PU shareholders are not taken off the hook for the companys past performa nce Thus on May the Commission approved the merger itself and allow ed GPU to establish deferral of generation expenses for accounting purposes The issues to be addressed in the settlement as directed by the Commissio n in its Order concerned passing on mergerrelated benefits to consumers an d GPUs generation costs Todays settlement addresses these directive s by extending the distribution rate cap from through rather than violating the generation rate caps providing a mechanism for GPU to write off andor recover its generation expenses from existing revenues over time establishing a demandside response program to minimize future generation expenses for the company and all consumers and committing the company to contribute million now to the GPU Sustainable Development Funds and invest another million in renewable energy projects How the Deferral Accounting Works The deferral provisions allow GPU to retain unrecovered generation costs o n its books until but doesnt require GPU consumers to pay more as a result The rate caps are left intact Some excess generation costs will be reduced on the companys books if future energy prices decrease sufficiently The settlement also increases the shopping credit modestly while correspondingly reducing the Competitive Transition Charge CTC so some of the possible excess generation costs also may be recovered from existing C TC revenue which otherwise would have been applied against company stranded costs Doing so does not increase consumer payments however because the GPU Restructuring Settlement allowed CTC collection to continue as lo ng as in order to take into account the unknown level of nonutility generation NUG costs and divestiture proceeds that were a major portion o f total GPU stranded costs The settlement cuts off CTC collection for GPU in rather than permitting CTC collection from Met Ed customers to continue until as long as Best current estimates are that the Met Ed CTC would have continued to about Now any stranded costs not recovered by must be written off reducing consumer payment of stranded costs This will provide a modest improvement in the opportunity to shop and for a competitive mark et to develop Any remaining excess generation costs must be written off by The settlement also redefines the way that NUG stranded costs are calculated Under the Restructuring Settlement the amount by which N UG payments exceed the market value capped rate are stranded costs As change d only the portion of a NUG payment that exceeds the higher of the capped ra te or the market price is recoverable as stranded costs This change corrects what turned out to be an inaccurate assumption that the market price of generation would always be below the capped rate but it does not affect NU G contracts in any way The NUGs still get whatever they are entitled to unde r their contracts without changes and even benefit because their payor will become the financially stronger merged FirstEnergy instead of GPU The Benefits The primary and crucial benefit to the consumer is that provider of last resort generation service will continue within capped rates The primary benefit to the company is that the deferral accounting allows the company maximum flexibility to recover costs and to write off unrecovered costs But perhaps the most important aspect of the settlement is that it establishes a firm commitment and mechanism for FirstEnergy to address the underlying problem by reducing its exposure to high energy costs with a comprehensive demand side response program While the details of the progra m remain to be developed the company commitment includes an effort to maximize the costeffective reduction of peak load through interva l and timeofuse metering appliance control technologies and open architecture Its goals are to include participation by all customer classes and competitive suppliers and to be available by next summer If no program agreement is reached all parties may address the issues in a future Commission proceeding The other environmental benefits are real if not as comprehensive as one might have preferred FirstEnergy will give million in company money to the GPU Sustainable Development Funds within days This contribution is in addition to those already made by GPU but replaces the centskwh o f GPU ratepayer money that might have been provided between and IF the Commission did not change distribution rates by that time FirstEnergy in consultation with PennFuture will also invest an addition al million in renewable energy Like all provisions of the settlement th e environmental provisions are subject to PUC oversight What the Settlement Does Not Do First the settlement does not really resolve what would happen in the eve nt that the merger falls throughif for example the New Jersey BPU rejec ts the merger All of the agreements would be tossed except the agreement to deal with the deferral account for generation costs authorized by the Commission on May GPU would write off all generation costs prior to Ju ne while it would recover the costs incurred after June in a manner and at a time to be determined in Commission proceedings Nothing i n this provision assumes a rate increase or breaking the rate caps For example the costs could be recovered in a manner comparable to the deferr al accounting in the event that the merger is completed The settlement also does not allow FirstEnergy to raid any pension funds Federal law and union contracts govern pension plan funding and tolerate some withdrawals with major tax penalties GPU unions support the settlement The settlement does not shut down or clean up all of FirstEnergys foss il generation plants or figure out how to safely eliminate FirstEnergys nuclear waste Finally the settlement does not establish lower competitive wholesale and retail market prices in the FirstEnergy and GPU territories or jump start the competitive market Yeah that would have been nice too Ecubed is available for reprint in newspapers and other publications Authors are available for print or broadcast PennFuture wwwpennfutureorg with

in the energy market November Vol No Pennsylvanias First Successful CDS Auction An important new regulatory skirmish has broken out before the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission PUC over which company has won the right to provide default generation service to customers of PECO Energy an Exelon Company This skirmish is actually good news for consumers and is t he fruit of the PECO Energy restructuring settlement agreement a landma rk document that ended a ferocious regulatory war when all combatants signed it The peace treaty includes a requirement that PECO Energy bid out de fault service for of its customers and PECO has done so Green Mountain Energy Company is now challenging PECO Energys decision that New Power won the auction to provide the settlements mandated default service Both Green Mountain and New Power are offering those consumers sma ll rate reductions compared to customers receiving default service from PECO and more electricity generated from renewable energy resources Specifically New Power and Green Mountain are offering generation service to Rate R residential customers for approximately cents per kilowatthour That offer is cents per kilowatthour less than PECO Energys unbundled generation and transmission rate of cents per kilowatthour and cents per kilowatthour less than the shopping cred it of The consumer savings that these offers represent is masked or reduced by t he stranded cost payments that consumers must pay PECO Energy Indeed were it not for stranded cost payments the New Power and Green Mountain offers would reduce total bills by about cents per kilowatthour or The dispute between New Power and Green Mountain is noteworthy because it proves that companies will compete vigorously to provide default service if shopping credits and lengths of contracts are set at reasonable levels It also shows that renewable energy portfolio standards can be met economically Finally the result of this case will switch more customers to competitive suppliers in one day than the total number who switched in California over a period of nearly three years When the PUC anoints New Power or Green Mountain as the winner if all consumers opt to stay with the CDS provider the total number of customers in Pennsylvania that will be served by a competitive supplier wil l jump to more than Of this total will be residential customers of PECO a number equal to of the PECO residential class CDS Background In Pennsylvania there must always be a default sup plier or provider of last resort to assure that service is always availab le to all customers The incumbent utility is the default supplier unless the P UC decides otherwise The default supplier must provide generation service to customers who do not have a competitive supplier either because they chose not to shop or did not find a willing supplier at an acceptable price The PECO Restructuring Case Settlement initially defined CDS service in paragraph On January of all of PECOs residential customers determined by random selection including lowincome and inabilitytopay customers and without regard to whether such customers are obtaining generation service from an EGS shall be assigned to a provider of last resortdefault supplier other than PECO that will be selected on the basis of a Commissionapproved energy and capacity market price bidding process This service shall be referred to as Competitive Default Service CDS The same approach was used in the other Settlements in the GPU PPL and APS restructuring cases CDS reflects an effort to assure that there is at leas t one other large competitor in each market CDS also has a renewable portfolio standard RPS even though there is no RPS for regulated utilities in Pennsylvania The winning bidder must supply of its offered energy supply for CDS service from renewable r esources of solar wind sustainable biomass including landfill gas but excluding incineration of Municipal Solid Waste geothermal or ocean power The renewable energy increment shall increase by annual increments of thereafter This increasing renewable requirement continues indefinitely meaning that in year four of the CDS there will be a renewable requirement in year five and so on This is significant as each extra percent of renewab le energy used to serve the customer block prevents approximately tons of NOx tons of SO and tons of CO from being emitted by fossil fuel burning power plants PECOs CDS RFP Importantly the PECOUnicom merger case modified the CD S bidding process as established by the settlement Of particular note the revisions eliminated the customer care functions from CDS mad e the contract three years long to help spread out return of startup costs and instituted several rounds of selection in the event that prior efforts yielded no successful CDS contract PECO issued its initial RFP for CDS on April and Shell Energy Services submitted the only bid However the PUC rejected the bid as nonconforming and denied Shells Petition for Reconsideration of its decision Pursuant to the modifications in the merger settlement PECO entered into bilateral negotiations based on an August RFP Three suppliers submitted conforming bids and PECO selected New Power as the winner on October New Power is the new competitive supplier actively marketing residential and small commercial customers in the PECO service territory and is backed by Enron AOL and IBM PECO and New Power negotiated a complete contract that is before the PUC f or approval on November Under the proposal PECO and New Power expanded the size of the CDS requirement to include of nonshopping residential customers instead of of all residential customers whether shopping or not This change was designed to implement paragraph of the Restructuring Settlement requiring adjustments to the numbers assigned to CDS in order to have of all PECO residential and commercial customers obtaining competitive generation as of January There also will be a second round of assignment of nonshopping customers as of October if New Power is providing CDS to fewer than of all PECO residential customers New Power electricity will be renewable in renewable in and renewable in as required but does not include a commitment to exceed the requirements or provide cleaner power for the nonrenewable portion of the product The price for New Powers CDS for Rate R customers would be below the shopping credit while residential heating customers on Rate RH would pay less than their shopping credit For a Rate R customer this would mean that overall rates would fall as energy and transmission falls from to for Rate RH rates would fall Customers assigned to CDS may still choose any competitive supplier or opt out and retain defau lt service from PECO without penalty or charge New Power will be able to off er its full slate of energy and nonenergy related products to these customer s Green Mountain asserts that approval of the PECONew Power contract is not in the public interest arguing that PECO ignored Green Mountains o ffer that included CDS pricing below the shopping credit for all residential customers including those on residential heating or offpeak service Lik e the New Power proposal the Green Mountain proposal would lower Rate R and RH rates and respectively Green Mountain asserts that the New Power rate cut for Rate R is only and not and argues that its product is better for the environment because the nonrenewable portion of the product would come from natural gas and hydro instead of system power generated primarily from coal and nuclear fuels If not declared the winni ng bidder Green Mountain proposes in the alternative that both they and New Power receive CDS contracts In response PECO states that all three bidders had the opportunity to submit revised bids and that the Green Mountain revised bid was not submitted until October days after the deadline and nine days after the selection of New Power as the winning bidder The PUC will sort out the facts and arguments on November Some think th at the PUC may very well split the customer block between Green Mountain and New Power Whatever the result customers in the Philadelphia area should receive yet another small price reduction more renewable energy and the opportunity f or a more competitive electricity market

in the energy market November Vol No No Pardon for this Turkey In Pennsylvania had the fourth dirtiest air in the nation For years Governor Ridge and Secretary Seif of the Department of Environmental Protection DEP have blamed power plants in Ohio for the Commonwealth s dirty air which damages our environment our economy and most importantl y the public health of Pennsylvanians But now the Governor DEP and most directly the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission PUC have the chance to apply Pennsylvania law to a major polluter of Pennsylvanias environmen t FirstEnergy of Ohio Having for years spewed soot and smogcausing pollution across the OhioPennsylvania border particularly victimizing Pittsburgh and western Pennsylvania FirstEnergy has come before the PUC in search of an official stamp of approval for its proposed merger with GPU Our officials should make it clear this merger wont just be rubberstamped They must hold this outofstate polluter accountable by ensuring that the price of merger approval is real benefits for consumers competition and the environment Since the August announcement of the proposed merger we have hoped that FirstEnergy would recognize the harm it has caused and have the grace to propose real concessions that would protect the public interest Silly us Last weeks merger Application filing by FirstEnergy proposes nothi ng that would benefit consumers or undo its damage to Pennsylvanias environment FirstEnergy apparently believes that it is still in Ohio where it is an pound political gorilla which gets all the bananas Perhaps with the he lp of GPUs political influence it thinks it has the same command here Pennsylvanians will soon see on whose side are our state officials The stakes are high and involve life and death According to a recent study air pollution from power plants specific ally fine particles resulting from emissions of nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide kills more than Americans each year nearly twice as m any as die from drunken driving accidents or homicides This study ranks Ohio second in the nation with annual deaths from health problems attributed to power plants Only Pennsylvania with deaths had more In total FirstEnergys plants are among the nations worst air pollu ters In FirstEnergy power plants pumped into the air over tons of SO and tons of NOx newsindexssfnewspdwpowerhtml as well a s million tons of CO a principal cause of global warming It alone is responsible for approximately and respectively of Ohio utilities SO CO and NOx emissions FirstEnergys sole fossil fuel plan t in Pennsylvania Bruce Mansfield contributes approximately and of all of Pennsylvania power plant SO CO and NOx emissions Not surprisingly given that record in November the United States Department of Justice and EPA brought suit against FirstEnergy subsidiaries Ohio Edison and Pennsylvania Power charging that modifications at the Sammis Plant in Jefferson County Ohio violated the Clean Air Act According to the United States the defendants made improvements at each o f the seven units at Sammis without applying required pollution control technology that would have sharply reduced emissions of nitrogen oxides sulfur dioxide and particulate matter Reducing these emissions would significantly reduce public health threats and environmental effects including acid rain and smog There should be no merger approval unless FirstEnergy agrees to clean up Sammis and settles this suit as Virginia Electric Power recently resolved a similar case The Turkey is Served The FirstEnergyGPU merger Application acknowledges that the PA PUC may approve the merger only if the commission shall find or determine that the granting of such certificate is necessary or proper for the service accommodation convenience or safety of the public Yet the proposal does not attempt to show that the merger would provide any specific public benefits Rather it attempts to put a spin on the requirement arguing th at the merger wont cause any harm because it wont change things very much The merger proposal itself places the companies between a rock and a hard place in gaining PUC approval The transaction represents the acquisition o f the GPU holding company by the FirstEnergy holding company The individual public utilities that are holdingcompany subsidiaries Met Ed Penele c and PennPower in Pennsylvania will continue to operate as they have without corporate or operational changes But the Public Utility Code does not allow PUC approval based on the wellbeing of the holding companies involved or their unregulated businesses Neither does the Code allow PUC approval based on the absence of significant harm to public service The proposal does however claim that the merger would provide substantial strategic company benefits and is expected to enhance FirstEnergys cash flow and earnings per share But for consumers the best the companies can muster is a vague claim that the larger company will be financially stronge r and more profitable and that the several regionally operated utilities wil l be able to share best practices It may be obvious to FirstEnergy that a bigger more profitable company is good for the company and its shareholders and therefore whats good for the shareholders is good for public service But these are not truths that we hold selfevident Before the PUC approves the merger it must be given affirmative reasons concerning the public benefit to do so Recently the PUC approved the PECOUnicom merger settlement which provid ed a long list of additional public benefits As modified from PECOs init ial proposal the PECOUnicom merger puts substantial muscle and dollars into rate cuts service improvements cleaner air affordable service for low income customers improving the competitiveness of the electricity market and many other identifiable tangible public benefits See Ecubed of Apri l Vol No Slicing the Turkey There are ways in which the merger could provide public benefits Lets look at the key benefits outlined in the merger proposal and briefly co nsider whether they provide a basis for public benefits and if not how they could FirstEnergy Becomes Big The merger would create the nations sixth largest investorowned electric system based on number of customers Bigger is not inherently better for consumers In fact it could make thin gs worse for consumers Access to the Wholesale Electric Market The companies point out that FirstEnergy would have the largest customer base in the PJM Power Pool and its customer base in the state region that FirstEnergy has targeted for growth would double How will that benefit consumers in Pennsylvania There are ways discussed below but FirstEnergy doesnt seem to have identified them let alone m ade any commitment Transmission System Integration The companies identify that joining their contiguous transmission and distribution systems provides the basis for wholesale market opportunities and that the companies intend to keep GPU in PJM GPU is currently part of PJM the most effective ISO in the nation FirstEnergy is not a part of any functioning ISO In fact the Application affirms that FirstEnergy continues to hold onto hopes that the Alliance RTO will become operational although there is no basis at this time to expect that it will become a fully functioning ISO which would serve the market a nd consumers as required The merged companies would not be able to integrate their transmission systems serving the public interest and obtaining the companies anticipated wholesale market benefits unless FirstEnergy jo ins PJM FirstEnergy has no viable nearterm alternative to joining PJM And the recent announcement that APS will join and create PJMWest precludes any attempt to argue to the contrary Neither wholesale nor retail competition can work without a fully functioning ISO to ensure that the wholesale electric market is workably competitive the power supply is reliable and consumers are protected fro m anticompetitive market manipulation If FirstEnergy were to join PJM it would expand the size of the market in which electricity could be freely traded benefiting FirstEnergy its customers and all consumers within the PJM market from New Jersey to the Indiana state line The Application also states that the companies intend that GPU will remain in PJM but includes no firm commitment If GPU were pulled out of PJM th e merger would be categorically contrary to the public interest no matter what other benefits might be provided In order for the merger to provide public benefits it cannot be approved without an ironclad requirement that GPU will remain in PJM and that FirstEnergy will join Solve GPUs POLR Disaster The proposal vaguely suggests that the me rger may help contribute to meeting GPUs provideroflastresort requirement s for electricity customers in its Pennsylvania and New Jersey service areas GPU made its POLR bed and should be made to lie in it The rate cap is a promise that cannot be broken and is a consumer right that exists with or without this merger it is not a merger benefit Expanding customer opportunities to shop and demandside response should be a major part of the plan to reduce company POLR exposure FirstEnergy shoul d commit to deploying realtime meters and appliance control technology which would empower customers to save money by changing their demand in response to market prices Selling FirstEnergy Generation in the PJM Market The companies emphasi ze the important wholesale market opportunity to sell MW of generation capacity in the east FirstEnergy cannot improve on its present ability to sell into the PJM market without first joining PJM Additionally expanding the PJM market can make it much more competitive a nd provide public benefits but there must be strong and specific commitments to improve competitive market conditions clean up FirstEnergys dirty power plants and substantially expand the availability of cleaner renewable generation Expand Unregulated Business Opportunities The proposal identifies increased market and growth opportunities for FirstEnergys natural gas resources and both companies mechanical contracting and construction telecommunications and eprocurement resources That may well be a benefit of the merger to the companies and their shareholders but it has nothing to do with public service or merger approval If anything unregulated business growth and profits up the ante for providing more regulated business savings and other benefits to consumers Merger Savings The proposal vaguely argues merger savings but presents only a crude estimate of million that are expected to come from the elimination of duplicative activities improved operating efficiencies mo re efficient use of generation assets and the combination of the companies work forces Only a portion of such savings would be from regulated service in Pennsylvania If the merger wont provide real opportunities for cost savings the companies have a heavy burden to demonstrate why not and to provide other ways in which the merger will provide alternative public benefits For example FirstEnergy claims that its creation in upon the merger of Ohio Edison and Centerior already has delivered million of the promis ed billion in savings with million in annual recurring savings And cost savings should mean rate cuts the most basic consumer benefit from a utility merger but the proposal promises nothing Therefore th e merger must not be approved unless a substantial portion of economic benefits are shared with consumers or provide other public benefits Other key points The proposal states that the companies will maintain separate utility operations and seek to minimize the effects of workforce reductions through hiring limits attrition and separation programs and honoring all labor agreements Wow What a commitment to their workers and our communities The only specific commitment made is to retain GPU charitable giving levels for thr ee years Even that represents a lack of immediate harm not a public benefit What would actually happen in Reading and Johnstown Were Still Hungry The FirstEnergyGPU merger as proposed will not be in the public interest and should not be approved The PUC must make consumer savings service improvements more competitive choices cleaner energy and similar public service gains the requirements for merger approval And the PUC must ensur e improved demandside response opportunities and a more competitive wholesa le and retail market by compelling First Energy to join PJM That is the very least that should be expected and the very least that FirstEnergy owes the people and

current themes and trends in the energy market December Vol No Demand Sides Promise The coldest days of the year are when wholesale electricity prices are amo ng their highest and when the risks of blackouts are greatest least welcome and even dangerous On these days frequently around the holidays our electric system and wallets are stressed to the limit As energy demand surges prices in the wholesale electric market skyrocket with price caps serving as the only limits to the pricing power of wholesale suppliers An d as more electricity is generated old fossil fuel power plants emit more a nd more pollution into our environment At the other extreme the hottest days of the year present the same scenario often with the added designation of being the smoggiest days Sometimes the smog caused in part by the sun heating up pollutants emi tted from power plants is so bad that people are advised to stay indoors a nd thousands with respiratory illness crowd emergency rooms across the nation Yet we could all breathe easier save money and worry less about our pow er going out if many more consumers were given the opportunity to change the ir electric usage in response to escalating prices and to profit from doing so In electric restructuring vocabulary demandside response is typically used to describe these consumer actions to reduce or shift their electric usage in response to changes in prices For years encouraging demand reduction or energy efficiency has been the holy grail for the environmental community because many of our country s most pressing environmental and public health problems cannot be solved if the nation simply guzzles ever more dirty power But these days the case for fostering demandside response has never been stronger and there is a n emerging consensus that goes well beyond the environmental community about the importance of increasing demandside response More and more experts now agree that empowering consumers to modify their electricity usage in response to price will powerfully address the triple threat of pollution high electric bills and rolling blackouts all of which are now plaguing California Indeed electric restructuring in California or any other state will not be complete until consumers are abl e to modify their usage in response to realtime prices But while greater demandside response would deliver numerous benefits to consumers the economy system reliability and the environment most electric markets presently provide far too few opportunities even wit hin Pennsylvania and PJM where retail and wholesale electricity competition have been the most successful Therefore as the next crucial stage in its electricity restructuring Pennsylvania and PJM must now lead the way in creating policies and market mechanisms to increase opportunities for demandside response Encouragingly both the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission PUC wher e Commissioner Fitzpatrick sponsored a November st conference on the subject and PJMs management understand the stakes DemandSide Benefits A legitimate demandside market would serve as a check on high prices in t he hourly and forward PJM energy markets PJMs Market Monitoring Unit calculates that a percent reduction in demand during peak periods about mW can reduce market prices by about percent Empowering customers to participate in the demandside market limits wholesale and retail price s impacting the forward market and making the retail market more competitive In addition a demandside response reduction of mW would enable PJM to once again retain its onedayinten reliability standard an historic reliability benchmark which has been put at risk due to the offsystem sale s of generators this past summer The Technology Three types of technologies are required to achieve mW of reliable demandside participation Each is readily available and more importantly pays for itself Yet not enough of these technologies are being installed in homes and businesses to safeguard the public interest Remote appliance controls These controls enable a consumer to voluntarily curtail hisher electric usage during peak periods in exchange for an economic benefit For example in its On Call program FPL installs an energy management device in consumers homes connecting it to one or mo re qualifying appliances Through this program FPL pays consumers up to per year in credits on their electric bills More than FPL custome rs are currently participating Here in PJM BGE pays residential consumers per summer month for installing an Energy Saver Switch on their central air conditioners During periods of high demand for electricity BGE sends a radio signal which activates the switch cycling the compressor in minute increments More than BGE residential customers currently use the Energy Saver Switch and help BGE manage summer peak load Consumers who choose to similarly cycle their electric water heater receive an additional credi t per summer month Also in PJM PEPCOs mWsized kilowatchers plus program off ers participants about year for the right to remotely cycle hours of residential air conditioning In another example The Allegheny Electric Cooperative in Pennsylvania remotely switches air conditioners and water heaters from a central location in downtown Harrisburg For most consumers in these programs its money in the bank without noticeable impact These programs demonstrate that many small consumers wan t the opportunity to voluntary save money in return for agreeing to brief interruptions of selected appliances and that its fairly simple to pro vide the technology and operate the program The Pennsylvania PUC and other state Commissions should encourage and if necessary direct jurisdictional EDCs to offer remote appliance devices to consumers Its not difficult to imagine that if remote appliance devic es were implemented throughout PJM mW of small commercial and residential remotely cycled load could be bid in a demandside market Metering SetTop Devices or Advanced Metering Advanced metering or meteri ng settop devices register load decrements enabling consumers andor their suppliers to sell firm power into the peak market instead of using it Fo r example a supplier either the local utility or a competitive supplier could offer a lower price to a large consumer willing to reduce usage durin g peak load enabling the supplier to sell a relatively small amount of electricity to those requiring firm service during the peak load The consumer need not agree to limit usage except upon specific approval Already Duquesne and soon PECO Energy will have deployed advanced metering systemwide demonstrating that it can be economic even without the benefi ts of demandside response There are also various devices or meter addons that modify existing meters and allow recording of load decrements see for example wwwstonewatersoftwarecom These devices or meter addons appear to pay for themselves when the energy is sold during periods when prices are abov e the price the consumer is paying the EDC The need to ensure reliability in PJM combined with the current availability of technology to enable demandside participation by all consumers dictate that by all Pennsylvania customers should be equipped with a metering or appliance control device Internetbased Energy Management Platforms Computer software is necessary to maximize the effectiveness of advanced metering Programs have already been developed and used by major international corporations which enable them to make precise decisions on when to sell power back into the market decrease usage and use onsite generation BGE for one recently announce d deployment of the OmniLink platform wwwpowerwebtechnologiescomnewshtm DemandSide Barriers There are no inherent obstacles to obtaining the benefits of demandside responses but there are several important commitments necessary to make t he promise of demandside market participation a reality PJM and other ISOs as well as utilities and suppliers must all be able to offer demandside platforms without discrimination In addition PJM and other ISOs have the direct responsibility to manage system reliability and the wholesale energy market Demandside responses directly impact reliability and wholesale market prices including undesirable market powe r during peak load There can be no doubt that ISOs have an inherent role indeed an inherent responsibility to maximize the effective deployment of demandside market responses especially to offer a platform for LSEs to sell load decrements created in response to price signals PJM is on board but consumers who want to sell directly into the PJM demandside market fa ce opposition from some EDCs To unlock the potential of demandside markets the Pennsylvania PUC other state commissions and the FERC must support the role of PJM and other ISOs in creating such a market PJM must be permitted and encouraged to offer a demandside platform Finally EDCs must be required to fully deploy advanced metering and remote appliance control programs These small but important public policies will help to protect the reliability

families and businesses in the southeast region of Pennsylvania In a brandnew program that will debut later this summer consumers in the PECO Energy service territory will be able to apply for financial support to purchase and install solar photovoltaic PV systems The key elements of the new program are grants of up to for solar PV systems sized between and kW consumer loans to help residential consumers pay for PV solar water heating systems or energy efficiency improvements financial incentives to encourage housing developers to include PV in their housing projects and loans and other financial incentives to help commercial and industrial customers install PV This is terrific news for any homeowner or business that is interested in using clean power but cant afford the still relatively high cost of solar The program was developed by the Sustainable Development Fund SDF which was created by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission as part of the transition to electric competition The SDFs mission is to promote renewable energy energy conservation and sustainable energy businesses The SDF recently issued a Request for Proposals to select a PV program administrator who will be responsible for managing the PV grant program If you are interested in the PV program or in submitting a proposal to serve as program administrator visit their website at wwwtrfundcomsdf Also be sure to contact SDF by email at so that you can be put on a contact list and given updated information about the PV program For more information about solar power in the Philadelphia area check the Philadelphia Million Solar Roofs Program website wwwphillysolarorg REPRESENTATIVE VITALI SPOTLIGHTS GLOBAL WARMING IN PENNSYLVANIA On May th Representative Greg Vitali hosted a hearing on greenhouse gas emissions and global warming in Pennsylvania which was attended by environmental advocates concerned citizens and industry representatives The hearing sponsored by the House Democratic Policy Committee focused on Vitalis recently introduced House Resolution which requests the Department of Environmental Protection to investigate the causes and effects of global warming in Pennsylvania and to develop a strategy for reducing the states greenhouse gas emissions John Dernbach Environmental Law Professor at Widener University Dr Tom Delworth of the Geophysical Dynamics Laboratory at Princeton University John Hanger President and CEO of PennFuture and the Reverend Joy Kaufmann Director of Public Advocacy for the Pennsylvania Council of Churches all testified as to the need for a statewide strategy to attack global warming Pennsylvania currently emits a whopping percent of the worlds greenhouse gas emissions These emissions are contributing worldwide to rising temperatures and seas loss of crops and species and increased disease and starvation Several regional assessments predict that Pennsylvanias average summer temperature will rise between to degrees by the year Biodiversity will diminish including the loss of maple beech and birch forests and cold water fishes such as trout There will be increases in vectorborne diseases and more frequent extreme weather such as storms and droughts There is great news however As several of the testifiers pointed out Pennsylvania is in a unique position to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions by using energy efficiently and developing renewable energy resources After all a single household switching to renewable energy can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an amount equal to planting trees or not driving miles In fact the four bills recently introduced by the Renewable Energy Caucus HB and provide incentives for building renewable energy supply encouraging the use of personal power and energy efficiency and building greener more efficient buildings Testifiers repeatedly stressed that passing this package of bills along with House Resolution will be a critical step in reducing our greenhouse gas emissions Help ensure that Pennsylvania takes a leadership role on global warming Ask your representative to support House Resolution and the Renewable Energy Bills To see a copy of the Resolution or the Bills visit the House of Representatives Bill Room at WULIBIbillroomhtm CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY PROVIDES INSPIRING LEADERSHIP WITH HUGE WIND PURCHASE Carnegie Mellon University CMU is making the nations largest single retail purchase of wind energy CMU will buy percent of its total electricity next year from new wind power generated in western Pennsylvania The purchase of windgenerated electricity equivalent to the energy required by nearly homes per year is part of Carnegie Mellons commitment to cleaner energy and the environment CMU is using their research and education programs as well as their own campus practices to improve environmental quality while also supporting the development of wind power generation in Western Pennsylvania Carnegie Mellons wind energy will be generated by the ExelonCommunity Energy Wind Farm at Mill Run under construction in Springfield and Stewart Townships in Fayette County about miles southeast of Pittsburgh The Carnegie Mellon wind energy purchase of megawatthours will require more than an entire dedicated turbine to meet the demand CMUs decision to buy locally generated wind energy makes a contribution both locally and globally With the current attention on an impending energy crisis it is both satisfying and responsible to use energy that generates no pollution and uses no fuel The universitys actions show that doing right by the environment is also a good business decision Their vision is one that can and should be copied by educational institutions government businesses and individuals throughout the Commonwealth By moving from local coalfired power plant production to wind power CMUs purchase will eliminate the equivalent of tons of nitrogen oxides per year a precursor of ozone smog tons of sulfur dioxide which leads to acid rain tons of carbon dioxide the primary contributor to global warming and pounds of mercury a pollutant that is toxic to humans and the environment The reduction in carbon dioxide emissions is equivalent to planting nearly acres of trees or taking more than cars off the road PECO CUSTOMERS WILL SOON SEE HOMEGROWN WIND ENERGY ADDED TO THEIR MENU PECO customers will soon have the option to buy homegrown wind energy as a result of an exciting new business venture between PECO Energy Company and Community Energy Inc CEI a local renewable energy marketing company PECO will buy the output of the Somerset Wind Farm and Mill Run Wind Farm which will be built in western Pennsylvania and the new Waymart Wind Farm which is planned for Scranton PA This purchase agreement will make PECO the largest wind marketer east of the Mississippi and gives consumers a chance to support regional development of new renewable energy supply Homes and businesses will be able to buy the wind energy in blocks based on kilowatthours allowing them to ensure that a certain amount of their power comes from the new Pennsylvania wind farms Customers will be able determine how much extra they want to spend each month depending on how many blocks they buy providing a flexible new way to support renewable energy An additional five dollars would represent about a third of a typical residential customers monthly usage PECO and CEI will soon be presubscribing these wind blocks to interested customers in advance of these new wind farms anticipated energy production later this year For more information about how you can buy a wind block call Community Energy at GETTING TO CONFERENCE HELPS SET THE AGENDA FOR GROWING PENNSYLVANIAS GREEN POWER MARKET Hundreds of developers marketers green power advocates and interested citizens from all over the country recently flocked to Harrisburg to discuss how Pennsylvania will get percent of its energy from renewable sources by the year Described by attendees as inspiring and timely the conference kicked off with Ray Anderson Chairman and CEO of Interface sharing his vision for conducting business in the new millennium where profits and environmental protection are not only compatible but mutually dependent Workshops were standing room only as leaders in renewable energy brought each other up to date

and federal level public education and assisting citizens in public advocacy September Vol No Pittsburgh v San Diego First and Goal Pittsburgh like San Diego will soon be served by an electric utility that has divested its generation and paid off its stranded costs Despite these important similarities the different public policies implemented by Pennsylvania and California are producing electricity markets that have little in common In the Pittsburgh area where Duquesne Lights distribution service territory delivers electricity residential customers have several choices and an impressive have switched to a competitive generation supplier In the electricity transition game Pittsburghers have a first and goal By contrast suffering from a market which features a dominant retail utility that is passing through the hourly wholesale spot market price San Diego s residents need a completed hailMary pass to escape wholesale pric e spikes and a lack of choices Some crucial changes nonetheless to the Duquesne service territorys transition from monopoly to competitive wholesale and retail markets generation should soon be made Now pending before the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission at Docket No R is Duquesne Lights Petitio n for approval of its Provider of Last Resort plan POLR This filing may be a model for the nation on how to manage a transition once stranded cost charges have been paid off Also in the boardrooms of the three main western Pennsylvania utilities that are not presently part of the PJM power pool utility executives will soon decide whether they will voluntarily join PJM If they do not ways o f compelling inclusion within PJM are under discussion in Harrisburg On expanding PJM there can be no compromise Western Pennsylvania does not currently have and will not have a viable competitive wholesale market unless its service territories become part of PJM If the western Pennsylvania utilities are included one way or another in PJM and if the Duquesne POLR is approved with at most little change Pittsburgh will have the most competitive wholesale and retail markets in the country At that point rate regulation of default service could be successfully ended as long as widespread deployment of timeofuse meters and appliance control technology that together increase demand response t o price has occurred On the other hand if incorrect decisions are made on POLR PJM or increasing demand response Pittsburgh will be on the road to San Diego An d that is an electricity market that no Pennsylvanian or Californian should experience Duquesnes POLR transition plan would end the collection of stranded cos ts from residential customers as early as February As a result it would provide a system average and residential rate cut for customers whether or not they are shopping Transmission and generation rates will then be capped until December and possibly until December In addition to the rate cuts and caps the Duquesne plan would increase present shopping credits by on a system average basis to over six cents per kilowatthour giving shopping customers the opportunity to save as much as another off the bundled rate in effect on January Between the rate cut and savings from shopping residential customers may be able to reduce their rates by when compared to those in effect prior t o competition Indeed based on current price offerings the end of the stranded cost charge means consumers could even purchase a renewable Greene product and still save about on their total electric bill compared to what customers previously paid for fossil and nuclearfueled monopoly generatio n from Duquesne For this reason the Pittsburgh market can be the hottest renewable energy market in the world Aggressive public education and marketing are all that is needed to turn that prediction into reality The POLR plan which was developed by Duquesne in collaboration with sever al interested parties also provides more customer usage data to competitive suppliers and better allocates load responsibility and losses between competitive suppliers and Orion the new provider of last resort Flags Thrown on POLR Nevertheless the plan is Duquesnes not a settlement Some may object to the proposed rule that customers not be permitted to switch to POLR servic e for belowmarket summer rates although Orion insists it will not supply wholesale power without the protection A second controversial component o f the plan is to permit Duquesne to avoid a TD rate case by allowing Duques ne to charge four mills above the price of POLR service from Orion effective ly raising TD rates by about from the existing rates that were set in Whether or not everyone likes every part of the plan Duquesnes custome rs would save as much as from prerestructuring rates The new higher shopping credits effectively would become the highest in the country and encourage greater retail competition in the service territory It could op en the door for new entrants renewable products and valueadded services tha t genuinely compete for customers Pittsburgh could be the first region in t he nation to see what a competitive market really can provide in the electric industry Why Pittsburgh The PUC restructuring decision in May based substantially on the cornerstone PECO decision in December established shopping credits that have given the Pittsburgh area the most successful residential retail choice plan in the US so far Duquesnes plan also included its exit from the generation business and the divestiture of its generation assets In April Duquesne completed its sale of generation facilities totaling megawatts MW to Orion Power MidWest for billion This successful generation auction greatly reduced Duquesnes actual strande d costs compared to the projected levels Avoiding Interception Even with an end to stranded cost recovery and high shopping credits in there will be no genuinely competitive retail market without a genuinely competitive wholesale market nor a workably competitive wholesa le market without a workably competitive retail market Successful electricit y competition requires both competitive wholesale and retail markets see ou r prior issue entitled California Bad Dreaming However even high shopping credits provide consumers with small retail savings if power cannot economically be transmitted into the region and such transmission is very limited in the tiny Duquesne control area Duquesne has a large number of shopping customers primarily because Duques ne wanted to exit the generation supply business Duquesne made some capacity available at belowmarket rates and Allegheny Energy did a particularly good job aggregating communities and picking off customers Only a few suppliers compete though and offer only limited savings mainly because Pittsburgh and the rest of western Pennsylvania the Duquesne Penn Power and Allegheny Energy service territories still lack a functional Independent System Operator To remedy these problems and help create a competitive wholesale market western Pennsylvanias utilities must join PJM a power pool that is independently operated and contains over megawatts of generation Duquesnes POLR filing itself drives home the urgency of requiring weste rn Pennsylvanias utilities to join PJM Duquesne directly states there is no liquid visible wholesale electric market in Duquesnes area and tha t none is likely to exist in the near future These statements strongly under score the need for state action and the failure of policy at the federal level The absence of a competitive wholesale market makes the issue of basing prices on competitive market rates one of the stickiest issues among those working to develop the POLR plan Duquesne correctly insists that it would be fruitless to move POLR service to market rates without a competitive wholesale market Ultimately the plan provides for marketbased POLR prici ng no sooner than if a proceeding establishes during that a competitive wholesale market exists Yet while supporting the conclusion that no competitive wholesale market exists and identifying the lack of an Independent System Operator or regional power exchange as particular problems the POLR filing has no discussion of the obvious solution expansion of PJM to include western Pennsylvania Duquesne may be willing to support this solution if only AP S and perhaps First Energy with which the Duquesne system is interconnected would join as well Joining PJM would eliminate transmission rate pancakin g avoid multiple control areas expand the number of generators and supplier s serving the market and enable new generation including renewable generation to serve the Pittsburgh area In the End Zone Duquesne Light should be congratulated for its stewardship of the transiti on in its service territory and for its POLR filing Due to its work so far a nd that of others including the Public Utility Commission Pittsburgh will s ee huge reductions in the costs of electricity starting in and continuin g until at least Pittsburgh will also be the best place to buy and sel l renewable energy in America as residential customers will be able to swit ch to a renewable power product and still save about when compared t o bundled rates in effect on January All that is a triumph of policy and will make Pittsburgh a better place to live and work But the biggest victory that now can and must be won is in Pittsburghs grasp Winning will award Pittsburgh the most competiti ve wholesale and retail markets in the nation But to secure the win POLR mu st be approved with no or at most minor modifications PJM must be expanded and demand side response to price must be increased Only then can Pittsburgh truly declare victory in the electric competition game Ecubed is available for reprint in newspapers and other publications Authors are available for print or broadcast Support Ecubed by

blowing in the wind In fact about MW of new wind generation will be operating in Pennsylvania by a small portion of the Commonwealths total wind resource which is enough to produce about billion kWh or of Pennsylvanias total electricity consumption But challenges must be overcome to keep this crop from fading into thin air Why are obstacles being overcome to make wind power part of Pennsylvania s energy future Customers want clean energy and wind is readily available especially in the northeastern central and southwestern areas of our state While some other states have better wind resources Pennsylvania has plenty of Class wind resources and a good bit of Class much of which is located in rural communities Ironically sufficient wind resources are al so often found in formerly important coal centers that were decimated when machines replaced human labor and mines were emptied of marketable coal I t could offer these communities a sustainable economic future as the wind i s never mined out Just one year ago when Ecubed discussed reasons to Go With the Wind Vol I No no commercial wind farms were operating in Pennsylvania but our state had and still has the most vibrant customer choice program in America Today there are already two new clean renewab le wind generation facilities that were built in direct response to consumer demand The MW Green Mountain Farm in Garrett Somerset County can produce about MWh of electricity enough to serve about households eac h year The kW Pennsylvania Wind Energy Project in Hazleton Luzerne County can produce about kWh of electricity and will double in siz e this fall But even when additional kW turbines are installed Community Energys wind block sales will have served only about half of th e small commercial customer load that subscribed to its limited pilot marke ting program These two operating wind farms avoid tons of S tons of CO and tons of NOx Two larger wind farms are expected to be operating next year Atlantic Renewable and International Wind are developing a MW Mill Run wind far m in Fayette County and National Wind Power is developing a facility near Scranton Lackawanna County which will produce at least MW initially Although not all will be completed by the end of seven other project s by five active wind developers are scheduled to provide an additional MW of new wind generation in Pennsylvania during and after The wind industry expects that about MW could be built in Pennsylvania within t wo to three years If MW of additional wind generation replaced system power Pennsylvania would avoid tons of SO tons of CO a nd tons of NOx These new wind developments are fueled not just by wind but by investment dollars and consumer demand as well The Pennsylvania Wind Development Program recently announced the availability of wind energy production incentives for new facilities that become operational by the end of of up to centskwh for five years The program operated for the Sustainable Development Fund by The Reinvestment Fund will receive million from settlement of the PECOUnicom merger which is expected to become final in November Construction by the end of is also important because the federal Production Tax Credit for new wind development expires at that time and it is unclear if it will be renewed Production incentives are crucial for wind power especially in Pennsylvania where wind resources tend to peak in both the winter and during the late evening hours when the demand for electricity is low In t he current market the estimated average energy value from wind power is only about to centskWh The green attribute can fetch about an other centskwh for total market revenues of around cents per kilowatthour California wind production on the other hand generally peaks in the afternoon when the demand for electricity is high resulting in average electric sales value of approximately centskWh By comparison wind costs about cents per kilowatthour to produce in Pennsylvania The cost is on the way down although it could be some time before it dips as low as the cents and less mark in those areas of the country with the very best wind resources However total generation costs of Pennsylvania wind compare favorably to allin nuclear generation costs such as Limericks centskwh and Susquehannas near cent allin cost but still cost about more than total costs of a new fossil fuel plant Of course existing nuclear plants do not have to recover the allin production costs through the market because those costs are subsidized by stranded costs payments The million of funding in the Pennsylvania Wind Development Program is a drop in the bucket compared to the billions of dollars that subsidize nuclear powe r plants Another challenge to new wind power is that the exploding demand for wind turbines throughout the world and the rush to build American wind farms by December are stressing the capacity of turbine manufacturers to meet orders Only five qualified wind manufacturers do business in the US Of the five two are taking no new orders through while two others have limited capacity remaining for additional orders The leading manufacturer s are unfortunately not American but European many are just beginning t o have enough business in the US and Pennsylvania in particular to support necessary sales and operating support If turbines are available to harvest the wind Pennsylvanias wind resou rce is sufficient for commercial development but does not generate as much or as valuable electricity as in other states For example some states may have Class wind that blows strong and steady during peak electric load times The best sites in Pennsylvania are only Class and the wind often blows intermittently In addition to the lower average price for the electricity generated at offpeak times the resource at a site is crucial to project finances and requires detailed assessment A site generally mus t be metered for a full year before investors will make a commitment to a project Although there are no technical barriers to interconnection of wind generation to the grids in Pennsylvania the intermittent nature of wind also makes interconnection with a system based on predictable generation more difficult and less economic For example some operating systems stil l have rules that impose substantial penalties for inaccurate scheduling of generation even though the real time balancing markets required under FER C Order should eliminate the need for these penalties The intermittent nature of wind makes such rules especially burdensome for wind projects On the bright side some of the early problems with wind generation are successfully being overcome New wind turbines now purr along quietly compared to older technologies New turbines also turn quite slowly and developers are sensitive to the rights of birds to fly While wind turbine s were once considered eyesores the sleek postmodern look is increasingly found attractive especially in comparison to transmission lines cell towers or the strip mining that often occurred on the same land upon whic h the turbines are now being built Communities also are welcoming wind projects not just because problems related to noise birds or view sheds can be minimized but as important rural economic development and supplementary income to farmers A farmer c an receive rental income of about per year per turbine erected on a ti ny portion of farmland without significant interference to farming operations A turbine wind farm could add in annual income to a hardpresse d small farmer A rural township can also expect a boost in its tax base For example whe n the wind farm was built the Garrett tax base increased about And local

be expanded and system operators should correct their rules in order to eliminate unnecessary barriers to the development of our burgeoning wind industry Ultimately consumer demand may resolve these

continued to accep t new customers throughout the summer as the three suppliers offering Green e products in the PECO area Green Mountain also has dropped the per month customer service charge in the PECO service territory thereby cutti ng the cost of its renewable energy product by more than This is a good time to switch to these attractive renewable energy products which avoid an amount of pollution equal to not driving miles taking cars off the road or planting trees See our website at wwwpennfutureorg for a switching kit New investment for Green Mountain This week Green Mountain Energy Company announced that it has received a million investment from Nuon the largest utility company in the Netherlands Nuon joins BP Amoco with significant stakes in Green Mountain Energy Sam Wyly also announced that he was resigning as the Chairman of Green Mountain Energys Board of Directors Hopefully the new investment and board membership are preludes to more marketing activity in Pennsylvania for renewable energy products Adversity to triumph In another striking development in the renewable market one of Pennsylvanias early modernera renewable generators will most likely stay in business despite the recent ending of a longterm PURPA contract Sinc e the Lebanon Methane Recovery project has been operating effectively to convert into electricity the landfill methane that would have gone directl y into the atmosphere After the year PURPA contract ended last year the facility was not able to sell its output in the PJM wholesale market at prices high enough to stay in business Its closing was imminent when PennFuture was first contacted The plant will likely now remain open as PennFuture arranged a project that will keep middleman expenses to a minimum The methane generator will sell directly to Mack Services Group a licensed wholesaler and retailer which will sell a renewable Greene certified product to an aggregation of churches in the PECO service territory By averting the shutdown of the facility this project directly avoids the emission of methane a greenhouse gas that is four times mo re potent than carbon dioxide CO The generation of electricity from this project also produces approximately fewer tons of nitrogen oxide tons less sulfur dioxide and tons less CO than are emitted by th e generation of average system power Lebanon Methane and Mack Services have agreed to price the transactions so that a reasonable profit is made while selling at a price that enables mos t congregations to save as much as off the price they would pay for mostl y coal and nuclear generation from PECO Adding more small renewable generators and additional congregations may expand this project in the future Allegheny Energy joining PJM Allegheny Energy operating in Pennsylvania western Maryland and West Virginia must by October th inform FERC and the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission PUC about which Regional Transmission Organization or Independent System Operator that it will join Important legislators like Rep Tulli and key regulators like the PUC have been sending the unmistakable message that Allegheny Energy would be well advised to join PJM Last month on the verge of briefing the PUC about its ISO plans Allegheny Energy was told not to come to Harrisburg unless it was going to give two thumbs up on PJM No car from Hagerstown MD headed northeast tha t day If Allegheny Energy does become part of PJM Duquesne Light would likely follow suit Expanding PJM to cover western Pennsylvania is vital to Pennsylvanias economy and future Encouragingly officials in Harrisbur g increasingly understand the importance and urgency of this matter Hopefully Allegheny Energy also understands the determination to ensure that PJM expands to include western Pennsylvania Trouble blowing in the wind Recently Allegheny Energy was asked to provide the same energy scheduling treatment for a proposed wind farm in Fayette County that is accorded to a similar wind farm now operating in neighboring Garrett Somerset County T he Garrett wind farm is located within PJM and its need for scheduling treatment that reflects the intermittent nature of wind power has been accommodated by GPU and PJM Allegheny Energy refused to provide the same treatment given to the Garrett facility and as a result has certainly delayed the project and put at risk the income to farmers local tax revenues good jobs and clean energy which the nearly megawatt wind farm would create The primary reasons Allegheny Energy gave for its refusal wer e that its control area is too small and that it lacks a liquid spot market Guess what Both problems would vanish if Allegheny Energy joins PJM The only glimmer of hope for avoiding an unfortunate regulatory fight is that Allegheny Energy said it would discuss this matter further after October th Lets hope for all concerned that the ides of October bring glad tidings Duquesne POLR II collaborative to begin October The recent decision by the Pennsylvania PUC to send the Duquesne POLR II proceeding to a collaborative commences with the first session October t h The collaborative is expected to wrap up in November At stake is the most ambitious and successful retail choice transition of any EGS in the US see E Vol No Sept The Duquesne plan would increase prese nt shopping credits by on a system average basis as well as provide a system average and residential rate cut for customers whether or not they are shopping Between the rate cut and savings from shopping residential customers may be able to reduce their rates by when compar ed to those in effect prior to competition Among a host of other issues parties to the collaborative are now raising the issue of Duquesnes membership in PJM Presumably if Duquesnes transmission assets are moved into PJM then Orions generation bundle will also be in PJM If Allegheny and First Energy were to join PJM Duquesnes membership in PJM would brin g all Pennsylvania generation mWs into the same ISO GPUFirst Energy merger In another ISOrelated decision First Energy part of the flawed Alliance ISO filing will file their merger plans with FERC and the Pennsylvania PUC this month First Energy as a possible Alliance member is not slated to join a fully functioning ISO for some time The GPU merger gives First Energy a chance to join PJM This would expand PJMs geographic coverag e to Toledo Ohio Whatever the reason for First Energys delay in joining P JM it is not for lack of cash flow or merger synergies First Energys presentation to Wall Street on the GPU merger notes that in their previous merger s Ohio EdisonCenterior union First Energy promised synergie s of billion and states that it has already delivered million with millionyear in annual recurring savings The presentation tells only half the story First Energys promise to the Ohio PUC in that merger was to join a functioning ISO That promise now can be kept with First Energy joining PJM Little known fact about PECO shopping credits A recent analysis of seven churches in the PECO service territory showed that because of usage variations and the demand factor charge shopping credits ranged from to centskWh Looks like a good opportunity for savings in green power ICAP update As high as mWday this past summers ICAP prices were due substantially to delisting of capacity resources for sale into neighborin g power pools The delisting of capacity resources can explain why ICAP prices skyrocketed this summer when daily energy prices were lower than expected as were yearahead energy prices in the forward market The impa ct of delisting on prices and reliability was discussed in a recent PJM Futu re Adequacy Working Group FAWG meeting where it was revealed that delisti ng could have presented a problem had demand in PJM been consistently high Despite the FAWG acronym even with a northJersey accent there is no clou d in this groups direction Most forwardlooking participants expect that t he delisting market maneuver will be limited by a requirement that ICAP be bi d once or twice a year with a daily market for changes in ICAP responsibility This way if a generation owner decides to delist his resource to chase higher energy prices in other markets the owner foregoe s ICAP for a full year or most of the year if the commitment period is semiannual as opposed to annual Beyond this fix for next summer we predict that the FAWG will embrace the elimination of ICAP for Ecubed is available for reprint in newspapers and other publications
