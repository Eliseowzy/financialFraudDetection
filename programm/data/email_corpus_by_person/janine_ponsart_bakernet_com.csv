developments in global energy and public utility law December Reactive Power Capability Challenges Future Transmission By Michael J Zimmer Baker McKenzie Washington DC A significant challenge to the transmission providers reported by the National Electric Reliability Council NERC will be to maintain adequate levels of reactive support for the transmission system in the era of open market competition in the US Unlike real power MW the reactive component of power Mvar cannot be easily transmitted over longer distances and must generally be supplied at the local level Without adequate reactive power support portions of the electric power system can be susceptible to potential voltage collapse or instability according to NERC Sources of reactive power include generators synchronous condensers transmission lines capacitors and very specialized reactive support devices generally known as static var compensators SVCs Demand for reactive power is shaped by the size and type of demand power transactions across the transmission system and the loading of transmission facilities This demand for reactive power is growing nationwide Decline in Reactive Improvements Many electric utilities made concerted efforts to improve reactive support as demand grew by adding shunt capacitors on their distribution and subtransmission systems NERC reports However such distribution reactive improvement programs have declined in recent years within the industry Reactive support programs must be continuous as demand on the distribution system continues to escalate A chief component of that growth in the need for reactive improvement has been air conditioning which particularly requires increasing levels of reactive support Most air conditioner demand is motor load requiring significant reactive power support Because of its interaction with the transmission system reactive support is one area that distribution companies must not ignore if reliability is to be maintained on the bulk transmission system The physics of transferring power across a transmission line causes it to consume reactive power with increased transfers resulting in escalating voltage decline across the line When heavy power transfers occur across a transmission system interface and transmission lines are heavily loaded voltage in the area of the interface can become depressed if sufficient reactive supplies are not available to the system NERC has stated Open Access Impacts When transfers of power follow a consistent directional pattern it is relatively easy to plan and justify costs for the required reactive support for the transfers For example significant reactive support was added on the bulk system to enable higher transfers from ECAR to MAAC and the VACAR subregion of SERC in the early s However under open access transmission transactions are conducted in large numbers across long distances and often flow in directions that were not anticipated when the transmission system was originally planned and built The direction and amount of such transfers has become much more volatile changing daily and sometimes hourly Consequently planning reactive support enhancements for improving transfer capability has become more difficult as the pace and level of transactions have become more shortterm and realtime There is currently no incentive to increase the levels of reactive support on the bulk power system NERC states In fact there are disincentives because generators are paid to produce real power not reactive power under current contracting There is a tradeoff between producing real and reactive power because reactive power generation decreases as the real output increases A recent spate of nuclear unit upgrades effectively lowered the units reactive power output capabilities as the real output of these nuclear units was increased In the long term transmission providers must reevaluate their bulk power systems in light of open access including planning for necessary reactive support Business is increasing on the transmission system but very little is being done to increase the load serving and transfer capability of the bulk transmission system This will be essential for supporting development of regional transmission organizations RTO Most of the transmission projects planned over the next ten years are intended to reinforce parts of the system to alleviate local problems Future Planning Opportunities This raises several issues for future planning Can distributed generation become a new market source for reactive power capability Can distributed generation become a source of reliable transmission loading relief avoidance Is there a third party competitive market for reactive power Is there a merchant reactive power plant market to avoid voltage reduction which should be encouraged Who manages this critical bulk power system issue in a postrestructured world Generators Transmission Distributors Marketers Will this issue become impaired further with distribution company mergers and consolidations Will most new transmission gravitate to reinforce the system for local problems management because of a lack of RTOs and strong regional siting Are independent system operators doing enough to manage this challenge Is this another incentive for the power quality market to respond The ability to transfer electric energy across interfaces or seams hampers reactive power support NERC believes it is a national imperative that reactive power improvements keep pace with the demands being placed on the transmission systems to maintain reliability We are already seeing this as an element of key market disruptions Reactive power support must ultimately be placed and coordinated among generation transmission and distribution

energy and public utility law May ANCILLARY SERVICES THE NEXT FRONTIER Since the issuance of Order Nos by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Commission in market recognition of the value of ancillary services provided in this regulatory initiative has increased dramatically Shortly thereafter the FERC recognized that marketbased rates could also be provided for certain of these ancillary services which include voltage regulation spinning reserves nonspinning reserves and reactive power that were critical elements of historically bundled service This regulatory recognition was intended to serve as a stimulus for market penetration and development of ancillary services in a competitive marketplace With the formation of independent system operators ISOs and the consideration of movement to regional transmission organizations RTOs ancillary services have received increased discussion and attention Frequently markets do not have yet sufficient market makers to create adequate transparencies in a robust competitive market for certain services For example because of market deficiencies in California and New York ancillary services have come under increased scrutiny This short history and limited development of ancillary services is about to change with the advent of material consideration of RTOs It can be expected that a revamped Bushera FERC will finalize most RTO proposals this summer undertaken by former Chairman James Hoecker and his colleagues on the Commission That process should conclude by the end of with increased enforcement and market monitoring new mechanisms to resolve disputes increased resolution of seams management concerns new transmission pricing and return policies and major market validation of forprofit transcos as the underlying vehicle for regional growth and development of transmission in the future Key Considerations This market growth and recognition will not come too quickly given the continual demise of transmission investment and development by the regulated utility industry Over the past years the utility industry has whittled away its transmission legacy with little real growth and development of the national transmission system to support the advent and movement to competitive markets which has accelerated since Ancillary services will become a critical element of that market as they become the future callwaiting and callforward services of the electric utility industry borrowing from the telephone industry parallels and paradigm from the prior decade of experience Formation of RTOs will provide stronger market validation and recognition of ancillary services This will necessitate the development of separate pricing new forms of contracting new revised pricing methodologies for those ancillary services through separate contracts and pricing opportunities through formal agreements In many instances agreements still need to be developed for ancillary service sales or need to be materially enhanced in existing service agreements with the electric utility Several areas require current consideration at this time to ensure a smooth and effective transition Interconnection agreements should fully anticipate the separate provision of ancillary services in their technical review of a generating facility and requirements for that facility with the electric utility The interface of utility systems with control areas and RTOs need further understanding and management for risks liabilities and cost consequences Recognition for adequate compensation and marketbased pricing for ancillary services should be provided with the opportunity to supplement that pricing with amended and restated schedules in relevant agreements Transition of existing transmission and interconnection agreements to the RTOs should be contemplated in current agreements Assignment of those agreements should only be permitted with appropriate notice and review rights by the generator and the opportunity to accept amend or reject the terms of that assignment or transfer depending on whether it provides for enhanced sale and market development opportunities for the market value of ancillary services There are other ancillary services yet to unfold that have not been recognized by Order Nos and they should be analyzed and evaluated Any specificity that can be undertaken to capture recognition of those future services including development and pricing opportunities for those services should be separately retained in existing agreements now Otherwise the spectre exists that those services may ultimately be provided to the regulated utility at no charge Future Course of Action Why has this occurred Individual utilities managing the needs of their systems with the public utility obligation to serve and paramount reliability responsibilities were not willing to separately recognize the value of ancillary services Bundled service also disguised this value and did not provide an adequate and accurate platform for such recognition Utility divestitures of generation resources started the ball running Moreover utilities operating in a monopoly costofservice regime did not have the incentive or ability to seek out new revenue streams through creative unbundling and repackaging of ancillary services With the evolution to RTOs and broader scope and markets a shift will be undertaken in the provision of ancillary services such as security emergency planning risk management and reliability from discrete utility systems to all potential players in the competitive market including generators regulated utilities transmitting utilities power marketers and traders and large scale industrial and commercial users This restructuring of the market also provides an enhanced opportunity to assess the delivery of critical ancillary services their recognition as a matter of contract and the appropriate elements of marketbased rates and cost of service analysis as applicable and new methodologies justifying pricing for these new essential products Enlightened generators and developers will be thoughtfully analyzing this issue at this time with the goal of protecting their interests in anticipation of the evolution of these ancillary services as part of competitive markets which will allow them to capture contracting and pricing opportunities for the benefit of their owners or shareholders Michael J Zimmer John A Cohen ENotes is a publication of Baker McKenzie It does not constitute legal advice or a legal opinion on any specific facts or

services which include voltage regulation spinning reserves nonspinning reserves and reactive power that were critical elements of historically bundled service This regulatory recognition was intended to serve as a stimulus for market penetration and development of ancillary services in a competitive marketplace With the formation of independent system operators ISOs and the consideration of movement to regional transmission organizations RTOs ancillary services have received increased discussion and attention Frequently markets do not have yet sufficient market makers to create adequate transparencies in a robust competitive market for certain services For example because of market deficiencies in California and New York ancillary services have come under increased scrutiny This short history and limited development of ancillary services is about to change with the advent of material consideration of RTOs It can be expected that a revamped Bushera FERC will finalize most RTO proposals this summer undertaken by former Chairman James Hoecker and his colleagues on the Commission That process should conclude by the end of with increased enforcement and market monitoring new mechanisms to resolve disputes increased resolution of seams management concerns new transmission pricing and return policies and major market validation of forprofit transcos as the underlying vehicle for regional growth and development of transmission in the future Key Considerations This market growth and recognition will not come too quickly given the continual demise of transmission investment and development by the regulated utility industry Over the past years the utility industry has whittled away its transmission legacy with little real growth and development of the national transmission system to support the advent and movement to competitive markets which has accelerated since Ancillary services will become a critical element of that market as they become the future callwaiting and callforward services of the electric utility industry borrowing from the telephone industry parallels and paradigm from the prior decade of experience Formation of RTOs will provide stronger market validation and recognition of ancillary services This will necessitate the development of separate pricing new forms of contracting new revised pricing methodologies for those ancillary services through separate contracts and pricing opportunities through formal agreements In many instances agreements still need to be developed for ancillary service sales or need to be materially enhanced in existing service agreements with the electric utility Several areas require current consideration at this time to ensure a smooth and effective transition Interconnection agreements should fully anticipate the separate provision of ancillary services in their technical review of a generating facility and requirements for that facility with the electric utility The interface of utility systems with control areas and RTOs need further understanding and management for risks liabilities and cost consequences Recognition for adequate compensation and marketbased pricing for ancillary services should be provided with the opportunity to supplement that pricing with amended and restated schedules in relevant agreements Transition of existing transmission and

and the opportunity to accept amend or reject the terms of that assignment or transfer depending on whether it provides for enhanced sale and market development opportunities for the market value of ancillary services There are other ancillary services yet to unfold that have not been recognized by Order Nos and they should be analyzed and evaluated Any specificity that can be undertaken to capture recognition of those future services including development and pricing opportunities for those services should be separately retained in existing agreements now Otherwise the spectre exists that those services may ultimately be provided to the regulated utility at no charge Future Course of Action Why has this occurred Individual utilities managing the needs of their systems with the public utility obligation to serve and paramount reliability responsibilities were not willing to separately recognize the value of ancillary services Bundled service also disguised this value and did not provide an adequate and accurate platform for such recognition Utility divestitures of generation resources started the ball running Moreover utilities operating in a monopoly costofservice regime did not have the incentive or ability to seek out new revenue streams through creative unbundling and repackaging of ancillary services With the evolution to RTOs and broader scope and markets a shift will be undertaken in the provision of ancillary services such as security emergency planning risk management and reliability from discrete utility systems to all potential players in the competitive market including generators regulated utilities transmitting utilities power marketers and traders and large scale industrial and commercial users This restructuring of the market also provides an enhanced opportunity to assess the delivery of critical ancillary services their recognition as a matter of contract and the appropriate elements of marketbased rates and cost of service analysis as applicable and new methodologies justifying pricing for these new essential products Enlightened generators and developers will be thoughtfully analyzing this issue at this time with the goal of protecting their interests in anticipation of the evolution of these ancillary services as part of competitive markets which will allow them to capture contracting and pricing opportunities for the

global energy and public utility law July MarketBased Rates for Ancillary Services Pursuant to Order No companies with general marketbased rate authority must separately obtain marketbased rate authority for ancillary services See Order No at quoting the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC as stating The fact that we have authorized a utility to sell wholesale power at marketbased rates does not mean we have authorized the utility to sell ancillary services at marketbased rates Accordingly an entity with marketbased rate authority must make a separate showing with regard to securing marketbased rates for ancillary services In markets that are currently administered by independent system operators ISOs ie the PJM Interconnection LLC PJM the New York ISO NYISO ISONew England ISONE and the California ISO CalISO the FERC has previously permitted entities with general marketbased rate authority to sell ancillary services in those markets to the extent that it has authorized other suppliers to sell such ancillary services See Canadian Niagara Power Co Ltd FERC authorizing sales of ancillary services at marketbased rates into the NYISO and ISONE markets Minergy Neenah LLC et al FERC authorizing sales of ancillary services at marketbased rates into the NYISO Atlantic City Elec Co et al FERC authorizing sales of ancillary services at marketbased rates into PJM PJM Interconnection LLC FERC same see also New England Power Pool FERC Central Hudson Gas Elec Corp et al FERC Connectiv Energy Supply Inc FERC AES Redondo Beach LLC et al FERC order on rehg and clarification FERC order on rehg and clarification FERC order on rehg FERC order on rehg and clarification FERC As a general proposition companies that have sought authority to sell ancillary services in these ISO markets have simply requested the blanket authorization for sales of ancillary services Many companies have added that they desire the authority to be extended to additional ancillary services and geographic markets as the FERC may specify and authorize in the future in orders that extend such authority to all sellers previously authorized to sell energy andor capacity at marketbased rates See Edison Mission Mktg and Trading Docket No ER unpublished delegated letter order issued May The authority to make sales of ancillary services at marketbased rates is not merely limited to only those markets were established by the FERC with operating ISOs The criteria for seeking such authority in nonISO markets is found in the Avista case See Avista Corp FERC rehg granted FERC Avista The problem associated with obtaining marketbased rates for ancillary services in nonISO markets has centered on the difficulty or impossibility of obtaining estimates of other suppliers abilities to supply ancillary services to support a reliable market analysis that demonstrates that the entity seeking such authority does not have market power in the relevant markets for ancillary services However in the Avista case the FERC authorized the provision of Regulation and Frequency Response Energy Imbalance Operating Reserve Spinning Reserve Service and Operating Reserve Supplemental Reserve Service at marketbased rates in nonISO markets with certain conditions The Avista conditions require the Company to consider the establishment of an internet site that provides information on and conducts ancillary services transactions the posting on the internet site of the offering prices of all available services and the ability of customers to request services and make bids for those services using the site Moreover the entity must file with the FERC one year after the internet site is operational and at least three years thereafter a report describing its activities in the relevant ancillary services markets The entity must also commit not to sell ancillary services at marketbased rates to i regional transmission organizations RTOs such as an ISO or transco ie where the RTO has no ability to selfsupply ancillary services but instead depends on third parties ii a traditional franchised public utility affiliated with the entity or sales where the underlying transmission is on the system of a public utility affiliated with the entity or iii a public utility that is purchasing ancillary services to satisfy its own open access transmission tariff requirements to offer ancillary services to its own customers Id at note The terms and conditions associated with the provision of ancillary services at marketbased rates must be included in the marketbased rate schedule filed with the FERC and address the limitations on that authority as discussed above For entities which have already obtained general marketbased rate authority an amendment could be filed in their underlying marketbased rate dockets before the FERC seeking the authority to also sell ancillary services at marketbased rates consistent with the referenced FERC precedent
