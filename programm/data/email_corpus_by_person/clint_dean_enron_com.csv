Part of Scouting Missouri Texas will play at Missouri Saturday in a game that will start at pm and despite prior announcements will not be televised not even on a pay per view basis The Longhorns ranked No in both polls are while the Tigers are unranked at Missouri opened the season with a loss to Bowling Green then thumped Southwest Texas before getting mauled by Nebraska Then the Tigers beat Oklahoma State in a triple overtime before losing to Iowa State and then outscoring Kansas Tiger QB Kirk Farmer has had a hot hand in recent weeks and he kept both teams in the game last week blistering Kansas with yards and three touchdowns passing plus another rushing yards But he also had two interceptions run back for touchdowns Farmer a pound junior has completed of passes for yards and touchdowns but he was very productive in the Tigers three most recent games He also is a slippery runner who is a great scrambler WR Justin Gage a pound junior is one of the nations most productive pass receivers He has caught passes for yards and TDs and ranks second in the Big in receptions per game with a average RB Zack Abron a pound sophomore is the main threat on the ground He has rushed times for yards and TDs Thats an average of yards per carry New coach Gary Pinkel inherited eight offensive and six defensive starters from a team and he has shifted players around particularly on defense to try to get more speed on the field I had to use Big statistics in my team comparisons this week because the NCAA defensive statistics and rankings were not available at press time As you can see from the statistics below the Longhorns appear to be far superior to the Tigers This is a game the Longhorns should win and will win if they Avoid costly turnovers Keep on running the ball to provide more offensive balance Get their usual great defensive game Heres how the teams compare statistically Big rank in parenthesis Texas Missouri Offense Rushing Avg Passing Avg Total Off Avg Scoring Avg Defense Rushing Avg Passing Avg Total Def Avg Opp Scoring Avg Big Roundup The Big is down to two teams with perfect records and one of those will fall Saturday when Nebraska

big recruiting battle between Texas and North Carolina is very close to making his choice In fact two North Carolina internet sites claim he has already made it and the Tar Heels are the winners Buckman isnt saying He says he has always been a Texas fan but really likes North Carolina and the ACC because basketball is so important in that area Top Women Visit Center LaToya Davis of Houston South Houston took her official visit to Texas last weekend after visiting Texas Tech the previous week Davis the states top uncommitted player has narrowed her choices to those two schools and is expected to make her decision this week Three top juniors also took unofficial visits to Texas the same weekend They are Kalee Carey of Canyon Destiny Drew of Crosby and Emily Niemann of Houston Westbury Christian UT Men Women Picked th The Longhorns arent getting alot of respect in basketball The Texas men and women were both picked to finish fifth in a poll of Big coaches last week The mens coaches picked Chris Owens to the AllBig first team and tabbed freshman point guard T J Ford as conewcomer of the year The womens coaches didnt name any Longhorns to their honor teams which probably was a mistake because the Longhorn women were headed toward a very good season last year when a rash of injuries destroyed their chances With an outstanding group of incoming recruits the Longhorn women will have much more depth this year Turnover Troubles Texas is and Colorado is You knew that didnt you But did you know that in the two games Colorado lost the Buffaloes suffered nine turnovers five against Fresno State and four against Texas and did not cause a single one And did you know that in the game the Longhorns lost they gave up four turnovers against Oklahoma without gaining a single one What that statistic proves is that going in turnovers is a really surefire formula for going in games The Perfect Christmas Present For Horns Who Have Everything Else A Gift Subscription to

Part of Recruiting Roundup Tyler DB Matt Melton committed to Texas last week because I knew I wanted to stay in state and after visiting AM and Texas unofficially I just like Texas better He said he visited UT unofficially because he wants to take his official visit the December weekend to attend the Longhorn football banquet Melton who has tackles and two interceptions so far this year said he had offers from about or schools including Texas AM Purdue TCU Baylor and West Virginia He is the th recruit to commit to Texas He is a member of my Fabulous The other recruits who have committed to Texas include nine recruits who are listed on one or more national top teams They are WR Marquis Johnson of Centennial High School in Champaign Illinois DE Chase Pittman of Shreveport Evangel LB Garnet Smith of Arlington Lamar DTs Sonny Davis of Gulf Coast JC in Mississippi and formerly of Austin Lanier Earl Anderson of San Marcos Lyle Sendlein of Scottsdale Chaparral the twotime defending Class A champion in Arizona OLs Brett Valdez of Brownwood and Neale Tweedie of Allen and TE David Thomas of Wolfforth Frenship Davis made all of the top national lists last year The other Longhorn pledges are DT Tully Janszen of Keller LBs Brian Robison of Splendora and Marcus Myers of Pflugerville Connally WR Dustin Miksch of Round Rock Westwood QB Billy Don Malone of Paris North Lamar and RBAth Clint Haney of Smithson Valley Michael Williams the big and fast linebacker from Lindale I wrote about it my last issue went to the OklahomaBaylor game Saturday and committed to the Sooners When I talked to him Sunday night he called it a soft commitment and said Im still going to visit Texas on December and I might visit Minnesota and Texas Tech too I think hes in about the same boat as Garnet Smith the Arlington Lamar linebacker who is committed to Texas Both say they are committed but both want to look around a little bit to see if they find anything better I always compare it to being engaged and dating other people which makes getting married somewhat iffy Williams probably will wind up at OU and Smith probably will wind up at Texas but both cases will bear watching right up to and through signing day in February Several top national recruits were in Austin for the TexasColorado game including DE Bryan Pickryl of Jenks Oklahoma who was there on his official visit He wasnt expected back at home until Monday so I wasnt able to talk to him after his visit but before his visit he told me he has narrowed his choices to Oklahoma Texas and Missouri Top Texas players who were at the game included RB Albert Hardy of Galena Park MLB Aaron Harris of North Mesquite DE Travis Leitko of The Woodlands and WR Robert Timmons of Flower Mound Marcus Players already committed to UT who were there included Smith Anderson Thomas Janszen Myers and Miksch This Longhorn recruiting class is already ranked No in the country by a couple of national recruiting services The ranking will improve dramatically if the Horns hold what they have and add a few top national recruits like DT Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings QB Vincent Young of Houston Madison DE Larry Dibbles of Lancaster and some of the players who attended the game Saturday like Pickryl Hardy Harris Leitko and Timmons The Horns wont get all of those guys but they continued on page Recruiting continued from page will get several of them and their chances are very good with Wright Dibbles Harris Hardy and Timmons if he walks the straight and narrow path for the rest of the season They also are close to with Pickryl Young and Leitko If Williams does follow through on his plans to visit Texas the Dec weekend his pledge to OU might turn out to be really soft Of course the same could be said of Smiths commitment to Texas if he follows through on his announced plans to take other visits Texas has pledges from five players on my man difference maker list including No DT Anderson No LB Smith No LB Brian Robison of Splendora No OL Brett Valdez of Brownwood and No QB Billy Don Malone of Paris North Lamar The Horns have a pretty good shot at everyone in the top seven on that list No DT Wright No QB Young No DE Dibbles No DE Leitko No RB Hardy and No LB Harris They wont get all of that group but they might get most of them I think the Longhorns will sign at least four players from the eightmember group of superstars that includes Wright Dibbles Harris Hardy Pickryl Young Lietko and Timmons If they do this class will rank very high nationally probably in the top That would give the Longhorns four straight super classes heading into next season and for the first time the oldest group of that foursome would be seniors or juniors who have redshirted The Longhorns with commitments already have a couple of shaky ones in Smith who plans to take other visits and one player who has an uphill battle to qualify They can take more than the normal limit in a single year because Pittman plans to graduate from Shreveport Evangel in December and enroll at Texas in January which will let him count against last years total Pickryl also plans to graduate early so he also could be counted back to last year if he signs with Texas I expect the Longhorns to take commitments from another to recruits The number will be on the low side if Smith stays solid and Pickryl goes alsewhere but it will rise if Smith strays and Pickryl comes aboard Sonny Davis suffered a torn ACL in a recent game at Gulf Coast JC in Mississippi and is due to undergo knee surgery this week His mother told me he still hopes to graduate early and enroll at Texas in January The surgery probably would knock him out of most or all of the contact work but should allow him to be fully recovered by the start of next season Game Quotes We played poorly We turned the ball over and could not overcome the adversity we created for ourselves I give Texas a lot of credit They have good players who are well coached I feel bad that we didnt give them a better game Colorado head coach Gary Barnett We did not want to be one dimensional We knew it wouldnt be easy to run on Colorado but we knew we had to keep at it I thought the offensive line did a good job and Cedric Benson did a great job Texas offensive coordinator Greg Davis We worked all week against two tight ends and I think in this game they ran two tight ends maybe four times They did a great job of coming and doing exactly what we werent planning on But our guys did a pretty good job of improvising UT defensive coordinator Carl Reese We forced some turnovers today and when you got most of the turnovers you usually win the game UT linebacker DeAndre Lewis Sloan Thomas is probably the most underrated wide receiver in the country Longhorn QB Chris Simms talking about the backup wide receiver who has scored two touchdowns in each of the last two games We did self destruct a little bit but I dont want to take anything away from Texas They came out ready to play on both sides of the ball as well as on special teams We made a lot of mistakes today and they had us on our heels throughout the second half Colorado linebacker Joey Johnson Hes an unbelievable running back He runs hard and that move he put on to break that long gain on the shovel pass at the end of the first half was unbelievable Simms talking about Longhorn freshman running back Cedric Benson They beat us in every phase of the game I dont think it was one particular thing We had some turnovers and they put together some long drives They also did a nice job in the punt return game Buff linebacker Robbie Robinson We cant keep our defense on the field that long We let the defense down We selfdestructed and Texas took advantage of everything Colorado running back

going to be released today Monday and the Longhorns should rank just about seventh which coincidentally is where they are in both major polls this week What that mean is that Texas has a very good chance to land one of the four major BCS bowl spots if they take care of business and win their final four games to finish the regular season at Upsets have thinned the ranks of unbeaten teams in the last two weeks leaving only eight teams in major college football with perfect records They are No Miami No Oklahoma No Nebraska No UCLA No Virginia Tech No Maryland No Washington State and No Brigham Young At least two of those teams will lose in the near future because Oklahoma and Nebraska clash this week and Washington State and UCLA meet in early November The top two teams in the final BCS standings will play for the national title in the Rose Bowl on January Texas coach Mack Brown and his Longhorns hope to be in that game but their chances are somewhere between very slim and none because Oklahoma would have to lose twice in the regular season for that to happen and then the Horns would have to beat the Big North winner probably Nebraska But by winning out and finishing the Longhorns would have a great chance to play in the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans in the postseason

Part of Jerry Scarbroughs True Orange Newsletter The Newsletter for the True Texas Longhorn Faithful Volume No October Longhorn Defense Stifles Buffs Simms Benson Spark Offensive Fireworks in Romp The Texas defense forced four turnovers and totoally shut down Colorados offense in the second half to lead the No Longhorns to a victory over No Colorado in Austin The offense also had a great day with QB Chris Simms throwing for yards and three touchdowns and true freshman RB Cedric Benson getting yards for the second straight Saturday He also scored two touchdowns and caught three passes for yards Benson had the days biggest offensive play It came with the Longhorns leading and facing secondand at their own just before the the half The Horns were going into a stout wind and Colorado was threatening to get the ball back in great field position But Simms dropped back and just before he was hit flipped a shovel pass to Benson who caught it put an awesome move on two Buff defenders and sped yards to launch the Longhorns on an yard scoring drive that broke the game open The UT defense forced four Buffalo turnovers three fumbles and a pass interception and held the potent Colorado offense to just two first downs and net offensive yards in the second half The three fumbles Colorado lost all came in the first half and cost the Buffs a firstandgoal at the UT with Texas ahead only and set up short Longhorn scoring drives for the field goal that made it and the touchdown that gave Texas a lead Colorados starting QB Craig Ochs did not play because of a concussion he suffered in the victory over Texas AM last week His replacement Bobby Pesavento is a better passer but Ochs is a much better runner and his absence caused the Buffaloes to change their offensive strategy to include more passing and less double tight end power running The Longhorn defense also had something to do with that Here briefly is how the game went First Quarter Texas won the toss and deferred Colorado took the ball and the Longhorn defense stuffed the Buffs power running game and forced a quick punt Starting at their own after a short punt into the stiff wind the Horns scored quickly Benson ran for then Simms hit TE Bo Scaife for A wide receiver reverse was beautifully blocked allowing B J Johnson to gallop yards to the Buffalo Benson carried three times for a first down at the then Simms after a fake to Benson going right rolled left and hit WR Roy Williams for the TD Dusty Mangums kick gave UT a lead with left On the first play after the kickoff Pesavento hit two big passes to the UT Then he threw into a crowd at the Longhorn but WR Derek McCoy wrestled it away from three Horns and bulled to the four before fumbling Freshman LB Derrick Johnson recovered for Texas The Horns couldnt move and a short punt gave the Buffs the ball at their own Colorado went to its power running game and rolled to a first down at the UT before the Longhorn defense stiffened and forced a yard field goal try that was wide CU led in first downs and in total offense but the Longhorns led because they scored on their only foray deep into Buff territory while the Buffaloes fumble at the and missed chipshot FG killed both their scoring chances Second Quarter DE Kalen Thornton forced a fumble that was recovered by UT CB Roderick Babers at the CU The Horns drove to the before Mangum kicked a yard field goal for a lead with left UTs kickoff into the wind went out of bounds giving Colorado good field position at the and the Buffs got their running game going and swept in for the TD in just seven plays to cut the lead to with left UT drove into Buff territory but Simms was sacked to kill the threat The third Colorado fumble of the half set the Horns up at the Buff and they capitalized but they they had to score two TDs to get credit for one First Simms hit Williams in the end zone and Williams got a foot down in bounds but the official waved it off Benson got the TD on a yard run and Mangums kick gave UT a lead with left A quick defensive stop gave the Horns another possession at their with left Simms was sacked at the on the first play but Benson took a shovel pass juked two defenders off their feet at about the and scampered yards down the sideline Simms passed to WR B J Johnson for and to Williams for before Benson scored from the with left for a lead Texas led in first downs and in total offense in the quarter Third Quarter Texas couldnt move into the wind and had to punt Colorado drove to the Texas and went for it on a fourthand but the Longhorn defense held Brown to a yard gain to end that drive The Longhorn offense then drove yards in plays for another TD with the payoff coming on a yard pass from Simms to WR Sloan Thomas Mangums kick gave Texas a lead with left The UT defense stifled Colorados next effort and Nathan Vasher ran the Buffalo punt back yards to the CU setting up a yard Mangum FG for a lead with left Texas led in first downs and in total offense in the quarter Fourth Quarter Simms found Thomas all alone in the end zone for yards and the games f inal score on the Horns first possession in the quarter Major Applewhite and Chance Mock took over at QB after that The Longhorn defense did not allow Colorado a single first down in the period and the Buffs had only plays for net yards Drive Chart Heres the drive chart

costs a minute You must be or older to call Coachs Corner Coach Mack Brown said Sunday studying the films of the Longhorns victory over Colorado Saturday proved what we felt all along our guys played really well and really hard all day He also said Colorado is a much better team than yesterdays score would indicate That was just a game that got out of hand because of turnovers He said he was very pleased with the shovel passes wide receiver reverses and other misdirection plays the Horns used very successfully Saturday If you are moving the ball they usually work he said Weve talked about needing a little more misdirection All of them are things we need to run because it makes our regular plays work better He had said last week wanted to use more traps run more gaps and counter gaps saying it slowed defensive pursuit and created more doubt in the minds of defenders After using a lot of them against the Buffaloes he said they will remain a part of the UT offense Colorado came into the game on a fivegame winning streak and with a powerful running game that ranked No nationally at yards a game and a strong rushing defense that was No nationally allowing only yards That had allowed the Buffs to dominate time of possession against their foes They were averaging about minutes a game compared to about minutes for their opponents But Texas dominated the time of possession to held the Buffaloes to net rushing yards yards below their average and rushed on the Buff defenders for yards about more than they had been allowing Brown said the Longhorn defense did an outstanding job against the CU power runners and he said the Texas offense was successful because it was able to stay two dimensional But he said the early UT lead helped along by the Colorado turnovers forced them to try to play catchup and playing catchup is not their game I think Colorado is really good he said Weve played so well at home and our crowd gives us a big advantage at home I think Colorado will win a bunch more football games this year Longhorn true freshman RB Cedric Benson picked up yards rushing on carries and scored two touchdowns in his second start It marked the first time all season a running back has hit the Colorado defense for yards Thats a credit to our balance our offensive line and to Cedric Brown said Hes a fine running back who has great vision and who almost always falls forward Hes getting better every week Brown said he and his assistant coaches talk constantly to their players about the need to show up ready to play every week and he also said its way too early to worry about the BCS bowl situation because there are a lot of football games still to be played before that comes into play We talked to our team after Florida lost to Auburn about how you cant control anything except what you do Anybody can beat anybody Our guys understand the only thing they can do is be the best football team they can be and be ready to play Missouri this Saturday What weve got to do is try to win four more football games and see where that takes us Longhorn Notes Quotes They say football is a game of inches and UT QB Chris Simms will buy into that particularly after executiing the shovel pass to freshman RB Cedric Benson just before the half that went for yards and helped break the game open I was nervous dropping back Simms said I was in the end zone and saw the defensive end coming and I didnt know if our tackle got a good piece of him and Im thinking Gosh I have to get it out Cedrics still turning around and I kind of threw it just as I was about to get hit and hoped he could catch it Cedric just got turned around and he caught it and then made an unbelievable move down the sideline As for Benson he says college football is a little more complicated than he thought it would be In high school it was basically run left run right he said Here Im learning how to block how to fake better and how to run better routes Simms said Benson is going to be great He runs so hard on every play and the thing I like about him is every time I drop back to pass and he protects for me he turns around after his block and goes Did I do okay I say I didnt get hit did I You did okay

the nations top programs picked Texas Tuesday saying he thinks the Horns are on the verge of joining the national elite in basketball He chose Texas over North Carolina at the end but also had considered Kentucky UCLA Missouri and others He had said earlier that the lure of the ACC where basketball reigns supreme was very strong and almost pulled him to North Carolina But he told me Tuesday Ive always wanted to go to Texas This is where my heart is He also said his head turned Texas way at the end because coach Rick Barnes has established a consistent winning program and has been wooing and winning bigtime recruits After looking at it closely he said I think Texas basketball is really on the upswing Theyve signed two McDonalds All Americans freshman point guard T J Ford of Fort Bend Willowridge and sophomore forward Brian Boddicker of Duncanville in the last two years They could make it three in three years because Buckmans stock soared this summer when he starred in several top AAU tournaments Brick Oettinger publisher of Prep Stars Recruiters Handbook was asked who was the biggest surprise of the summer Oettinger said In terms of from out of nowhere not in anybodys top to everybodys top it would be Brad Buckman Big forward very aggressive and a whole lot of skills just about as many skills as anybody in the class Ive got him No now and he wasnt in my top Dave Telep another national recruiting analyst agreed Buckman is a national top recruit The reality is that while there are guys with larger names there probably arent better players in the class Telep said He is athletic can handle it some he blocks shots he shoots to mediumrange and he scores in the post Clifton McNeely the Westlake coach also says his stars work ethic is off the chart Hes a very gifted player with a lot of talent McNeely said but the best thing about him is his strong heart and work ethic I dont think you could find anyone who works harder than he does McNeely also said he thinks Buckman is the best player in Texas There are some guards in the Dallas area who ranked higher nationally including Bracy Wright of The Colony who chose Indiana Daniel Horton of Cedar Hill who picked Michigan and Bryan Hopkins of Dallas Lincoln who committed to SMU The Longhorns recruited all three of those star guards but lost out on them at the end Buckman averaged points rebounds and blocks for Westlake as a junior And hes the kind of bluecollar inside player Barnes loves McNeely said Buckman can play a power game inside and shoot from point range Asked to compare him to Luke Axtell and Chris Mihm two other Westlake players he coached who played at UT he said He has the physical presence of Mihm and is a lot stronger coming out of high school and he has the range of Luke He is the first recruit to commit to Texas for the early signing period next month Barnes and his assistants are recruiting several other players most of them in other states and hope to sign a sharp shooting guard and a wing Buckmans father Brent played on two national championship golf teams at UT Basketball Team Has New Look The Longhorn basketball team will have a new look this season with the addition of heralded point guard T J Ford who led Fort Bend Willowridge to backtoback Class A state titles When the season starts next month Ford will be called upon to speed up the Horns offense and also create more opportunities for the teams inside players with his lightningquick passes Coach Rick Barnes is hoping Fords creativity in the halfcourt offense will improve the scoring punch of center James Thomas who averaged points and rebounds a game last year Ford also should be able to provide better shooting opportunities for senior forward Chris Owens sophomore wings Brandon Mouton and Royal Ivey and forward Brian Boddicker Barnes had to operate without a true point guard last year Fredie Williams Ivey and shooting guard Darren Kelly took turns at the point Barnes and the Horns coped with it admirably going overall and in the tough Big but they shot only percent from the field and had more turnovers than assists Ford should help raise the former and lower the latter They also lost in the first round of the NCAA Tournament to Temple and Barnes hopes Ford will be a key to helping the team get farther into the playoffs this season Replacing departed wing Maurice Evans and Kelley who combined for of UTs pergame scoring average creates scoring opportunities for other shooters Now Barnes just needs some of them to seize that opportunity He expects Mouton and Ivey to step up there Sydmill Harris a freshman from The Netherlands has been a consistent shooter in preseason workouts Owens was a star in the World University Games during the summer and is expected to be one of the top players in the Big and a more dependable scoring threat Ever since last year the Temple game it started coming together Owens said It clicked I didnt do what I wanted to do and I knew I had the ability Now I have the mental concentration UT Women Looking Sharp Coach Jody Conradts Longhorn womens basketball team is picked to finish in the middle of the Big pack but early practices and stiff competition at several positons indicate it might be a lot better than that The Longhorns were looking good early last season before losing centerforward Annissa Hastings and guardTai Dillard to knee injuries Hastings and Dillard are hale and hearty once again but equally important is the fact that the Horns heralded recruiting class is living up to its hype Stacy Stephens a sophomore returns as the starting center and senior Tracy Cook and the Hastings can back her up and also play power forward Jody Bell a freshman from Canada and freshman Mercedes Williams also are looking good at power forward Two freshmen Heather Schreiber the high school player of the year in Texas last year and Kala Bowers last years high school player of the year in Oklahoma are battling for the small forward job it shows you are on the right track when you can call and women small forwards Hastings is so versatile that she probably will see action at all three inside positions Kenya Larkin returns as the point guard and other guards who will see a lot of action include sophomore Kaira White who has been looking great in practice plus Dillard and freshman CoCo Reed Alisha Sare and Asha Hill are other guards who could figure into the rotation RECRUITING NOTES LaToya Davis of Houston South Houston picked Texas Tech over Texas last week Nichelle Roberts a centerforward who teamED with Mercedes Williams to lead Spring Westfield deep into the state playoffs last year is the only remaining uncommitted blue chipper and the Longhorns have a great chance to sign her No Horns Win Soccer Title The No Texas womens soccer team clinched its first Big Conference title Sunday with a victory over Oklahoma The Longhorns are overall and in the Big and have one regular season match remaining against Texas AM Coach Chris Petrucelli in his third year at the helm said This is a huge step for us Its going to help us in recruiting Its going to help us in marketing And its going to help our confidence

Part of Part Recruiting Roundup The status of three outstanding players Texas is recruiting is rather murky at this time LB Garnet Smith of Arlington Lamar is committed to Texas but is setting up visits to Oklahoma he was once committed to the Sooners and several other schools WR Robert Timmons of Flower Mound Marcus committed to Florida and LB Michael Williams of Lindale committed to Oklahoma last week but then they both decommitted Williams attended Texas AMs game Saturday and plans to come to take an official visit to Texas the December weekend The Longhorns commitments include nine players who are listed on one or more national top teams They are WR Marquis Johnson of Centennial High School in Champaign Illinois DE Chase Pittman of Shreveport Evangel LB Garnet Smith of Arlington Lamar DTs Sonny Davis of Gulf Coast JC in Mississippi and formerly of Austin Lanier Earl Anderson of San Marcos Lyle Sendlein of Scottsdale Chaparral the twotime defending Class A champion in Arizona OLs Brett Valdez of Brownwood and Neale Tweedie of Allen and TE David Thomas of Wolfforth Frenship Davis made all of the top national lists last year However he injured a knee and has undergone surgery and his coach at Gulf Coast JC says he has a lot of academic ground to cover to graduate The other Longhorn pledges are DT Tully Janszen of Keller LBs Brian Robison of Splendora and Marcus Myers of Pflugerville Connally WR Dustin Miksch of Round Rock Westwood QB Billy Don Malone of Paris North Lamar DB Matt Melton of Tyler and RBAth Clint Haney of Smithson Valley The Longhorns will give about to more scholarships and I think most of them will be awarded to members of a player group that includes QB Vincent Young of Houston Madison RBs Albert Hardy of Galena Park and Selvin Young of Houston Jersey Village WRs Timmons Biren Ealy of Cypress Falls and Anthony Wright of Klein Forest TE Eric Winston of Midland Lee OLs Justin Blalock of Plano East and Tony Ugoh of Spring Westfield DEs Bryan Pickryl of Jenks Okla Larry Dibbles of Lancaster and Travis Leitko of The Woodlands DTs Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings Marco Martin of Mesquite and Kasey Studdard of Highlands Ranch Colo LBs Aaron Harris of North Mesquite and Lindales Williams and DBs Edorian McCullough of North Garland Brodney Pool of Houston Westbury and Ricky Wilson of Port Arthur Lincoln If the Longhorns finish strong they have a very good chance to get the four top players on my man differencemaker list They already have No in Earl Anderson and they have very good shots at No Wright No Young and No Dibbles If Pikryl lived in Texas he would be in my top and he says Texas is the leader right now He took his official visit the weekend of the Colorado game The Longhorns might take a kicker if they find one who is consistent at kicking off into the end zone Trey DeCarlo at Carrollton Creekview is the best Ive seen this year at booting them deep College kickers start five yards farther back but DeCarlos kicks usually carry out of the end zone INTERESTING RECRUITING TIDBIT The Longhorns lost their mystique for many years but there are a few signs they are getting it back Consider this item in last Fridays

the field even when the ball doesnt come to him because the defense has to be aware of where he is at all times Quarterback Chris Simms did a great job looking off on his big catch just before the half Texas offensive coordinator Greg Davis This was a great team win for us The offense did a great job of hanging on the ball and running the clock and the defense did a good job of getting some threeandouts Thats the way its supposed to work when you draw it up I give a lot of credit to CB Quentin Jammer and nickel back Dakarai Pearson for shutting down their bigplay receivers Jammer held WR Justin Gage to two catches and Dak really did a good job on their tight end after we decided to give him the primary coverage on him UT defensive coordinator Carl Reese I dont think I was running any harder in the fourth quarter I think our offensive line just wore them down a little Coach Brown and coach Davis told me I needed to take charge in the fourth quarter and I just tried to keep running and pounding as hard as I could It feels good to be part of the record book UT freshman RB Cedric Benson talking about his game and the fact that he is the first true freshman to rush for yards in

Part of Jerry Scarbroughs True Orange The Newsletter for the True Texas Longhorn Faithful Volume No October Simms Throws TD Passes Benson Rushes For Yards as Longhorns Gore Tigers Junior QB Chris Simms and true freshman RB Cedric Benson had careerbest days and the UT defense held Missouri to just one first down in the first and third quarters Saturday in Columbia to lead Texas to a victory On a day when upsets reigned across the country particularly in the top and five of the eight previously unbeaten teams lost the Longhorns took care of business and ran their record to overall and in the Big With Oklahomas loss at Nebraska the Sooners Longhorns and Aggies are all tied atop the standings in the Big South But the Longhorns have to win out and Oklahoma has to lose another conference game for the Longhorns to make it to the Big Championship Game Saturdays victory at Missouri was a fairly easy conquest thanks to the stout UT defense and a great performance by the offensive line that allowed Simms to complete of passes for yards and four touchdowns and Benson to run for yards on carries an average of yards a pop But some strange things happened to thwart the Longhorns in the early going On their first drive for example they held the ball almost minutes rolling yards in plays but they got zero points because they stalled at the Tiger and Dusty Mangum missed the chipshot field goal They also drove into Missouri territory on their second possession but again stalled Missouri finally got rolling to start the second quarter and scored first That seemed to wake up the Longhorn offense and it took control and wore out the Missouri defenders Here briefly is how the game went First Quarter Texas won the toss and deferred Missouri took the ball and Marcus James ran the UT kick back to the The Longhorn defense forced a quick threeandout and the UT offense had its most timeconsuming drive of the year going yards in a laborious minute play drive to the Tiger but Dusty Mangum missed the chipshot field goal Missouri went threeandout again The Horns drove to midfield again but stalled as the quarter ended Texas had a huge lead in statistics with first downs to for Missouri a edge in total offense and a to bulge in time of possession but the game was all even at in the only statistic that counts Second Quarter The Tigers finally got their offense untracked to start the second quarter and drove yards primarily on the passing of QB Kirk Farmer to take a lead with left Victor Ike ran the kickoff back to the and the Longhorns went yards in plays to tie it up Simms connected with WR B J Johnson on the yard TD toss but the big play was a yarder from Simms to TE Bo Scaife on thirdand at the Missouri Mangums kick tied it with left After the UT defense forced another quick andout and got a short punt Simms found Scaife again on the first play for a yard gain to the MU A WR reverse by Johnson got yards and Benson got more and a first down at the before Simms faked to Benson and hit TE Brock Edwards for the final yards and the TD Mangums kick gave Texas a lead with left The Tigers stormed down the field in the final two minutes primarily on the running of pound Zack Abron who gained yards in three carries His yard tacklebreaking run to the gave the Tigers a firstandgoal but his next try gained only a yard and Farmer threw two incompletions before Brad Hammerich booted a yard field goal to cut the UT lead to with seconds left The Tigers outgained the Longhorns in the quarter to yards and had a edge in first downs Third Quarter Texas got the ball and again made a long timeconsuming drive but this time it counted because Simms scored from the to cap a yard drive and Mangum converted for a lead with left the Longhorns overcame a thirdand early in the drive when Simms scrambled and found Brett Robin for yards Vasher intercepted Farmer four plays later to give the Horns great field position at the MU The Longhorns couldnt move but the pick kept Missouri bottled up deep in its own territory throughout the quarter and allowed Texas to start its possessions around midfield in a quarter that was dominated by defense after Texas impressive opening drive The Tigers made only one first down in the quarter and Texas after getting five first downs on that opening TD drive managed only one more in the entire quarter Fourth Quarter The Tigers finally figured out their best offense was to hand the ball to Abron and he bulled for and then more for a TD Missouris pass for a point conversion failed and left UT on top with left Not to be outdone Benson shredded the Missouri defense for and then before Simms scrambled left and found Robin who scampered the final yards to complete a yard scoring play Mangums kick gave Texas a lead with left Texas and the BCS The next Bowl Championship Series BCS standings will be a lot different from the first ones that were announced last week and Texas will be a lot higher than it was in the last one In the first standings which were announced last Monday Texas was ranked No behind five teams with perfect records The BCS standings are like golf in that the lowest score is the best score Oklahoma came in at No in the first standings at followed by Nebraska at UCLA at Miami at Virginia Tech at Texas at and Michigan at to round out the top seven But a rash of upsets claimed OU UCLA and Virginia Tech Since OU lost to Nebraska the Sooners wont tumble far but Texas should pass UCLA and VT Of course Michigan is so close to Texas that the Wolverines might pass the Horns if they keep winning Under the BCS formula the top four teams in the final standings are guaranteed berths in one of the four BCS Bowls which are the Rose Orange Fiesta and Sugar The Rose Bowl will get the national title game this year Right now that looks like a NebraskaMiami battle but both teams have some big games left before making that date Texas could make it to the Rose Bowl but it would require some big upsets like Texas AM or Texas Tech upsetting Oklahoma and then Texas beating Nebraska in the Big title game But the Longhorns will make it to one of the big BCS bowls if they keep winning Key Games for BCS Watchers If you want to keep tabs on the Longhorns chances to wind up in good shape in one of the big four BCS bowls the key is that they have to win their final three regular season games Assuming that happens here are some key games to watch for the rest of the season This Saturdays key games are Michigan at Michigan State Tennessee at Notre Dame and UCLA at Washington State The big ones the following Saturday Nov are Texas AM at Oklahoma and UCLA at Oregon On Nov Texas Tech hosts Oklahoma Syracuse is at Miami Michigan is at Wisconsin and Virginia Tech is at Virginia On Thanksgiving weekend Michigan hosts Ohio State Nebraska goes to Colorado and Oklahoma State plays at Oklahoma The big games on Dec are Miami at Virginia Tech Tennessee at Florida and Oregon State at at Oregon If Oklahoma loses to AM Tech or OSU and the Longhorns win out Texas would qualify for the Big Championship Game on Dec The final BCS rankings will be released on December the day after the Big and Southeastern Conference have their championship games Texas probably will be fourth or fifth in the BCS rankings to be released today and the games mentioned above will be big determining factors in where the Horns wind up Jackson McClintock to Redshirt It looks like senior LB Lee Jackson and junior DE O J McClintock will redshirt Both have been out with injuries all season and head coach Mack Brown said last week there are no plans to play them He said Jackson is still having troubles with his toe and his leg He said McClintock wont play unless the team suffers some injuries at DE Number Updated Daily I update my number every day with football and football recruiting news The number is It costs a minute You must be or older to call Coachs Corner The Longhorns now ranked No in both polls after a rash of upsets Saturday are playing well but they need to keep working to get better head coach Mack Brown said Sunday After studying films of the victory over Missouri Brown said he and his assistants were generally pleased with the teams play But he said the defense will work on hard on tackling this week We werent pleased with out tackling Brown said We werent pleased one back gained over yards on us Weve got to get back to work on that He also said the defense did a good job in permitting Missouri to get into the red zone only three times all day but they scored all three times Thats not what we want The offense played a pretty good game he said adding that tackle Mike Wiliams played great Hes our offensive player of the week Defensively he said the player of the week is CB Quentin Jammer who held the Tigers nationally ranked WR Justin Gage to two receptions for yards He was averaging receptions per game and ranked second in the Big in that department Brown also said he is concerned about some aspects of the kicking game We kicked two balls out of bounds on kickoffs he said Weve got some issues there weve got to correct He said backup LB Reed Boyd who plays on several of the kicking teams was our special teams player of the week Asked how he prepares his team for games like the next two against Baylor and Kansas when the opponents are losing and struggling he said Baylor played AM and Oklahoma tough Our guys need to play football because they like playing it If they cant get excited about playing football they dont need to be playing

November Part of Part Recruiting Roundup Today Monday was the day the Longhorn coaches could start another big recruiting push by going to top recruits schools and homes but the big game Saturday has pushed that back a week But dont worry about it Coach Mack Brown wrote the book on recruiting and his previous four classes at Texas have been very good and some of them have been great This years class has a chance to be as good as any Brown and his assistants have signed Theres a chance it could be the best of the bunch even better than the toprated Chris Simms Cory Redding class They already have commitments about half of them from players who have been on at least one national top list and their class already is ranked as one of the top five in the nation Lets take a look at where they are and where they are going OFFENSE Quarterback UT has a commitment from Billy Don Malone of Paris North Lamar who is a lot better than most of the gurus think and the Horns have close to a shot at Vincent Young the wonder kid at Houston Madison who had his usual game Friday for the undefeated Marlins doing everything on offense and even running an interception back for a touchdown Yes he plays defense too when needed Running Back The Horns have a commitment from Clint Haney of unbeaten Smithson Valley and are in the hunt for powerrunner deluxe Albert Hardy of Galena Park and elusive Selvin Young of Jersey Village They have an outside shot at Lorenzo Booker of Ventura Cal the nations highest rated running back Tight End David Thomas of Wolfforth Frenship a national top player on some lists is already committed He is very good The only other TE the Horns are recruiting is Eric Winston the humongous pass catcher and blocker deluxe at Midland Lee Wide Receiver National top star Marquis Johnson of Champaign Ill and Dustin Miksch of Round Rock Westwood are already committed Robert Timmons of Flower Mound Marcus a supremely talented player who has little playing experience because of transfer problems is a possibility and if the Horns dont get him they might wind up with Biren Ealy of Cypress Falls or Anthony Wright of Klein Forest Line The Horns already have a pledge from Neale Tweedie of Allen a great pass blocker who is on several national top lists and from Brett Valdez of Brownwood a tremendous run blocker They are still recruiting Justin Blalock of Plano East and Tony Ugoh of Spring Westfield Blalock is the best run blocker Ive seen this year DEFENSE End Chase Pittman of Shreveport Evangel a national top player has committed and will enroll in January and go through spring training which will give him a chance to see action as a true freshman The Longhorns are in the hunt for Bryan Pickryl of Jenks Okla a speed rusher deluxe Larry Dibbles of Lancaster and Travis Leitko of The Woodlands All three are on every national top list Ive seen Tackle Texas has commitments from four top tackles Sonny Davis of Gulf Coast Community College a JC in Mississippi Earl Anderson of San Marcos Lyle Sendlein of Scottsdale Chapaparral and Tully Jantzen of Keller Davis has some academic issues Sendlein also is a very good offensive lineman and Jantzen is swift enough to play end Texas has a very good shot at Rodrique Wr ight of Alief Hastings the nations top DT and at Marco Martin of Mesquite another national top player Kasey Studdard of Highlands Ranch Colo who excels at DT and OG also is a strong possibility Its on whether he will play offense or defense in college He is the son of David Studdard a former UT offensive line star who had a long career with the Denver Broncos Linebacker Texas starts three seniors and needs a great group Garnet Smith of Arlington Lamar Brian Robison of of Splendora and Marcus Myers of Pflugerville are already committed and the Horns are still recruiting several top one from Texas and across the country A J Nicholson of Winston Salem N C and Aaron Thomas of North Mesquite are national top middle backers who are strongly considering Texas and Michael Williams of Lindale and Rufus Alexander of Baton Rouge Christian Life are fast outside backers the Horns are recruiting Another possibility is Lance Mitchell a top JC linebacker in California who ir orignally from Dallas He is considering taking a visit Defensive Backs Matt Melton a hardhitting safety from Tyler is already committed Swift Edorian McCullough of North Garland the Class A meter champ also is considering Texas along with Brodney Pool a big fast safety from Houston Westbury Kicker Texas is looking for a kicker but has not homed in on one yet The coaches want someone who can kick off into the end zone consistently Longhorn Basketball Adds Pair Twotop basketball recruits have signed with Texas head coach Rick Barnes has announced Brad Buckman a pound forward from Austin Westlake and Kenton Paulino a com bo guard from Los Angeles Fremond HS who will play for Maine Central Institute this season are the new signees Signing Brad

and blocks per game during his junior season He also is tabbed the No prospect in the nation by Clark Francis Hoop Scoop Buckman earned Most Outstanding Player honors at the prestigious Pitt FiveStar Camp this July in Pittsburgh Pa Theres not a program in the nation that did not go after Brad during the recruiting period so to come out on top in that battle is a huge win for us Barnes said Brad turned down four of the most storied programs in college basketball history for the opportunity to play at Texas Barnes said He made one of the biggest jumps in his game that I have seen during the summer camp period Brad has a tremendous competitive fire and is one of those players that fans here will really appreciate Paulino plays under coach Carl Hendrickson at Maine Central He starred at Fremont High School under coach Sam Sullivan where he averaged points a game and earned Los Angeles CoPlayer of the Year accolades during his senior campaign Kenton is one of those explosive scoring guards that we need in our program Barnes said He is a very good shooter with range and an exceptional athlete who highjumped in high school Kenton is the complete guard we were looking for Horns Sign in Softball Texas softball coach Connie Clark has signed centerfielder Tina Boutelle of Katy Taylor and second baseman Chezare Sievers of Aliso Niguel HS in Mission Viejo Calif We are excited about

November Part of Part Game Quotes We actually had an Aggie block Wed worked on it all week but it wasnt working so we went back to our regular block ande I just had to beat the guy in front of me When I saw it was a linebacker I knew he was in trouble Linebackers arent quick enough to block me If I cant get by a big old guy like that I dont deserve my scholarship Longhorn cornerback Rod Babers who blocked the punt that resulted in UTs firstquarter touchdown We were both on the right side he and Babers and they werent zone blocking like we do They were in manforman and all we had to do was beat the guy in front of us Thats my first touchdown as a special teams player Texas wide receiver Tony Jeffery who scooped up the ball Babers blocked and ran it in for the games first touchdown We did a good job against the run I thought Maurice Gordon probably played as good as hes every played for us Their center AllBig Seth McKinney is a good ball player and at times he couldnt block him I thought all our guys played pretty well today This was a good oldfashioned football game with both teams playing good defense and a break or two deciding the outcome UT defensive coordinator Carl Reese We felt like if we would just hang in there and hang in there wed eventually get the running game going and Cedric Benson and the offensive line did a great job in the fourth quarter With Cedric you dont have to abandon the running game because you know hell break loose sooner or later We didnt want to take too many chances and give them a short field because we knew they would have a hard time making a long drive with our defense playing so well Texas defensive coordinator Greg Davis It never got easier but it did get better I think our linemen finally wore them down and I started getting a little more room It would have been nice to get yards but winning the game is the main thing and we did that Texas running back Cedric Benson Give the Longhorns some credit Their defense is really good It ranks with any we have seen this year AM quarterback Mark Farris The game was up for grabs in the fourth quarter They just made some plays It was and they did what they had to do in the fourth quarter

Championship Game It will be televised nationally by ABC and it should be a good one Texas is an point favorite The Longhorns mauled the Buffaloes on Oct in Austin but that Colorado team bore little resemblance to the one that hung a lashing on No ranked Nebraska Saturday For starters Bobby Pesavento who passed for yards against Nebraska got his first start against Texas and he looked like a firsttime starter He was a poised confident sharpshooter Saturday against Nebraska the perfect complement for the Buffs power running game that produced yards and eight rushing touchdowns against the proud Blackshirt defense of Nebraska Sophomore Chris Brown scored a school record six rushing touchdowns while rushing for yards He had yards against Texas in October Colorado is Its only losses were in the season opener with Fresno State and the one at Texas The nine victories were over Colorado State over San Jose State over Kansas over Kansas State over Texas AM over giantkiller Oklahoma State over Missouri over Iowa State and of course the big one over Nebraska Texas won the first game against Colorado by using four firsthalf turnovers to take a lead and force the Buffaloes the abandon their running game and try to play catchup In that game Colorado had yards offensively in the first half but was stymied by a fumble at the UT on firstand goal a fumble at the CU that set up a Texas field goal and another fumble at the Buff that set up another UT touchdown Unless history repeats and the Horns force more early turnovers this game will be a terrific challenge for Texas I think there are three keys to a UT victory Win the turnover battle again Keep balance between running and passing but challenge the Buffs suspect pass defense frequently Slow down Colorados power running

happen to teams who keep winning After a midseason loss to Oklahoma the Longhorns have reeled off six straight wins and Oklahoma States stunning upset of Oklahoma Saturday gave Texas the Big Southern Division title Obviously he said we are excited about it because it proves to our guys that when people questioned whether their season was over after the Oklahoma game that it wasnt They realized that what they needed to do was take care of their business and there might be some good things that happen at the end Our team couldve taken the Missouri game or the Baylor game for granted but they didnt They took care of their business every week They didnt worry about the BCS and now theyve got themselves in position for a championship game for the second time in three years We are really really excited I am proud of our team and of the way they played at College Station What an awful thing it would have been if we had not taken care of business Friday in College Station and this would have happened OUs loss Saturday So give credit to our team for being mature playing hard and putting themselves in position to have a rematch with Colorado He also said the Longhorns victory over Colorado in Austin back on October means little because this isnt the same Colorado team we played at midseason Any team that can get points against Nebraska gets your attention he said I think it is obvious that Colorado is a great football team They are running the ball as good as anybody in the country right now What a great challenge it will be for our defense which has played as good as any defense in the country he said That will be a great matchup Brown said the Longhorn offense had a tough day against AM We will need to play better on offense in this game and what a great challenge it will be to try to stop Colorado from running the ball as well as they ran it against Nebraska he said Brown also said Saturdays game is huge because it is for the Big Championship You always want to win your conference championship he said It is one of your first goals each year This is our second opportunity to win a conference championship in four years here and are we excited The BCS is not an issue today and a bowl game is not an issue today he said This is what you fight to get into but when you get there youve got to win After that you try to look up and figure out where you are But Brown said beating Colorado again is a huge challenge for the Longhorns If our guys werent convinced before the Nebraska game we will convince them that this Colorado team is different he said Give Colorado coach Gary Barnett credit He took his kids to Texas Stadium this summer and said that is where we want to end up and as of Saturday nobody thought that Colorado and Texas would end up in this ball game So give both teams credit Brown said It is two teams that have been down this year and have gotten themselves back up gone back to work and are playing as well as anyone in the country at the end of the year One of the things that we have talked about with this team is respect You need to respect yourself and your teammates but you also need to respect your opponent Every Saturday has to be a real important game for us and a really exciting game for us Our guys will play hard this Saturday because they understand what is at stake To win the conference championship in this league Brown said you have to beat the same team twice a lot of the time That is something that is just there To be the champion you have to do it so we are excited about it There is no question that it is harder because they will have a lot of motivation coming in But we are also going to have a lot of motivation coming in to try to be the champions of the Big He said the players and coaches are excited about the challenge This is a championship game week he said You understand that this is like playing your biggest rival and that makes it fun What we have to do to win the championship every year is play a huge rival like Texas AM and then play this game the next week We need to get used to that There are a lot of things that are different now in the Big that they were around here for a long time with the Southwest Conference One of them is being able to play big game after big game and especially at the end of the year We have been here before but we havent taken the other step yet This is the week for us to take the other step and win the championship Our players are the reason why we are here Different things have happened throughout the year and this was just the latest one The reason we are playing in this game is our assistant coaches and our players have worked really hard to take advantage of every opportunity that they have had since the Oklahoma game They never got their head down and still believed They kept themselves in a position to win if the opportunity came up Brown had planned a big recruiting push this week but said We will put our recruiting on hold All of the coaches could go out on Monday for the first time and be in schools and the homes but the players out there will understand that our recruiting will be better by winning the championship game

November Part of Jerry Scarbroughs True Orange The Newsletter for the True Texas Longhorn Faithful Volume No November Editors Note Im sending this in four pieces today because it is a bigger issue than usual due to the spring recruiting in basketball track and softball Volume No November Benson Defense Stifle Ags Huge Upsets Propel Horns Into Big Title Game Against Colorado As Longhorn defensive coordinator Carl Reese noted it was an oldfashioned rockem sockem game in College Station before a state record football crowd of Friday and Texas won it with a gritty defense and two late touchdowns by outstanding freshman RB Cedric Benson After taking the victory head coach Mack Brown congratulated the team on its fine season and said he wasnt worried about the Bowl Championship Series BCS because well be in it I dont know if had a crystal ball but immediately after the Longhorns expected victory toprated Nebraska was humiliated by Colorado and the next day No Oklahoma a point favorite lost at home to Oklahoma State It was only the fifth time OSU has won at OU The good news is those games moved Texas up to the No spot in both major polls and put the Longhorns back in control of their own destiny for the first time since that loss to OU back in October Texas plays Colorado Saturday at pm in Irvings Texas Stadium for the Big Championship and an automatic berth in one of the four BCS bowls possibly even the Rose Bowl in the national title game But the bad news is that a loss to the stampeding Buffaloes would knock the Longhorns out of the BCS mix Brown and his players are tickled orange however at the chance to play for the conference championship The BCS isnt an issue today Brown said Saturday after the huge upset in Norman The Bowl game isnt an issue today We said we needed to get to the championship game he said but once you get there you need to win After that you just look up and try to figure out where you are People have been asking us about the BCS for five weeks Brown said Obviously we said we needed to wait until the end of the season and the ends not even near where it should be People havent given us or Colorado a chance to be in this game for five weeks To our kids credit and to Colorados kids credit they kept working hard and now they are in this game The coaches and players have to forget the Aggie game and get ready for the Buffaloes but we can enjoy it just a little longer This was a game where the defenses werent going to give up a lot but the Longhorns got an early special teams touchdown when CB Roderick Babers blocked a punt and WR Tony Jeffery scooped it up and scored The Aggies tied it on a yard drive after a fine punt return in the third quarter when they had the benefit of the strong wind which was around miles per hour with frequent gusts to or miles per hour But Nathan Vasher made a couple of good punt returns and Texas started the pivotal fourth quarter with the wind and a drive into Aggie territory that changed the field position for the rest of the game After a short Aggie punt midway through the period the Longhorns rode Bensons strong legs to a touchdown then they got another from the powerful freshman after Everick Rawls interception in the final two minutes Here briefly is how the game went First Quarter Texas won the toss and deferred After each defense got a quick stop the Aggies were stymied a second time and Babers blocked the punt and Jeffery returned it yards for a Longhorn TD and a lead with left Another threeandout by the Aggies followed by a shanked punt gave Texas possession at the UT The Horns made one first down and Dusty Mangum missed a yard field goal try Defenses dominated the quarter AM led in first downs and in total yardage Second Quarter A shanked punt by UTs Brian Bradford set the Aggies up at the Longhorn AM couldnt move but punted the ball dead at the UT The Longhorn offense which had done little with the stiff wind couldnt move into it and Bradfords yard punt a good one into the wind gave AM possessiion at the UT The Aggies made a first down at the before stalling Cody Scates missed a yard field goal attempt An interception of a long pass at the UT by safety Ahmad Brooks with just under five minutes left in the half finally pumped a little life into the Longhorn offense which drove to midfield and killed all but seconds of the half before stalling Texas had a lead in first downs and a lead in total offense at intermission Third Quarter Texas got the ball going into the wind to start the second half The Horns couldnt move and punted AMs Mickey Jones almost tied the game on the punt return starting right then racing left and going down the sideline for yards before being pushed out of bounds at the UT The Aggies hit a pass to the UT then pound RB Keith Joseph took over powering to the left to the then taking a pitchout to the right for the TD to tie the game with left The Horns came right back with a good drive to midfield sparked by two passes from Simms to TE Bo Scaife But facing fourth down with an inch or two needed a lineman flinched and UT drew a yard penalty and had to punt Fourth Quarter Benson who had been stymied throughout the first three quarters got and then yards on his first two carries of the final period getting the Horns to the Aggie But the UT offense stalled again and Bradfords punt was killed at the Aggie The Texas defense force a quick punt into the wind and Vasher alertly ran up and caught the short punt at the AM and returned it to the Benson got loose for to the then got and to the On third and Simms hit Scaife coming across the middle to the AM Benson powered through the right side for the TD on the next play Mangums kick put UT on top with left Rawls interception at the AM and return to the with left set up the final UT touchdown Benson got then ran through a big hole and powered through two defenders for the TD and the final count Rose Bowl Road Full of Thorns If you still have some hope the Longhorns will be playing for the national title in the Rose Bowl on January heres what it would take A victory over Colorado Saturday A loss for either Florida or Miami and probably a loss for Oregon too because the Ducks were ahead of Texas in the last BCS ratings The Horns have to be No or No in the final BCS ratings on December to get to Pasadena Miami plays at Virginia Tech Saturday while Florida hosts Tennessee and Oregon also is at home against Oregon State If Florida beats Tennessee the Gators would have to win the SEC title game on December against the winner of Saturdays game between Auburn and LSU Since that game is in Baton Rouge and Auburns outstanding running back broke his shoulder two weeks ago LSU probably will be the Gators Dec opponent Its asking a lot for two of those three teams to lose a game but after the games in Boulder and Norman last weekend anything is possible Longhorn Notes Saturdays meeting between Texas and Colorado will be the sixth Big Championship Game Texas won the inaugural title game in Nebraska triumphed in and Texas AM won the title in and Oklahoma took the crown in If Texas wins Saturday the Longhorns will join Nebraska as the only twotime champs Since the Big Championship Game counts in statistical manners RB Cedric Benson has a great chance to become the first Longhorn freshman to rush for more than yards in a season He has yards and ranks second among Longhorn freshmen behind Ricky Williams who rushed for yards in Benson broke the UT freshman record for touchdowns with his pair of fourthquarter rushing scores He has touchdowns on the season rushing and one on a shovel pass reception breaking the record of set by Roy Williams last year Benson had only yards on carries after three quarters Friday in College Station but he finished strong carrying times for yards and scoring the Longhorns only two offensive touchdowns in the final period He finished with carries for yards and two touchdowns The UT defense is allowing yards a game rushing the fourth lowest average in school history trailing only teams from the old oneplatoon days when defense dominated and games were the norm The only lower season averages were in in and in This is Texas first win season since which was the last time Texas won at Kyle Field The Longhorns have had teams with or more wins in a season but this is just the third since Texas evened the series in College Station UT leads the overall series The Texas defense has held its last eight opponents to less than yards of total offense Texas AM gained yards which was the fourth time Texas has held its opponent to less than yards in Sophomore WR BJ Johnson extended his streak of consecutive games with a catch to a UT record to start a career and the thirdlongest in school history Mike Adams holds the school record of which he set from Sophomore WR Roy Williams has caught a pass in straight games He had eight receptions o move into sixth place on the UT career receptions list He also moved into second place on UTs singleseason list with receptions Junior QB Chris Simms passed for yards giving him yards on the season and placing him second on the UT singleseason chart Major Applewhite holds the UT record with yards in Senior LB DD Lewis tied the UT record with his th straight start He now shares the record with Dan Neil Freshman WR Tony Jeffery scored his second career touchdown when he returned Rod Babers blocked punt yards in the first quarter His first score came against Houston when he had a yard touchdown reception Texas has returned two blocked punts for touchdowns in the first was by sophomore safety Phillip Geiggar against New Mexico State Junior CB Rod Babers blocked a punt for the second straight game It was his second blocked kick of the season and the fifth for Texas as a team Texas has blocked seven kicks overall this season Fridays victory marked UTs eighth straight road victory and th in its last games Texas has produced seven defensive or special teams scores in including four in the last three games The Texas defense has had an interception in six straight games and eight of games this season Texas is when scoring first when leading at halftime and when outrushing its opponent during the Mack Brown era The Horns are when they are outrushed during the Brown era

Number Updated Daily I update my number every day with football and football recruiting news The number is It costs a minute You must be or older to call Texas the BCS and the Bowl Situation Forget calculating the Longhorns BCS standings and their chances of getting into a BCS bowl It all got simplified when Nebraska and Oklahoma both lost last weekend Now two improbable division winners Texas in the South and Colorado in the North will meet Saturday for the Big Championship and the automatic BCS berth that goes with it It would take another big round of upsets for Texas to make it to the National Championship Game in the Rose Bowl but a second victory over the Buffs Saturday would guarantee the Horns a BCS bowl bid It could be the Fiesta Bowl in Phoenix which normally gets the Big champion if the Big champ isnt in the national title game But the BCS bowls can trade things around and the Rose Bowl normally the meeting place for the Big and Pac champs wont have a team from either of those conferences in it unless Oregon gets lucky So some Fiesta Bowl folks would like to turn their bowl into Rose Bowl II by inviting the Big and Pac champs They reportedly have been talking to the Sugar Bowl folks about switching teams and the New Orleans folks reportedly would love to have the Longhorns assuming they take care of business Saturday in Texas Stadium There also is an outside chance the Orange Bowl will get in on the swapping so the Horns could wind up there And what if Colorado pulls another big upset Saturday Then we hope all of you love the Cotton Bowl because that is where Texas will be when the new year begins The new BCS standings will be issued Monday but for the first time since that all started it really wont matter where Texas stands because a win Saturday will guarantee a BCS bowl berth and a loss will guarantee there wont be a BCS bowl berth for Texas
