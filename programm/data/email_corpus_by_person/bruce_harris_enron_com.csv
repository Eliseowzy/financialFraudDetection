them into the brokerage account with some sales occurring over time going forward If this plan is agreed to then early next week we can call BONY together with Morgan Stanley our prime broker and work out a streamlined settlement procedure so that MS is assured that shares will be delivered Regards Bruce To Bruce nron cc Subject Re Next steps with Copel shares Bruce Please add theresa brogan to the

nron Sheila CT Edward E nron Rick nron Jeffrey E SommersENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re Next steps with Copel shares Bruce Harris We do not need to set up a new Cayman entity to transfer the two certificates for M to We achieve no US tax benefit for transferring or holding the shares in a Cayman entity I propose that EBPH XII obtain the two certificates and then distribute those certificates to Enron South America LLC the sole shareholder of EBPH XII The value of the certificates at the date of transfer will determine the US tax treatment Given the liquidity discount surrounding the stock using the screen price on the date of the transaction is probably not a good indicator of the fair market value For tax purposes we will assume the value to be the historical cost basis since recent trades have been in a narrow band on either side of that value If the first M certificate is sold shortly after the transfer to Enron South America LLC we will need to adjust the transfer price since the sales price to a third party will be a valid indicator of what the fair market value was on the date of the distribution If the ultimate transfer price is higher than the tax basis EBPHXII will recognize taxable income and pay US tax on the gain in the year the distribution was made to Enron South America LLC This would result in reporting a tax expense in and perhaps book income in if that sale takes place after the end of the year If the value on the date of the transfer is ultimately determined to be less than the historical tax basis the distribution to Enron South America LLC will result in there being unrecovered basis in EBPH XII If the shares are sold by EBPH XII to affiliated Cayman companies the same valuation issues exist with the same potential for recognition of US gain on the sale from EBPH XII to an affiliated Distributing the shares to Enron South America LLC will be much easier Lynn Bruce Harris AM To Robert H nron Kay CT cc Dan nron Lynn nron Joe nron Kent nron

Brazil and into the parent CayCos I understand that by sometime early next week the physical ADR certificates will be returned by BONY to the Enron vault Here is what we now need to do We are going to need to send one certificate back to BONY and split it into three new certificates Two certificates will be for approximately M shares each the balance for about M shares We need to form a new CayCo and sell or otherwise transfer capital split the two M tranches to this NewCo This needs to happen next week Pending Dan Boyles structuring efforts and an affirmative Corp decision supervised by Joe Kishkill the two existing CayCos which now own the Copel shares will be sold into Whitewing Fund That means about M shares will go to Whitewing and the certificates will remain in the vault This would happen last week of the yearif it happens there are actually about total ADRsI am approximating in this email The NewCo shares will remain outside this structure entirely We will need to put one tranche of M into a brokerage accountSheila at this point we will bring you in for assistance again hopefully next week Robertwe need to work out soon with Sheila Skaddenand BONY to establish an efficient mechanism to convert the full M share certificate to unrestricted ADRs absent and prior an immediate buyersor we need to figure out foolproof mechanics for constantly reissuing new certificates for every small sale We will then be looking for effective points to sell these M sharesand again Joe Kishkill will provide pricevolume targets execution via Gary Hickersons group who has not yet been informed In months time we will repeat the process for the other M tranche Robertplease call me so we can determine a how to set up NewCotransfer shares and b how to work the M

are going to do with the shares now that they are directly held in the Corp vault by Enron Brazil Power Holding XII I suspect that what we will do will be to just keep all the shares in XII and put them into the brokerage account with some sales occurring over time going forward If this plan is agreed to then early next week we can call BONY together with Morgan Stanley our prime broker and work out a streamlined settlement procedure so that MS is assured that shares will be delivered Regards Bruce To Bruce nron cc Subject Re Next steps with Copel shares Bruce Please add theresa brogan to the

nron Sheila CT Edward E nron Rick nron Jeffrey E SommersENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re Next steps with Copel shares Bruce Harris We do not need to set up a new Cayman entity to transfer the two certificates for M to We achieve no US tax benefit for transferring or holding the shares in a Cayman entity I propose that EBPH XII obtain the two certificates and then distribute those certificates to Enron South America LLC the sole shareholder of EBPH XII The value of the certificates at the date of transfer will determine the US tax treatment Given the liquidity discount surrounding the stock using the screen price on the date of the transaction is probably not a good indicator of the fair market value For tax purposes we will assume the value to be the historical cost basis since recent trades have been in a narrow band on either side of that value If the first M certificate is sold shortly after the transfer to Enron South America LLC we will need to adjust the transfer price since the sales price to a third party will be a valid indicator of what the fair market value was on the date of the distribution If the ultimate transfer price is higher than the tax basis EBPHXII will recognize taxable income and pay US tax on the gain in the year the distribution was made to Enron South America LLC This would result in reporting a tax expense in and perhaps book income in if that sale takes place after the end of the year If the value on the date of the transfer is ultimately determined to be less than the historical tax basis the distribution to Enron South America LLC will result in there being unrecovered basis in EBPH XII If the shares are sold by EBPH XII to affiliated Cayman companies the same valuation issues exist with the same potential for recognition of US gain on the sale from EBPH XII to an affiliated Distributing the shares to Enron South America LLC will be much easier Lynn Bruce Harris AM To Robert H nron Kay CT cc Dan nron Lynn nron Joe nron Kent nron Bruce nron Sheila CT Edward E nron Rick nron Jeffrey E SommersENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Next steps with Copel shares Robert and Kay thanks for all your work on getting the shares moved out of Brazil and into the parent CayCos I understand that by sometime early next week the physical ADR certificates will be returned by BONY to the Enron vault Here is what we now need to do We are going to need to send one certificate back to BONY and split it into three new certificates Two certificates will be for approximately M shares each the balance for about M shares We need to form a new CayCo and sell or otherwise transfer capital split the two M tranches to this NewCo This needs to happen next week Pending Dan Boyles structuring efforts and an affirmative Corp decision supervised by Joe Kishkill the two existing CayCos which now own the Copel shares will be sold into Whitewing Fund That means about M shares will go to Whitewing and the certificates will remain in the vault This would happen last week of the yearif it happens there are actually about total ADRsI am approximating in this email The NewCo shares will remain outside this structure entirely We will need to put one tranche of M into a brokerage accountSheila at this point we will bring you in for assistance again hopefully next week Robertwe need to work out soon with Sheila Skaddenand BONY to establish an efficient mechanism to convert the full M share certificate to unrestricted ADRs absent and prior an immediate buyersor we need to figure out foolproof mechanics for constantly reissuing new certificates for every small sale We will then be looking for effective points to sell these M sharesand again Joe Kishkill will provide pricevolume targets execution via Gary Hickersons group who has not yet been informed In months time we will repeat the process for the other M tranche Robertplease call me so we can determine a how to set up NewCotransfer shares and b how to work the M
