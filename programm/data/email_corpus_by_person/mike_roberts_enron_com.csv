is really a homerun hitter Mike Forwarded by Mike A RobertsHOUECT on AM Enron North America Corp From Stephen Bennett ENRON AM To Mike A CT cc Subject London Status Report Hi Mike Before we meet with Vince tomorrow I thought we should drop you a line and give you an idea as to whats been accomplished in the first week as well as some of the challenges and problems weve run into This way we can make the most effective use of Vinces time Current Products and Customers In our first days we established different customer groups representing approximately traders plus additional fundamentals and analytics folks The groups are UK Trading Gas Fundamentals Crude Trading Weather Derivatives Continental Power and an internal trader newsletter Weve built the following framework to address these customers the key deadlines are noted UK TradingWeather DerivativesFundamentals Prepare a to day UK specific forecast and assess the z runs of the ECMWF and ensembles the AVN as well as EarthSats day outlook The traders are particularly interested in the performance of the ECMWF as it feeds all of their demand models We prepare a page summary and give an idea as to any particular forecast biases whether we feel things may come in warmer or colder than the model We brief the traders and field questions then provide our report to the fundamentals group In the future we would like to be able to gather raw data from the AVN and MRF to provide a series of choices which could be input into their demand models or at least be able to give them our best pick of guidance and how we feel things may deviate from that pick AM Obtain the UK Met and day forecasts Provide comment for UK Trading UK TradingCrude and ProductsWeather Derivatives Prepare a full qualitative analysis of z models MRFNOGAPSCANADIANEnsembles Produce a to day Europe forecast and make any needed adjustments to the to day forecast Produce the Global Weather Report including a Global Executive Summary Analysis of Teleconnections and their expected impact to and to day forecasts compared to EarthSat A day city forecast table for European Cities along with the expected effect on heating demand and finally A port status report describing weather and port conditions in worldwide ports Update traders UK and Wx Deriv on changes or new trends in the z models Provide a quality assessment of the UK Met to and to day forecast for UK Trading MonWed Brief the Crude and Products groups in London and Houston Review z AVN for any major forecast changes and communicate changes to traders Weekly Produce a weather article for Critical Mass internal trading newsletter Of course between and we are looking closely at the US weather for support to you guys in Houston Im still writing the daily US Executive summary as well as producing a to day US forecast Requested Projects Gas Fundamentals has asked us to provide weather information for their morning report and website They would like to be able to gather objective output from as many forecast models as we can get Weather Derivatives has asked for week ahead month ahead and seasonal outlooks for temperature and precipitation They have also asked about creating a tradeable NAO Index and developing an inhouse model for forecasting NAO Continental Power has asked for temperature and precipitation outlooks for power generation and hydro Gas Fundamentals UK Trading Continental Power Weather Derivatives and Crude and Products have all asked for a European Summer Outlook for temperature and precipitation We expect to have this completed tomorrow The research group has asked for assistance in gathering climate data across Spain for temperature and precipitation Leads to Follow Up On Elsa in Houston asked us to contact some of the Softs traders here and let them know once we were up and running Contact Chris Mahoney to determine if we can provide and additional support for Crude and Products Follow up on a potential morning breifing for Continental Power Challenges Weve been told that we will be moving locations next week which might entail corrupting or loosing the software and hardware configurations that have taken almost a week to get fully established It seems that this office functions on a hot desk system where people are constantly moving around This will make it very difficult to stay connected as well as very difficult for our customers to identify us Administrative detail take an inordinate amount of time Assembling reports both physical and electronic can take nearly as long as actually preparing the reports Mike OK I think that brings you up to speed Ive been amazed at the amount of feedback weve already gotten and weve only been here days On that note I wanted to let you know that I am fully committed to this project It seems that we will not have a second meteorologist to assist Tony by my planned departure date on the th As such I can continue in my current role through my planned vacation keeping me in London until the th which is my current reservation back to Houston I am also open to remaining in London beyond the th to ensure the success of this project Hopefully this gives you a good idea as to whats gone on in the first few days here We look forward to talking to you later today and with you and Vince tomorrow

Vince tomorrow I thought we should drop you a line and give you an idea as to whats been accomplished in the first week as well as some of the challenges and problems weve run into This way we can make the most effective use of Vinces time Current Products and Customers In our first days we established different customer groups representing approximately traders plus additional fundamentals and analytics folks The groups are UK Trading Gas Fundamentals Crude Trading Weather Derivatives Continental Power and an internal trader newsletter Weve built the following framework to address these customers the key deadlines are noted UK TradingWeather DerivativesFundamentals Prepare a to day UK specific forecast and assess the z runs of the ECMWF and ensembles the AVN as well as EarthSats day outlook The traders are particularly interested in the performance of the ECMWF as it feeds all of their demand models We prepare a page summary and give an idea as to any particular forecast biases whether we feel things may come in warmer or colder than the model We brief the traders and field questions then provide our report to the fundamentals group In the future we would like to be able to gather raw data from the AVN and MRF to provide a series of choices which could be input into their demand models or at least be able to give them our best pick of guidance and how we feel things may deviate from that pick AM Obtain the UK Met and day forecasts Provide comment for UK Trading UK TradingCrude and ProductsWeather Derivatives Prepare a full qualitative analysis of z models MRFNOGAPSCANADIANEnsembles Produce a to day Europe forecast and make any needed adjustments to the to day forecast Produce the Global Weather Report including a Global Executive Summary Analysis of Teleconnections and their expected impact to and to day forecasts compared to EarthSat A day city forecast table for European Cities along with the expected effect on heating demand and finally A port status report describing weather and port conditions in worldwide ports Update traders UK and Wx Deriv on changes or new trends in the z models Provide a quality assessment of the UK Met to and to day

Trading Continental Power Weather Derivatives and Crude and Products have all asked for a European Summer Outlook for temperature and precipitation We expect to have this completed tomorrow The research group has asked for assistance in gathering climate data across Spain for temperature and precipitation Leads to Follow Up On Elsa in Houston asked us to contact some of the Softs traders here and let them know once we were up and running Contact Chris Mahoney to determine if we can provide and additional support for Crude and Products Follow up on a potential morning breifing for Continental Power Challenges Weve been told that we will be moving locations next week which might entail corrupting or loosing the software and hardware configurations that have taken almost a week to get fully established It seems that this office functions on a hot desk system where people are constantly moving around This will make it very difficult to stay connected as well as very difficult for our customers to identify us Administrative detail take an inordinate amount of time Assembling reports both physical and electronic can take nearly as long as actually preparing the reports Mike OK I think that brings you up to speed Ive been amazed at the amount of feedback weve already gotten and weve only been here days On that note I wanted to let you know that I am fully committed to this project It seems that we will not have a second meteorologist to assist Tony by my planned departure date on the th As such I can continue in my current role through my planned vacation keeping me in London until the th which is my current reservation back to Houston I am also open to remaining in London beyond the th to ensure the success of this project Hopefully this gives you a good idea as to whats gone on in the first few days here We look forward to talking to you later today and with you and Vince tomorrow

is really a homerun hitter Mike Forwarded by Mike A RobertsHOUECT on AM Enron North America Corp From Stephen Bennett ENRON AM To Mike A CT cc Subject London Status Report Hi Mike Before we meet with Vince tomorrow I thought we should drop you a line and give you an idea as to whats been accomplished in the first week as well as some of the challenges and problems weve run into This way we can make the most effective use of Vinces time Current Products and Customers In our first days we established different customer groups representing approximately traders plus additional fundamentals and analytics folks The groups are UK Trading Gas Fundamentals Crude Trading Weather Derivatives Continental Power and an internal trader newsletter Weve built the following framework to address these customers the key deadlines are noted UK TradingWeather DerivativesFundamentals Prepare a to day UK specific forecast and assess the z runs of the ECMWF and ensembles the AVN as well as EarthSats day outlook The traders are particularly interested in the performance of the ECMWF as it feeds all of their demand models We prepare a page summary and give an idea as to any particular forecast biases whether we feel things may come in warmer or colder than the model We brief the traders and field questions then provide our report to the fundamentals group In the future we would like to be able to gather raw data from the AVN and MRF to provide a series of choices which could be input into their demand models or at least be able to give them our best pick of guidance and how we feel things may deviate from that pick AM Obtain the UK Met and day forecasts Provide comment for UK Trading UK TradingCrude and ProductsWeather Derivatives Prepare a full qualitative analysis of z models MRFNOGAPSCANADIANEnsembles Produce a to day Europe forecast and make any needed adjustments to the to day forecast Produce the Global Weather Report including a Global Executive Summary Analysis of Teleconnections and their expected impact to and to day forecasts compared to EarthSat A day city forecast table for European Cities along with the expected effect on heating demand and finally A port status report describing weather and port conditions in worldwide ports Update traders UK and Wx Deriv on changes or new trends in the z models Provide a quality assessment of the UK Met to and to day forecast for UK Trading MonWed Brief the Crude and Products groups in London and Houston Review z AVN for any major forecast changes and communicate changes to traders Weekly Produce a weather article for Critical Mass internal trading newsletter Of course between and we are looking closely at the US weather for support to you guys in Houston Im still writing the daily US Executive summary as well as producing a to day US forecast Requested Projects Gas Fundamentals has asked us to provide weather information for their morning report and website They would like to be able to gather objective output from as many forecast models as we can get Weather Derivatives has asked for week ahead month ahead and seasonal outlooks for temperature and precipitation They have also asked about creating a tradeable NAO Index and developing an inhouse model for forecasting NAO Continental Power has asked for temperature and precipitation outlooks for power generation and hydro Gas Fundamentals UK Trading Continental Power Weather Derivatives and Crude and Products have all asked for a European Summer Outlook for temperature and precipitation We expect to have this completed tomorrow The research group has asked for assistance in gathering climate data across Spain for temperature and precipitation Leads to Follow Up On Elsa in Houston asked us to contact some of the Softs traders here and let them know once we were up and running Contact Chris Mahoney to determine if we can provide and additional support for Crude and Products Follow up on a potential morning breifing for Continental Power Challenges Weve been told that we will be moving locations next week which might entail corrupting or loosing the software and hardware configurations that have taken almost a week to get fully established It seems that this office functions on a hot desk system where people are constantly moving around This will make it very difficult to stay connected as well as very difficult for our customers to identify us Administrative detail take an inordinate amount of time Assembling reports both physical and electronic can take nearly as long as actually preparing the reports Mike OK I think that brings you up to speed Ive been amazed at the amount of feedback weve already gotten and weve only been here days On that note I wanted to let you know that I am fully committed to this project It seems that we will not have a second meteorologist to assist Tony by my planned departure date on the th As such I can continue in my current role through my planned vacation keeping me in London until the th which is my current reservation back to Houston I am also open to remaining in London beyond the th to ensure the success of this project Hopefully this gives you a good idea as to whats gone on in the first few days here We look forward to talking to you later today and with you and Vince tomorrow
