<24255314.1075858587755.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,stephen_kruft@swissre.com,2001-08-15 10:06:02,Re Revised Annex Cc summe Dear Joe I do appreciate this point and assumed from the draft that this was the reasoning I could reach the same conclusions if the provision in question were in essence a crossdefault provision As an obvious example that you provide if a CP is suspended from a stock exchange and this produces a default under another agreement this should not necessarily impact the Master Agreement Similarly if a party to another agreement is obligated my English colleagues insist the correct word is obliged to furnish a particular document and fails to do so thus breaching an affirmative covenant this alone arguably should not have a serious consequence under the Master Agreement The reason I do not concur here is that instead this provision is in essence a crossacceleration usable only if the other instrument is actually terminated early for default This is already the most lenient variant of a crossdefault The considerations should for that reason be different I see acceleration as a much more severe event that in practice does not occur except in serious circumstances At least if it is in a material amount perhaps by meeting the crossdefault threshold it should in my view have the same effect regardless of the cause Regards Steve Kruft Joseph Carrico schaftde PM To cc Angela Papesch David Benton Chip Goodrich Daniel Cunningham David Wysoki Emily Jelich Jeff Golden Jane Carlin Josh Cohn Ken Kopelman Kimberly Summe Mark Taylor Marlisa Vinciguerra Peter Werner Richard Metcalfe Bob Mancini Robert Pickel Shigeki Kawano Teruo Tanaka Tomoko Morita Richard Tredgett Subject Re Revised Annex Dear Mr Kruft I appreciate your question with respect to this provision as the issues are definitely not transparent There are two issues at play here i the ISDA Master Agreement being the credit agreement for many OTC products with certain Events of Default having been initially drafted by ISDA committees and then bilaterally negotiated between the parties and ii the desirability to be able to trigger a default on the ISDA when a credit relevant event occurs under another transaction which is often governed by another master agreement The actual events of default in these other nonISDA agreements will include events such as failure to pay or post margin breach of representation and insolvency which are similar to events which would lead to an Event of Default under the ISDA However some underlying lending or repo agreements may have events of default which seem much more relevant for a particular book of transactions but not as a credit event for the entire OTC book governed by the ISDA eg being suspended from a stock exchange What I have attempted to do is to isolate those events which would have been an Event of Default had such transaction been a Transaction under the relevant ISDA Master Agreement In this manner should it so desire a party may elect to negotiate additional broader Events of Default that would also function for av but the vast majority of parties who use the basic menu of Events of Default would not find their ISDA agreements being cross polluted from these other events that were unforeseen when the ISDA was negotiated Regards Joe wrote Ladies and gentlemen I apologize for commenting at this late date but I still do not understand why this language should be present where the event resulting in the default is an event which would have been an Event of Default had such Specified Transaction been a Transaction under this Agreement in a situation where the provision is in essence a crossacceleration rather than a crossdefault I can understand the reasoning if this were a crossdefault although the language would still be quite unusual On the other hand if the other instrument is actually accelerated because the party failed to perform its obligations or failed to meet some other requirement then it seems that the master agreement should follow Of particular concern are cases where the applicable master agreement itself has been negotiated down so that its events of default are limited and the impact is thus to limit still further the effect of this provision Regards Steve
