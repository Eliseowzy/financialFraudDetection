equivalent amount of power from MSEB at another spot on their grid and then EIPL sell to the rd party state Pinnamaneni CT PM To Sandeep KohliENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Vince J CT Wade ClineENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re MarktoMarket Document link Wade Cline Sandeep I met with Bob today and discussed the deal structure we put together On the marktomarket issue Bob and his colleague Wess told me that as long as payments are tied to one particular plant we cannot mtm them They had same problem with plants here in the US like the peaking plants and they had to separate the plant from power sales to be able to mtm the assocated cashflows What they did is they sold power from the plant to an outside party and bought it back from them at completely different multiple locations The buyback is not tied to any specific plant and is marked to maket Even if Enron can somehow marktomarket a deal with DPC it can do so for only of the cashflows because only of DPC is owned by outsiders And a simple loan to an affiliate cannot also be marked to market Bob was suggesting that if EIPL buys options from DPC and from some other plants and in turn sells power to AP or Karnataka then we could have a case for mtm Politically DPC selling power to EIPL may not be the best solution to put it rather mildly Our alternatives as I see them are Do the deal as we structured it The only difference is that Enron doesnt mark it to market and income is earned only in Do the deal as we structured it EIPLEnron then sells the contract to another party at a profit The problem of course is finding this party and forking part of the profit to them Same deal except revenue securitization is done through an outside party in India not EIPL Bob said he will think about the issues some more this week Let me know when you will be here next week so we can meet with Bob together I will be going to Boston for Tuesday andor Wednesday Feb I can book an appt with Bob for us Sandeep NRONDEVELOPMENT PM To Robert Butts Pinnamaneni CT cc Vince Kaminski Wade ClineENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Ananda Mukerji Jaiprakash DesaiENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject MarktoMarket Bob I wanted to continue the analysis on marktomarket that I had spoken to you about on the phone I thought that it was getting very difficult explaining the whole transaction by phone so I am having Krishnarao who is in Vinces group explain the transaction to you Krishna has been helping us structure the deal here in India and he has just returned to Houston from India after working with the team here He will seek an appointment with you to explain the transaction I would like you to please spend some time with him and then based on the discussion please send us a note detailing how sucha a transaction would be marked to market Please cosider the fact that currently there are no such transactions from the Indian side This is a very important transaction for us and we may need to repeat this in coming months hence setting up the system to account for these maybe well worth it Also what I am concerned about is that there will be an Enron India EIPL account in India based on Indian GAAP and upon consolidation there will be a US GAAP accounting in the US It is here that we would like to have marktomarket accounting EIPL is structured through Mauritius and then Caymen Islands Another key question to consider is that when we mtm the transaction in the US there will be a tax accruing in the year of mtm say However in India as a result of the accrual accounting there will not be any income showing till the year or We will need to know how that would get treated and whether there is a way to get credit for the tax payable in the US I am also confused about whether US tax would be levied since none of the income is being brought back into the US remains overseas subpartF and other concerns Finally we have been working hard in structuring a fixed price contract and getting a fixed for floating swap in the US this is still not allowed to Indian Corporates I need you to think about this too and see if some type of accounting will solve this issue Krishna knows what I am talking about and will brief you on the same Krishna Please walk Bob through the three structures we had worked here Look forward to your help and comments This is going to be an exciting project for us all Regards Sandeep

Louis Holland Barbara Marcin and Brian Rogers LOUIS RUKEYSER Good evening Im Louis Rukeyser This is Wall Street Week Welcome back Well folks now you know why they call it black tie Much of the world of investors regards as a year of mourning for profits past for bubbles burst for bulls dehorned and for certainties crumbled And lets face it It wasnt always fun As Winston Churchill put it Im always ready to learn although I do not always like to be taught Virtually nobody except the nonstop pessimists who are still stone losers over the past decade foresaw the viciousness of this years declines although the year was contradictory even there For example is this a bear market Well yes and no Even from their highest heights in early the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the SP have declined far less than the twenty percent that traditionally has defined a bear market But for the formerly highflying technology stocks personified by the Nasdaq this has not only been a bear but the growly of all time Nasdaq which never does things moderately fell nearly percent this year and is off more than percent from its March th high That makes this not only the worst year ever for the yearold Nasdaq but the biggest decline for any of the three major indexes since the SP lost percent in during the Great Depression So devastating was this latest and most severe tech wreck that any attempt to put it in perspective by pointing out say that Nasdaq has been the bullish phenomenon of the past decade and that it gained more than percent in alone is likely to seem like irrelevant ancient history to todays bleeding tech investors Are they right Is this just a temporary reversal of a fantastically promising uptrend or is it truly the end of a booming era Were the downward catalysts of a fierce Federal Reserve a steeply weakening economy and a nation driven to embarrassing selfdoubt by the Election That Would Not Die passing phenomena or auguries of enduring change Well try to get you some meaningful answers tonight in the company of four sharpshooting panelists whose recommendations actually made our viewers significant money in while the markets and most of their competitors faltered Well review what really did happen in to the economy and to investors and well see if those four can be at least as helpful to us in the year ahead in which not to put too fine a point on it Wall Street owes us all a lot But first lets see how the bestperforming got better and the worsthit got hysterical in a characteristically mixed ending to a thoroughly mixedup year The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended on a stronger note despite a finalday selloff gaining more than points to close the year at making this the Dows first losing year since Most indexes followed the Dows upward lead with the conspicuous exception of you guessed it Nasdaq which ended the year at less than half its March peak But the elves filled with the holiday spirit or something continue to insist that better times lie ahead both for the Dow where our haloes go as usual to those who voted neutral three months ago since when the Dow is up by just a bit more than one percent and for Nasdaq which we now insist they also predict to see if that can improve their worst overall yearly record since they were created There were minimal changes in the bond and oil markets and the dollar had a mixed week as the longsuffering euro continued its recent rebound And if your investments this year are giving you palpitations try munching some of those holiday sweets youve been trying to put out of your mind A new report in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition says that chocolate may protect against heart disease The theory is that procyanidin found in the candy helps prevent buildup of blood platelets Brian Rogers whats it going to take to build up investor psychology in Wall Street ROGERS Well Lou I think what weve seen is a very natural transition this year away from some of the higherflying sectors of And I think investors as we enter the new year will be focused on earnings progression what the Fed does with rates and I think an awful lot will be determined at least in the first part of the year on what happens to mutual fund cash flows RUKEYSER When will we know that A week or two from now or will it take longer ROGERS I think well see a lot of indications in January I think the Fed will meet several weeks into the new year I think well see trends in mutual fund cash flow data evident by the end of January And then we also have the January effect I suppose we can look forward to to see how the first month of the year shakes out RUKEYSER So basically if things dont look a heck of a lot better by midJanuary thats going to be a bad sign ROGERS You can take the rest of the year off at that point RUKEYSER Thanks for your encouragement Barbara Marcin what do you think Whats it going to take to pep up the investors MARCIN Well I think that we have much more reasonable expectations of profit and growth priced into the market here And I really think that what happened this year was it was really a narrow group of stocks that really led the market down It was the same technology and telecommunication stocks which boomed so much last year And last year you could have a reasonable return which would look very mediocre if you werent invested in those stocks and this year if you have a reasonable return it looks very good because the telecom and technology stocks declined so much So I think its really just been a matter of resetting expectations and I think we can still have a good market here with a broad number of stocks attractively priced RUKEYSER So it was a good thing that those jazzedup fly boys came down to earth huh MARCIN Well I think it sets us up for a better year in the stock market certainly yes RUKEYSER Lou Holland Brian mentioned the Fed How important is the Fed in all this HOLLAND Well I think the Fed made a big mistake I mean they raised interest rates you know times in months You know basically the economy inflation was not an issue at the time that they were raising it And now of course they took money out of the system because they put a lot in at the end of for YK issues and now theyve taken it out So really I think theyve dropped the ball here and I think that theyre going to have to cut rates here over the next month or so RUKEYSER How much impact will that have Wall Street expects them to do that doesnt it HOLLAND Well I think it does Wall Street expects that But I think again to see it is to believe it and I think to the extent that Greenspan has sort of been a follower he has not been a leader So I suspect that any positive action here will be received relatively positively RUKEYSER You mean the markets have led him HOLLAND Thats exactly right RUKEYSER And theyre now leading him to a rate cut HOLLAND Exactly RUKEYSER I see Well I hope Mr Greenspan understands that Beth Dater what do you think DATER Well thats an interesting point because I think typically the stock market is driven by the economy Whats sort of interesting about the last yearandahalf is that to some extent the economy has been driven by the stock market and the wealth effect And so I think whats going to be really important to watch here is the consumer and whether the consumer can adjust to a year in the stock market where you may have gains that are more like eight percent than or or high doubledigit gains RUKEYSER The consumer didnt seem to be too sanguine this Christmas DATER No the consumer seems to be retrenching definitely somewhat here And I think the question will be back to Brians point what will happen when the consumers see their fourth quarter results in some of the mutual fund business Its something to watch very closely I think RUKEYSER There was a fall off in the rate of net input into mutual funds last month which is not surprising What do you think Why should people turn around and put a lot of money into mutual funds now DATER Well I think theres I think that consumers also have to adjust to the fact that you know the same stocks arent going to carry everything that there are areas of diversification such as fixed income and value and other styles of investing where one can still receive good returns over time RUKEYSER All right Now before we look ahead with our winners of the year lets review where weve been in a year most investors would love to forget The Dow Jones Industrial Average was the years first victim falling nearly points after peaking in midJanuary at a record but then gained most of it back ending with a loss of just over six percent The SP peaked later in March but recovered less losing a bit more than ten percent for the year But the true carnage was restricted to the Nasdaq which was butchered by more than percent In contrast both the New York and American Stock Exchange composite indexes which track all the common stocks traded there eked out small gains for the year while the smallstock Russell was down by just percent Even a bad year for stocks and a hint of inflation couldnt revive the fortunes of the investment worlds longest sufferers the gold bugs whose favorite metal continued to tarnish And silver did even worse The strong man of the year was the US dollar which easily outperformed all other major currencies with a particularly dazzling gain of percent against the yen Meanwhile the US economy continued as it has now for nearly ten years what has become a record expansion but new doubts about its durability arose as growth slowed in the third quarter to just percent and the fourth quarter seemed even weaker There was a slight whiff of inflation midway through the year helped along by a stunning rise in oil prices and a period of excess money creation by Fed officials who last year took the YK threat too seriously By November there was some relief consumer prices for the past months had increased percent ahead of the pace a year ago but off the summer highs Continuing to defy oldfashioned economic textbooks unemployment remained low even as inflation blipped and the economy chugged forward US unemployment reached a threedecade low at percent and as of the last monthly report in November was still holding at just four percent Even the everedgy bond market stopped trembling about inflation and with the prospect of a softer economy the ghouls rejoiced The yield on the year Treasury bond was driven down to percent more than a full point lower than where it was a year ago But shortterm rates which are moreeasily controlled by the Federal Reserve climbed nearly as much as long rates fell The average yield on taxable moneymarket funds is now up to six percent The years big international economic story was oil From below a barrel just two years ago oil climbed over this past September before retreating to todays a little more than a dollar higher than a year ago For the fourth year in a row the US trade deficit is setting a record in and next April will mark a full quartercentury since the US last saw even a monthly trade surplus And where do we go from here The Conference Boards index of socalled leading economic indicators has been anemic throughout with outright negative readings in four of the past five months Brian Rogers which of these numbers if any is the one to watch in the markets ROGERS Lou I think the most important thing will be what happens to corporate earnings in the first half Things have been sluggish in the second half of this year and I think as we enter the new year corporate profitability will be the most important thing affecting how investors view markets RUKEYSER And whats your guess on how that will turn out ROGERS I think well have a decent profit year but when I say decent Lou my best guess is in the five to seven percent range and not much more than that from a corporate profitability standpoint RUKEYSER Do you think the markets are expecting that ROGERS I think the markets are expecting a little bit more than that which makes me think we might continue to have some again some choppiness in the first part of RUKEYSER Barbara Marcin what are you going to keep your eye on MARCIN Im going to keep my eye on the consumer confidence levels You know we had three forces which slowed the economy this year the Federal Reserve raising interest rates high oil and gas prices and really a sharp drop off in consumer confidence as the stock market fell and that slowed spending a lot And I think that if that were to get much worse or consumers really stopped spending that could spiral a little bit more into companies incorporating that and having layoffs and really then we could get a recession So thats what Im keeping my eye on RUKEYSER Consumers have been the heroes and heroines of this whole expansion MARCIN Yes RUKEYSER There are some signs theyre flagging a little but you want to see how much MARCIN Yes RUKEYSER Whats your guess MARCIN I think that right now Im not predicting a recession so Im not predicting that theyre going to flag that much more We just had this week the third straight month of a fall off in consumer confidence And I think that perhaps come the new year we can regain it but that is what Im concerned about RUKEYSER Lou Holland how about you HOLLAND I agree with Barbara I think the consumer sentiment has deteriorated and I think that theres probably a greater than chance that were probably going to have a recession Its sort of the old notion of the Federal Reserve pushing on the string in order to get the economy going by reducing rates or injecting money into the system And Im not so sure that the system will swallow it quick enough to stop us from falling into recession RUKEYSER So you think the Fed has waited far too long HOLLAND I think so RUKEYSER Do you think theres a chance that theyll cut more than a quarter percent next month HOLLAND I think its possible that they could have an interim meeting to cut and I think its very possible they could cut a half a point RUKEYSER Beth can you cheer me up any more DATER Well I think it gets down to interest rates because I think that is what will ultimately influence the consumer confidence Im a little bit concerned about the dollar in here I mean I think that we have had a huge amount of foreign investment also into our capital markets here and if the dollar were to weaken substantially that might be at risk and we might see some repatriation of some of those foreign investments RUKEYSER All right Now comes the moment of truth when we turn the spotlight on what these folks said twelve months ago In what has been for decades the toughest competition in investing the lists cannot be changed for any reason during the ensuing twelve months it was a tough year even for our certified geniuses though the average of all our panelists continued to beat the performance of the SP let alone the sagging Nasdaq You can check all their records on our web site It will be up after midnight tonight As youll see the five who actually defied the odds and made you money in included the four stalwarts here tonight Brian Rogers to show what a weird year it was you were the secondclosest of all our panelists behind Marty Zweig in predicting the Dows high and close though even you were too optimistic by nearly and points respectively That was good this year But in the farmoreimportant actual moneymaking part of the competition you excelled with a portfolio of specific recommendations that according to calculations by our friends at Bloomberg Financial Markets was up a whopping percent aided by three timely short sales and a neardouble in Bergen Brunswig Congratulations ROGERS Thank you RUKEYSER Barbara Marcin with both you and Brian here its clearly the value players night out While your prediction that the Dow would get above turned out to be ridiculously high you came within points points of nailing the precise Dow low of And better still your portfolio is up more than percent in this generallygrim year thanks to the best single pick of any panelist Everest Reinsurance Holdings which rewarded you with a percent gain So thanks Barbara for bringing us so much value MARCIN Thank you RUKEYSER Lou Holland welcome back to your fourth yearend appearance the most of any panelist here tonight and you earned it While your high low and close were way off the mark a familiar song this year your portfolio was up more than percent powered by the morethandoubling of Washington Mutual Way to go Lou HOLLAND Thank you RUKEYSER Beth Dater this is your third yearend program And your cautious approach to investing in including putting percent of the portfolio in threeyear Treasury notes paid off with an average gain of more than percent In that looked awful good So congratulations Beth DATER Thank you Lou RUKEYSER But enough with the compliments however wellearned in a year like this past one Theres a new and we hope different year ahead and what have you done for us lately For starters in our annual triumph of hope over experience lets hear from each of you the true inside word on the highest close the lowest close and the final close for both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq in And this time gang lets all get it exactly right Brian ROGERS Lou for the Dow I have a high of a low of and a close of And for the Nasdaq a high of a low of and a close of RUKEYSER Barbara MARCIN For the Dow I have a high of a low of and a close of And for Nasdaq a high of a low of and a close of RUKEYSER Lou HOLLAND For the Dow I have a high of a low of and a close of For the Nasdaq I have a high of a low of and a close of RUKEYSER Beth DATER Lou for the Dow I have a high of a low of and a close of And for the Nasdaq a high of a low of and a close of RUKEYSER Okay Well one thing is for sure and this is my only personal unqualified guarantee of the night At least some of them will be wrong But if youd like to see the full predictions with specific stock selections from all of our panelists all those lists will be included in tonights transcript which you can get for by writing to YearEnd Transcripts Wall treet Week With Louis Rukeyser Owings Mills Maryland or you can order online for by visiting our web site at pbsorg And now lets see what these fabulous four think are the very best buys for Brian ROGERS Lou Aon Corp Cypress Semiconductor Disney Exodus Communications Fortune Brands Hasbro Morgan Stanley Emerging Markets Fund Motorola Octel Ryder System Sprint FON Group and Unisource Energy RUKEYSER Barbara MARCIN Im keeping the two from this years list that did not perform and thats Cendant and Mattel and Im adding Compaq WorldCom Lucent Loral Space Communications ATT Wireless and Motorola RUKEYSER A little tech in there hmm MARCIN Yes RUKEYSER Techs going to have a little comeback you think MARCIN Thats right Tech and telecom maybe RUKEYSER Some of those bleeding people will be very happy to hear that from a cautious person like yourself Lou HOLLAND Okay I have Carnival Corp CEC Entertainment Ceridian Corp Clorox Company Chase Manhattan Bank Cognos Inc Intel one of your favorites Louis Home Depot Jabil Circuit Microsoft and WorldCom RUKEYSER My favorites are the ones that go up The ones I hate are the ones that go down You know what Will Rogers said theres nothing hard about the stock market You buy a stock and when it goes up you sell it If they dont go up you dont buy Beth Dater your list DATER Lou weighting in year US Treasury notes The balance equally weighted in Amgen Berkshire Hathaway Cisco Systems Intel MedImmune Mellon Bank Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Royal Dutch Petroleum Schlumberger WalMart and Westwood One RUKEYSER Hearing as much financial services as I do is that an interest rate forecast as well DATER Its an interest rate forecast and also its a call on valuations which I think are still very interesting in that area RUKEYSER How about some of those fallen giants that youve picked That suggests to me that you dont think its the end of the world DATER I do not think its the end of the world And I do think its a time of some uncertainty and its a time to think of preservation of capital first and foremost and therefore Im going with some household names at this point RUKEYSER Especially some that have been knocked so far down that DATER Exactly The valuations are coming into reasonable levels RUKEYSER Brian Rogers lets hear from you on interest rates What do you think ROGERS Lou I think well see a normalization of the yield curve this year so I think well see short rates fall The Fed will cut rates probably a couple of times And I think the big gain this year was in the long bond in calendar year I think that game is probably mostly over would be my best guess RUKEYSER And shortterm rates you dont think are going to fall that much ROGERS No I think shortterm rates will fall causing the yield curve to look RUKEYSER But how much do you think theyll fall ROGERS I think theyll fall at least or basis points this year RUKEYSER Okay If we can get that over the next two weeks that might help some of your inflows into your mutual funds ROGERS Well well be happy then RUKEYSER Thank you all very much There we do have to stop I hope youll join me next week twice first for our regular program when my guest will be the incomparable Abby Joseph Cohen and then for a very special hourlong Louis Rukeysers Money Guide when my guests will include four worldclass industrial titans true

in the new Digital Age And imagine how good IT can be Visit Toshibacom for more details adstoshibaindexhtml The Real Wolf RECKONINGS By PAUL KRUGMAN ecently I received a letter from an economist I respect chiding me for my Naderite columns on the California energy crisis He just didnt believe that market manipulation by power companies could possibly be an important issue it sounded too much to him like the sort of thing one hears from kneejerk leftists who blame greedy capitalists for every problem be it thirdworld poverty or high apartment rents The left has cried Wolf so many times that sensible people have learned to discount such claims But now a bona fide wolf has arrived whose predatory behavior is doing terrible damage to our most populous state and nobody will believe it True California would be heading for a summer of power shortages even if it had never deregulated And even if there was workable competition in the wholesale electricity market prices in that market would spike during periods of peak demand transferring billions of dollars from either taxpayers or consumers to the generators But the evidence is now overwhelming that there isnt workable competition in Californias power market and that the actions of generators gaming the system have greatly magnified the crisis The key fact is that California has somehow remained in a state of more or less continuous power shortage and very high wholesale prices regardless of the level of demand A rash of outages has kept the electricity market conveniently and very profitably short of supply even during periods of low demand when there ought to be lots of excess capacity As Frank Wolak the Stanford economist who also advises the states power grid has pointed out an outage at a power plant is a lot like an employee calling in sick You cant tell directly whether he is really sick or has chosen to take the day off for other reasons but you can look for circumstantial evidence And such evidence has convinced Mr Wolak that generators use forced outages strategically to withhold capacity from the market a view shared by a growing number of other researchers Which brings us to the latest move by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission On Wednesday the commission apparently decided to offer California some relief and put new price caps in place on the California electricity market I say apparently because the more you look at the plan the less likely it seems to be any help at all Indeed the measure was passed on a to vote with William Massey the one commissioner who has been sympathetic to calls for price controls voting against it on the grounds that it would be ineffectual Whats wrong with FERCs plan First it caps prices only in emergency conditions ignoring the fact that electricity prices have stayed at hard toexplain levels even when there is no emergency In effect the plan is laid out as if the electricity market were really competitive in spite of all the evidence that it is not Second even those emergency price caps are full of loopholes offering extensive opportunities for what Mr Wolak calls megawatt laundering selling power to affiliated companies that for one reason or another are exempted from the price controls for example the controls do not apply to imports from neighboring states then selling it back into the California market Severin Borenstein of the University of California Energy Institute adds that because the allowed price depends on the cost of generation at the least efficient plant generators will have a clear incentive to produce inefficiently I predict we will find some plants we never heard of before that are suddenly operating again and they will be pretty inefficient The general verdict seems to be that this is not a serious plan There are serious proposals to mitigate the crisis out there indeed last fall Mr Wolak submitted a proposal that was well received by other experts but FERC has ignored all of them The charitable interpretation is that FERC still doesnt get it that it just cant bring itself to believe that this time the wolf is real The uncharitable interpretation is that last weeks action was meant to fail The Medley Report an online newsletter calls the FERC plan a grand exercise in posturing without substance a very clever temporary move by the Bush administration to deflect any political fallout from the looming disaster Whatever the explanation the plain fact is that FERC and the administration have yet to offer California any significant relief opinionKRUGhtmlexeienafbbabf Visit

in preaching that people are rational when makingtheir decisions be it an investment or a divorce Yet many economists and decisionmaking theory scientists do notsubscribe one hundred percent to this paradigm They claim that while most people i stylemsobidifontstylenormalstrive to be rational decisionmakers they are still subject tomany psychological limitations and traps that may distract them from theirgoal Some scientists claim that thesepsychological traps are a manifestation of millions of years of evolutionduring which the mankind had developed herd instincts in order to survive It is essential to notice that the influenceof these common biases increases when uncertainty is present in the decisionsituation In thisarticle we will list a number of common psychological biases that werediscussed in a recent book by three Harvard professors II The Biases TheAnchoring Trapin considering a decision the mind gives a disproportionatelylarge weight to the i stylemsobidifontstylenormal first informationit receivesanchoring effect Anchors can take many formsstatistical resultsbiased wording of the decision problem past events trend availability etc The Status Quo Trapmost decision makers display a strong biastoward alternatives that perpetuate the current situation TheSunkCost TrapPast decisions prey on our psyche TheConfirming Evidence TrapWe seek only information that supports our point ofview while avoiding information that contradicts it In a word one sees whatshe wants to see TheFraming TrapThe way you ask a question can profoundly influence the answer youget If you ask whether you can smokewhile praying the answer is likely to be emphatic No But if you ask whether you can pray whilesmoking you may get Yes TheOverconfidence TrapOn average people tend to set too narrow confidence levelsfor an uncertain event TheRecallability TrapOne focuses on barely probable but dramatic events TheBaseRate TrapOne tends to neglect relevant information by referring to somestereotype on average image Example Mr Jones is either librarian or a salesman He is also retiring Whatis he Most people would answerlibrarian although in the US salesmen outnumber male librarians by to The Prudence TrapYou assign larger than what is reasonableprobability to an uncertain event Basically you account for uncertainty by being overly prudent andplaying conservatively TheOutguessing Randomness TrapYou see patterns where purely random phenomenaexist TheGoingMysticalAboutCoincidences TrapIf someone wins twice in lottery this does not necessarily mean that there is not randomness III Improving Our Judgment The above are only someof a number of bad jokes our brain can play to us I believe that once we are aware that our mind is not perfectthe most sensible thing to do is to accept this Mind traps can be systematically studied quantified and used toconstantly improve our judgment Here I will throw some ideas of how this canbe done To begin with we maytry to quantify our susceptibility to each of the known traps Of course there is no objective way to dothis but in my view this doesnt mean that such an exercise is a futileone For example prior to making adecision we may try to assign ourselves a score from to on our perceptionof the influence of the anchoring trap on our decision We can do this with every otherpsychological trap Then we will wait and recordthe result from our decision Say ifthe result turned out to be as we had hoped to we would put and otherwise This exercise should be done for anumber of decision situations say trading decisions At some point of time we will be in asituation in which we will have quantitative information on our biases at thepoint of making a decision and the results on our decision There are mathematical techniques saylogistic regression neural networks etc that can help us combine the differentpieces of i stylemsobidifontstylenormala priori information into asingle index that is associated to the largest possible extent with thebeneficial final result We can alsoextract the probability of having a beneficial result given some set of initialperceptions At the very least we willbe able to put some weights on our predecision perceptions IV Conclusion The main idea of thisarticle is that ones brain is susceptible to a variety of psychologicalbiases This is a fact of life andshould be understood and studied Psychologists have already discovered a number of such biases If we subscribe under the statement thattrading is not only a mechanical manipulation of statistical data but alsojudgment insight and human psychology we may want to use and benefit fromsuch information The neverending questfor designing an objective score based on publicly available information thattells us how the market will behave in the future may be quite doomed Indeed the publicly available informationrepresents either historical data or the average public opinion about thefuture There should be some correctivefactor between public opinion and reality In my view this factor can be our judgment Judgment can be understood cuddled educated and developed A crucial moment in anyjudgment improving effort will be the seriousness and sincerity in quantifyingthe predecision perceptions This maybe controlled to a certain extent by creating a system of welldesigned questionnairesto the decision makers The Alchemy of Decisionwjkdoc The Alchemy of Decisionwjkdoc

from the harton website ThreadIndex AcFmenuIzmzMRqSfXAngbPwABxYnQ From Martin John D To David Martin Email Vince Kaminski Email XMailer Unknown No Version Original Message From Garven James R Sent Monday November AM To Martin John D Subject FYI Oh the Games Enron Played from the harton website Oh the Games Enron Played In the s Houstons Enron Corp was Wall Streets darling It had thrown out the energyindustry playbook remaking itself from a staid gas pipeline company to a hightech trading firm that created exotic securities for betting on everything from gas prices to the number of hot days in summer Share prices soared from to between and as sales increased from billion to more than billion Enron executives gained reputations as the energy industrys visionaries This fall it all came apart Share prices have fallen by this year including a plunge from just below to less than this fall In October Enron reported a thirdquarter loss of million The companys massive debt was downgraded to near junkbond status and the CEO and CFO were expelled Shareholders sued and the Securities and Exchange Commission launched an investigation Finally the humiliated company which employs more than agreed Nov to be taken over by smaller crosstown rival Dynegy Inc for about billion in stock and billion in assumed debt It is not certain the merger will take place since it is subject to regulatory approval and could be blocked on antitrust grounds And some news accounts suggest that major Dynegy shareholders could derail the merger over concerns about inheriting liabilities from current or future lawsuits by Enron shareholders The Enron story is not simply a case of a lone company that played with fire and got burned Enron was able to take enormous risks while keeping shareholders in the dark because it could exploit accounting loopholes for subsidiaries that are available to most publicly traded companies Companies like Enron can legally conceal massive debts because rules require a full accounting of a subsidiarys balance sheet only when the parent company owns more than half of it If Im a shareholder of Enron and I want full and fair disclosure I would want information about the entities Enron controls says Wharton accounting professor Robert E Verrecchia Yet Enron shareholders have never received such a report Enrons fate is crucial to the energy industry and other markets it serves points out Paul R Kleindorfer a professor of public policy and an expert on deregulation at Wharton Producers and users of gas oil electricity and other forms of energy rely on Enrons system for trading futures forwards options swaps and other contracts to get the best prices and control costs far into the future Without such a system deregulation simply cannot work If Enrons trading platform were to go down it would not be a minor loss Kleindorfer says It would be a huge loss for the industryIn the early s the company singlehandedly produced the backbone infrastructure that has led to a whole industry of broker intermediation To some extent Enron appears to have been a victim of sagging securities prices and volatile energy costs in and and it has lost hundreds of millions by laying fiberoptic cable for which there is no demand But although those factors may have determined the timing of the companys troubles they were not the chief cause Enron appears to have lost enormous amounts of shareholder money by gambling at its own roulette wheels In hindsight we made some very bad investments in noncore businesses that performed worse than we ever could have conceived Chairman Kenneth Lay told analysts last week How did Enron get into this mess Becoming a Market Maker When it was created in by the merger of Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth parent company of Northern Natural Gas Enrons chief business was the operation of thousands of miles of natural gas pipeline Lay became chairman in Feb Then early in the s the federal government took key steps to deregulate the energy industry Previously large regulated utilities were vertically integrated giving them control from wellhead to consumer Kleindorfer says Deregulation effectively broke apart the production longrange transmission and local distribution functions leaving each to a different set of players A factory owner for example can now buy gas or electricity from number of producers To function a free market such as this needs brokers or intermediaries to create buy and sell contracts for production and delivery and it requires a market maker to facilitate trading just as the big Wall Street firms and exchanges facilitate trading in stocks Enron created that marketplace This intermediation activity or brokerage activity just revolutionized the marketplace Kleindorfer says Since utilities and other energy users must line up dependable supplies for many months in the future they rely on various forms of contracts specifying quantities prices and delivery dates But before the commodity is delivered prevailing prices may go up or down and a supplier may find it has promised to sell at a price thats now too low while a purchaser may find that it could have bought for less than it had agreed to pay Suppliers and purchasers therefore use a variety of derivative contracts to benefit from prices that move in their favor and hedge in case prices move against them A company that has contracted to buy a shipload of liquefied natural gas at a specific price in three months could for a much smaller sum buy an options contract giving it the right but not the obligation to buy a shipload at a lower price And it could buy an option giving it the right to sell at a higher price Thus it is protected regardless of whether prices move up or down This was the business Enron invented By permitting competition and price discovery far into the future it brought to the marketplace the most efficient pricing and allowed energy users to predict and stabilize costs far into the future Kleindorfer says Having that information historically as well as projected into the future could revolutionize how you plan your business he said At the heart of Enrons business strategy was the belief that it could be a big energy player without owning all the power plants ships pipelines and other facilities involved Instead it could use contracts to control the facilities in which other companies had invested says Ehud Ronn director of the Center for Energy Finance Education and Research at the Red McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin The Center trains masters candidates in the use of energy securities Enron is one of the centers eight corporate sponsors Enron he says evolved into something akin to a Wall Street firm Enron thought of itself in very similar terms as an investment banker that wanted to tie up as little capital as possible By Enron had evolved into a market maker for some different products many of them energy or Internetrelated contracts or derivatives the company had created itself They included products allowing customers to buy sell hedge or speculate in markets ranging from traditional commodities like coal oil gas and electricity to cutting edge markets for Internet bandwidth pollution emissions semiconductors wind energy and many others Prices for many of these products were available on the companys free website giving the energy markets unprecedented price transparency Betting on the Weather To see how these products could be used consider one of Enrons weather risk management products meant for utilities energy distributors agricultural companies and financial institutions A gas utility for example might use a floor to protect its revenue in the event of a mild winter In exchange for a premium similar to that paid on an insurance policy Enron will compensate the utility for every day between November and March on which the temperature rises above a set level The payments would make up for reduced gas sales In another form of contract called a swap or collar Enron will pay the gas company a given amount if the number of warm days exceeds a set level But if the number of cold days exceeds a threshold the gas company will make a payment to Enron The utility would not have to pay a premium as it would with the floor and if it had to pay Enron the money would come from the extra revenue received by selling more gas in a colderthan normal winter To a layman this might look like betting We never use that word says Ronn The worst we say is to have a view In practice other parties are often involved in such transactions taking over the contractual obligation created by Enron So in addition to placing its own bets Enron serves as a middleman the way a stockbroker stands in the middle of a securities trade Like many middlemen Enron has to be in a position to make good on any transaction should either party default Otherwise it would be hard to make a market in these products In addition says Ronn Enron often has to pay out money before receiving payment from another party Finally Enron needed large amounts of capital to trade products in its own account just as a Wall Street firm invests in stocks on its own in addition to executing customers trades To accomplish all this Enron needed vast amounts of capital You do need to have liquidity in huge numbers Ronn says This created a dilemma A public company can raise capital by selling additional shares but current shareholders dont like that because the new shares dilute the value of their holdings The alternative is to borrow but large debts hurt a companys credit rating forcing it to pay higher interest rates on its loans Andrew S Fastow who became the companys senior vice president of finance in found innovative ways to issue new shares without dilution and to raise capital by selling oldfashioned assets like power plants and pipelines He has invented a groundbreaking strategy Ted A Izatt senior vice president at Lehman Brothers Inc told CFO Magazine in the fall of Or as Enron president and CEO Jeffrey K Skilling told the magazine We needed someone to rethink the entire financing structure at Enron from soup to nuts We didnt want someone stuck in the past since the industry of yesterday is no longer Andy has the intelligence and the youthful exuberance to think in new ways He deserves every accolade tossed his way Fastow named chief financial officer in March told the magazine We transformed finance into a merchant organizationEssentially we would buy and sell risk positions A key to the strategy Move many of Enrons transactions off the balance sheet In part this involved exploiting a loophole in the securities and accounting regulations As noted earlier debts accumulated by subsidiaries partnerships or other entities can be kept off the parent companys books so long as the parent does not own more than of the entity incurring the debt By using socalled unconsolidated subsidiaries you do not make transparent either the nature of the investment or the relationship between the parent and the subsidiary said Verrecchia Heavy hitters such as Wall Street analysts and major shareholders may have the clout to get a company to provide additional information on subsidiaries But if youre just an investor picking up Enrons annual report you are stuck Verrecchia added A Pattern of Sketchy Details It has long been clear from company statements and SEC filings that Enrons offbalancesheet transactions were enormous but details were sketchy because Enron did not have to report them and chose not to By this fall however it became obvious these transactions involved huge risks when Enron acknowledged it had improperly kept some activity off its books Putting those debts and losses into Enrons financial statements last month meant reducing shareholder equity by billion Corrected statements reduced net income by million for million for million for and million for At issue were socalled special purpose entities or SPEs set up for a variety of transactions for Enrons benefit Enron conceded some of these entities did not meet the accounting standards to be kept off of Enrons books In one case for instance the entity had inadequate capitalization for such treatment In Enron had created four entities known as Raptor I II III and IV to hedge market risk in certain of its investments according to an Enron filing with the SEC Enron acquired notes receivable from the Raptors in exchange for an obligation to issue Enron shares to the entities But Enron had improperly included the value of the notes receivable on its books without accounting for the cost of the shares it would have to issue In correcting this violation of accounting rules Enron said it had overstated its shareholders equity by billion in March and June Enron was particularly embarrassed in acknowledging that two special purpose entities limited partnerships LJM Cayman and LJM CoInvestment had Fastow as the managing partner Fastow who according to Enron made in excess of million in this role was forced out of the company in October An internal committee and the SEC are investigating the use of the partnerships Obviously Fastows role was a problem If the partnerships were truly independent entities he was in a conflict of interest If he was running them on Enrons behalf they were not independent Despite the writedowns and disclosures this fall many analysts complain they still do not have a full picture of Enrons activities Enron for instance has not fully described other partnerships it believes it can properly keep off the balance sheet Nor is it clear to what extent Enrons losses are due to bad bets it had made through highlyleveraged derivatives While a stock market investor can simply hang on to shares to wait out a downturn options and other derivatives typically have expiration dates If the bet has not turned out as hoped the entire investment can be lost New disclosure was modest and management did not resolve concerns Goldman Sachs analysts David Maccarrone and David Fleischer wrote in an Oct report to clients Though Enron had long faced such criticisms investors had tended to give the company the benefit of the doubt because of its strong growth in earnings and acknowledged industry leading capabilities the two analysts said In other words when stock was soaring investors didnt require details on how it was done Now they are crying foul and a number of shareholder suits have been filed Essentially they claim the company inflated its stock price by filing false financial statements Investors who bought shares at those high prices have suffered huge losses For years the Financial Accounting Standards Board which sets accounting rules has had a draft proposal for improving disclosure of subsidiaries activities and numbers Essentially it would move toward a more qualitative evaluation of whether the parent controlled the subsidiary even if it owned less than of the stock Control could be exerted by holding board seats or through contracts that effectively make the subsidiary a unit of the parent What the FASB has promulgated seems to me to be sensible Verrecchia said noting that the whole purpose of accounting is to give an accurate view of a companys inner workings and true earnings To conceal obligations risk and debt as Enron and others do undermines that goal he said But facing heavy opposition from accountants and corporations the FASB has not acted on the draft proposal citing insufficient support on its board So for the time being offbalancesheet transactions will continue to be a common practice among American corporations

vastly different strategies a ndhindsight being a strong argument can be made that Dynegys stra tegy is the winner at this juncture Throughout this article I will focus on two key areas in which Dynegy and Enron differ dramatically Those two key areas are the ownership of physical generation assets and the extent to which the companies have expanded and invested into noncore sectors Both companies started out as naturalgas companies and converged into the power market in the s However that is essentially where their simil arities end and over the last few years Enron and Dynegy havef ollowed dec idedly different paths In an attempt to make the complex rather rudimenta ry let me summarize the two paths this way Enron does not believe it nee ds to own physical assets to be a success in the power and naturalgast rad ing sector Dynegy on the other hand not only believes in the ownership o f physical assets but has set a goal that could ultimately establish the company as owning one of the largest generation arsenals in the industry Lets look at the companies separately Well discuss Enron first since it is the older of the two Enron readily admits that its strategy is diffic ult to define but a close approximation is that Enron literallyc reates co mmodity markets so that it can deliver physical commodities to customers The participation and success in commodity markets according toE nron doe s not necessitate ownership of physical assets In fact the company has r outinely sold physical assets that are not considered to be strategic to i ts wholesale business Rather Enron has concentrated on developing a newp hilosophy of risk management excellence in which it will merely buy and se ll the commodities it needs to participate in trading venues As an example Enron bought Portland General which owns MW of gener ation and kilometers of electric TD lines in as a way to lau nch its penetration of the West Coast power markets When competition fizz led in that region Enron put Portland General back on the sales block a sale of Portland General to Northwest Natural is pending at thisw riting Likewise in Europe where it is one of the most prominent tradingc ompanies Enron has disposed of generation assets such as Sutton Bridge inE ngland and unlike other US competitors has refrained from buying additional g enerating units in opening countries such as Germany and Italy According t o its most recent K report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commis sion Enron owns or controls MW of generating capacity including jo int ownerships which is drastically lower than the average among other c ompanies operating in the power trading sector Dynegys approach to the market is crystal clear andr adically different fr om Enrons In the words of CEO Chuck Watson Dynegys longterm strategy is to focus on marketing and trading around physical assets which suppor ts earnings sustainability Ever since going public in Dynegy has b een on an acquisition binge with each purchase significantly increasing i ts generation capability Dynegy presently owns or controls about MW of generating capacity in the United States gasprocessing plants and miles of pipelines which are located in geographically competitiv e areas The companys goal is to own or control MW or percent of the US market within the next five years Sometimes Dynegy has acqu ired assets throughp artnerships with other companies such as NRG Energy b ut just as often it has purchased assets independently Most notably when Dynegy acquired Illinova in early the purchase doubled Dynegys gen erating capacity Dynegy is now attempting to replicate this approach in E urope where it is presently planning to purchase naturalgas storage faci lities in England Dynegy executives have argued that naturalgas storage is the best way to back up a naturalgas trading operation Theres no que stion that the approach is working Out of the million that Dynegy re ported in the third quarter million of it came from the companys ma in wholesale business The issue of asset ownership is probably the centrald efining difference be tween Enron and Dynegy and its significance should not be overlooked It is not difficult to make a case that supports Dynegys approach Owning ph ysical assets often enables a trading company to gain information in the c ourse of operating power plants that can help the company to gauge markets and anticipate small changes in price In other words by controlling the actual output of generation instead of just being involved in buys and sel ls a trader such as Dynegy will theoretically know what the load is going to be in a particular region how much power can be produced to meet that load and when shortages might occur In addition in markets that are sho rt on infrastructure it may be difficult for a trader to participate in t he market unless theya ctually have ownership of physical assets in the reg ion By the same token those companies that do control physical assets of ten have greater communication with grid operators and possible insight t o spreads the difference between various energy prices In fact Dynegy s CEO Watson fully acknowledges that his company excels at being able to t rade around the volatility of price and being capable of resolving balanc es when shortages exist This may be more difficult for a company such as Enron to accomplish when it has no physical generation of its own to meet discrepancies in power bids Dynegys strategy of acquiring both naturalg as pipelines and power plants also gives it the flexibility to trade on bo th commodities On the other side of this argument a case could be made that Enrons appr oach provides more flexibility in reacting to trading volatility Certainl y by investing less in power generation facilities Enron has less capita l on the line when compared to a company like Dynegy Under a scenario whe n market prices suddenly drop a company such as Enron that does not have heavy capital invested in power generation could actually fare better than an assetladen company because Enron does not face the pressure to meet th ef ixed payments of a generation facility Assetheavy companies also may f ind that their earnings could be impacted by the investment in generation facilities in times of extreme price volatility As the industry becomes i ncreasinglyf ocused on bottomline results this could be seen as a potenti al concern for investors Further some would argue that Enrons approach of establishingp urchasing contracts with various parties to meet its buy a nd sell requirements is the rough equivalent of owning a generation facili ty What Enron gains by this approach is the presumed flexibility it has b y not being tied down to a specific generation unit and being able to buil d its own portfolio Consequently the issue of asset ownership can perhaps be considered the great debate among power traders However although Dynegys overall perf ormance in the third quarter was better than Enrons that does not necess arily provide a clear endorsement of Dynegys strategy toward acquiring ne w generation facilities Keep in mind that Enrons Q losses resulted prim arily from nonrecurring charges related to its noncore businesses broad band and water in particular Without these charges Enrons core wholesa le trading business continues to perform well This is a point that CEO Ke n Lay has been quick to reiterate to investors Our percent increase in recurring earnings per diluted share shows the very strong results of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our naturalgas pipelines Lay said The continued excellent prospects in these businesses and En rons leadingm arket position make us very confident in our strong earnings outlook Moreover perhaps even more than ownership of physical assets the key iss ue that played a role in the current disparity between Dynegy and Enron ea rnings in the third quarter is the companies approach to developing new l ines of business Telecom is a perfect example to illustrate the point En ron which prides itself as usually gaining a firststrike advantage plung ed into the telecom sector well ahead of other energy companies Under the leadership of thenCEO Jeffrey Skilling Enron sunk large sums of capital into purchasing broadband capacity on the expectation that the market wou ld quickly become lucrative Now Lay admits that the company could have g otten into the broadband business with less capital and that Enron spent too much too soon in this sector Nevertheless Enron recorded an mi llion nonrecurringw ritedown for restructuring its broadband unit in the third quarter and isp resently attempting to stop the bleeding in this sect or by reducing futurec osts in this sector to million a quarter Dynegy took a much more cautious approach toward expanding into the teleco m sector and made a comparatively small amount of investment when compared to Enron Dynegy has likewise been impacted by the slowdown of thet elecom sector but in the third quarter took a million loss in its broadband business compared to the million loss that Enron reported However D ynegy clearly specializes in marketing and trading two commodities electr icity and natural gas and seems to add other businesses in a verym ethodic al way that merely supplements its core business It is also important to note that Enron gained the firststrike advantage when it developed EnronOnline an electronic tradinge xchange In fact Enr on was the first to create such an exchange in the energy space well ahea d of its competitors Dynegy later followed this trend withc reating Dynegy direct The two exchanges are different in terms of their trading standard s but it is important to acknowledge that in this particular case Enron w as successful in launching into the electronic trading space well ahead of its competitors The latest available information indicates thatE nronOnli ne has recorded transactions that exceed in notional value Since its inception in November Dynegydirect has recorded billion in noti onal transactions At this juncture Dynegy and Enron are very different with regard to their approaches toward financial reporting Enron which has often been accuse d of not providing a balance sheet to investors is currently struggling f rom a serious image problem as the Securities and Exchange Commission purs ues an investigation of possible mishandling of funds by Enrons CFO To m y recollection no one has ever accused Dynegy of not providing ab alance s heet and thus the companys status with investors is arguably more solid As I dont expect either company to radically alter its competitives trate gy any time soon my projection is that at least in the near term we wi ll continue to see a wide disparity in Wall Street performance between Dyne gy and Enron That is not to say that anyone should count Enron out of the game As noted the companys core business of wholesale business remains strong but clearly has been tainted by the impact of other noncore busi nesses Thatd oesnt mean Enron is down permanently but it will have to fi nd a way to strike a better balance between the businesses that it does be st and those businesses that former CEO Jeffrey Skilling believed were adv antageous In many ways the comparison between Dynegy and Enron is rather like the t ortoise and the hare parable I am sure you can guess which company is the tortoise and which is the hare in this analogy The race between the two is far from over although Dynegy is taking the lead at this pointb ased o n its more methodical approach What will be fascinating to observe is how both companies continue to adapt to changes in the marketplace and possibl y modify

home mortgage and you have points from the earlier loan that you hadnt finished deducting you may write off the rest of those points in the year you refinance Also if you refinance and you used some of the money from the refinance for home improvements you can deduct a portion of those points this year For more information on the rules for deducting points see Points Deduction Rules at a

Standard Poors said innovatively structured collateralised debt obligations CDOs will spur the growth of structured finance products in The agency predicts a market worth more than billion this year SP has reacted to the expected growth of such alternative investments by developing criteria for rating debt secured by the market value of hedge funds And expects that rating these CDOs will

first stage in its effort to create an online OTC electricity derivatives market in North America via a soft launch in Alberta Traders will be able to hedge electricity prices using electricity swaps and options including base peak and offpeak terms from dayahead through the forward curve to calendar years via the new system The broker has already combined voice and electronic brokerage trading in Europe becoming the leading broker for German electricity Should the Alberta project prove successful it is likely that GFI will rollout the hybrid model across North America starting in the eastern

not cause the bankruptcy and the bankruptcy does not pose a risk to the markets the logical conclusion is that there is no argument for additional derivatives regulation It is unclear how additional

by advertisement Share the spirit with a gift from Starbucks Our coffee brewers espresso machines at special holiday prices shopsubcategoryaspcategorynameSaleClearancecicookietest Why It Takes Psychology to Make People Save January By LOUIS UCHITELLE When it comes to saving for retirement Americans are not rational They know they do not put away enough surveys show But ask them to save more in their k plans and they balk A buck in hand is irresistibly spent Try a different approach Ask them to commit now to increasing their savings in the future make the increase coincide with the next raise and they cheerfully sign up Various quirks embedded in human nature come into play Saving more in the future seems much less of a sacrifice When the future arrives opting out succumbs to inertia And timing the increase to coincide with a raise so that one cancels out the other is much more palatable than a cut in takehome pay In the human psyche giving up a raise not yet in hand is easier for people to accept emotionally than a loss even the illusion of a loss After all the money lost is still there in ones savings account Standard economics allows for none of these quirks Over a lifetime people rationally save an optimal amount mainstream economics holds Confronted with the reality that people do not save enough the mainstream has no solution except to reiterate that people are rational so whatever they save must be enough No wonder behavioral economics is making such a splash becoming the in specialty of young economists from the best graduate schools You have to force savings and take the money away before people have it and cant resist spending it said Richard H Thaler a University of Chicago economist Mr Thaler is a pioneer in the development of behavioral economics over the last years and now he is a leader in finally applying the insights to daily life So far the application focuses on persuading people to save more in k plans But there are other potential uses Fiscal policy is one Allowing for human quirks what is the most effective way to spend public money to promote jobs and economic growth If we invested six months in designing a stimulus package using insights from behavioral economics there is good reason to think it might work Mr Thaler said That is still off in the future Medicine offers an immediate application Some dentists for example are beginning to ask behavioral economists how to get patients to return every six months for teeth cleaning Reminder postcards dont often work People put them in a drawer and procrastinate another human quirk that messes up mainstream theory with its faith in rationally taking good care of teeth Most people delay unless the dentist extracts a commitment by persuading a patient when he or she comes in for a cleaning to make an appointment on the spot for the next cleaning six months hence The postcard system only facilitates procrastination said David I Laibson a behavioral economist at Harvard who gets calls from dentists THE most promising application so far is retirement savings At a time when workers must save for their own retirement they are in danger of inadequate income in old age unless they contribute percent of their pay to k plans pension experts say And that does not count losses in k money invested in hightechnology stocks or in the Enron Corporation newsquote Such hearty contributions are certainly in the interest of the Vanguard Group which administers k plans for companies like Philips Electronics newsquote North America a unit of Royal Philips Electronics Philips also has a stake under federal law top executives cannot have retirement savings too out of line with those of ordinary employees So Vanguard and Philips turned to Mr Thaler and to Shlomo Benartzi at the University of California at Los Angeles Executives had read a paper they wrote entitled Save More Tomorrow reporting on the results at a Midwestern company where employees more than half the staff had agreed in advance to annual increases in their k contributions each increase coinciding with a raise Over three years the contributions rose to percent of income from percent Most of the Philips employees enrolled in k plans save percent or less So Philips is experimenting With Vanguard administering the test and Mr Thaler and Mr Benartzi giving advice the company will ask workers next month to commit to annual increases in k contributions of one two or three percentage points The first increase would be in April when Philips gives annual raises although this year in a recession a raise is not a sure thing says Lisa Pyne Philipss benefits director Still she is counting on inertia to keep people from opting out even the percenters who absent a raise might notice the slight decline in takehome pay Behavioral economics seems to work Ms Pyne said businessyourmoneyVIEWhtmlexeiencebadd HOW TO ADVERTISE For information on advertising in email newsletters or other

on three othe rs Herb Greenberg Mon Jan EST If you learn nothing else from the Enron mess take this lesson to heart A companys inability to handle its debt can be its downfallno matter ho w much Wall Street likes its stock Indeed while earnings may be a window to a companys psyche the balance sheet is what gives you a truer pictur e of its wellbeing Bond analysts make a beeline to this crucial piece of financial disclosure paying special attention to a companys ability to service its debt And when the ratio of cash to debt plungeswatch out The best balancesheet snoops are often way ahead of the pack in finding s igns of trouble Sometimes however the big creditrating firms Standard Poors and Moodys which get paid by the companies they rate are slow off the markslower as a rule than independent bondrating services li ke EganJones of Wynnewood Pa or research firms like New Yorkbased Gim me Credit We dont have the constraint of trying to keep a company happy says EganJones President Sean Egan whose downgrade of Enron to junk b eat the big guys by about a month To be fair Moodys is revising how it assesses companies taking into account additional information that could lead to a default Standard Poors for its part argues that its exist ing methods are adequate Given the scopeand the surpriseof the Enron failure its worth asking Are there other companies out there that these aggressive independent cr editrating agencies are flagging now You can bet on it Were not necess arily talking future Enrons but simply companies whose financial situatio n is more dire than the market thinks Certainly one where the alarm bells are ringing loudly and whichdont remind megot a positive nod from t his column a year ago is Ford Motor Its no secret that Ford is having s erious problems but you wouldnt know it from its credit rating which is still investment grade EganJones however labels it BBB a few notche s lower than the other rating agencies do and just one step above junk Th ats where EganJones thinks Ford will arrive within six months as the sa les boost from the much heralded financing starts to wane and bad auto loans pile up Junk status raises the cost of borrowing and would be parti cularly damaging for Ford whose ability to cover its debt has been deteri orating rapidly Egan and other bond analysts measure this by calculating a companys interest coverage ratiopretax income plus interest expense divided by interest expense The ratio which varies widely by industry is key to credit analysis Ega n calculates that Fords interest coverage has tumbled from in Septemb er to just above now Thats akin to saying that nearly everything you earn will have to be used to pay your interest expense which doesnt leave a lot of money to invest in the business he says Ford responds t hat its disappointed by the EganJones rating both Sand Moodys insis t they havent been laggards and that their ratings are appropriate EganJones is even warier of computer maker HewlettPackard Its credit pi cture is as imperiled as its proposed Compaq merger according to EganJon eswhich has already tossed the tech giants debt on the junk heap with a rating of BB several notches below that of the major rating agencies Its appropriate to view HewlettPackard on a standalone basis which is not particularly attractive Egan says Today it is hard to name any bus iness where its the undisputed leadereven its printer business is being attacked Making matters worse From October HewlettPackards int erest coverage has sunk steadily from to just By contrast IBMs ratio according to EganJones is HewlettPackard officials couldn t be reached for comment Finally theres retailer Gap another company this column once argued you should never bet against because of its miracleworking marketing genius of a CEO Mickey Drexler While Gimme Credits Carol Levenson says Gaps balancesheet condition is not yet critical its not nearly as strong a s it used to be EganJones points out that Gaps interest coverage ratio has plunged from down to over the past four quarters As a resul t the firm rates the retailers debt one step above junk and a couple of notches below that of both Standard Poors and Moodys ratings Gap offi cials say they have never worked with EganJones and point to the retail ers standing with the major rating agencies instead The problem is as E nron

Louis Holland Barbara Marcin and Brian Rogers LOUIS RUKEYSER Good evening Im Louis Rukeyser This is Wall Street Week Welcome back Well folks now you know why they call it black tie Much of the world of investors regards as a year of mourning for profits past for bubbles burst for bulls dehorned and for certainties crumbled And lets face it It wasnt always fun As Winston Churchill put it Im always ready to learn although I do not always like to be taught Virtually nobody except the nonstop pessimists who are still stone losers over the past decade foresaw the viciousness of this years declines although the year was contradictory even there For example is this a bear market Well yes and no Even from their highest heights in early the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the SP have declined far less than the twenty percent that traditionally has defined a bear market But for the formerly highflying technology stocks personified by the Nasdaq this has not only been a bear but the growly of all time Nasdaq which never does things moderately fell nearly percent this year and is off more than percent from its March th high That makes this not only the worst year ever for the yearold Nasdaq but the biggest decline for any of the three major indexes since the SP lost percent in during the Great Depression So devastating was this latest and most severe tech wreck that any attempt to put it in perspective by pointing out say that Nasdaq has been the bullish phenomenon of the past decade and that it gained more than percent in alone is likely to seem like irrelevant ancient history to todays bleeding tech investors Are they right Is this just a temporary reversal of a fantastically promising uptrend or is it truly the end of a booming era Were the downward catalysts of a fierce Federal Reserve a steeply weakening economy and a nation driven to embarrassing selfdoubt by the Election That Would Not Die passing phenomena or auguries of enduring change Well try to get you some meaningful answers tonight in the company of four sharpshooting panelists whose recommendations actually made our viewers significant money in while the markets and most of their competitors faltered Well review what really did happen in to the economy and to investors and well see if those four can be at least as helpful to us in the year ahead in which not to put too fine a point on it Wall Street owes us all a lot But first lets see how the bestperforming got better and the worsthit got hysterical in a characteristically mixed ending to a thoroughly mixedup year The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended on a stronger note despite a finalday selloff gaining more than points to close the year at making this the Dows first losing year since Most indexes followed the Dows upward lead with the conspicuous exception of you guessed it Nasdaq which ended the year at less than half its March peak But the elves filled with the holiday spirit or something continue to insist that better times lie ahead both for the Dow where our haloes go as usual to those who voted neutral three months ago since when the Dow is up by just a bit more than one percent and for Nasdaq which we now insist they also predict to see if that can improve their worst overall yearly record since they were created There were minimal changes in the bond and oil markets and the dollar had a mixed week as the longsuffering euro continued its recent rebound And if your investments this year are giving you palpitations try munching some of those holiday sweets youve been trying to put out of your mind A new report in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition says that chocolate may protect against heart disease The theory is that procyanidin found in the candy helps prevent buildup of blood platelets Brian Rogers whats it going to take to build up investor psychology in Wall Street ROGERS Well Lou I think what weve seen is a very natural transition this year away from some of the higherflying sectors of And I think investors as we enter the new year will be focused on earnings progression what the Fed does with rates and I think an awful lot will be determined at least in the first part of the year on what happens to mutual fund cash flows RUKEYSER When will we know that A week or two from now or will it take longer ROGERS I think well see a lot of indications in January I think the Fed will meet several weeks into the new year I think well see trends in mutual fund cash flow data evident by the end of January And then we also have the January effect I suppose we can look forward to to see how the first month of the year shakes out RUKEYSER So basically if things dont look a heck of a lot better by midJanuary thats going to be a bad sign ROGERS You can take the rest of the year off at that point RUKEYSER Thanks for your encouragement Barbara Marcin what do you think Whats it going to take to pep up the investors MARCIN Well I think that we have much more reasonable expectations of profit and growth priced into the market here And I really think that what happened this year was it was really a narrow group of stocks that really led the market down It was the same technology and telecommunication stocks which boomed so much last year And last year you could have a reasonable return which would look very mediocre if you werent invested in those stocks and this year if you have a reasonable return it looks very good because the telecom and technology stocks declined so much So I think its really just been a matter of resetting expectations and I think we can still have a good market here with a broad number of stocks attractively priced RUKEYSER So it was a good thing that those jazzedup fly boys came down to earth huh MARCIN Well I think it sets us up for a better year in the stock market certainly yes RUKEYSER Lou Holland Brian mentioned the Fed How important is the Fed in all this HOLLAND Well I think the Fed made a big mistake I mean they raised interest rates you know times in months You know basically the economy inflation was not an issue at the time that they were raising it And now of course they took money out of the system because they put a lot in at the end of for YK issues and now theyve taken it out So really I think theyve dropped the ball here and I think that theyre going to have to cut rates here over the next month or so RUKEYSER How much impact will that have Wall Street expects them to do that doesnt it HOLLAND Well I think it does Wall Street expects that But I think again to see it is to believe it and I think to the extent that Greenspan has sort of been a follower he has not been a leader So I suspect that any positive action here will be received relatively positively RUKEYSER You mean the markets have led him HOLLAND Thats exactly right RUKEYSER And theyre now leading him to a rate cut HOLLAND Exactly RUKEYSER I see Well I hope Mr Greenspan understands that Beth Dater what do you think DATER Well thats an interesting point because I think typically the stock market is driven by the economy Whats sort of interesting about the last yearandahalf is that to some extent the economy has been driven by the stock market and the wealth effect And so I think whats going to be really important to watch here is the consumer and whether the consumer can adjust to a year in the stock market where you may have gains that are more like eight percent than or or high doubledigit gains RUKEYSER The consumer didnt seem to be too sanguine this Christmas DATER No the consumer seems to be retrenching definitely somewhat here And I think the question will be back to Brians point what will happen when the consumers see their fourth quarter results in some of the mutual fund business Its something to watch very closely I think RUKEYSER There was a fall off in the rate of net input into mutual funds last month which is not surprising What do you think Why should people turn around and put a lot of money into mutual funds now DATER Well I think theres I think that consumers also have to adjust to the fact that you know the same stocks arent going to carry everything that there are areas of diversification such as fixed income and value and other styles of investing where one can still receive good returns over time RUKEYSER All right Now before we look ahead with our winners of the year lets review where weve been in a year most investors would love to forget The Dow Jones Industrial Average was the years first victim falling nearly points after peaking in midJanuary at a record but then gained most of it back ending with a loss of just over six percent The SP peaked later in March but recovered less losing a bit more than ten percent for the year But the true carnage was restricted to the Nasdaq which was butchered by more than percent In contrast both the New York and American Stock Exchange composite indexes which track all the common stocks traded there eked out small gains for the year while the smallstock Russell was down by just percent Even a bad year for stocks and a hint of inflation couldnt revive the fortunes of the investment worlds longest sufferers the gold bugs whose favorite metal continued to tarnish And silver did even worse The strong man of the year was the US dollar which easily outperformed all other major currencies with a particularly dazzling gain of percent against the yen Meanwhile the US economy continued as it has now for nearly ten years what has become a record expansion but new doubts about its durability arose as growth slowed in the third quarter to just percent and the fourth quarter seemed even weaker There was a slight whiff of inflation midway through the year helped along by a stunning rise in oil prices and a period of excess money creation by Fed officials who last year took the YK threat too seriously By November there was some relief consumer prices for the past months had increased percent ahead of the pace a year ago but off the summer highs Continuing to defy oldfashioned economic textbooks unemployment remained low even as inflation blipped and the economy chugged forward US unemployment reached a threedecade low at percent and as of the last monthly report in November was still holding at just four percent Even the everedgy bond market stopped trembling about inflation and with the prospect of a softer economy the ghouls rejoiced The yield on the year Treasury bond was driven down to percent more than a full point lower than where it was a year ago But shortterm rates which are moreeasily controlled by the Federal Reserve climbed nearly as much as long rates fell The average yield on taxable moneymarket funds is now up to six percent The years big international economic story was oil From below a barrel just two years ago oil climbed over this past September before retreating to todays a little more than a dollar higher than a year ago For the fourth year in a row the US trade deficit is setting a record in and next April will mark a full quartercentury since the US last saw even a monthly trade surplus And where do we go from here The Conference Boards index of socalled leading economic indicators has been anemic throughout with outright negative readings in four of the past five months Brian Rogers which of these numbers if any is the one to watch in the markets ROGERS Lou I think the most important thing will be what happens to corporate earnings in the first half Things have been sluggish in the second half of this year and I think as we enter the new year corporate profitability will be the most important thing affecting how investors view markets RUKEYSER And whats your guess on how that will turn out ROGERS I think well have a decent profit year but when I say decent Lou my best guess is in the five to seven percent range and not much more than that from a corporate profitability standpoint RUKEYSER Do you think the markets are expecting that ROGERS I think the markets are expecting a little bit more than that which makes me think we might continue to have some again some choppiness in the first part of RUKEYSER Barbara Marcin what are you going to keep your eye on MARCIN Im going to keep my eye on the consumer confidence levels You know we had three forces which slowed the economy this year the Federal Reserve raising interest rates high oil and gas prices and really a sharp drop off in consumer confidence as the stock market fell and that slowed spending a lot And I think that if that were to get much worse or consumers really stopped spending that could spiral a little bit more into companies incorporating that and having layoffs and really then we could get a recession So thats what Im keeping my eye on RUKEYSER Consumers have been the heroes and heroines of this whole expansion MARCIN Yes RUKEYSER There are some signs theyre flagging a little but you want to see how much MARCIN Yes RUKEYSER Whats your guess MARCIN I think that right now Im not predicting a recession so Im not predicting that theyre going to flag that much more We just had this week the third straight month of a fall off in consumer confidence And I think that perhaps come the new year we can regain it but that is what Im concerned about RUKEYSER Lou Holland how about you HOLLAND I agree with Barbara I think the consumer sentiment has deteriorated and I think that theres probably a greater than chance that were probably going to have a recession Its sort of the old notion of the Federal Reserve pushing on the string in order to get the economy going by reducing rates or injecting money into the system And Im not so sure that the system will swallow it quick enough to stop us from falling into recession RUKEYSER So you think the Fed has waited far too long HOLLAND I think so RUKEYSER Do you think theres a chance that theyll cut more than a quarter percent next month HOLLAND I think its possible that they could have an interim meeting to cut and I think its very possible they could cut a half a point RUKEYSER Beth can you cheer me up any more DATER Well I think it gets down to interest rates because I think that is what will ultimately influence the consumer confidence Im a little bit concerned about the dollar in here I mean I think that we have had a huge amount of foreign investment also into our capital markets here and if the dollar were to weaken substantially that might be at risk and we might see some repatriation of some of those foreign investments RUKEYSER All right Now comes the moment of truth when we turn the spotlight on what these folks said twelve months ago In what has been for decades the toughest competition in investing the lists cannot be changed for any reason during the ensuing twelve months it was a tough year even for our certified geniuses though the average of all our panelists continued to beat the performance of the SP let alone the sagging Nasdaq You can check all their records on our web site It will be up after midnight tonight As youll see the five who actually defied the odds and made you money in included the four stalwarts here tonight Brian Rogers to show what a weird year it was you were the secondclosest of all our panelists behind Marty Zweig in predicting the Dows high and close though even you were too optimistic by nearly and points respectively That was good this year But in the farmoreimportant actual moneymaking part of the competition you excelled with a portfolio of specific recommendations that according to calculations by our friends at Bloomberg Financial Markets was up a whopping percent aided by three timely short sales and a neardouble in Bergen Brunswig Congratulations ROGERS Thank you RUKEYSER Barbara Marcin with both you and Brian here its clearly the value players night out While your prediction that the Dow would get above turned out to be ridiculously high you came within points points of nailing the precise Dow low of And better still your portfolio is up more than percent in this generallygrim year thanks to the best single pick of any panelist Everest Reinsurance Holdings which rewarded you with a percent gain So thanks Barbara for bringing us so much value MARCIN Thank you RUKEYSER Lou Holland welcome back to your fourth yearend appearance the most of any panelist here tonight and you earned it While your high low and close were way off the mark a familiar song this year your portfolio was up more than percent powered by the morethandoubling of Washington Mutual Way to go Lou HOLLAND Thank you RUKEYSER Beth Dater this is your third yearend program And your cautious approach to investing in including putting percent of the portfolio in threeyear Treasury notes paid off with an average gain of more than percent In that looked awful good So congratulations Beth DATER Thank you Lou RUKEYSER But enough with the compliments however wellearned in a year like this past one Theres a new and we hope different year ahead and what have you done for us lately For starters in our annual triumph of hope over experience lets hear from each of you the true inside word on the highest close the lowest close and the final close for both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq in And this time gang lets all get it exactly right Brian ROGERS Lou for the Dow I have a high of a low of and a close of And for the Nasdaq a high of a low of and a close of RUKEYSER Barbara MARCIN For the Dow I have a high of a low of and a close of And for Nasdaq a high of a low of and a close of RUKEYSER Lou HOLLAND For the Dow I have a high of a low of and a close of For the Nasdaq I have a high of a low of and a close of RUKEYSER Beth DATER Lou for the Dow I have a high of a low of and a close of And for the Nasdaq a high of a low of and a close of RUKEYSER Okay Well one thing is for sure and this is my only personal unqualified guarantee of the night At least some of them will be wrong But if youd like

your favorites Louis Home Depot Jabil Circuit Microsoft and WorldCom RUKEYSER My favorites are the ones that go up The ones I hate are the ones that go down You know what Will Rogers said theres

equally weighted in Amgen Berkshire Hathaway Cisco Systems Intel MedImmune Mellon Bank Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Royal Dutch Petroleum Schlumberger WalMart and Westwood One RUKEYSER Hearing as much financial services as I do is that an interest rate forecast as well DATER Its an interest rate forecast and also its a call on valuations which I think are still very interesting in that area RUKEYSER How about some of those fallen giants that youve picked That suggests to me that you dont think its the end of the world DATER I do not think its the end of the world And I do think its a time of some uncertainty and its a time to think of preservation of capital first and foremost and therefore Im going with some household names at this point RUKEYSER Especially some that have been knocked so far down that DATER Exactly The valuations are coming into reasonable levels RUKEYSER Brian Rogers lets hear from you on interest rates What do you think ROGERS Lou I think well see a normalization of the yield curve this year so I think well see short rates fall The Fed will cut rates probably a couple of times And I think the big gain this year was in the long bond in calendar year I think that game is probably mostly over would be my best guess RUKEYSER And shortterm rates you dont think are going to fall that much ROGERS No I think shortterm rates will fall causing the yield curve to look RUKEYSER But how much do you think theyll fall ROGERS I think theyll fall at least or basis points this year RUKEYSER Okay If we can get that over the next two weeks that might help some of your inflows into your mutual funds ROGERS Well well be happy then RUKEYSER Thank you all very much There we do have to stop I hope youll join me next week twice first for our regular

this afternoon NumeriX provides versatile solutions for the pricing and risk management of complex derivative instruments Of particular interest to Enron may be the use of NumeriX Tools for supporting energy derivatives The energy solution provided is a versatile ExcelCC environment for structuring and pricing complex derivatives in the electricity marketplace The model is based on a microeconomic determination of one or multiple electricity forward curves Power demands by utility companies are balanced with power generating plantsproduction to determine the marginal price of electricity for multiple geographic regions Interregional transmission constraints are imposed to calculate monthly forward prices for border stations Theenergy solution is based on Monte Carlo simulation The regional power demands and fossil fuel prices are modeled as random processes where model parameters are determined from historical data Marginal prices from different regions are used to determine border prices This procedure is iterated over many scenarios and subsequent averages are taken to determine the forward COB prices I Overview NumeriX is a leading provider ofmodular analytical

NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re MarktoMarket Document link Wade Cline Sandeep I met with Bob today and discussed the deal structure we put together On the marktomarket issue Bob and his colleague Wess told me that as long as payments are tied to one particular plant we cannot mtm them They had same problem with plants here in the US like the peaking plants and they had to separate the plant from power sales to be able to mtm the assocated cashflows What they did is they sold power from the plant to an outside party and bought it back from them at completely different multiple locations The buyback is not tied to any specific plant and is marked to maket Even if Enron can somehow marktomarket a deal with DPC it can do so for only of the cashflows because only of DPC is owned by outsiders And a simple loan to an affiliate cannot also be marked to market Bob was suggesting that if EIPL buys options from DPC and from some other plants and in turn sells power to AP or Karnataka then we could have a case for mtm Politically DPC selling power to EIPL may not be the best solution to put it rather mildly Our alternatives as I see them are Do the deal as we structured it The only difference is that Enron doesnt mark it to market and income is earned only in Do the deal as we structured it EIPLEnron then sells the contract to another party at a profit The problem of course is finding this party and forking part of the profit to them Same deal except revenue securitization is done through an outside party in India not EIPL Bob said he will think about the issues some more this week Let me know when you will be here next week so we can meet with Bob together I will be going to Boston for Tuesday andor Wednesday Feb I can book an appt with Bob for us Sandeep NRONDEVELOPMENT PM To Robert Butts Pinnamaneni CT cc Vince Kaminski Wade ClineENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Ananda Mukerji Jaiprakash DesaiENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject MarktoMarket Bob I wanted to continue the analysis on marktomarket that I had spoken to you about on the phone I thought that it was getting very difficult explaining the whole transaction by phone so I am having Krishnarao who is in Vinces group explain the transaction to you Krishna has been helping us structure the deal here in India and he has just returned to Houston from India after working with the team here He will seek an appointment with you to explain the transaction I would like you to please spend some time with him and then based on the discussion please send us a note detailing how sucha a transaction would be marked to market Please cosider the fact that currently there are no such transactions from the Indian side This is a very important transaction for us and we may need to repeat this in coming months hence setting up the system to account for these maybe well worth it Also what I am concerned about is that there will be an Enron India EIPL account in India based on Indian GAAP and upon consolidation there will be a US GAAP accounting in the US It is here that we would like to have marktomarket accounting EIPL is structured through Mauritius and then Caymen Islands Another key question to consider is that when we mtm the transaction in the US there will be a tax accruing in the year of mtm say However in India as a result of the accrual accounting there will not be any income showing till the year or We will need to know how that would get treated and whether there is a way to get credit for the tax payable in the US I am also confused about whether US tax would be levied since none of the income is being brought back into the US remains overseas subpartF and other concerns Finally we have been working hard in structuring a fixed price contract and getting a fixed for floating swap in the US this is still not allowed to Indian Corporates I need you to think about this too and see if some type of accounting will solve this issue Krishna knows what I am talking about and will brief you on the same Krishna Please walk Bob through the three structures we had worked here Look forward to your help and comments This is going to be an exciting project for us all Regards Sandeep

NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re MarktoMarket Document link Wade Cline Sandeep I met with Bob today and discussed the deal structure we put together On the marktomarket issue Bob and his colleague Wess told me that as long as payments are tied to one particular plant we cannot mtm them They had same problem with plants here in the US like the peaking plants and they had to separate the plant from power sales to be able to mtm the assocated cashflows What they did is they sold power from the plant to an outside party and bought it back from them at completely different multiple locations The buyback is not tied to any specific plant and is marked to maket Even if Enron can somehow marktomarket a deal with DPC it can do so for only of the cashflows because only of DPC is owned by outsiders And a simple loan to an affiliate cannot also be marked to market Bob was suggesting that if EIPL buys options from DPC and from some other plants and in turn sells power to AP or Karnataka then we could have a case for mtm Politically DPC selling power to EIPL may not be the best solution to put it rather mildly Our alternatives as I see them are Do the deal as we structured it The only difference is that Enron doesnt mark it to market and income is earned only in Do the deal as we structured it EIPLEnron then sells the contract to another party at a profit The problem of course is finding this party and forking part of the profit to them Same deal except revenue securitization is done through an outside party in India not EIPL Bob said he will think about the issues some more this week Let me know when you will be here next week so we can meet with Bob together I will be going to Boston for Tuesday andor Wednesday Feb I can book an appt with Bob for us Sandeep NRONDEVELOPMENT PM To Robert Butts Pinnamaneni CT cc Vince Kaminski Wade ClineENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Ananda Mukerji Jaiprakash DesaiENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject MarktoMarket Bob I wanted to continue the analysis on marktomarket that I had spoken to you about on the phone I thought that it was getting very difficult explaining the whole transaction by phone so I am having Krishnarao who is in Vinces group explain the transaction to you Krishna has been helping us structure the deal here in India and he has just returned to Houston from India after working with the team here He will seek an appointment with you to explain the transaction I would like you to please spend some time with him and then based on the discussion please send us a note detailing how sucha a transaction would be marked to market Please cosider the fact that currently there are no such transactions from the Indian side This is a very important transaction for us and we may need to repeat this in coming months hence setting up the system to account for these maybe well worth it Also what I am concerned about is that there will be an Enron India EIPL account in India based on Indian GAAP and upon consolidation there will be a US GAAP accounting in the US It is here that we would like to have marktomarket accounting EIPL is structured through Mauritius and then Caymen Islands Another key question to consider is that when we mtm the transaction in the US there will be a tax accruing in the year of mtm say However in India as a result of the accrual accounting there will not be any income showing till the year or We will need to know how that would get treated and whether there is a way to get credit for the tax payable in the US I am also confused about whether US tax would be levied since none of the income is being brought back into the US remains overseas subpartF and other concerns Finally we have been working hard in structuring a fixed price contract and getting a fixed for floating swap in the US this is

Cc XOriginalArrivalTime Oct UTC FILETIMEDFCEA XMailer Unknown No Version Martin Lance What do you think Vince Original Message From Frank A Wolak iaStanfordEDUENRON Sent Friday October PM To Kaminski Vince J Subject Vince Ive been hearing rumors that Enron has decided to endorse the nodal pricing model as implemented in PJM I just wanted to warn you that Im not sure this is in Enrons longterm interest at all Let me explain why Feel free to give me a call if youd like to talk more about this First let me say that I firmly believe in locational pricing and specifically pricing congestion However the way that PJM implements nodal pricing is to eliminate as much price volatility and reduce the transparency of the market Specifically the PJM tariff gives the ISO the ability to mitigate to cost plus a adder the bids of any market participant that the ISO deems is out of merit in one of the three zones in region The fact that a nodal market is talking about zones should give you cause for alarm Then the ISO takes this mitigated bid and reruns its pricesetting software to compute new nodal prices The way I have somewhat unfairly decribed this pricesetting process is that the PJM ISO decides what prices it would like for a given day and mitigates bids until it gets them This is not a transparent market nor one where it makes any sense to buy the risk management services that Enron provides The only price volatility you have to worry about in the PJM market is that kind that comes about if they need imports into their control area to meet demand Under these circumstances you need to pay the imports whatever is necessary to get them to come to your market However bear in mind FERCs desire to make a large RTO on the East Coast This will effectively mean little imports to the East Coast RTO so all bids can be mitigated at the discretion of the ISO Paying marketclearing prices to costofservice mitigated bids is just paying too much to eliminate price volatility It effectively kills off the development of risk management at the wholesale and retail level Power marketing becomes much less profitable because retailers know you can always buy at costmitigated prices In short the PJM model is not market It is just an alternative form of regulation that is politically attractive because it reduces price volatility but it is not good for consumers or traders because they just get a higher cost form of regulation than traditional costofservice regulation You pay marketclearing prices to costofservice mitigated bids but under regulation you could just pay costofservice prices and eliminate the inframarginal profits to low cost generators As we discussed during our dinner I think the two biggest sources of benefits from restructuring will come from getting the demandside involved in the market and from more efficient risk management A necessary condition for both of these to occur is prices that reflect actual conditions in the market including the extent of market power exercised Masking these signals dulls any incentive for market participants to make the investment necessary to management The PJM model is just way to have a market in name without achieving any significant benefits to consumers or energy traders Frank This email is the property of Enron Corp andor its relevant affiliate and may contain confidential and privileged

conference Aspen World in October in Washington DC on this topic as well as the broader topic of Risk assessment and management in the energy markets I know this seems a little strange making a coldcall in this manner but I am reaching out in the community of Risk and Uncertainty management in the Supply Chain Process and Energy markets to identify and solicit compelling speakers AspenTech does not have a traditionally strong or well developed business or application layer in this realm but as our enterprisewide reach and activities in planning forecasting and supply chain have grown and integrated I and the technology drivers in the company have been cultivating a demand and recognition for risk management and pricing activities to BE the next logical dimension to our growth and technology Therefore the session I am chairing see the abstract below will be one intended to educate entice and compel our clientele business partners and staff on the business value technology and mathematical and modeling technique I would be happy to elaborate on the intended audience and opportunity for the conference Please contact me at your earliest convenience by email or phone at the numbers below to discuss things if you think it would be a possibility or if you would like more information on the context of the work and subject matter in AspenTechs core businesses Thanks in advance for your time Sincerely Skip Paules Uncertainty and Risk Management in Supply Chain and Process Modeling This session will examine the assessment and quantification of uncertainties and risk in the supply chain and process modeling arena The emphasis is on the modeling and enterprise business process aspects Topics should include point solution methods such as design and realtime optimization application at the process level planning and scheduling applications as well as enterprise level solution strategies that balance forecasting supply chain planning scheduling and operations Commodities trading models strategies and techniques are also included in this scope What developments in the applications and theory of the field will allow us to take collections of deterministic modeling tools to the next strategic level where objectives for capital projects operations and supply chain optimization models incorporate not only economics but also valueatrisk andor robustness elements to create more broadly applicable or hedged strategies to achieve the desired goals Possible presentation topics will include Uncertain supply demand in planning and scheduling Robust plantwide optimization realtime Robust control Valueatrisk VAR quantification in modeling applications Dynamic hedging in commodities trading eg energy markets Flexible design and synthesis

from the harton website ThreadIndex AcFmenuIzmzMRqSfXAngbPwABxYnQ From Martin John D To David Martin Email Vince Kaminski Email XMailer Unknown No Version Original Message From Garven James R Sent Monday November AM To Martin John D Subject FYI Oh the Games Enron Played from the harton website Oh the Games Enron Played In the s Houstons Enron Corp was Wall Streets darling It had thrown out the energyindustry playbook remaking itself from a staid gas pipeline company to a hightech trading firm that created exotic securities for betting on everything from gas prices to the number of hot days in summer Share prices soared from to between and as sales increased from billion to more than billion Enron executives gained reputations as the energy industrys visionaries This fall it all came apart Share prices have fallen by this year including a plunge from just below to less than this fall In October Enron reported a thirdquarter loss of million The companys massive debt was downgraded to near junkbond status and the CEO and CFO were expelled Shareholders sued and the Securities and Exchange Commission launched an investigation Finally the humiliated company which employs more than agreed Nov to be taken over by smaller crosstown rival Dynegy Inc for about billion in stock and billion in assumed debt It is not certain the merger will take place since it is subject to regulatory approval and could be blocked on antitrust grounds And some news accounts suggest that major Dynegy shareholders could derail the merger over concerns about inheriting liabilities from current or future lawsuits by Enron shareholders The Enron story is not simply a case of a lone company that played with fire and got burned Enron was able to take enormous risks while keeping shareholders in the dark because it could exploit accounting loopholes for subsidiaries that are available to most publicly traded companies Companies like Enron can legally conceal massive debts because rules require a full accounting of a subsidiarys balance sheet only when the parent company owns more than half of it If Im a shareholder of Enron and I want full and fair disclosure I would want information about the entities Enron controls says Wharton accounting professor Robert E Verrecchia Yet Enron shareholders have never received such a report Enrons fate is crucial to the energy industry and other markets it serves points out Paul R Kleindorfer a professor of public policy and an expert on deregulation at Wharton Producers and users of gas oil electricity and other forms of energy rely on Enrons system for trading futures forwards options swaps and other contracts to get the best prices and control costs far into the future Without such a system deregulation simply cannot work If Enrons trading platform were to go down it would not be a minor loss Kleindorfer says It would be a huge loss for the industryIn the early s the company singlehandedly produced the backbone infrastructure that has led to a whole industry of broker intermediation To some extent Enron appears to have been a victim of sagging securities prices and volatile energy costs in and and it has lost hundreds of millions by laying fiberoptic cable for which there is no demand But although those factors may have determined the timing of the companys troubles they were not the chief cause Enron appears to have lost enormous amounts of shareholder money by gambling at its own roulette wheels In hindsight we made some very bad investments in noncore businesses that performed worse than we ever could have conceived Chairman Kenneth Lay told analysts last week How did Enron get into this mess Becoming a Market Maker When it was created in by the merger of Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth parent company of Northern Natural Gas Enrons chief business was the operation of thousands of miles of natural gas pipeline Lay became chairman in Feb Then early in the s the federal government took key steps to deregulate the energy industry Previously large regulated utilities were vertically integrated giving them control from wellhead to consumer Kleindorfer says Deregulation effectively broke apart the production longrange transmission and local distribution functions leaving each to a different set of players A factory owner for example can now buy gas or electricity from number of producers To function a free market such as this needs brokers or intermediaries to create buy and sell contracts for production and delivery and it requires a market maker to facilitate trading just as the big Wall Street firms and exchanges facilitate trading in stocks Enron created that marketplace This intermediation activity or brokerage activity just revolutionized the marketplace Kleindorfer says Since utilities and other energy users must line up dependable supplies for many months in the future they rely on various forms of contracts specifying quantities prices and delivery dates But before the commodity is delivered prevailing prices may go up or down and a supplier may find it has promised to sell at a price thats now too low while a purchaser may find that it could have bought for less than it had agreed to pay Suppliers and purchasers therefore use a variety of derivative contracts to benefit from prices that move in their favor and hedge in case prices move against them A company that has contracted to buy a shipload of liquefied natural gas at a specific price in three months could for a much smaller sum buy an options contract giving it the right but not the obligation to buy a shipload at a lower price And it could buy an option giving it the right to sell at a higher price Thus it is protected regardless of whether prices move up or down This was the business Enron invented By permitting competition and price discovery far into the future it brought to the marketplace the most efficient pricing and allowed energy users to predict and stabilize costs far into the future Kleindorfer says Having that information historically as well as projected into the future could revolutionize how you plan your business he said At the heart of Enrons business strategy was the belief that it could be a big energy player without owning all the power plants ships pipelines and other facilities involved Instead it could use contracts to control the facilities in which other companies had invested says Ehud Ronn director of the Center for Energy Finance Education and Research at the Red McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin The Center trains masters candidates in the use of energy securities Enron is one of the centers eight corporate sponsors Enron he says evolved into something akin to a Wall Street firm Enron thought of itself in very similar terms as an investment banker that wanted to tie up as little capital as possible By Enron had evolved into a market maker for some different products many of them energy or Internetrelated contracts or derivatives the company had created itself They included products allowing customers to buy sell hedge or speculate in markets ranging from traditional commodities like coal oil gas and electricity to cutting edge markets for Internet bandwidth pollution emissions semiconductors wind energy and many others Prices for many of these products were available on the companys free website giving the energy markets unprecedented price transparency Betting on the Weather To see how these products could be used consider one of Enrons weather risk management products meant for utilities energy distributors agricultural companies and financial institutions A gas utility for example might use a floor to protect its revenue in the event of a mild winter In exchange for a premium similar to that paid on an insurance policy Enron will compensate the utility for every day between November and March on which the temperature rises above a set level The payments would make up for reduced gas sales In another form of contract called a swap or collar Enron will pay the gas company a given amount if the number of warm days exceeds a set level But if the number of cold days exceeds a threshold the gas company will make a payment to Enron The utility would not have to pay a premium as it would with the floor and if it had to pay Enron the money would come from the extra revenue received by selling more gas in a colderthan normal winter To a layman this might look like betting We never use that word says Ronn The worst we say is to have a view In practice other parties are often involved in such transactions taking over the contractual obligation created by Enron So in addition to placing its own bets Enron serves as a middleman the way a stockbroker stands in the middle of a securities trade Like many middlemen Enron has to be in a position to make good on any transaction should either party default Otherwise it would be hard to make a market in these products In addition says Ronn Enron often has to pay out money before receiving payment from another party Finally Enron needed large amounts of capital to trade products in its own account just as a Wall Street firm invests in stocks on its own in addition to executing customers trades To accomplish all this Enron needed vast amounts of capital You do need to have liquidity in huge numbers Ronn says This created a dilemma A public company can raise capital by selling additional shares but current shareholders dont like that because the new shares dilute the value of their holdings The alternative is to borrow but large debts hurt a companys credit rating forcing it to pay higher interest rates on its loans Andrew S Fastow who became the companys senior vice president of finance in found innovative ways to issue new shares without dilution and to raise capital by selling oldfashioned assets like power plants and pipelines He has invented a groundbreaking strategy Ted A Izatt senior vice president at Lehman Brothers Inc told CFO Magazine in the fall of Or as Enron president and CEO Jeffrey K Skilling told the magazine We needed someone to rethink the entire financing structure at Enron from soup to nuts We didnt want someone stuck in the past since the industry of yesterday is no longer Andy has the intelligence and the youthful exuberance to think in new ways He deserves every accolade tossed his way Fastow named chief financial officer in March told the magazine We transformed finance into a merchant organizationEssentially we would buy and sell risk positions A key to the strategy Move many of Enrons transactions off the balance sheet In part this involved exploiting a loophole in the securities and accounting regulations As noted earlier debts accumulated by subsidiaries partnerships or other entities can be kept off the parent companys books so long as the parent does not own more than of the entity incurring the debt By using socalled unconsolidated subsidiaries you do not make transparent either the nature of the investment or the relationship between the parent and the subsidiary said Verrecchia Heavy hitters such as Wall Street analysts and major shareholders may have the clout to get a company to provide additional information on subsidiaries But if youre just an investor picking up Enrons annual report you are stuck Verrecchia added A Pattern of Sketchy Details It has long been clear from company statements and SEC filings that Enrons offbalancesheet transactions were enormous but details were sketchy because Enron did not have to report them and chose not to By this fall however it became obvious these transactions involved huge risks when Enron acknowledged it had improperly kept some activity off its books Putting those debts and losses into Enrons financial statements last month meant reducing shareholder equity by billion Corrected statements reduced net income by million for million for million for and million for At issue were socalled special purpose entities or SPEs set up for a variety of transactions for Enrons benefit Enron conceded some of these entities did not meet the accounting standards to be kept off of Enrons books In one case for instance the entity had inadequate capitalization for such treatment In Enron had created four entities known as Raptor I II III and IV to hedge market risk in certain of its investments according to an Enron filing with the SEC Enron acquired notes receivable from the Raptors in exchange for an obligation to issue Enron shares to the entities But Enron had improperly included the value of the notes receivable on its books without accounting for the cost of the shares it would have to issue In correcting this violation of accounting rules Enron said it had overstated its shareholders equity by billion in March and June Enron was particularly embarrassed in acknowledging that two special purpose entities limited partnerships LJM Cayman and LJM CoInvestment had Fastow as the managing partner Fastow who according to Enron made in excess of million in this role was forced out of the company in October An internal committee and the SEC are investigating the use of the partnerships Obviously Fastows role was a problem If the partnerships were truly independent entities he was in a conflict of interest If he was running them on Enrons behalf they were not independent Despite the writedowns and disclosures this fall many analysts complain they still do not have a full picture of Enrons activities Enron for instance has not fully described other partnerships it believes it can properly keep off the balance sheet Nor is it clear to what extent Enrons losses are due to bad bets it had made through highlyleveraged derivatives While a stock market investor can simply hang on to shares to wait out a downturn options and other derivatives typically have expiration dates If the bet has not turned out as hoped the entire investment can be lost New disclosure was modest and management did not resolve concerns Goldman Sachs analysts David Maccarrone and David Fleischer wrote in an Oct report to clients Though Enron had long faced such criticisms investors had tended to give the company the benefit of the doubt because of its strong growth in earnings and acknowledged industry leading capabilities the two analysts said In other words when stock was soaring investors didnt require details on how it was done Now they are crying foul and a number of shareholder suits have been filed Essentially they claim the company inflated its stock price by filing false financial statements Investors who bought shares at those high prices have suffered huge losses For years the Financial Accounting Standards Board which sets accounting rules has had a draft proposal for improving disclosure of subsidiaries activities and numbers Essentially it would move toward a more qualitative evaluation of whether the parent controlled the subsidiary even if it owned less than of the stock Control could be exerted by holding board seats or through contracts that effectively make the subsidiary a unit of the parent What the FASB has promulgated seems to me to be sensible Verrecchia said noting that the whole purpose of accounting is to give an accurate view of

have less lecture but more guest speakers and student presentations Energy Consulting Financial Services trading risk management Origination Marketing and Sales Oil Gas Electricity Project Development strategic planning Structuring of Products Supply Chain Venture Capital within energy industry GeoPolitical considerations You are on the right track getting companies involved Typical groupings would be Utilities eg Reliant Gas Pipeline Trading eg Enron El Paso Energy Oil Products retail arm of Shell Exxon etc Exploration Production Shell Exxon Apache etc Chemicals majors like Shell Exxon but also

Baker Cc Syed Farhan Iqbal Son Vu John Montgomery Craig A Parks Anthony Beebe Chris Jensen Arthur Jiantao Yan Subject Rice Energy Club Roundtable topics Dear John dear Vincent Let me update you on the roundtables we decided in the last meeting to focus on during the rest of the academic year The original idea was to keep the number of events from to roundtables each semester The result of the last meeting with all members was driven by enthusiasm and as you see below we produced a prolific list of subjects Maybe you can help us to narrow down to a reasonable number events one we had yesterday by May we think are too many I also would take this opportunity to update on the ongoing relationships with the most prominent industry in the sectors and have your feedback suggestion on how to group them in the roundtable We got great support so far from Reliant Enron Mirant Schell Coral Bp Duke El Paso ChevronTexaco Phillips and Halliburton etc also are interested and we will present the club to them as well The major challenge for us is not transform the Energy Club in a Finance Energy Club At Rice we already have a Finance club and it works very well We want first educate about the energy industry in general and second present the opportunities for MBAs in the industry in different areas including finance but not limited to Topics of Roundtable Meetings Energy Corporate Finance

Louis Holland Barbara Marcin and Brian Rogers LOUIS RUKEYSER Good evening Im Louis Rukeyser This is Wall Street Week Welcome back Well folks now you know why they call it black tie Much of the world of investors regards as a year of mourning for profits past for bubbles burst for bulls dehorned and for certainties crumbled And lets face it It wasnt always fun As Winston Churchill put it Im always ready to learn although I do not always like to be taught Virtually nobody except the nonstop pessimists who are still stone losers over the past decade foresaw the viciousness of this years declines although the year was contradictory even there For example is this a bear market Well yes and no Even from their highest heights in early the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the SP have declined far less than the twenty percent that traditionally has defined a bear market But for the formerly highflying technology stocks personified by the Nasdaq this has not only been a bear but the growly of all time Nasdaq which never does things moderately fell nearly percent this year and is off more than percent from its March th high That makes this not only the worst year ever for the yearold Nasdaq but the biggest decline for any of the three major indexes since the SP lost percent in during the Great Depression So devastating was this latest and most severe tech wreck that any attempt to put it in perspective by pointing out say that Nasdaq has been the bullish phenomenon of the past decade and that it gained more than percent in alone is likely to seem like irrelevant ancient history to todays bleeding tech investors Are they right Is this just a temporary reversal of a fantastically promising uptrend or is it truly the end of a booming era Were the downward catalysts of a fierce Federal Reserve a steeply weakening economy and a nation driven to embarrassing selfdoubt by the Election That Would Not Die passing phenomena or auguries of enduring change Well try to get you some meaningful answers tonight in the company of four sharpshooting panelists whose recommendations actually made our viewers significant money in while the markets and most of their competitors faltered Well review what really did happen in to the economy and to investors and well see if those four can be at least as helpful to us in the year ahead in which not to put too fine a point on it Wall Street owes us all a lot But first lets see how the bestperforming got better and the worsthit got hysterical in a characteristically mixed ending to a thoroughly mixedup year The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended on a stronger note despite a finalday selloff gaining more than points to close the year at making this the Dows first losing year since Most indexes followed the Dows upward lead with the conspicuous exception of you guessed it Nasdaq which ended the year at less than half its March peak But the elves filled with the holiday spirit or something continue to insist that better times lie ahead both for the Dow where our haloes go as usual to those who voted neutral three months ago since when the Dow is up by just a bit more than one percent and for Nasdaq which we now insist they also predict to see if that can improve their worst overall yearly record since they were created There were minimal changes in the bond and oil markets and the dollar had a mixed week as the longsuffering euro continued its recent rebound And if your investments this year are giving you palpitations try munching some of those holiday sweets youve been trying to put out of your mind A new report in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition says that chocolate may protect against heart disease The theory is that procyanidin found in the candy helps prevent buildup of blood platelets Brian Rogers whats it going to take to build up investor psychology in Wall Street ROGERS Well Lou I think what weve seen is a very natural transition this year away from some of the higherflying sectors of And I think investors as we enter the new year will be focused on earnings progression what the Fed does with rates and I think an awful lot will be determined at least in the first part of the year on what happens to mutual fund cash flows RUKEYSER When will we know that A week or two from now or will it take longer ROGERS I think well see a lot of indications in January I think the Fed will meet several weeks into the new year I think well see trends in mutual fund cash flow data evident by the end of January And then we also have the January effect I suppose we can look forward to to see how the first month of the year shakes out RUKEYSER So basically if things dont look a heck of a lot better by midJanuary thats going to be a bad sign ROGERS You can take the rest of the year off at that point RUKEYSER Thanks for your encouragement Barbara Marcin what do you think Whats it going to take to pep up the investors MARCIN Well I think that we have much more reasonable expectations of profit and growth priced into the market here And I really think that what happened this year was it was really a narrow group of stocks that really led the market down It was the same technology and telecommunication stocks which boomed so much last year And last year you could have a reasonable return which would look very mediocre if you werent invested in those stocks and this year if you have a reasonable return it looks very good because the telecom and technology stocks declined so much So I think its really just been a matter of resetting expectations and I think we can still have a good market here with a broad number of stocks attractively priced RUKEYSER So it was a good thing that those jazzedup fly boys came down to earth huh MARCIN Well I think it sets us up for a better year in the stock market certainly yes RUKEYSER Lou Holland Brian mentioned the Fed How important is the Fed in all this HOLLAND Well I think the Fed made a big mistake I mean they raised interest rates you know times in months You know basically the economy inflation was not an issue at the time that they were raising it And now of course they took money out of the system because they put a lot in at the end of for YK issues and now theyve taken it out So really I think theyve dropped the ball here and I think that theyre going to have to cut rates here over the next month or so RUKEYSER How much impact will that have Wall Street expects them to do that doesnt it HOLLAND Well I think it does Wall Street expects that But I think again to see it is to believe it and I think to the extent that Greenspan has sort of been a follower he has not been a leader So I suspect that any positive action here will be received relatively positively RUKEYSER You mean the markets have led him HOLLAND Thats exactly right RUKEYSER And theyre now leading him to a rate cut HOLLAND Exactly RUKEYSER I see Well I hope Mr Greenspan understands that Beth Dater what do you think DATER Well thats an interesting point because I think typically the stock market is driven by the economy Whats sort of interesting about the last yearandahalf is that to some extent the economy has been driven by the stock market and the wealth effect And so I think whats going to be really important to watch here is the consumer and whether the consumer can adjust to a year in the stock market where you may have gains that are more like eight percent than or or high doubledigit gains RUKEYSER The consumer didnt seem to be too sanguine this Christmas DATER No the consumer seems to be retrenching definitely somewhat here And I think the question will be back to Brians point what will happen when the consumers see their fourth quarter results in some of the mutual fund business Its something to watch very closely I think RUKEYSER There was a fall off in the rate of net input into mutual funds last month which is not surprising What do you think Why should people turn around and put a lot of money into mutual funds now DATER Well I think theres I think that consumers also have to adjust to the fact that you know the same stocks arent going to carry everything that there are areas of diversification such as fixed income and value and other styles of investing where one can still receive good returns over time RUKEYSER All right Now before we look ahead with our winners of the year lets review where weve been in a year most investors would love to forget The Dow Jones Industrial Average was the years first victim falling nearly points after peaking in midJanuary at a record but then gained most of it back ending with a loss of just over six percent The SP peaked later in March but recovered less losing a bit more than ten percent for the year But the true carnage was restricted to the Nasdaq which was butchered by more than percent In contrast both the New York and American Stock Exchange composite indexes which track all the common stocks traded there eked out small gains for the year while the smallstock Russell was down by just percent Even a bad year for stocks and a hint of inflation couldnt revive the fortunes of the investment worlds longest sufferers the gold bugs whose favorite metal continued to tarnish And silver did even worse The strong man of the year was the US dollar which easily outperformed all other major currencies with a particularly dazzling gain of percent against the yen Meanwhile the US economy continued as it has now for nearly ten years what has become a record expansion but new doubts about its durability arose as growth slowed in the third quarter to just percent and the fourth quarter seemed even weaker There was a slight whiff of inflation midway through the year helped along by a stunning rise in oil prices and a period of excess money creation by Fed officials who last year took the YK threat too seriously By November there was some relief consumer prices for the past months had increased percent ahead of the pace a year ago but off the summer highs Continuing to defy oldfashioned economic textbooks unemployment remained low even as inflation blipped and the economy chugged forward US unemployment reached a threedecade low at percent and as of the last monthly report in November was still holding at just four percent Even the everedgy bond market stopped trembling about inflation and with the prospect of a softer economy the ghouls rejoiced The yield on the year Treasury bond was driven down to percent more than a full point lower than where it was a year ago But shortterm rates which are moreeasily controlled by the Federal Reserve climbed nearly as much as long rates fell The average yield on taxable moneymarket funds is now up to six percent The years big international economic story was oil From below a barrel just two years ago oil climbed over this past September before retreating to todays a little more than a dollar higher than a year ago For the fourth year in a row the US trade deficit is setting a record in and next April will mark a full quartercentury since the US last saw even a monthly trade surplus And where do we go from here The Conference Boards index of socalled leading economic indicators has been anemic throughout with outright negative readings in four of the past five months Brian Rogers which of these numbers if any is the one to watch in the markets ROGERS Lou I think the most important thing will be what happens to corporate earnings in the first half Things have been sluggish in the second half of this year and I think as we enter the new year corporate profitability will be the most important thing affecting how investors view markets RUKEYSER And whats your guess on how that will turn out ROGERS I think well have a decent profit year but when I say decent Lou my best guess is in the five to seven percent range and not much more than that from a corporate profitability standpoint RUKEYSER Do you think the markets are expecting that ROGERS I think the markets are expecting a little bit more than that which makes me think we might continue to have some again some choppiness in the first part of RUKEYSER Barbara Marcin what are you going to keep your eye on MARCIN Im going to keep my eye on the consumer confidence levels You know we had three forces which slowed the economy this year the Federal Reserve raising interest rates high oil and gas prices and really a sharp drop off in consumer confidence as the stock market fell and that slowed spending a lot And I think that if that were to get much worse or consumers really stopped spending that could spiral a little bit more into companies incorporating that and having layoffs and really then we could get a recession So thats what Im keeping my eye on RUKEYSER Consumers have been the heroes and heroines of this whole expansion MARCIN Yes RUKEYSER There are some signs theyre flagging a little but you want to see how much MARCIN Yes RUKEYSER Whats your guess MARCIN I think that right now Im not predicting a recession so Im not predicting that theyre going to flag that much more We just had this week the third straight month of a fall off in consumer confidence And I think that perhaps come the new year we can regain it but that is what Im concerned about RUKEYSER Lou Holland how about you HOLLAND I agree with Barbara I think the consumer sentiment has deteriorated and I think that theres probably a greater than chance that were probably going to have a recession Its sort of the old notion of the Federal Reserve pushing on the string in order to get the economy going by reducing rates or injecting money into the system And Im not so sure that the system will swallow it quick enough to stop us from falling into recession RUKEYSER So you think the Fed has waited far too long HOLLAND I think so RUKEYSER Do you think theres a chance that theyll cut more than a quarter percent next month HOLLAND I think its possible that they could have an interim meeting to cut and I think its very possible they could cut a half a point RUKEYSER Beth can you cheer me up any more DATER Well I think it gets down to interest rates because I think that is what will ultimately influence the consumer confidence Im a little bit concerned about the dollar in here I mean I think that we have had a huge amount of foreign investment also into our capital markets here and if the dollar were to weaken substantially that might be at risk and we might see some repatriation of some of those foreign investments RUKEYSER All right Now comes the moment of truth when we turn the spotlight on what these folks said twelve months ago In what has been for decades the toughest competition in investing the lists cannot be changed for any reason during the ensuing twelve months it was a tough year even for our certified geniuses though the average of all our panelists continued to beat the performance of the SP let alone the sagging Nasdaq You can check all their records on our web site It will be up after midnight tonight As youll see the five who actually defied the odds and made you money in included the four stalwarts here tonight Brian Rogers to show what a weird year it was you were the secondclosest of all our panelists behind Marty Zweig in predicting the Dows high and close though even you were too optimistic by nearly and points respectively That was good this year But in the farmoreimportant actual moneymaking part of the competition you excelled with a portfolio of specific recommendations that according to calculations by our friends at Bloomberg Financial Markets was up a whopping percent aided by three timely short sales and a neardouble in Bergen Brunswig Congratulations ROGERS Thank you RUKEYSER Barbara Marcin with both you and Brian here its clearly the value players night out While your prediction that the Dow would get above turned out to be ridiculously high you came within points points of nailing the precise Dow low of And better still your portfolio is up more than percent in this generallygrim year thanks to the best single pick of any panelist Everest Reinsurance Holdings which rewarded you with a percent gain So thanks Barbara for bringing us so much value MARCIN Thank you RUKEYSER Lou Holland welcome back to your fourth yearend appearance the most of any panelist here tonight and you earned it While your high low and close were way off the mark a familiar song this year your portfolio was up more than percent powered by the morethandoubling of Washington Mutual Way to go Lou HOLLAND Thank you RUKEYSER Beth Dater this is your third yearend program And your cautious approach to investing in including putting percent of the portfolio in threeyear Treasury notes paid off with an average gain of more than percent In that looked awful good So congratulations Beth DATER Thank you Lou RUKEYSER But enough with the compliments however wellearned in a year like this past one Theres a new and we hope different year ahead and what have you done for us lately For starters in our annual triumph of hope over experience lets hear from each of you the true inside word on the highest close the lowest close and the final close for both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq in And this time gang lets all get it exactly right Brian ROGERS Lou for the Dow I have a high of a low of and a close of And for the Nasdaq a high of a low of and a close of RUKEYSER Barbara MARCIN For the Dow I have a high of a low of and a close of And for Nasdaq a high of a low of and a close of RUKEYSER Lou HOLLAND For the Dow I have a high of a low of and a close of For the Nasdaq I have a high of a low of and a close of RUKEYSER Beth DATER Lou for the Dow I have a high of a low of and a close of And for the Nasdaq a high of a low of and a close of RUKEYSER Okay Well one thing is for sure and this is my only personal unqualified guarantee of the night At least some of them will be wrong But if youd like

equally weighted in Amgen Berkshire Hathaway Cisco Systems Intel MedImmune Mellon Bank Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Royal Dutch Petroleum Schlumberger WalMart and Westwood One RUKEYSER Hearing as much financial services as I do is that an interest rate forecast as well DATER Its an interest rate forecast and also its a call on valuations which I think are still very interesting in that area RUKEYSER How about some of those fallen giants that youve picked That suggests to me that you dont think its the end of the world DATER I do not think its the end of the world And I do think its a time of some uncertainty and its a time to think of preservation of capital first and foremost and therefore Im going with some household names at this point RUKEYSER Especially some that have been knocked so far down that DATER Exactly The valuations are coming into reasonable levels RUKEYSER Brian Rogers lets hear from you on interest rates What do you think ROGERS Lou I think well see a normalization of the yield curve this year so I think well see short rates fall The Fed will cut rates probably a couple of times And I think the big gain this year was in the long bond in calendar year I think that game is probably mostly over would be my best guess RUKEYSER And shortterm rates you dont think are going to fall that much ROGERS No I think shortterm rates will fall causing the yield curve to look RUKEYSER But how much do you think theyll fall ROGERS I think theyll fall at least or basis points this year RUKEYSER Okay If we can get that over the next two weeks that might help some of your inflows into your mutual funds ROGERS Well well be happy then RUKEYSER Thank you all very much There we do have to stop I hope youll join me next week twice first for our regular
