would have liked to get you down lower but that wont be possible today without a much larger contribution And Im OK with you helping with the foundation contribution you just wont get any recognition from Texas or from the IRS with that arrangement And with the job market these days there might come a time when I cant continue my own level of giving and then everyone will have to make a decision Id lower my giving so that the total contribution was level year after year If and when you decided to stop Id have to start making up the difference again to keep my seats on row Or Id be bumped somewhere I got this many because people started asking about getting tickets this is probably how a lot of people do it Im not sure today if I could add any more to the general area where everyone is Sheila and Mark are still getting tix on AM To David AS cc Subject RE Season tix are in I didnt think about it from your point of view and if some day I decide not to help anymore then you get hurt because your contribution falls So just disregard that suggestion I guess Im trying to feel you out about the possibility of continuing this current arrangement longterm Because I will commit to purchase the current two and would like to get two more for a total of from now on It really would be better for me to continue this arrangement rather than get them on my own because like you indicated I would have to really pony up alot of to keep similar seats Im just not sure what your plans would be for my current tickets and if at some point you would like them back for yourself How did you end up with so many Is Mark still getting the two next to mine Just curious Dont worry about the OU tix I will find you on Saturday Thanks as always DG Original Message From ENRON
