email will receive correspondence by fax Thank you so much for your enthusiasm and your ideas Many things have been suggested that I had not thought of but I think before we put these on a bulletin board we should issue passwords to protect the information for that matter the advisory board members We will call you on a landline to give you your password This will take a little time with so many advisory board members Another thing that will take a little time is insuring the security of the group in any meeting we might have Dr Wainerdi has kindly offered to have the meeting in a secure site within the Texas Medical Center and Ambassador Djerejian and I feel best to reschedule the meeting that we were talking about holding at the Baker Institute at pm on Friday September Instead we will get some advice from the FBI as to whether there are any immediate local security concerns and if so how best to mitigate them Meanwhile we will get everyone a password so that we can do some secure planning before a facetoface meeting is ever held This will make better use of the time of busy people I thought I would answer a couple critical questions that have been asked Why Defense of Houston Isnt there already enough overlap of agencies We conceived of Defense of Houston as mainly a medical group to improve the medical response in case of any terrorism or other medical disasters I have been working here for years and have been involved in some disasters like the flood but no one here has ever been in anything like what happened at the World Trade Center At best we cant say with confidence that we are prepared Indeed every single national study and there have been in the past year alone says that we are not prepared and points to communication coordination training and public education as the most pressing needs We have enough trouble keeping communication open with our sister institutions Memorial Hermann Hospital St Lukes Episcopal Hospital the Texas Heart Institute and MD Anderson Cancer Center and we know from experience that communication with the rest of the medical center and with doctors and hospitals outside the medical center is harder still Despite the outstanding efforts of the Houston Fire Departments Medical Director Dr David Persse communication is not always smooth and equipment and training are not optimal even though they are better than in most cities Since we need to do more the question is who should do it and how The doctors and scientists in the medical center dont have all the answers but have learned over the past few days that some great common sense questions and solutions have come from nontechnical people outside the medical center Moreover every member of this advisory board is a stake holder and has the right to know if the medical response system is adequate Moreover the advisory board members are leaders in the community both directly and indirectly are educators Finally a large and representative group will help medical center institutions not only by their advice their questions and needs but by their support of the work we are doing This includes the need to more research to develop better sensors vaccines and therapies all which will benefit from federal support and federal support for such projects in the Texas Medical Center and beyond is more likely and the public and its leaders are united and one day speak out Defense of Houston is not intended compete with or distract the other important groups work in this area which include the Houston Task Force on CounterTerrorism at the Baker Institute leaders are members of the Defense of Houston and viceversa or the many important city county state and federal agencies Defense of Houston is an attempt to improve our medical readiness Because we ourselves could be targets we have to know a little bit about how these other agencies can protect us and how we can help protect ourselves More specifically we expect to leave all the policy issues to the Houston Task Force on CounterTerrorism This would include the upstream issues such as analysis of the root causes of terrorism of diplomatic efforts of interagency cooperation of leadership of publicprivate efforts etc The Baker Institute also plays an important educational role In contrast Defense of Houston will focus on optimizing the medical response and secondarily on public education that is part of the mission of the medical schools here Thirdly Defense of Houston is interested in bolstering the capability of the medical institutions to conduct the kind of critical research in biosensors public health surveillance coordination of emergency care increased understanding of biological and chemical agents and means to inactivate them to vaccinate against them and to treat victims We have lots of news that will be available as soon as you have your password Thanks again for your interest I am now convinced that we can make Houston the safest city in the country Sincerely Ward INVITEES information not confirmed Allen MD Steve Medical Director Memorial Hermann Hospital Anderson Sanders Texas Southern Univ Archer Bill Price Waterhouse Andrews Mike

that in light of the terrorist attacks in New York we need to redouble our efforts in Houston As the President said last night Be ready Ed Djerejian has offered to hold a meeting at the Baker Instiute next Friday at pm Please try to attend His office will send more info I will update the acceptances on the membership list by Tuesday So far around replies all yes I believe these ad hoc groups have a short life span deservedly so but for now we can help by prodding the many agencies into better communication and coordination and a mobilized citizens group increases the chances of federal funding for Houston The website itself may end up as the education and communication tool of choice in a disaster Thanks for your interest Ward LIST OF INVITEES TO DISASTER RELIEF ADVISORY BOARD FOR HOUSTON
