BCS Formula Works Just Fine December By JOE DRAPE The Bowl Championship Series ranking formula was designed to give something to everybody The human polls are counted along with computer rankings the strength of schedule is factored in and teams are penalized for losses and credited for victories over better teams As it has the past three years the system worked Can anyone honestly say undefeated Miami versus Nebraska is not the best matchup for the national title game Now Colorado Coach Gary Barnett and the Buffaloes faithful are trying to say it is not Yes Colorado beat the Cornhuskers handily and went on to win the Big championship The Buffaloes also lost two games one to Fresno State a fine team with a future pro quarterback in David Carr But Fresno State did not even win the Western Athletic Conference title Louisiana Tech did The Bulldogs posted an record by beating league teams like Tulsa Southern Methodist Nevada and San Jose State a group that finished with a combined record The Buffaloes are beating their chests about holding off Texas in the conference championship game but the Longhorns rolled over Colorado by earlier in the season One loss in a season when there are not two undefeated teams is understandable rewarding two losses would be absurd Colorado did not earn a trip to the Rose Bowl If the Buffaloes beat Oregon in the Fiesta Bowl and Nebraska upends topranked Miami in the title game shame on any voter in the Associated Press news media poll who decides that Colorado is more deserving of the No ranking than Nebraska Oregon on the other hand has a right to feel slighted The Ducks can also be heartened that a Miamilose Oregonwin scenario might earn them the APs top ranking The Ducks who only lost to a very good Stanford team are ranked No in both the AP and USA TodayESPN coaches polls The strengthofschedule and computer component of the BCS formula did Oregon in The wonlost records of opponents and opponents opponents dont lie For Oregon those numbers add up to the nations sttoughest schedule compared to Nebraskas thranked schedule Even if you dislike or dont understand the computer rankings they account for only percent of the BCS formula Oregon was ranked as high as No by one computer and as low as No by another Both were thrown out as the formula requires and the remaining six computer service rankings were averaged Oregons averagepoint total was which means the computers rated it as the fourth or fifthbest team in the nation The math is essentially the short way of telling you what an hour of reviewing Oregons season game recaps spell out the Ducks struggled to beat decent but hardly great opponents Six of their games were decided by points or fewer In four games the margin was or fewer The Ducks had to persevere against Wisconsin Southern California UCLA and Oregon State Without the moral authority of the No ranking in the human polls Oregon Coach Mike Bellotti and the Ducks fans would assume the same gracious and silent posture as the coaches and partisans at Illinois and Maryland both also They would celebrate their fine season at a highprofile bowl game regret their single loss and admit that a down year in their respective conferences cost them a trip to the big game And how about that moral authority After Tennessee lost to Louisiana State last Saturday the coaching colleagues of Nebraskas Frank Solich changed their votes in favor of Barnett and Colorado to try to keep the Cornhuskers out of the title game Say what you want about computers and formulas but doesnt it bother you that the human component of the BCS formula is the only one that can willfully corrupt the integrity of the standing Beyond Colorado and Oregon the loudest whining is coming from the college playoff proponents many of whom are AP poll voters Fortunately they too account for percent of the BCS standing So far university presidents have emphatically shot down any playoff structure Wisely in my opinion Would the last three weeks with losses by Nebraska to Colorado Oklahoma to Oklahoma State Texas to Colorado Florida to Tennessee and Tennessee to LSU have been as urgent or dramatic if you knew many of these teams were going to tee it up again in a week or two and commence a roundrobin Of all the major sports only college football offers a regular season that matters Expanded playoffs in the pro sports and even the NCAA mens basketball tournament give fans cues when to pay attention In college football you pay attention from August on because the playoff is under way The BCS standing was created to ensure that the best two teams met in a title game which wasnt always guaranteed TennesseeFlorida State Virginia TechFlorida State OklahomaFlorida State The past three BCS title games resulted in an undisputed national champion Cut through all the noise and in Nebraska youll find a team that won straight by points or more Yes Nebraskas loss was ugly and it came in the season finale which pollsters for some reason have historically found abhorrent Yet Nebraska has one fewer loss than Colorado and has faced better competition than Oregon You may not like the BCS formula but it is fair Whether you calculate by abacus or algorithms Whether you argue it with barroom gusto or classroom decorum the BCS made the right game sportsncaafootballCOLLhtmlex eienaddadadd
