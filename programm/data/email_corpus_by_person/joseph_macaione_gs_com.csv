they were paid in blocks of mm throughout the course of the session This had the effect of flattening s by an impressive bps and of widening swap spreads by about bps in that part of the curve while spreads elsewhere closed the day pretty much unchanged Further out the curve we saw strong interest in the spread though its unclear if this was new risk or profit taking from the dealer community With regard to spreads Im wondering if it makes sense to put on a swap spread widener here with a very short term view Swap spreads blew out in the US yday as the market got the sense that most of the new issuance was out of the way and given how well EUR spreads held in despite ydays Singtel ATT and EIB pricing perhaps EUR spreads are due for a small correction Still like the narrower longer term just thinking on a very short term basis WHY THE FED WILL BE SLOW TO TIGHTEN In our view the econ recovery is not likely to be very powerful There are large imbalances in the household and corporate sectors and the sources of stimulus mortgage financing etc are likely to be much less than previously expected Additionally while it is true the nominal rates have fallen sharply the decline in real rates is roughly half of the decline in nominals On the inflation front we believe inflation is likely to decline further as a consequence of both excess capacity and higher unemployment With most major indices at or lower the Fed can be much more patient than normal when they consider whether or not they need to take back some of the bps of easing Overall we believe the Fed will want the econ to grow at an above trend rate in order to psh it back to full employment but against this we have a market that is now incorporating a signif amount of tightening over the next near Dec Euro up bps in the last week Even building in a risk premium of bps per contract a bp sprd between m libor and fed funds and bps of year end pressure this still implies about bps of tightening by While not impossible it neither reflects the Feds thinking nor appears anywhere close to the center of our probability distrubtion USD SWAPSVOL Another standard deviation event yday with the selloff in treasuries snowballing as negatively convex portfolios capitulated into selling by paying fixed at higher rates The cork was finally removed from the pressurized bottle in spreads with most corporate deals out of the way and took their natural course by widening by bps We saw heavy flows with paying across all sectors save the very long end Vols were up on the day Gamma shot up bpsday which is a pretty large move longer expiries were up about bpsday which is in line with the market price of skew Flows were not as heavy as one might have expected at least for the time being The market is clearly saying that this is the turn in the economy and that were already heading for a sharp recovery with aggressive Fed tightening action over This seems to be somewhat premature With no inflation in sight and still big signs of weakness in the economy it is unlikely that the Fed will reverse its course this fast Whilst this selloff might not be over in the near term expect high volatility we remain constructive on the outlook for rates in the medium term IPOs CORPORATE ISSUANCE Both the coporate bond market and the equity IPO market seem to be recovering a bit here The avg spread tightening on the Sing Tel and fixed rate ATT tranches is bps between where the deal was priced yday and where it opened this morning On the equity side not only are our sec lending people telling us that short interest is decreasing ie more pple covering shorts but IPO calendar is also firming up The US market had its busiest week of the year with IPOS secondary offerings and can look forward to the bln Prudential next month while Europe pitched in with a bln convert deal for Swiss Re and expects some bln in new issuance by the end of the year While its unclear how much underwater portfolios will look to take on new posns going into year end and while this flood of issuance may simply be due issuers looking to tie up loose ends before year end it does appear the global investor base is

rate used to value insurance liabilities from to despite the fact that the formula called for them to reduce the rate to as low as This marks yet another meeting where the Council reduced the rate by less than what was dictated by the formula and this likely reflects the lobbying pressure being applied by the Danish insurance industry The attached graph plots the discount rate required by the formula not the rate chosen by regulators vs yy EUR vol Its interesting to note that vol reached its peak EXACTLY when the discount rate reached its trough Its also interesting to note how quickly vol sold off when the discount rate rebounded from the low as equities rebounded Overall while we suspect there will be some smaller funds feeling some pain with this latest reduction its likely much less than the forced buying that we probably would have seen if the rate was reduced by the amount required by the formula Going forward it seems the best guide to the performance of long dated vol and cash in Euroland is the overall level of the index Happy to provide more information on this if you want more clarification dkkvoldoc EUR SWAPS One of the quietest days of the year yday as the market rallied and the Tresor was nowhere to be seen Will be interesting if todays weakness brings them back into the market Tresor aside the focus now shifts to an increasing corporate pipeline that will see a mm y deal from Alcatel and mm yr deal from Tomkins a y or y deal from Metro and a mm y deal from Royal Ahold coming to the market over the next several days With swap spreads very close to their tightest levels of the year weve seen little interest in swap spread widening positions with the Tresor looming and issuance increasing we suspect spreads will continue on their tightening path for at least the balance of the week Overall it seems this week will provide a very good barometer of how the rest of the year will be from a flow perspective as there appears to be little incentive to jeopardize yearly performance good or bad by committing large amounts of capital to a market thats been particularly vicious over the past two weeks EUROPE TRADING VIEW Our overall trading view is to buy on weakness and sell on strength this week Due to illiqudity and lack of risk capital commitment before year end and no major economic data to turn the market around our trading strategy this will likely be BUY AND TRADE wait until new year and then BUY AND HOLD A few other points Note that Europe and US have began to sell off at the same time Based on empirical studies the simultaneous sell off usually signals a correction not a prolonged bear market s in Europe have under performed very sharply relative to the beginning of all previous bear markets Note that supply in that sector is now behind us and supply will concentrate in year sector in next two weeks Stocks Bonds and commodities market have all thrown in the towel for a V shape recovery Whats the probability that all three markets are wrong MSCI reweightings this week Our research estimated billion out of Eurozone and about billion into UK However this news is priced in the market in our opinion If European fixed income sold off because of the reweightings this week we would fade that trade and go long European fixed income LEVELS close to close ex basis SWAP CURVE GBPEUREUR convention today t yy yy E GBP SWAP
