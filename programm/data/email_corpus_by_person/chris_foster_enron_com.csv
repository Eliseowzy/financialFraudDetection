Schevitz Chronicle Staff Writers Tuesday March San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifilechroniclearchiveM NDTL The University of California and the California State University system are accusing energy giant Enron of breaking contracts to provide lowcost electricity to state campuses so the company can sell the power at higher prices on the spot market The two university systems are asking a federal judge to block the Houston based energy broker from abandoning fouryear contracts Those contracts guaranteed the universities a reliable supply of power at prices percent below the capped rate created under the states deregulation law The schools say Enron Energy Systems Inc which promised them protection from the uncertainties of Californias deregulation is now trying to force them to rely on Pacific Gas and Electric Co and Southern California Edison the two utilities nearly bankrupted by skyrocketing electricity prices Enron says the universities will still be guaranteed the price provided in the contracts until the deals run out in March But at least some of the electricity will now have to be purchased for the campuses by the state Department of Water Resources on the expensive spot market Prices on the shortterm market can be many times greater than prices in longterm deals like those between Enron and the universities The state or utilities which cannot charge customers the full cost of electricity because of the rate cap would be liable for the difference between the current utility rate and the spot market cost The state which stepped in as buyer of power in January after the debt ridden utilities defaulted on payments to power plants has already spent billion buying electricity for utility customers If Enron gets out of its contracts with UC and CSU the state also would have to buy as much as megawatts for the two universities Thats enough to power homes In a civil complaint filed Friday in federal court in Oakland the universities contend that Enron wants to be free to take advantage of soaring market prices for electricity by reselling lowcost power it controls under contracts originally meant to serve the college campuses Enron is seeking to capitalize on the energy crisis to reap enormous profits the civil suit alleges Enron spokeswoman Peggy Mahoney denied the accusation We do not have any power purchased in blocks Mahoney said It is fundamentally not true Nettie Hoge executive director of the Utility Reform Network in San Francisco called the move by Enron outrageous These people have been gouging us and making profits she said If they are making less on some longterm contracts they should stay with it Marty Sunde vice chairman of Enron Energy Services said he was shocked by the lawsuit and believes it is driven by fear of the unknown We absolutely positively are honoring our contract Sunde said The universities have a percent discount off the frozen tariff rate Mahoney said Enron will continue to honor other terms of the contracts by providing billing and advice on how the colleges can minimize their energy use But Eric Behrens an attorney for UC said Enron cannot fulfill those parts of the contracts because it has asked the utilities to rip out thousands of meters that provided information to the company about electricity use on the campuses The utilities are installing their own meters at the schools Behrens said UC one of the largest single users of electricity in the state went through a laborious process to shift onto Enrons system spending for each of the new meters Even if Enron honors the low rate until the contracts expire Behrens said its abrogation of the deals could expose UC and CSU to extra costs of as much as million in coming years by forcing them to become utility customers again Those customers will probably have to cover a major share of the billions in debt that the utilities and the state have racked up over the past year as wholesale prices for power went through the roof Until Feb when Enron took steps to drop them the universities were so called direct access customers of Enron Direct access a key piece of the states deregulation plan was originally intended to lower prices for consumers by allowing companies to compete with the utilities But the state Legislature concerned that too many customers were fleeing the utilities recently passed a bill that could suspend any new contracts under the direct access program Mahoney said Enron is being forced to release all its direct access customers because the debtladen utilities have stopped paying Enron and other providers a required rebate Other residential and institutional customers also are being returned to the utilities Enron for example is returning the San Francisco Giants to PGE even though the energy company signed a contract to provide electricity to Pacific Bell Park through TEXThtm

Chris Jeff ES AM To Chris H CT James D ES cc Subject Re SDGE Requirements Deal Thanks for the update Just want to add that if were uneasy about wearing the full requirements risk then focusing on offering a purely wholesale deal can still be very attractive given SDGEs blunders wrt procurment wholesale power on behalf of its customers And the CPUC has been beat up pretty well for tying the IOUs hands in attempting to hedge so theyll be subject to a considerable amount of pressure to preapprove if a deal is offered that can be show to shield San Diegans from volatility and that looksattractive Appreciate being kept in the loop on the details Thanks Best Jeff To James D ES cc Tim CT Greg CT Jeff ES Subject Re SDGE Requirements Deal J I think we could get below on a year deal with a bell shaped load profile at SP I do not think we can get there for the SDGE zone In fact I dont think Tim will want to sell the SDGE zone at all If we offer it it will be at a significant premium to SP We just showed SCE for a year peak By the way like the SDGE RFP the SCE RFP resulted in no transactions because they did not get preapproved reasonableness review and they were too chicken to do it at shareholder risk The PGE RFP for essentially the same deal structure is due tomorrow and we will be responding With the PGE RFP prices can be changed oon October so the prices we will show them now are indicative only Get me that load profile data and I will put together a deal structure I wil also be working with the traders to address this new zone issue as it exists for all three utilities not just SDGE C James D ES AM To Chris H CT cc thane twiggs Subject SDGE Requirements Deal Chris I agree with you on the difficulty of a true full requirements deal I assume what you are talking about is some preagreed to load factor energy delivery that could be different for each hour during the year a sort of load profile solution SDGE would be responsible for around this delivery Maybe offer SDGE an option on wide variations The other key issue I guess that is important is transmission congestion risk Would EPMI be willing to agree to deliver the energy into the SDGE load zone or just to SP It is my understanding that there is a significant economic difference the SP and specific load zones Am I correct in my thinking We probably need to beat Mwh and leave Mwh for the load following We may need to go even lower if possible to give SDGE room to recover this summers high cost of power with the retroactive retail ratemaking back through July On your issue of CPUC approval that is exactly the play We need to walk into the CPUC with an offer that it cant pass up with or without SDGE Ive asked Thane Twiggs to get you the appropriate load profile for SDGE residential customers While the rate deal was broader we could just supply this customer group Ill call when we have the information Jim To James D ES cc Christopher F CT Tim CT Subject Re SDGE Bilateral Authority Delay Jim A couple thoughts I dont think Tim would be interested in a true Full Requirements deal that would put us at risk for actual load If we could define Full Requirements as a load profile that has been set ahead of time and have SDGE be at risk for deviations from that profile then I think we would be interested With this structure we could offer a fixed price equal to the weighted average price of their load profile If that fixed price was lower than the SDGE embedded generation cost in rates we might have an angle Winning such a deal still seems like a pretty low probability event given SDGEs desire to RFP everything However SDGEs and SCEs main objective seems to be preapproved reasonableness review Since they cant make money on commodity at least they dont want to lose money Maybe we could get the approval of the CPUC SDGE wouldnt mind buying from us if this is what it took to get preapproved reasonableness review If someone could get me that load

Subject Duke Energy Proposes to Manage All of SDGEs Electricity Needs For Next Five Years at Low Fixed Pri Monday November pm Eastern Time Press Release SOURCE Duke Energy Corporation Duke Energy Proposes to Manage All of SDGEs Electricity Needs For Next Five Years at Low Fixed Price MORRO BAY Calif Nov PRNewswire Duke Energy NYSE DUK news through its business unit Duke Energy North America DENA has put forth another bold solution to Californias electricity crisis by proposing to manage San Diego Gas Electrics SDGE megawatt electricity load at a fixed price of cents per kilowatthour for the next five years This proposal is based on market prices for electricity and natural gas as of Nov DENAs proposal which takes into account SDGEs seasonal and hourly load requirements and has a percent annual adjustment for inflation was included in comments DENA submitted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission last week in response to the commissions proposed remedies for Californias electricity market Under DENAs proposal SDGEs business and residential customers no longer would be exposed to the electricity price spikes they experienced this past summer when their retail electricity prices often exceeded cents per kilowatthour The megawatts represent the full electricity load SDGE needs to serve its retail customer base during the hottest summer day said Jeff Stokes DENA executive vice president for the Western region We again have stepped up with tangible marketbased solutions that can be implemented to address the San Diego areas electricity price spikes In addition to stabilizing customers power bills our proposal would also eliminate SDGEs exposure to high wholesale electricity prices and the financial uncertainty that goes along with that exposure California is facing high wholesale electricity prices largely because of supply and demand imbalance which has caused the California Independent System Operator CalISO to call an unprecedented Stage Two Electrical Emergencies thus far in when available electricity supplies have fallen below percent The primary causes for the electricity supply shortfall are the states economic growth the lack of new power plants being built in California over the past decade an aging generation fleet that requires more maintenance and electricity imports being less available due to economic growth throughout the West Californias electricity supply and demand imbalance is expected to worsen or show little improvement until the summers of and which is the earliest a substantial amount of new more efficient and cleaner power plants can be brought on line This is another key marketbased solution to Californias electricity crisis made by Duke Energy over the past four months and we hope that it is given serious consideration said Bill Hall DENA vice president of asset management for the Western region The competitive wholesale electricity markets did not cause this electricity crisis but with patience wisdom and bold behavior by all market participants we can fix the crisis and not burden the states electricity ratepayers or taxpayers DENA has taken the following steps recently to address Californias electricity shortfall and high prices On Nov DENA broke ground on its million modernization of Moss Landing Power Plant in Monterey County to upgrade the existing plant and add megawatts of new capacity to the sites current megawatts When the modernization is completed the plant will be Californias largest The project represents a substantial portion of the new generation scheduled to come on line in California during summer On Nov DENA signed a wholesale electricity contract with Southern California Edison to help manage price volatility and prevent price spikes for their retail customers This followed a similar contract that was signed with Pacific Gas Electric on Oct The specific prices of the contracts are proprietary On Oct DENA refiled with the California Energy Commission its page application for certification to modernize the megawatt Morro Bay Power Plant The new megawatt facility represents a million investment If the certification is received DENA expects to bring the new plant on line by summer and demolish the existing plant by Finally DENA has begun to work with City of Chula Vista officials to accelerate the schedule for replacing the South Bay Power Plant with a cleaner and more efficient facility Existing plans call for the plant to be replaced in For more information about DENAs California operations power plant modernization plans

Subject Duke Energy Proposes to Manage All of SDGEs Electricity Needs For Next Five Years at Low Fixed Pri Monday November pm Eastern Time Press Release SOURCE Duke Energy Corporation Duke Energy Proposes to Manage All of SDGEs Electricity Needs For Next Five Years at Low Fixed Price MORRO BAY Calif Nov PRNewswire Duke Energy NYSE DUK news through its business unit Duke Energy North America DENA has put forth another bold solution to Californias electricity crisis by proposing to manage San Diego Gas Electrics SDGE megawatt electricity load at a fixed price of cents per kilowatthour for the next five years This proposal is based on market prices for electricity and natural gas as of Nov DENAs proposal which takes into account SDGEs seasonal and hourly load requirements and has a percent annual adjustment for inflation was included in comments DENA submitted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission last week in response to the commissions proposed remedies for Californias electricity market Under DENAs proposal SDGEs business and residential customers no longer would be exposed to the electricity price spikes they experienced this past summer when their retail electricity prices often exceeded cents per kilowatthour The megawatts represent the full electricity load SDGE needs to serve its retail customer base during the hottest summer day said Jeff Stokes DENA executive vice president for the Western region We again have stepped up with tangible marketbased solutions that can be implemented to address the San Diego areas electricity price spikes In addition to stabilizing customers power bills our proposal would also eliminate SDGEs exposure to high wholesale electricity prices and the financial uncertainty that goes along with that exposure California is facing high wholesale electricity prices largely because of supply and demand imbalance which has caused the California Independent System Operator CalISO to call an unprecedented Stage Two Electrical Emergencies thus far in when available electricity supplies have fallen below percent The primary causes for the electricity supply shortfall are the states economic growth the lack of new power plants being built in California over the past decade an aging generation fleet that requires more maintenance and electricity imports being less available due to economic growth throughout the West Californias electricity supply and demand imbalance is expected to worsen or show little improvement until the summers of and which is the earliest a substantial amount of new more efficient and cleaner power plants can be brought on line This is another key marketbased solution to Californias electricity crisis made by Duke Energy over the past four months and we hope that it is given serious consideration said Bill Hall DENA vice president of asset management for the Western region The competitive wholesale electricity markets did not cause this electricity crisis but with patience wisdom and bold behavior by all market participants we can fix the crisis and not burden the states electricity ratepayers or taxpayers DENA has taken the following steps recently to address Californias electricity shortfall and high prices On Nov DENA broke ground on its million modernization of Moss Landing Power Plant in Monterey County to upgrade the existing plant and add megawatts of new capacity to the sites current megawatts When the modernization is completed the plant will be Californias largest The project represents a substantial portion of the new generation scheduled to come on line in California during summer On Nov DENA signed a wholesale electricity contract with Southern California Edison to help manage price volatility and prevent price spikes for their retail customers This followed a similar contract that was signed with Pacific Gas Electric on Oct The specific prices of the contracts are proprietary On Oct DENA refiled with the California Energy Commission its page application for certification to modernize the megawatt Morro Bay Power Plant The new megawatt facility represents a million investment If the certification is received DENA expects to bring the new plant on line by summer and demolish the existing plant by Finally DENA has begun to work with City of Chula Vista officials to accelerate the schedule for replacing the South Bay Power Plant with a cleaner and more efficient facility Existing plans call for the plant to be replaced in For more information about DENAs California operations power plant modernization plans

Chris Jeff ES AM To Chris H CT James D ES cc Subject Re SDGE Requirements Deal Thanks for the update Just want to add that if were uneasy about wearing the full requirements risk then focusing on offering a purely wholesale deal can still be very attractive given SDGEs blunders wrt procurment wholesale power on behalf of its customers And the CPUC has been beat up pretty well for tying the IOUs hands in attempting to hedge so theyll be subject to a considerable amount of pressure to preapprove if a deal is offered that can be show to shield San Diegans from volatility and that looksattractive Appreciate being kept in the loop on the details Thanks Best Jeff To James D ES cc Tim CT Greg CT Jeff ES Subject Re SDGE Requirements Deal J I think we could get below on a year deal with a bell shaped load profile at SP I do not think we can get there for the SDGE zone In fact I dont think Tim will want to sell the SDGE zone at all If we offer it it will be at a significant premium to SP We just showed SCE for a year peak By the way like the SDGE RFP the SCE RFP resulted in no transactions because they did not get preapproved reasonableness review and they were too chicken to do it at shareholder risk The PGE RFP for essentially the same deal structure is due tomorrow and we will be responding With the PGE RFP prices can be changed oon October so the prices we will show them now are indicative only Get me that load profile data and I will put together a deal structure I wil also be working with the traders to address this new zone issue as it exists for all three utilities not just SDGE C James D ES AM To Chris H CT cc thane twiggs Subject SDGE Requirements Deal Chris I agree with you on the difficulty of a true full requirements deal I assume what you are talking about is some preagreed to load factor energy delivery that could be different for each hour during the year a sort of load profile solution SDGE would be responsible for around this delivery Maybe offer SDGE an option on wide variations The other key issue I guess that is important is transmission congestion risk Would EPMI be willing to agree to deliver the energy into the SDGE load zone or just to SP It is my understanding that there is a significant economic difference the SP and specific load zones Am I correct in my thinking We probably need to beat Mwh and leave Mwh for the load following We may need to go even lower if possible to give SDGE room to recover this summers high cost of power with the retroactive retail ratemaking back through July On your issue of CPUC approval that is exactly the play We need to walk into the CPUC with an offer that it cant pass up with or without SDGE Ive asked Thane Twiggs to get you the appropriate load profile for SDGE residential customers While the rate deal was broader we could just supply this customer group Ill call when we have the information Jim To James D ES cc Christopher F CT Tim CT Subject Re SDGE Bilateral Authority Delay Jim A couple thoughts I dont think Tim would be interested in a true Full Requirements deal that would put us at risk for actual load If we could define Full Requirements as a load profile that has been set ahead of time and have SDGE be at risk for deviations from that profile then I think we would be interested With this structure we could offer a fixed price equal to the weighted average price of their load profile If that fixed price was lower than the SDGE embedded generation cost in rates we might have an angle Winning such a deal still seems like a pretty low probability event given SDGEs desire to RFP everything However SDGEs and SCEs main objective seems to be preapproved reasonableness review Since they cant make money on commodity at least they dont want to lose money Maybe we could get the approval of the CPUC SDGE wouldnt mind buying from us if this is what it took to get preapproved reasonableness review If someone could get me that load
