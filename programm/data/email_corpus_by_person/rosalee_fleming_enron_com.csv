Hogan on AM To ER cc Subject On Market Power in California FYI The complete version of the following paper is available on my web pa ge at wwwwhogancom ON THE EXERCISE OF MARKET POWER THROUGH STRATEGIC WITHHOLDING IN CALIFORNIA Scott Harvey and William W Hogan April EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Beginning in June of the shock of unexpectedly high prices in the California electricity market convinced everyone of the need for policies t o correct the apparent market failures The public debate and policy discussions have been dominated by a focus on market power as a principal problem amenable to regulatory solution However design of effective policies to moderate prices or mitigate their effects depends on the diagnosis of the underlying causes High prices attributable largely to an exercise of market power in electric generation would point to particular market participants and behaviors that could be targeted for regulatory action By contrast high prices attributable to bad electricity market design would indicate a need for changes in the design High prices attributable to higher fuel prices environmental constraints and capacity shortages on the other hand would prompt actions to address the cost of fuel and environmental limitations and indicate that retail loads should receive the appropriate price signal for conservation Suppliers could affect market prices by strategically withholding some capacity in order to profit on the capacity actually sold in the market B ut charging high prices during periods of scarcity is not classified as exercising market power if there is no strategic withholding of supply Likewise refusing to supply without being paid is not an exercise of marke t power Although the potential for withholding exists for many suppliers t he focus of attention has been on the exercise of market power by thermal generators in California On its face the experience of extremely high prices suggests that the exercise of market power could be important But at the same time the data show that there have been profound changes in the California market such th at the thermal generators have actually increased their production more than demand has grown If anything thermal generators that hit annual output limits produced too much rather than too little in the summer of Furthermore the widespread impacts of higher electricity prices throughout the western market both on and off peak indicate that if the exercise of market power is important it is occurring to an extent and through channels unprecedented in this or other electricity markets In short this is a complicated story and there is ample room for further investigation of the data and diagnosis of causes Examination of the major analyses of the exercise of market power reveals that the estimated magnitude of the possible strategic withholding of electric generation is small enough to make it important to verify the simplifying assumptions If strategic withholding were large and pervasive then the real details of the California electricity market could be ignored But it is by now apparent that the evidence is not clear and any finding o f the presence or absence of strategic withholding of generation in the California electricity market could turn on the simplifying assumptions use d in the analysis of the data For example annual limits on production dictate that plants should not run in many hours when prices are higher tha n direct incremental costs hence examinations of output decisions for individual hours or months are necessarily incomplete The variation in re al time conditions is large enough to produce significant reductions in output compared to the expectations given dayahead prices hence with capacity constraints average optimal production is necessarily less than optimal production at average prices Limits on the ramping rate of generation units startup costs minimum load costs and other operational inflexibilities imply that a dispatch day is not just twentyfour separate hours and must be analyzed chronologically recognizing these factors And so on Accounting for such effects can reverse the implications of the previous evidence Unfortunately the real details are neither simple nor incidental It is difficult to conduct a study of market power based solely on publicly available data A fuller analysis would require data available only to the California Independent System Operator and has not been done Many factor s contributed to higher electricity prices in California and the market powe r theme is only at most part of the story The import of the previous analyses is not to prove that market power has been exercised in the California electricity market but rather to suggest that it might be important The import of the sensitivity analysis here is not to prove tha t market power has not been exercised in the electricity market but rather to suggest that it is unlikely to be the dominant factor and may not even b e significant With the available data in the public domain and the special complications introduced by the California market design the margin of err or in estimating the extent of the possible exercise of market power through strategic withholding of electric generation is of the same order of magnitude as the effect being measured On balance to date the publicly available data provides no reason for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to change its conclusion that there is no evidence of strategic withholding nor any proof that no strategic withholding has occurred By contrast there is general agreement that the California electricity market design is seriously flawed Furthermore there is evidence that the policy responses that have been adopted in California have accelerated an already serious market collapse Hence without dismissing the possibility of the exercise of market power the principal policy focus should be on fashioning workable solutions for the other more serious problems in market design that relate to the underlying causes of the market meltdown Separate from market power mitigation California should pay its bills rai se incremental prices to retail customers and move as quickly as possible to operating a coordinated and efficient market with consistent pricing for al l that includes unit commitment dayahead scheduling and realtime balancing Although not a panacea these steps would address immediate problems and set the stage for longerterm initiatives to expand generation capacity transmission infrastructure and the reach of an efficient market to the western interconnected grid William W Hogan John F Kennedy School of Government Harvard University John F Kennedy Street Cambridge MA o f web page wwwwhogancom or peoplewhogan

Richard nron Subject Hi Rosalee Steve Kean asked that I send you this note for transmittal to Ken Lay Mr Lay may receive a call from David Freeman regarding ongoing power negotiations between the California Department of Water and Enron but it i s not certain that he will call In the event that he does phone we would like to make sure that Mr Lay gets this information prior returning the call Thanks very much for your help All the best Jeff Mr Lay As you know weve been working very hard with David Freeman trying to hamme r out a power deal with CDWR The big issue getting in the way of the deal continues to be credit Ive attached the summary of the credit issues and possible solutions to the problem that was included in the email to Senator Brulte last week As part of the ongoing efforts to resolve the credit issues Chris Calger of the Portland office sent a letter to David Freeman yesterday That letter is also attached In sum the letter expresses our commitment to continue working together to resolve the credit issuesand requests payment for power previously delivered to CDWR and prepayment for any new deliveries In response David Freeman phoned Chris Calger expressing dissappointment that we had yet to sign a power deal with DWR despite your meeting with Dave Freeman and Mike Peevey a couple of weeks ago and we would make a power deal contingent upon a payment for power previously delivered to DWR and b prepayment for any future deliveries Freeman suggested that we could sign the deal for MWs of power now but then back out of the deal if CDWR fails to get adequate credit provisions in place within the next fe w weeks Given the political climate in California we are of course not anxious to sign a deal today that carries significant credit risk and announce later that we are backing out of the deal since doing so would place the Company in a very uncomfortable political position Instead we continue to suggest that its best for all parties to have the credit issue s resolved up front You may receive a call from David Freeman seeking to discuss these issues further As you know the credit issues are significant and we are working hard to overcome those issues But in the current climate where the Governor and the Legislature are actively discussing a complete takeover of the electric industry in California getting the contract issues right is critical Regards Jeff Dasovich SUMMARY OF CREDIT ISSUES FROM BRULTE EMAIL Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in ABX to Purchase Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with suppliers Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th e goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible However ambiguities contained in ABX have created significant credit risk concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms We understand that the lions share of counterparties share Enrons c redit risk concerns Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements going forward Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority The language in ABX is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power From our analysis of the bill the language in ABX appears to leave intact the California PUCs exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California As such suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat es adequate charges to cover DWRs costs of power purchases Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract Prudence The language in ABX leaves open the possibility that the California Public Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are imprudent On the basis of such a finding the CPUC could then ref use to allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power purchases Consequently suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr ee to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that DWR has entered into with suppliers Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to Recover DWRs Costs of Power Purchases In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority noted above the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to the specific ratemaking mechanics that ABX directs the PUC to empl oy to permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs Based on our analysis it i s extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu re DWR recovers its power purchase costs Moreover as currently drafted it is difficult to determine whether ABX would even permit the PUC to include in rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWRs power purchase costs Again this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri sk issues We have identified three options Amend ABX The amendments which are attached to this email would clarify that a the PUC would accept as prudent and reasonable all purchase costs incur red by DWR and b the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary to ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases This is the preferred option though we understand that the there may be some political challenges standing in the way of amending ABX See attached file entitled AmendABXdoc Clarify the Ambiguities in ABX through an Order Issued by the PUC and through Contract Language This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to implement However it is more complicated and could take significantly mo re time to implement than the legislative fix We have attached electronic copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC would need to issue under this option See attached file entitled cpuctalkingpointsdoc Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk As indicated in our letter responding to DWRs RFP we are willing to ac cept other forms of credit from DWR Those options include a letter of credit cash prepayment or an acceptable form of collateral DWR officials have indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options That is DWR prefers to clarify the ambiguities in ABX through a PUC order and through contract amendments LETTER FROM CHRIS CALGER TO DAVID FREEMAN February S David Freeman Advisor to the Governor California Department of Water

withholding of generation in the California electricity market could turn on the simplifying assumptions use d in the analysis of the data For example annual limits on production dictate that plants should not run in many hours when prices are higher tha n direct incremental costs hence examinations of output decisions for individual hours or months are necessarily incomplete The variation in re al time conditions is large enough to produce significant reductions in output compared to the expectations given dayahead prices hence with capacity constraints average optimal production is necessarily less than optimal production at average prices Limits on the ramping rate of generation units startup costs minimum load costs and other operational inflexibilities imply that a dispatch day is not just twentyfour separate hours and must be analyzed chronologically recognizing these factors And so on Accounting for such effects can reverse the implications of the previous evidence Unfortunately the real details are neither simple nor incidental It is difficult to conduct a study of market power based solely on publicly available data A fuller analysis would require data available only to the California Independent System Operator and has not been done Many factor s contributed to higher electricity prices in California and the market powe r theme is only at most part of the story The import of the previous analyses is not to prove that market power has been exercised in the California electricity market but rather to suggest that it might be important The import of the sensitivity analysis here is not to prove tha t market power has not been exercised in the electricity market but rather to suggest that it is unlikely to be the dominant factor and may not even b e significant With the available data in the public domain and the special complications introduced by the California market design the margin of err or in estimating the extent of the possible exercise of market power through strategic withholding of electric generation is of the same order of magnitude as the effect being measured On balance to date the publicly available data provides no reason for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to change its conclusion that there is no evidence of strategic withholding nor any proof that no strategic withholding has occurred By contrast there is general agreement that the California electricity market design is seriously flawed Furthermore there is evidence that the policy responses that have been adopted in California have accelerated an already serious market collapse Hence without dismissing the possibility of the exercise of market power the principal policy focus should be on fashioning workable solutions for the other more serious problems in market design that relate to the underlying causes of the market meltdown Separate from market power mitigation California should pay its bills rai se incremental prices to retail customers and move as quickly as possible to operating a coordinated and efficient market with consistent pricing for al l that includes unit commitment dayahead scheduling and realtime balancing Although not a panacea these steps would address immediate problems and set the stage for longerterm initiatives to expand generation capacity transmission infrastructure and the reach of an efficient market to the western interconnected grid William W Hogan John F Kennedy School of Government Harvard University John F Kennedy Street Cambridge MA o f web page wwwwhogancom or peoplewhogan

<14976286.1075847779327.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,rosalee.fleming@enron.com,2001-02-20 10:22:00,Re Cc Jeff I will give to Ken Rosie From Jeff Dasovich on PM Sent by Jeff Dasovich To Rosalee NRON cc Richard nron Subject Hi Rosalee Steve Kean asked that I send you this note for transmittal to Ken Lay Mr Lay may receive a call from David Freeman regarding ongoing power negotiations between the California Department of Water and Enron but it i s not certain that he will call In the event that he does phone we would like to make sure that Mr Lay gets this information prior returning the call Thanks very much for your help All the best Jeff Mr Lay As you know weve been working very hard with David Freeman trying to hamme r out a power deal with CDWR The big issue getting in the way of the deal continues to be credit Ive attached the summary of the credit issues and possible solutions to the problem that was included in the email to Senator Brulte last week As part of the ongoing efforts to resolve the credit issues Chris Calger of the Portland office sent a letter to David Freeman yesterday That letter is also attached In sum the letter expresses our commitment to continue working together to resolve the credit issuesand requests payment for power previously delivered to CDWR and prepayment for any new deliveries In response David Freeman phoned Chris Calger expressing dissappointment that we had yet to sign a power deal with DWR despite your meeting with Dave Freeman and Mike Peevey a couple of weeks ago and we would make a power deal contingent upon a payment for power previously delivered to DWR and b prepayment for any future deliveries Freeman suggested that we could sign the deal for MWs of power now but then back out of the deal if CDWR fails to get adequate credit provisions in place within the next fe w weeks Given the political climate in California we are of course not anxious to sign a deal today that carries significant credit risk and announce later that we are backing out of the deal since doing so would place the Company in a very uncomfortable political position Instead we continue to suggest that its best for all parties to have the credit issue s resolved up front You may receive a call from David Freeman seeking to discuss these issues further As you know the credit issues are significant and we are working hard to overcome those issues But in the current climate where the Governor and the Legislature are actively discussing a complete takeover of the electric industry in California getting the contract issues right is critical Regards Jeff Dasovich SUMMARY OF CREDIT ISSUES FROM BRULTE EMAIL Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in ABX to Purchase Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with suppliers Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th e goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible However ambiguities contained in ABX have created significant credit risk concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms We understand that the lions share of counterparties share Enrons c redit risk concerns Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements going forward Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority The language in ABX is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power From our analysis of the bill the language in ABX appears to leave intact the California PUCs exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California As such suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat es adequate charges to cover DWRs costs of power purchases Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract Prudence The language in ABX leaves open the possibility that the California Public Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are imprudent On the basis of such a finding the CPUC could then ref use to allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power purchases Consequently suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr ee to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that DWR has entered into with suppliers Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to Recover DWRs Costs of Power Purchases In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority noted above the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to the specific ratemaking mechanics that ABX directs the PUC to empl oy to permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs Based on our analysis it i s extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu re DWR recovers its power purchase costs Moreover as currently drafted it is difficult to determine whether ABX would even permit the PUC to include in rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWRs power purchase costs Again this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri sk issues We have identified three options Amend ABX The amendments which are attached to this email would clarify that a the PUC would accept as prudent and reasonable all purchase costs incur red by DWR and b the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary to ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases This is the preferred option though we understand that the there may be some political challenges standing in the way of amending ABX See attached file entitled AmendABXdoc Clarify the Ambiguities in ABX through an Order Issued by the PUC and through Contract Language This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to implement However it is more complicated and could take significantly mo re time to implement than the legislative fix We have attached electronic copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC would need to issue under this option See attached file entitled cpuctalkingpointsdoc Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk As indicated in our letter responding to DWRs RFP we are willing to ac cept other forms of credit from DWR Those options include a letter of credit cash prepayment or an acceptable form of collateral DWR officials have indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options That is DWR prefers to clarify the ambiguities in ABX through a PUC order and through contract amendments LETTER FROM CHRIS CALGER TO DAVID FREEMAN February S David Freeman Advisor to the Governor California Department of Water

nron Subject Hi Rosalee Steve Kean asked that I send you this note for transmittal to Ken Lay Mr Lay may receive a call from David Freeman regarding ongoing power negotiations between the California Department of Water and Enron but it i s not certain that he will call In the event that he does phone we would like to make sure that Mr Lay gets this information prior returning the call Thanks very much for your help All the best Jeff Mr Lay As you know weve been working very hard with David Freeman trying to hamme r out a power deal with CDWR The big issue getting in the way of the deal continues to be credit Ive attached the summary of the credit issues and possible solutions to the problem that was included in the email to Senator Brulte last week As part of the ongoing efforts to resolve the credit issues Chris Calger of the Portland office sent a letter to David Freeman yesterday That letter is also attached In sum the letter expresses our commitment to continue working together to resolve the credit issuesand requests payment for power previously delivered to CDWR and prepayment for any new deliveries In response David Freeman phoned Chris Calger expressing dissappointment that we had yet to sign a power deal with DWR despite your meeting with Dave Freeman and Mike Peevey a couple of weeks ago and we would make a power deal contingent upon a payment for power previously delivered to DWR and b prepayment for any future deliveries Freeman suggested that we could sign the deal for MWs of power now but then back out of the deal if CDWR fails to get adequate credit provisions in place within the next fe w weeks Given the political climate in California we are of course not anxious to sign a deal today that carries significant credit risk and announce later that we are backing out of the deal since doing so would place the Company in a very uncomfortable political position Instead we continue to suggest that its best for all parties to have the credit issue s resolved up front You may receive a call from David Freeman seeking to discuss these issues further As you know the credit issues are significant and we are working hard to overcome those issues But in the current climate where the Governor and the Legislature are actively discussing a complete takeover of the electric industry in California getting the contract issues right is critical Regards Jeff Dasovich SUMMARY OF CREDIT ISSUES FROM BRULTE EMAIL Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in ABX to Purchase Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with suppliers Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th e goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible However ambiguities contained in ABX have created significant credit risk concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms We understand that the lions share of counterparties share Enrons c redit risk concerns Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements going forward Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority The language in ABX is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power From our analysis of the bill the language in ABX appears to leave intact the California PUCs exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California As such suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat es adequate charges to cover DWRs costs of power purchases Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract Prudence The language in ABX leaves open the possibility that the California Public Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are imprudent On the basis of such a finding the CPUC could then ref use to allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power purchases Consequently suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr ee to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that DWR has entered into with suppliers Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to Recover DWRs Costs of Power Purchases In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority noted above the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to the specific ratemaking mechanics that ABX directs the PUC to empl oy to permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs Based on our analysis it i s extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu re DWR recovers its power purchase costs Moreover as currently drafted it is difficult to determine whether ABX would even permit the PUC to include in rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWRs power purchase costs Again this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri sk issues We have identified three options Amend ABX The amendments which are attached to this email would clarify that a the PUC would accept as prudent and reasonable all purchase costs incur red by DWR and b the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary to ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases This is the preferred option though we understand that the there may be some political challenges standing in the way of amending ABX See attached file entitled AmendABXdoc Clarify the Ambiguities in ABX through an Order Issued by the PUC and through Contract Language This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to implement However it is more complicated and could take significantly mo re time to implement than the legislative fix We have attached electronic copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC would need to issue under this option See attached file entitled cpuctalkingpointsdoc Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk As indicated in our letter responding to DWRs RFP we are willing to ac cept other forms of credit from DWR Those options include a letter of credit cash prepayment or an acceptable form of collateral DWR officials have indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options That is DWR prefers to clarify

Hogan on AM To ER cc Subject On Market Power in California FYI The complete version of the following paper is available on my web pa ge at wwwwhogancom ON THE EXERCISE OF MARKET POWER THROUGH STRATEGIC WITHHOLDING IN CALIFORNIA Scott Harvey and William W Hogan April EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Beginning in June of the shock of unexpectedly high prices in the California electricity market convinced everyone of the need for policies t o correct the apparent market failures The public debate and policy discussions have been dominated by a focus on market power as a principal problem amenable to regulatory solution However design of effective policies to moderate prices or mitigate their effects depends on the diagnosis of the underlying causes High prices attributable largely to an exercise of market power in electric generation would point to particular market participants and behaviors that could be targeted for regulatory action By contrast high prices attributable to bad electricity market design would indicate a need for changes in the design High prices attributable to higher fuel prices environmental constraints and capacity shortages on the other hand would prompt actions to address the cost of fuel and environmental limitations and indicate that retail loads should receive the appropriate price signal for conservation Suppliers could affect market prices by strategically withholding some capacity in order to profit on the capacity actually sold in the market B ut charging high prices during periods of scarcity is not classified as exercising market power if there is no strategic withholding of supply Likewise refusing to supply without being paid is not an exercise of marke t power Although the potential for withholding exists for many suppliers t he focus of attention has been on the exercise of market power by thermal generators in California On its face the experience of extremely high prices suggests that the exercise of market power could be important But at the same time the data show that there have been profound changes in the California market such th at the thermal generators have actually increased their production more than demand has grown If anything thermal generators that hit annual output limits produced too much rather than too little in the summer of Furthermore the widespread impacts of higher electricity prices throughout the western market both on and off peak indicate that if the exercise of market power is important it is occurring to an extent and through channels unprecedented in this or other electricity markets In short this is a complicated story and there is ample room for further investigation of the data and diagnosis of causes Examination of the major analyses of the exercise of market power reveals that the estimated magnitude of the possible strategic withholding of electric generation is small enough to make it important to verify the simplifying assumptions If strategic withholding were large and pervasive then the real details of the California electricity market could be ignored But it is by now apparent that the evidence is not clear and any finding o f the presence or absence of strategic withholding of generation in the California electricity market could turn on the simplifying assumptions use d in the analysis of the data For example annual limits on production dictate that plants should not run in many hours when prices are higher tha n direct incremental costs hence examinations of output decisions for individual hours or months are necessarily incomplete The variation in re al time conditions is large enough to produce significant reductions in output compared to the expectations given dayahead prices hence with capacity constraints average optimal production is necessarily less than optimal production at average prices Limits on the ramping rate of generation units startup costs minimum load costs and other operational inflexibilities imply that a dispatch day is not just twentyfour separate hours and must be analyzed chronologically recognizing these factors And so on Accounting for such effects can reverse the implications of the previous evidence Unfortunately the real details are neither simple nor incidental It is difficult to conduct a study of market power based solely on publicly available data A fuller analysis would require data available only to the California Independent System Operator and has not been done Many factor s contributed to higher electricity prices in California and the market powe r theme is only at most part of the story The import of the previous analyses is not to prove that market power has been exercised in the California electricity market but rather to suggest that it might be important The import of the sensitivity analysis here is not to prove tha t market power has not been exercised in the electricity market but rather to suggest that it is unlikely to be the dominant factor and may not even b e significant With the available data in the public domain and the special complications introduced by the California market design the margin of err or in estimating the extent of the possible exercise of market power through strategic withholding of electric generation is of the same order of magnitude as the effect being measured On balance to date the publicly available data provides no reason for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to change its conclusion that there is no evidence of strategic withholding nor any proof that no strategic withholding has occurred By contrast there is general agreement that the California electricity market design is seriously flawed Furthermore there is evidence that the policy responses that have been adopted in California have accelerated an already serious market collapse Hence without dismissing the possibility of the exercise of market power the principal policy focus should be on fashioning workable solutions for the other more serious problems in market design that relate to the underlying causes of the market meltdown Separate from market power mitigation California should pay its bills rai se incremental prices to retail customers and move as quickly as possible to operating a coordinated and efficient market with consistent pricing for al l that includes unit commitment dayahead scheduling and realtime

Hogan on AM To ER cc Subject On Market Power in California FYI The complete version of the following paper is available on my web pa ge at wwwwhogancom ON THE EXERCISE OF MARKET POWER THROUGH STRATEGIC WITHHOLDING IN CALIFORNIA Scott Harvey and William W Hogan April EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Beginning in June of the shock of unexpectedly high prices in the California electricity market convinced everyone of the need for policies t o correct the apparent market failures The public debate and policy discussions have been dominated by a focus on market power as a principal problem amenable to regulatory solution However design of effective policies to moderate prices or mitigate their effects depends on the diagnosis of the underlying causes High prices attributable largely to an exercise of market power in electric generation would point to particular market participants and behaviors that could be targeted for regulatory action By contrast high prices attributable to bad electricity market design would indicate a need for changes in the design High prices attributable to higher fuel prices environmental constraints and capacity shortages on the other hand would prompt actions to address the cost of fuel and environmental limitations and indicate that retail loads should receive the appropriate price signal for conservation Suppliers could affect market prices by strategically withholding some capacity in order to profit on the capacity actually sold in the market B ut charging high prices during periods of scarcity is not classified as exercising market power if there is no strategic withholding of supply Likewise refusing to supply without being paid is not an exercise of marke t power Although the potential for withholding exists for many suppliers t he focus of attention has been on the exercise of market power by thermal generators in California On its face the experience of extremely high prices suggests that the exercise of market power could be important But at the same time the data show that there have been profound changes in the California market such th at the thermal generators have actually increased their production more than demand has grown If anything thermal generators that hit annual output limits produced too much rather than too little in the summer of Furthermore the widespread impacts of higher electricity prices throughout the western market both on and off peak indicate that if the exercise of market power is important it is occurring to an extent and through channels unprecedented in this or other electricity markets In short this is a complicated story and there is ample room for further investigation of the data and diagnosis of causes Examination of the major analyses of the exercise of market power reveals that the estimated magnitude of the possible strategic withholding of electric generation is small enough to make it important to verify the simplifying assumptions If strategic withholding were large and pervasive then the real details of the California electricity market could be ignored But it is by now apparent that the evidence is not clear and any finding o f the presence or absence of strategic withholding of generation in the California electricity market could turn on the simplifying assumptions use d in the analysis of the data For example annual limits on production dictate that plants should not run in many hours when prices are higher tha n direct incremental costs hence examinations of output decisions for individual hours or months are necessarily incomplete The variation in re al time conditions is large enough to produce significant reductions in output compared to the expectations given dayahead prices hence with capacity constraints average optimal production is necessarily less than optimal production at average prices Limits on the ramping rate of generation units startup costs minimum load costs and other operational inflexibilities imply that a dispatch day is not just twentyfour separate hours and must be analyzed chronologically recognizing these factors And so on Accounting for such effects can reverse the implications of the previous evidence Unfortunately the real details are neither simple nor incidental It is difficult to conduct a study of market power based solely on publicly available data A fuller analysis would require data available only to the California Independent System Operator and has not been done Many factor s contributed to higher electricity prices in California and the market powe r theme is only at most part of the story The import of the previous analyses is not to prove that market power has been exercised in the California electricity market but rather to suggest that it might be important The import of the sensitivity analysis here is not to prove tha t market power has not been exercised in the electricity market but rather to suggest that it is unlikely to be the dominant factor and may not even b e significant With the available data in the public domain and the special complications introduced by the California market design the margin of err or in estimating the extent of the possible exercise of market power through strategic withholding of electric generation is of the same order of magnitude as the effect being measured On balance to date the publicly available data provides no reason for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to change its conclusion that there is no evidence of strategic withholding nor any proof that no strategic withholding has occurred By contrast there is general agreement that the California electricity market design is seriously flawed Furthermore there is evidence that the policy responses that have been adopted in California have accelerated an already serious market collapse Hence without dismissing the possibility of the exercise of market power the principal policy focus should be on fashioning workable solutions for the other more serious problems in market design that relate to the underlying causes of the market meltdown Separate from market power mitigation California should pay its bills rai se incremental prices to retail customers and move as quickly as possible to operating a coordinated and efficient market with consistent pricing for al l that includes unit commitment dayahead scheduling and realtime balancing Although not a panacea these steps would address immediate problems and set the stage for longerterm initiatives to expand generation capacity transmission infrastructure and the reach of an

nron Subject Hi Rosalee Steve Kean asked that I send you this note for transmittal to Ken Lay Mr Lay may receive a call from David Freeman regarding ongoing power negotiations between the California Department of Water and Enron but it i s not certain that he will call In the event that he does phone we would like to make sure that Mr Lay gets this information prior returning the call Thanks very much for your help All the best Jeff Mr Lay As you know weve been working very hard with David Freeman trying to hamme r out a power deal with CDWR The big issue getting in the way of the deal continues to be credit Ive attached the summary of the credit issues and possible solutions to the problem that was included in the email to Senator Brulte last week As part of the ongoing efforts to resolve the credit issues Chris Calger of the Portland office sent a letter to David Freeman yesterday That letter is also attached In sum the letter expresses our commitment to continue working together to resolve the credit issuesand requests payment for power previously delivered to CDWR and prepayment for any new deliveries In response David Freeman phoned Chris Calger expressing dissappointment that we had yet to sign a power deal with DWR despite your meeting with Dave Freeman and Mike Peevey a couple of weeks ago and we would make a power deal contingent upon a payment for power previously delivered to DWR and b prepayment for any future deliveries Freeman suggested that we could sign the deal for MWs of power now but then back out of the deal if CDWR fails to get adequate credit provisions in place within the next fe w weeks Given the political climate in California we are of course not anxious to sign a deal today that carries significant credit risk and announce later that we are backing out of the deal since doing so would place the Company in a very uncomfortable political position Instead we continue to suggest that its best for all parties to have the credit issue s resolved up front You may receive a call from David Freeman seeking to discuss these issues further As you know the credit issues are significant and we are working hard to overcome those issues But in the current climate where the Governor and the Legislature are actively discussing a complete takeover of the electric industry in California getting the contract issues right is critical Regards Jeff Dasovich SUMMARY OF CREDIT ISSUES FROM BRULTE EMAIL Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in ABX to Purchase Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with suppliers Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th e goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible However ambiguities contained in ABX have created significant credit risk concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms We understand that the lions share of counterparties share Enrons c redit risk concerns Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements going forward Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority The language in ABX is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power From our analysis of the bill the language in ABX appears to leave intact the California PUCs exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California As such suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat es adequate charges to cover DWRs costs of power purchases Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract Prudence The language in ABX leaves open the possibility that the California Public Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are imprudent On the basis of such a finding the CPUC could then ref use to allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power purchases Consequently suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr ee to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that DWR has entered into with suppliers Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to Recover DWRs Costs of Power Purchases In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority noted above the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to the specific ratemaking mechanics that ABX directs the PUC to empl oy to permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs Based on our analysis it i s extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu re DWR recovers its power purchase costs Moreover as currently drafted it is difficult to determine whether ABX would even permit the PUC to include in rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWRs power purchase costs Again this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri sk issues We have identified three options Amend ABX The amendments which are attached to this email would clarify that a the PUC would accept as prudent and reasonable all purchase costs incur red by DWR and b the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary to ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases This is the preferred option though we understand that the there may be some political challenges standing in the way of amending ABX See attached file entitled AmendABXdoc Clarify the Ambiguities in ABX through an Order Issued by the PUC and through Contract Language This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to implement However it is more complicated and could take significantly mo re time to implement than the legislative fix We have attached electronic copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC would need to issue under this option See attached file entitled cpuctalkingpointsdoc Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk As indicated in our letter responding to DWRs RFP we are willing to ac cept other forms of credit from DWR Those options include a letter of credit cash prepayment or an acceptable form of collateral DWR officials have indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options That is DWR prefers to clarify the ambiguities in ABX through a PUC order and through contract amendments LETTER FROM CHRIS CALGER TO DAVID FREEMAN February S David Freeman Advisor to the Governor California Department of Water

market design would indicate a need for changes in the design High prices attributable to higher fuel prices environmental constraints and capacity shortages on the other hand would prompt actions to address the cost of fuel and environmental limitations and indicate that retail loads should receive the appropriate price signal for conservation Suppliers could affect market prices by strategically withholding some capacity in order to profit on the capacity actually sold in the market B ut charging high prices during periods of scarcity is not classified as exercising market power if there is no strategic withholding of supply Likewise refusing to supply without being paid is not an exercise of marke t power Although the potential for withholding exists for many suppliers t he focus of attention has been on the exercise of market power by thermal generators in California On its face the experience of extremely high prices suggests that the exercise of market power could be important But at the same time the data show that there have been profound changes in the California market such th at the thermal generators have actually increased their production more than demand has grown If anything thermal generators that hit annual output limits produced too much rather than too little in the summer of Furthermore the widespread impacts of higher electricity prices throughout the western market both on and off peak indicate that if the exercise of market power is important it is occurring to an extent and through channels unprecedented in this or other electricity markets In short this is a complicated story and there is ample room for further investigation of the data and diagnosis of causes Examination of the major analyses of the exercise of market power reveals that the estimated magnitude of the possible strategic withholding of electric generation is small enough to make it important to verify the simplifying assumptions If strategic withholding were large and pervasive then the real details of the California electricity market could be ignored But it is by now apparent that the evidence is not clear and any finding o f the presence or absence of strategic withholding of generation in the California electricity market could turn on the simplifying assumptions use d in the analysis of the data For example annual limits on production dictate that plants should not run in many hours when prices are higher tha n direct incremental costs hence examinations of output decisions for individual hours or months are necessarily incomplete The variation in re al time conditions is large enough to produce significant reductions in output compared to the expectations given dayahead prices hence with capacity constraints average optimal production is necessarily less than optimal production at average prices Limits on the ramping rate of generation units startup costs minimum load costs and other operational inflexibilities imply that a dispatch day is not just twentyfour separate hours and must be analyzed chronologically recognizing these factors And so on Accounting for such effects can reverse the implications of the previous evidence Unfortunately the real details are neither simple nor incidental It is difficult to conduct a study of market power based solely on publicly available data A fuller analysis would require data available only to the California Independent System Operator and has not been done Many factor s contributed to higher electricity prices in California and the market powe r theme is only at most part of the story The import of the previous analyses is not to prove that market power has been exercised in the California electricity market but rather to suggest that it might be important The import of the sensitivity analysis here is not to prove tha t market power has not been exercised in the electricity market but rather to suggest that it is unlikely to be the dominant factor and may not even b e significant With the available data in the public domain and the special complications introduced by the California market design the margin of err or in estimating the extent of the possible exercise of market power through strategic withholding of electric generation is of the same order of magnitude as the effect being measured On balance to date the publicly available data provides no reason for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to change its conclusion that there is no evidence of strategic withholding nor any proof that no strategic withholding has occurred By contrast there is general agreement that the California electricity market design is seriously flawed Furthermore there is evidence that the policy responses that have been adopted in California have accelerated an already serious market collapse Hence without dismissing the possibility of the exercise of market power the principal policy focus should be on fashioning workable solutions for the other more serious problems in market design that relate to the underlying causes of the market meltdown Separate from market power mitigation California should pay its bills rai se incremental prices to retail customers and move as quickly as possible to operating a coordinated and efficient market with consistent pricing for al l that includes unit commitment dayahead scheduling and realtime balancing Although not a panacea these steps would address immediate problems and set the stage for longerterm initiatives to expand generation capacity transmission infrastructure and the reach of an efficient market to the western interconnected grid William W Hogan John F Kennedy School of Government Harvard University John F Kennedy Street Cambridge MA o f web page wwwwhogancom or peoplewhogan

Richard nron Subject Hi Rosalee Steve Kean asked that I send you this note for transmittal to Ken Lay Mr Lay may receive a call from David Freeman regarding ongoing power negotiations between the California Department of Water and Enron but it i s not certain that he will call In the event that he does phone we would like to make sure that Mr Lay gets this information prior returning the call Thanks very much for your help All the best Jeff Mr Lay As you know weve been working very hard with David Freeman trying to hamme r out a power deal with CDWR The big issue getting in the way of the deal continues to be credit Ive attached the summary of the credit issues and possible solutions to the problem that was included in the email to Senator Brulte last week As part of the ongoing efforts to resolve the credit issues Chris Calger of the Portland office sent a letter to David Freeman yesterday That letter is also attached In sum the letter expresses our commitment to continue working together to resolve the credit issuesand requests payment for power previously delivered to CDWR and prepayment for any new deliveries In response David Freeman phoned Chris Calger expressing dissappointment that we had yet to sign a power deal with DWR despite your meeting with Dave Freeman and Mike Peevey a couple of weeks ago and we would make a power deal contingent upon a payment for power previously delivered to DWR and b prepayment for any future deliveries Freeman suggested that we could sign the deal for MWs of power now but then back out of the deal if CDWR fails to get adequate credit provisions in place within the next fe w weeks Given the political climate in California we are of course not anxious to sign a deal today that carries significant credit risk and announce later that we are backing out of the deal since doing so would place the Company in a very uncomfortable political position Instead we continue to suggest that its best for all parties to have the credit issue s resolved up front You may receive a call from David Freeman seeking to discuss these issues further As you know the credit issues are significant and we are working hard to overcome those issues But in the current climate where the Governor and the Legislature are actively discussing a complete takeover of the electric industry in California getting the contract issues right is critical Regards Jeff Dasovich SUMMARY OF CREDIT ISSUES FROM BRULTE EMAIL Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in ABX to Purchase Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with suppliers Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th e goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible However ambiguities contained in ABX have created significant credit risk concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms We understand that the lions share of counterparties share Enrons c redit risk concerns Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements going forward Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority The language in ABX is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power From our analysis of the bill the language in ABX appears to leave intact the California PUCs exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California As such suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat es adequate charges to cover DWRs costs of power purchases Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract Prudence The language in ABX leaves open the possibility that the California Public Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are imprudent On the basis of such a finding the CPUC could then ref use to allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power purchases Consequently suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr ee to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that DWR has entered into with suppliers Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to Recover DWRs Costs of Power Purchases In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority noted above the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to the specific ratemaking mechanics that ABX directs the PUC to empl oy to permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs Based on our analysis it i s extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu re DWR recovers its power purchase costs Moreover as currently drafted it is difficult to determine whether ABX would even permit the PUC to include in rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWRs power purchase costs Again this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri sk issues We have identified three options Amend ABX The amendments which are attached to this email would clarify that a the PUC would accept as prudent and reasonable all purchase costs incur red by DWR and b the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary to ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases This is the preferred option though we understand that the there may be some political challenges standing in the way of amending ABX See attached file entitled AmendABXdoc Clarify the Ambiguities in ABX through an Order Issued by the PUC and through Contract Language This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to implement However it is more complicated and could take significantly mo re time to implement than the legislative fix We have attached electronic copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC would need to issue under this option See attached file entitled cpuctalkingpointsdoc Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk As indicated in our letter responding to DWRs RFP we are willing to ac cept other forms of credit from DWR Those options include a letter of credit cash prepayment or an acceptable form of collateral DWR officials have indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options That is DWR prefers to clarify the ambiguities in ABX through a PUC order and through contract amendments LETTER FROM CHRIS CALGER TO DAVID FREEMAN February S David Freeman Advisor to the Governor California Department of Water

From Jonathan Lash President ENRON mailtoIMCEANOTESJonathanLashCPresidentCjlashwriEorgE NRONcom Sent Wednesday July AM To Lay Kenneth Subject Climate News from Bonn The climate news from Bonn this week is very good Against the odds and defying expectations nations have agreed to proceed with implementation of the Kyoto Protocol The United States alone refused to participate in this remarkable achievement Two weeks ago every environmentalist I know was gloomy about the prospects for agreement Japan Canada and Australia had expressed grave misgivings about going forward without the US There were rumblings of doubt from several European nations But in Bonn the imperative of taking a first step to protect the global climate proved strong enough to persuade negotiators to step back from entrenched positions Europe agreed to flexibility in the treatment of sinks forests and agricultural soils that absorb CO and trading the ability of a nation that falls short of its target to purchase credits from a nation that exceeds its target Japan Australia and Canada agreed to join With strong leadership from conference chair Jan Pronk the result is a legally binding international agreement that achieves a little less than hoped years ago but much more than nothing If it is all it appears to be it is a profoundly important commitment to take a first step There are two great ironies about the impact of the US withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol The first is that the US criticism of the Protocol and failure to offer any alternative whatsoever helped the rest of the world to reach agreement A very senior Japanese official whom I spoke with expressed frustration and confusion that Japans urgent efforts to stand by the US and open the negotiations to alternatives despite strong popular support for the Kyoto agreement in Japan were met with stony silence What do they want this official asked Do they know US silence foreclosed negotiations and pushed Japan and others toward Europe My colleague Tony LaVina on temporary detail to the Philippine delegation in Bonn reports that US silence meant that there was no US rhetoric attacking developing countries and consequently greater willingness by developing countries to be flexible in their approach to the Protocol And resentment of the US position helped to unify negotiators Francois Bayrou a member of the European Parliament and French presidential candidate told me that support for the Kyoto Protocol and opposition to the US position is one of the most reliable applause lines in speeches he gives all over Europe The second irony is that US isolation will deprive US industries of three things they eagerly sought in any climate agreement Clear and certain rules that enable companies to make rational decisions on energy related investments that will last or more years It remains unclear when the US will enact policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or what those policies will be The ability to purchase credits from other countries The trading system will be set up under the Protocol for countries that are participating The ability to receive credits for investment in measures that reduce emissions in developing countries through the Clean Development Mechanism The CDM too will operate under the Protocol which will be designed by and operated for parties It seems obvious that this will raise the costs and reduce flexibility for the US when we decide to make reductions Even the Wall Street Journal editorial page admitted to harboring a certain fondness for one part of the Kyoto treaty emissions trading An encouraging development in the US Last week I was invited to testify before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee on a bill that would require the US to develop a longterm strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions The first witness was the snowyhaired chairman of the Appropriations Committee and former Majority Leader of the Senate Robert Byrd of West Virginia the author with Senator Stevens of Alaska of the bill under discussion Senator Byrd has been an effective advocate for his state and its coal industry and often an opponent of clean air legislation In with Senator Hagel of Nebraska he authored a resolution calling on the US to reject any agreement that failed to impose mandated emissions reductions on developing countries That resolution has been cited by White House spokespersons as reason for the US to withdraw from the Kyoto process Last week Senator Byrd delivered a powerful statement on the urgency of addressing global climate change saying make no mistake about it global climate change is a reality He said he did not believe his resolution should be used as an excuse for the United States to abandon its shared responsibility to help find a solution to the global climate change dilemma He expressed optimism that the United States is particularly well positioned with the talent the wisdom and the drive to lead efforts to control global warming The US has painted itself into a corner with global consequences The White House appears to have miscalculated the importance of the issue the seriousness of our allies and the capacity of US industry to respond I think that in the next three years with the White House or without it the United States will take action on climate That Wall Street Journal editorial I mentioned urged the Administration to propose an emissions cap and trading system It would be a good startthe sooner the better

what time the event in Cornell begins Rosie Kevin NRON COMMUNICATIONS on AM To Kenneth NRON Jeff NRON cc Rosalee NRON Sherri NRON Carol Ann BrownEnron nron Communications Subject Cornell Ken and Jeff As I think you both know I have been active in recruiting at Cornell for the Enron Associate program for several years now I also recently have become involved with something called the Park Leadership Fellowship Board which provides scholarships and forums to discuss business leadership issues They are holding a pretty prominent event called Leadership week which will include the business heads of Corning and American Express discussing their companys strategies for defining leadership in business today I hate to ask you guys to do things like this but it is a pretty big event and would really highlight Enrons recognition of Cornell as being a Core School in the MBA recruiting process The event as outlined below is scheduled for March th I appreciate your consideration Kevin Forwarded by Kevin HannonEnron Communications on AM AM To Kevin HannonEnron nron Communications cc Subject Kevin Just a quick followup on my November email regarding Enrons participation in the Johnson Schools March Leadership Week and the possibility of doing a case study on Enron Wondered if you have had a chance to float these ideas with Jeff or Ken I know you have lots on you plate Let me know if you have any sense of how this might go Below is the earlier email I sent to you Thanks for the help Hope all is well with you Nov email text We at Cornells Johnson School would like to establish a stronger link with Enron a company which we believe to be a leading example of the agile organization which will dominate in the dynamic unpredictable markets of the next decade One connecting point which we would like Enron to consider is with our Center for Leadership in Dynamic Organizations which draws faculty and students from across Cornell and beyond The specific activities that we propose at this point in time are two First we would like to invite a senior leader from Enron to be a key speaker at the Johnson Schools Leadership Week in March As described in the attached materials Leadership Week is made up of three conferences focused on academic faculty leadingedge corporations and students We very much would like Enron to present what we call a live case study at the corporate conference on underlineMarch underline You of course are an obvious candidate to do this Alternatively this is the kind of event that is made to order for Jeff Skilling or Ken Lay and would give them a chance to interact with other corporate leaders and the Cornell community Other corporate leaders we have signed up for the corporate conference are John Loose President and COO of Corning Ken Chenault incoming CEO of American Express Marty Coyne just announced President of Kodaks new Commercial Group Each of these leaders has a distinct message to deliver about the leadership challenges involved in continually reinventing themselves in a fastchanging marketplace We have several other speakers lined up for other parts of Leadership Week including Ken Blanchard and we think Abbey Cohen from Goldman Sachs We have some chance of getting Bill Ford from Ford Motor Company and an outside shot at Jack Welch through our President Emeritus Frank Rhodes but these are still long shots The point is that this is the biggest thing that will happen at the Johnson School and probably at Cornell next year If Jeff or Ken wanted a platform for telling the Enron story this would be a good one If they cant do it hopefully we could convince you to do it Again the date is March The second proposal is to develop a teaching case on Enron along the same lines In fact if we started working on the teaching case soon it could become the basis for the March conference live case study presentation We believe that Enron is unique in its ability to literally create new markets The question is how do you lead and manage an organization to keep the tight financial and risk controls in place that you do but still create the entrepreneurial behavior that seems to be the case at Enron What kind of management philosophies systems and practices make this possible I know that Enron was the subject of two Harvard cases in and around As I understand it neither focused on organizational and leadership issues We would like to devote a small research team to building this case about Enron directed by myself and Professor Lee Dyer from the ILR School We would need access to a number of people in the Enron organization but are very aware of the demands on time for fast moving organizations and are committed to doing this in a very efficient way Kevin we appreciate your willingness to entertain these two ideas and hopefully test them with your top leaders We will do anything we can to make it feasible for Enron to engage with us on these two initiatives Please let me know what I can do to help you carry this forward As always thanks for your great personal support Dick

this email includes the following An Enron contact to discuss developing smallscale generation on Tribal lan ds Our views on the impediments to distributed generation and suggestions on h ow to remove those impediments A description of the credit issues that continue to impede DWRs ability to sign contracts with power suppliers and options to resolve them Two possible options for addressing the credit issue are a California PUC order clarifying that DWR will recover its power purchase costs through rates and an amendment to ABX designed to accomplish the same goal I have attached talking points regarding the California PUC order and propose d amendments to ABX We believe that an amendment to ABX is the preferable option Our assessment of the supplydemand picture in California Our suggestions for a legislative package designed to solve both the near and longterm electricity crisis in California We will deliver to your office today detailed legislative language In those materials we will als o identify existing bills that we believe can easily accommodate our proposed language I hope that the information is useful Please do not hesitate to contact m e if you would like to discuss these materials further or if there is anythi ng else that I can do to assist you Regards Ken Lay Contact Information to Discuss Interest Expressed by Native American Tribes in Installing Smallscale Generation on Tribal Lands David Parquet VicePresident Enron North America California Street Suite San Francisco CA Phone Fax Key Barriers to Distributed Generation Excessive and Unnecessary Utility Standby Charges Solution The executive orders issued by the Governor on February th took a step in the right direction Utility standby charges have always been designed by the utilities to protect their monopoly position extract monopoly prices from customers or both But there is no reason to limit t he elimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than MW These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for California to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduc e the risk of black outs this summer We would propose lifting the cap by offering amendments to SBX which is designed to facilitate development o f distributed generation Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with investorowned and municipal utilities Solution The Governors executive order regarding interconnection is a step in the right directionDD requires utilities to complete interconnection studies within days California should ensure that this requirement applies to all generation facilities including distributed generation In addition the financial conflicts the utilities face when interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome through executive orders or other regulations To the greatest extent possible California should shift control over interconnection away from th e utility and place that control with the California ISO This could be accomplished through amendments to SB X Permitting and Air Quality Issues Developers of distributed ie onsite generation that is MWs or greater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission an d therefore face all of the impediments to development that largescale generation faces Solution California should ensure that the executive orders D thru D issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant output apply equally to smaller scale distributed generation facil ities In addition distributed generation that is less than MWs continues to face local opposition The State should ensure that local parochial interests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects These objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SBX Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in ABX to Purchase Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with suppliers Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th e goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible However ambiguities contained in ABX have created significant credit risk concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms We understand that the lions share of counterparties share Enrons c redit risk concerns Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements going forward Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority The language in ABX is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power From our analysis of the bill the language in ABX appears to leave intact the California PUCs exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California As such suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat es adequate charges to cover DWRs costs of power purchases Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract Prudence The language in ABX leaves open the possibility that the California Public Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are imprudent On the basis of such a finding the CPUC could then ref use to allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power purchases Consequently suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr ee to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that DWR has entered into with suppliers Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to Recover DWRs Costs of Power Purchases In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority noted above the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to the specific ratemaking mechanics that ABX directs the PUC to empl oy to permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs Based on our analysis it i s extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu re DWR recovers its power purchase costs Moreover as currently drafted it is difficult to determine whether ABX would even permit the PUC to include in rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWRs power purchase costs Again this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri sk issues We have identified three options Amend ABX The amendments which are attached to this email would clarify that a the PUC would accept as prudent and reasonable all purchase costs incur red by DWR and b the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary to ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases This is the preferred option though we understand that the there may be some political challenges standing in the way of amending ABX See attached file entitled AmendABXdoc Clarify the Ambiguities in ABX through an Order Issued by the PUC and through Contract Language This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to implement However it is more complicated and could take significantly mo re time to implement than the legislative fix We have attached electronic copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC would need to issue under this option See attached file entitled cpuctalkingpointsdoc Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk As indicated in our letter responding to DWRs RFP we are willing to ac cept other forms of credit from DWR Those options include a letter of credit cash prepayment or an acceptable form of collateral DWR officials have indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options That is DWR prefers to clarify the ambiguities in ABX through a PUC order and through contract amendments Californias Supplydemand Picture Heading into Summer Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research Associates CERA a private sector energy think tank have issued reports showing that California faces a severe supplydemand imbalance They diffe r only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available Al l credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer of and that unless a solution is found immediately blackouts are likely CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this summer by approximately MW These numbers are in line with our estimates Californias supply base currently has a capacity margin well below the average which is recommended for reliable system operatio n in the West Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power than other regions reserves are particularly important owing to the unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t o date In the event of a low rain and snow period the system must possess t he flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply Californias very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to this requirement Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of include the early drawdown of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage Californias seve re supplydemand gap emissions restrictions on existing plants and a reduced number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the utilities Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren t pace of siting permitting and construction adequate supplies will not be added to correct the market imbalance until at the earliest CERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately hours of rolling black outs this summer The CEC paints a considerably more optimistic scenario betting that California will bring an additional MWs on line to meet peaking summer demand It is our view that California should view the CECs rosy scenario with considerable skepticism Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California s Electricity Crisis This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution We wil l deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals As we have suggested throughout the crisis any solution to Californias crisis must focus on four issues Increase supply Decrease demand Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market Return Californias Investorowned utilities to solvency Increase supplyLegislative vehicle SBX Sher To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately years Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less than a year In California it takes about six years or longer The Governors executive orders and Senator Shers siting reform legi slation are steps in the right direction Our suggested amendments can improve tho se efforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face in securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit requirements included in the CECs certification requirements Enrons proposal seeks to streamline the process for obtaining credits and transfering credits between air districts In addition it creates an innovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund emissions in advance of obtaining certification and permits the affected a ir districts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the required reductions in pollution emissions Decrease demandLegislative Vehicle ABX Wright Because of the delay in getting a solution in place in California closing the supplydemand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer This can be accomplished mo st effectively and quickly in two ways Buydown demand California is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun d to finance DWRs power purchases California could likely reduce demand more economically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou ld be willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period eg through the summer months DWR could easily run an online auction to determine the price it could pay for these demand reductions To participate businesses would be required to have the metering equipment necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the reductions Enron has developed an online auction software package D eal Bench that it would be willing to contribute to the effort Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment To be successful customers need access to the following key elements An internet based hourahead price posting system to track the market price for hourahead power in real time Realtime metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment verification Settlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be paid for load reduction Negawatts The potential benefits of an effective demand response program would includ e creation of additional summer peaking capacity in California parti cularly in the short term without requiring construction of additional generation resources reduction of peak or superpeak load on the overstressed California electric system thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity in the state fostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full ris k of hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to customers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for responding We estimate that we could generate a summer onpeak demand response in excess of MW during certain high cost hours and a demand response for summer onpeak hours that could exceed MW We further estimate that the market response to this program from all ESPs could be to time s that amount We recommend that the State of California provide rebates directly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and control systems that would support load curtailment implementation Establish a truly competitive retail electricity marketLegislative vehi cle SBX The only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego we re customers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy service providers Ironically ABX takes that important option away from customers and businesses It is critical that ABX be amended to remove th e prohibition against Direct Access Enrons legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a direct access transaction while simultaneously addressing the Department o f Water Resources concerns about stranded power costs that might result from customer migration In addition California will only achieve a competitive retail market when the utility is removed completely from the procurement function Procureme nt is not a utility core competency as evidenced by the dire financial condition in which the utilities now find themselves California should therefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement function entirely with the goal of having all customers served by a nonutility provider within months To execute the transition Californ ia should hold a series of competitive solicitations over the month period in which competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments of utility load Return Californias Investorowned utilities to solvencyLegislative vehicle ABX Utility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand In short bankruptcy does nothing to solve Californias supplydemand imbalance In addition bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers and businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having Californ ia State government assume the role of electricity buyer for an extend ed period of time Finally bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidenc e in Californias energy markets and the private sectors willingness to participate in that market California can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a series of staged rate increases California should design those rate increases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without shocking the economy or household budgets For example California c ould amortize the recovery of the utilities past debt over a year perio d In addition the magnitude of the rate increase can be reduced in two ways First the utilities could absorb some portion of their existing debt in recognition of the risk they accepted when they agreed to the structure of AB Second California can net the revenues the utilities have r eceived from selling electricity into the Power Exchange against the debts they hav e accrued due to the retail price cap

Kerstetter in San Mateo Jeff Green in Detroit Marcia Vickers and Pete Engardio in New York and bureau reports Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has guided and presided over the longest economic expansion in the history of the US But now the yearold Greenspan faces an agonizing challenge an abrupt economic slowdown that neither he nor anyone else fully understands All of Greenspa n s training and experience have taught him how to cope with conventional downturns And so far hes dealing with this one in the conventional ma nner by cutting shortterm interest rates in quick but measured steps That may well prove to be the right course But theres a risk that this downturn is different and that far steeper cuts in interest rates are needed to keep th e New Economy from tumbling into a long and painful recession In short Alan Greenspan is feeling the heat of a market in tatters and an economy that by some measures appears to be on the brink And after ridin g triumphantly astride the economic boom times his very legacy is suddenly a t stake ASIA COVER STORY ASIAS BIG CHILL Caught between Japans weakyen policy and the steep US downturn the regions fragile economies may see their recent gains swept away By Brian Bremner in Tokyo with Frederick Balfour in Bangkok Michael Shari in Singapore Moon Ihlwan in Seoul and Pete Engardio in New York The US is clearly worried about Japan falling into a catastrophic slide But Washington may not have a clear view of another huge problem How decisions in Tokyo could undermine the precarious economic state of other Asian nations In South Korea and also in Southeast Asia the exportled recovery of the past two years is starting to slow because of the downturn in the US economy Growth in Korea Thailand Malaysia Singapore and Indonesia is expected to slow this year to between and The last thing these economies need is to compete for a dwindling export market with a Japan now reliant on a weaker yen Many of the economies of East and Southeast Asia are trying to shake off a triple blow The US slowdown is putting a dent in exports Second Japan is yanking investment from the region and now theres the yen threat Finally China is soaking up a growing slice of foreign investment a trend that will accelerate once it enters the World Trade Organization ASIA IS CATCHING THE JAPANESE DISEASE Commentary by Pete Engardio Its a terrible malady for young economies The symptoms banks that ha ve money but dont lend Lots of exports but no profits A teaming workfo rce with dim prospects Politicians who know urgent measures are needed but wh o wont act Call it Japan disease and its starting to set in acr oss the oncebooming emerging markets of East Asia Unfortunately East Asia has not used the nearly four years since its financial meltdown wisely Lulled by a USdriven export boom and a shortlived bounce in equity markets th e region has failed to finish the reforms that could have cleansed their financial system of billions of dollars of nonperforming assets Most of Asia can arrest Japan disease before paralysis sets in But politicians see m to have lost their will to force sales of distressed assets close failed banks and open their markets wider to foreign investors HAS GERMANY JUMPED THE RAILS Germanys stalled reforms are slowing growth By Jack Ewing in Frankfurt with Christine Tierney in Frankfurt and Carol Matlack in Paris Since its last recession ended a decade ago the Germany economy has struggled to get out of first gear Growth averaged a mediocre in the ls Economists business people and politicians thought the sorry performance was a temporary product of West Germanys costly and badly managed reunification with the exCommunist East But what if they are wrong There have been worrying economic indicators including nine months of sinking business confidence an uptick in unemployment and a collapse in car sales Germanys million people account for a third of gross dom estic product among euro countries No regional boom is possible without them Optimists think its slower growth is a temporary effect of economic malaise in the US Japan and other world markets Pessimists think the problems relate to Germanys persistent welfare state its coddled workers maybe even its riskaverse culture Some tough times lie ahead for Germany and for the entire Continent RATES EUROPE NEEDS A LIFTOFF TOO Commentary by David Fairlamb The economy of the nation euro zone is slowing just like its counterpar ts in the US and Asia But dont look to the European Central Bank to fol low the US Federal Reserve with interest rate cuts just yet The monetary conservatives who dominate its member governing council see their role a s fighting inflation rather than stimulating growth So with prices rising at an annualized well above the upper limit the ecb says is consist ent with price stabilitythe central bankers arent in a rush to push the price of money down below the current But there are plenty of reasons why it should A cut now would give the European economy a much needed boost Euro zone growth peaked at only last summer and will likely fall to fo r all of Tax cuts worth of the euro zones gross domestic prod uct have bolstered domestic demand a bit but not enough to make up for the effects of the global slowdown The ECB insists Europe wont be badly hu rt by the economic downturn in the US and East Asia But businesspeople aren t convinced THE WHITE KNIGHT RIDES AGAIN IN ARGENTINA But can Domingo Cavallo cure what ails the economy By Colin Barraclough in Buenos Aires with bureau reports On Mar Argentines awoke to the news that the yearold Harvard Universitytrained economist who rescued their country from hyperinflation more than a decade ago was back in his old job Cavallo is the third man to hold the post of Economy Minister in as many weeks To win the support of opposition politicians Cavallo must take a different tack than Lpez Murph y Cavallo has already abandoned his predecessors plan to push through draconian spending cuts Instead he aims to narrow Argentinas fiscal deficit by billion this year by rekindling growth thereby boosting tax collection Possible measures include cuts in some corporate tax rates to promote the reinvestment of profits and a reduction in banks reserve requirements which would free up money for loans WHOS

and a group of holding companies and a fund connected to Handelsbanken a Stockholm ban k maintaining an iron grip with a minimal amount of capital They do so by holding Ericsson A shares which have votes more than the B shares of which foreign shareholders have a majority Now that Ericsson is struggli ng in global markets a quick turnaround is needed The current twotier stoc k system should be

will effectively drive the overnight cal l rate back down to zero and pump up the money supply to push the consumer price index up Markets are now abuzz with speculation that Japan will deliberately ramp up inflation past and that Hayami is a convert to the cause of fast reflation But Hayami has not given up on the other part of h is agenda to press for real restructuring inside the banks and corporations So Hayami is signaling that he will ease up on his hardmoney ways in exchange for some real action by the banks While we are doing our part we hope the government and the financial system

The event that did t he damage a sting operation by an online magazine which caught leading politicians and military officials on camera accepting bribes in connection with what they thought were

game The pot an economic rebound in the second half At its second policy meeting of the Fed lowered its benchmark federal funds rate by a halfpoint to eschewing Wall Streets clamor for a supersize cut of threequarters of a point In effect the Fed made it clear that it will not follow the stock markets timetable for policy decisions The Feds action implicitly says that economic conditions did not justify a larger more radical move Investors were so focused on the idea that size matters that they completely ignored the meetings most obvious positive The Fed left ope n the door for more

thank Mr Lay for agreeing to take part in both our IEA ministerial session and in the OECD Forum Sustainable Development and the New Economy As discussed he is to chair the first of two energy panels at the FORUM his is titled Fuelling Sustainable Development On his panel will be Mr Kurt Yeager of EPRI speaking on hydrocarbon issues Mr Luis Echavarri the head of the OECDs Nuclear Energy Agency speaking on nuclear power and Danish Minister of Energy and Environment Svend Auken speaking on renewables and energy efficiency The panel is scheduled to take place starting at pm at the Cit des Sciences et de lIndustrie in La Villete in northern Paris As I believe I noted in our previous email communications while the IEA is responsible for organising our ministerial session and the substantive issues related to the energy panels on the FORUM the OECD is doing the FORUM logistics They have therefore asked that I forward to all speakers the following note see below It asks that Mr Lay provide a number of logistical inputs including a biography and photo as well as information on any remarks he might choose to make I note that as the chair of the first energy panel he may not wish to make a formal presentation but time does permit this if he wishes and the decision is at his discretion I would appreciate being a cc on any material you send to the OECD so we can keep our files current On our own side the IEA concluded its Governing Board Meeting last Friday and finally approved the ministerial session agenda and arrangements While Mr Priddle will be sending out a formal invitation and set of background documents to Mr Lay this week I wanted to give you a heads up and find out if you had any lastminute questions which I might help answer In addition I note that your last email indicated Mrs Lay will be in Paris during our session Some of our ministerial representatives are also planning to bring spouses in particular US Energy Secretary Abraham who is coming with his wife do you think Mrs Lay might wish to participate in any events during this period with any of these others If you let us know we would be happy to make arrangements Also please let us know

meet today at the Enron Teaching Excellence Awards It was an indeed an honor and a privilege to finally speak to you in person Ironically when I returned to the office today I received your interoffice mail concerning the below email I certainly understand that you will not be able to attend many events as I am sure that your schedule is quite demanding I believe that this group will benefit substantially by knowing that you are aware that it exists and want to support it Is it possible to send a brief email to UH alumni at Enron letting them know as such If the alumni see that you support our efforts they will take an increased interest in participating and provide us a solid foundation with which to work Please provide me any feedback you may have As we talked about today we would like to begin having occasional brown bags in an effort to get the alumni better acquainted with the university I believe that we should have one with Dr Smith to promote the image campaign changes at the university the tier status etc If you could make it that would be great but if not that is OK as well I will send you the date when I have it Chet Gladchuk has agreed to work with us to orchestrate a tailgate party on Sept th to welcome Dana Dimel in his first home football game We will have a tent food refreshments football tickets etc I suspect that it will be from approx PM to PM Please let me know if your calendar is free I am truly excited to have you as alumni and am grateful for your approachability Please let me stress that I do not expect you to make all or even most of our events I would just like to let you know what we are doing and if you find that you are free we would love to have you Thank you for your time Jeff Forwarded by Jeffrey McClellanHOUECT on PM Jeffrey McClellan PM To Kenneth NRON cc Subject Cougars Enron Mr Lay My name is Jeff McClellan and I am President of the Cougars Enron We are a group of Enron employees that are UH alumni that have banded together to form a chartered extension of the Houston Alumni Organization We had our kickoff event in the th floor dining room on March th of this year and have received substantial interest in our organization I wanted to drop you a line to tell you not only about us but also what we are doing As of today we have employees that have expressed interest in contributing to our groups success We have several stated objectives Network Enron Cougars together to build strong working relationships This will benefit the employees as well as the company Raise and present scholarships to Enron dependents to attend the University of Houston This will help to ease education costs Assist the company in its recruiting efforts concerning the university Assist the university through financial gifts whenever possible Currently here is what we have planned The HAO has given us their hall at Frontier Fiesta Frontier Fiesta is a festival thrown by the students and alumni that provides good family fun The HAO is having it catered and everyone is invited We are throwing a tailgate party to celebrate Dana Dimels first home football game against Army We are working with Chet Gladchuk to set up a tent have it catered listen to a live band football tickets etc We would like to make this event open to all of Enron if possible The university will provide Enron special recognition on both the Cougar Vision Scoreboard and over the PA in both the first and second half of the contest These are the confirmed events so far as we are still in the opening stages We anticipate to have more events planned golf tournament which I would like the opportunity to share with you This group is designed to cater to its members the company and the university and I believe it is going to be one of the most successful out there To achieve such a plateau however we need to be a continuous draw to old and new alumni alike To have you as an alumni is truly a monumental draw to our employees and the university Would you consider making several appearances with us at our events Your participation would greatly increase our exposure and ability to accomplish our goals and we would love the chance to honor you as one of our most distinguished alumni If there are any suggestions that you may have as to how to further our group I would love to hear them I understand that you are extremely busy and I do not wish to monopolize your time but this alumni charter is something that I truly believe in and I hope you will agree that it has great potential With you support we can attain a level of success that will set us aside from any other group Thank you for your time Jeff

Andrew Subject High Availability Server Evaluation Results We first want to express our appreciation to both HP and Compaq for their efforts in helping make our evaluation project a sucess This did not surprise us as you have both been strong partners with us up to now As we indicated at the beginning this evaluation was specifically aimed at how well each vendor performed at helping us install develop test and engineer an effective Oracle HA solution The ability to work with our Intuit team and the strength of the vendors support were critical factors Certainly the difficultly of data migration impacted this project limited our performance testing and remains of great concern to us in considering any migration in the future We are taking the opportunity to provide you with our honest evaluation in the hopes that this information may be of value to you We do however consider this information confidential and ask that you do not share it outside of your organization In addition we are providing it with the understanding that you will not use the details contained herein to criticize each other in an effort to promote your own position Here is a summary of our evaluation Sun Clusters unacceptable lacking features and EMC disk support SunVeritas Clusters acceptable but uncertain support and future HP Clusters very good strong features strong product roadmap very good technical support marginal sales support variable support during evaluation Compaq very good stronger features strong product roadmap outstanding support higher risk It should be understood that there has not been a final decision and management has not approved a migration plan We recommended Compaq provided that we would be able to reduce the risk factor associated with the recent release of their current software and hardware architectures Management has requested that some further analysis be done which were not in the scope of this project including costbenefit analysis from our customers viewpoint and conversion cost estimates We believe we have all the vendor information necessary to complete this analysis though they may be a few pricing issues that will need clarification We will be in contact with each vendor regarding the disposition of the loaned equipment we have on site from each vendor We again thank you for your efforts You will both remain key partners of Intuit in the forseeable future and we hope to see our relationship whatever the final determination by management concerning this project to continue to improve Richard Marino Lance Bell

what time the event in Cornell begins Rosie Kevin NRON COMMUNICATIONS on AM To Kenneth NRON Jeff NRON cc Rosalee NRON Sherri NRON Carol Ann BrownEnron nron Communications Subject Cornell Ken and Jeff As I think you both know I have been active in recruiting at Cornell for the Enron Associate program for several years now I also recently have become involved with something called the Park Leadership Fellowship Board which provides scholarships and forums to discuss business leadership issues They are holding a pretty prominent event called Leadership week which will include the business heads of Corning and American Express discussing their companys strategies for defining leadership in business today I hate to ask you guys to do things like this but it is a pretty big event and would really highlight Enrons recognition of Cornell as being a Core School in the MBA recruiting process The event as outlined below is scheduled for March th I appreciate your consideration Kevin Forwarded by Kevin HannonEnron Communications on AM AM To Kevin HannonEnron nron Communications cc Subject Kevin Just a quick followup on my November email regarding Enrons participation in the Johnson Schools March Leadership Week and the possibility of doing a case study on Enron Wondered if you have had a chance to float these ideas with Jeff or Ken I know you have lots on you plate Let me know if you have any sense of how this might go Below is the earlier email I sent to you Thanks for the help Hope all is well with you Nov email text We at Cornells Johnson School would like to establish a stronger link with Enron a company which we believe to be a leading example of the agile organization which will dominate in the dynamic unpredictable markets of the next decade One connecting point which we would like Enron to consider is with our Center for Leadership in Dynamic Organizations which draws faculty and students from across Cornell and beyond The specific activities that we propose at this point in time are two First we would like to invite a senior leader from Enron to be a key speaker at the Johnson Schools Leadership Week in March As described in the attached materials Leadership Week is made up of three conferences focused on academic faculty leadingedge corporations and students We very much would like Enron to present what we call a live case study at the corporate conference on underlineMarch underline You of course are an obvious candidate to do this Alternatively this is the kind of event that is made to order for Jeff Skilling or Ken Lay and would give them a chance to interact with other corporate leaders and the Cornell community Other corporate leaders we have signed up for the corporate conference are John Loose President and COO of Corning Ken Chenault incoming CEO of American Express Marty Coyne just announced President of Kodaks new Commercial Group Each of these leaders has a distinct message to deliver about the leadership challenges involved in continually reinventing themselves in a fastchanging marketplace We have several other speakers lined up for other parts of Leadership Week including Ken Blanchard and we think Abbey Cohen from Goldman Sachs We have some chance of getting Bill Ford from Ford Motor Company and an outside shot at Jack Welch through our President Emeritus Frank Rhodes but these are still long shots The point is that this is the biggest thing that will happen at the Johnson School and probably at Cornell next year If Jeff or Ken wanted a platform for telling the Enron story this would be a good one If they cant do it hopefully we could convince you to do it Again the date is March The second proposal is to develop a teaching case on Enron along the same lines In fact if we started working on the teaching case soon it could become the basis for the March conference live case study presentation We believe that Enron is unique in its ability to literally create new markets The question is how do you lead and manage an organization to keep the tight financial and risk controls in place that you do but still create the entrepreneurial behavior that seems to be the case at Enron What kind of management philosophies systems and practices make this possible I know that Enron was the subject of two Harvard cases in and around As I understand it neither focused on organizational and leadership issues We would like to devote a small research team to building this case about Enron directed by myself and Professor Lee Dyer from the ILR School We would need access to a number of people in the Enron organization but are very aware of the demands on time for fast moving organizations and are committed to doing this in a very efficient way Kevin we appreciate your willingness to entertain these two ideas and hopefully test them with your top leaders We will do anything we can to make it feasible for Enron to engage with us on these two initiatives Please let me know what I can do to help you carry this forward As always thanks for your great personal support Dick

this email includes the following An Enron contact to discuss developing smallscale generation on Tribal lan ds Our views on the impediments to distributed generation and suggestions on h ow to remove those impediments A description of the credit issues that continue to impede DWRs ability to sign contracts with power suppliers and options to resolve them Two possible options for addressing the credit issue are a California PUC order clarifying that DWR will recover its power purchase costs through rates and an amendment to ABX designed to accomplish the same goal I have attached talking points regarding the California PUC order and propose d amendments to ABX We believe that an amendment to ABX is the preferable option Our assessment of the supplydemand picture in California Our suggestions for a legislative package designed to solve both the near and longterm electricity crisis in California We will deliver to your office today detailed legislative language In those materials we will als o identify existing bills that we believe can easily accommodate our proposed language I hope that the information is useful Please do not hesitate to contact m e if you would like to discuss these materials further or if there is anythi ng else that I can do to assist you Regards Ken Lay Contact Information to Discuss Interest Expressed by Native American Tribes in Installing Smallscale Generation on Tribal Lands David Parquet VicePresident Enron North America California Street Suite San Francisco CA Phone Fax Key Barriers to Distributed Generation Excessive and Unnecessary Utility Standby Charges Solution The executive orders issued by the Governor on February th took a step in the right direction Utility standby charges have always been designed by the utilities to protect their monopoly position extract monopoly prices from customers or both But there is no reason to limit t he elimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than MW These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for California to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduc e the risk of black outs this summer We would propose lifting the cap by offering amendments to SBX which is designed to facilitate development o f distributed generation Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with investorowned and municipal utilities Solution The Governors executive order regarding interconnection is a step in the right directionDD requires utilities to complete interconnection studies within days California should ensure that this requirement applies to all generation facilities including distributed generation In addition the financial conflicts the utilities face when interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome through executive orders or other regulations To the greatest extent possible California should shift control over interconnection away from th e utility and place that control with the California ISO This could be accomplished through amendments to SB X Permitting and Air Quality Issues Developers of distributed ie onsite generation that is MWs or greater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission an d therefore face all of the impediments to development that largescale generation faces Solution California should ensure that the executive orders D thru D issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant output apply equally to smaller scale distributed generation facil ities In addition distributed generation that is less than MWs continues to face local opposition The State should ensure that local parochial interests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects These objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SBX Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in ABX to Purchase Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with suppliers Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th e goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible However ambiguities contained in ABX have created significant credit risk concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms We understand that the lions share of counterparties share Enrons c redit risk concerns Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements going forward Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority The language in ABX is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power From our analysis of the bill the language in ABX appears to leave intact the California PUCs exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California As such suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat es adequate charges to cover DWRs costs of power purchases Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract Prudence The language in ABX leaves open the possibility that the California Public Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are imprudent On the basis of such a finding the CPUC could then ref use to allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power purchases Consequently suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr ee to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that DWR has entered into with suppliers Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to Recover DWRs Costs of Power Purchases In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority noted above the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to the specific ratemaking mechanics that ABX directs the PUC to empl oy to permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs Based on our analysis it i s extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu re DWR recovers its power purchase costs Moreover as currently drafted it is difficult to determine whether ABX would even permit the PUC to include in rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWRs power purchase costs Again this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri sk issues We have identified three options Amend ABX The amendments which are attached to this email would clarify that a the PUC would accept as prudent and reasonable all purchase costs incur red by DWR and b the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary to ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases This is the preferred option though we understand that the there may be some political challenges standing in the way of amending ABX See attached file entitled AmendABXdoc Clarify the Ambiguities in ABX through an Order Issued by the PUC and through Contract Language This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to implement However it is more complicated and could take significantly mo re time to implement than the legislative fix We have attached electronic copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC would need to issue under this option See attached file entitled cpuctalkingpointsdoc Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk As indicated in our letter responding to DWRs RFP we are willing to ac cept other forms of credit from DWR Those options include a letter of credit cash prepayment or an acceptable form of collateral DWR officials have indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options That is DWR prefers to clarify the ambiguities in ABX through a PUC order and through contract amendments Californias Supplydemand Picture Heading into Summer Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research Associates CERA a private sector energy think tank have issued reports showing that California faces a severe supplydemand imbalance They diffe r only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available Al l credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer of and that unless a solution is found immediately blackouts are likely CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this summer by approximately MW These numbers are in line with our estimates Californias supply base currently has a capacity margin well below the average which is recommended for reliable system operatio n in the West Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power than other regions reserves are particularly important owing to the unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t o date In the event of a low rain and snow period the system must possess t he flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply Californias very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to this requirement Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of include the early drawdown of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage Californias seve re supplydemand gap emissions restrictions on existing plants and a reduced number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the utilities Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren t pace of siting permitting and construction adequate supplies will not be added to correct the market imbalance until at the earliest CERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately hours of rolling black outs this summer The CEC paints a considerably more optimistic scenario betting that California will bring an additional MWs on line to meet peaking summer demand It is our view that California should view the CECs rosy scenario with considerable skepticism Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California s Electricity Crisis This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution We wil l deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals As we have suggested throughout the crisis any solution to Californias crisis must focus on four issues Increase supply Decrease demand Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market Return Californias Investorowned utilities to solvency Increase supplyLegislative vehicle SBX Sher To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately years Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less than a year In California it takes about six years or longer The Governors executive orders and Senator Shers siting reform legi slation are steps in the right direction Our suggested amendments can improve tho se efforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face in securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit requirements included in the CECs certification requirements Enrons proposal seeks to streamline the process for obtaining credits and transfering credits between air districts In addition it creates an innovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund emissions in advance of obtaining certification and permits the affected a ir districts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the required reductions in pollution emissions Decrease demandLegislative Vehicle ABX Wright Because of the delay in getting a solution in place in California closing the supplydemand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer This can be accomplished mo st effectively and quickly in two ways Buydown demand California is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun d to finance DWRs power purchases California could likely reduce demand more economically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou ld be willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period eg through the summer months DWR could easily run an online auction to determine the price it could pay for these demand reductions To participate businesses would be required to have the metering equipment necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the reductions Enron has developed an online auction software package D eal Bench that it would be willing to contribute to the effort Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment To be successful customers need access to the following key elements An internet based hourahead price posting system to track the market price for hourahead power in real time Realtime metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment verification Settlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be paid for load reduction Negawatts The potential benefits of an effective demand response program would includ e creation of additional summer peaking capacity in California parti cularly in the short term without requiring construction of additional generation resources reduction of peak or superpeak load on the overstressed California electric system thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity in the state fostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full ris k of hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to customers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for responding We estimate that we could generate a summer onpeak demand response in excess of MW during certain high cost hours and a demand response for summer onpeak hours that could exceed MW We further estimate that the market response to this program from all ESPs could be to time s that amount We recommend that the State of California provide rebates directly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and control systems that would support load curtailment implementation Establish a truly competitive retail electricity marketLegislative vehi cle SBX The only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego we re customers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy service providers Ironically ABX takes that important option away from customers and businesses It is critical that ABX be amended to remove th e prohibition against Direct Access Enrons legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a direct access transaction while simultaneously addressing the Department o f Water Resources concerns about stranded power costs that might result from customer migration In addition California will only achieve a competitive retail market when the utility is removed completely from the procurement function Procureme nt is not a utility core competency as evidenced by the dire financial condition in which the utilities now find themselves California should therefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement function entirely with the goal of having all customers served by a nonutility provider within months To execute the transition Californ ia should hold a series of competitive solicitations over the month period in which competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments of utility load Return Californias Investorowned utilities to solvencyLegislative vehicle ABX Utility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand In short bankruptcy does nothing to solve Californias supplydemand imbalance In addition bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers and businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having Californ ia State government assume the role of electricity buyer for an extend ed period of time Finally bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidenc e in Californias energy markets and the private sectors willingness to participate in that market California can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a series of staged rate increases California should design those rate increases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without shocking the economy or household budgets For example California c ould amortize the recovery of the utilities past debt over a year perio d In addition the magnitude of the rate increase can be reduced in two ways First the utilities could absorb some portion of their existing debt in recognition of the risk they accepted when they agreed to the structure of AB Second California can net the revenues the utilities have r eceived from selling electricity into the Power Exchange against the debts they hav e accrued due to the retail price cap

Kerstetter in San Mateo Jeff Green in Detroit Marcia Vickers and Pete Engardio in New York and bureau reports Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has guided and presided over the longest economic expansion in the history of the US But now the yearold Greenspan faces an agonizing challenge an abrupt economic slowdown that neither he nor anyone else fully understands All of Greenspa n s training and experience have taught him how to cope with conventional downturns And so far hes dealing with this one in the conventional ma nner by cutting shortterm interest rates in quick but measured steps That may well prove to be the right course But theres a risk that this downturn is different and that far steeper cuts in interest rates are needed to keep th e New Economy from tumbling into a long and painful recession In short Alan Greenspan is feeling the heat of a market in tatters and an economy that by some measures appears to be on the brink And after ridin g triumphantly astride the economic boom times his very legacy is suddenly a t stake ASIA COVER STORY ASIAS BIG CHILL Caught between Japans weakyen policy and the steep US downturn the regions fragile economies may see their recent gains swept away By Brian Bremner in Tokyo with Frederick Balfour in Bangkok Michael Shari in Singapore Moon Ihlwan in Seoul and Pete Engardio in New York The US is clearly worried about Japan falling into a catastrophic slide But Washington may not have a clear view of another huge problem How decisions in Tokyo could undermine the precarious economic state of other Asian nations In South Korea and also in Southeast Asia the exportled recovery of the past two years is starting to slow because of the downturn in the US economy Growth in Korea Thailand Malaysia Singapore and Indonesia is expected to slow this year to between and The last thing these economies need is to compete for a dwindling export market with a Japan now reliant on a weaker yen Many of the economies of East and Southeast Asia are trying to shake off a triple blow The US slowdown is putting a dent in exports Second Japan is yanking investment from the region and now theres the yen threat Finally China is soaking up a growing slice of foreign investment a trend that will accelerate once it enters the World Trade Organization ASIA IS CATCHING THE JAPANESE DISEASE Commentary by Pete Engardio Its a terrible malady for young economies The symptoms banks that ha ve money but dont lend Lots of exports but no profits A teaming workfo rce with dim prospects Politicians who know urgent measures are needed but wh o wont act Call it Japan disease and its starting to set in acr oss the oncebooming emerging markets of East Asia Unfortunately East Asia has not used the nearly four years since its financial meltdown wisely Lulled by a USdriven export boom and a shortlived bounce in equity markets th e region has failed to finish the reforms that could have cleansed their financial system of billions of dollars of nonperforming assets Most of Asia can arrest Japan disease before paralysis sets in But politicians see m to have lost their will to force sales of distressed assets close failed banks and open their markets wider to foreign investors HAS GERMANY JUMPED THE RAILS Germanys stalled reforms are slowing growth By Jack Ewing in Frankfurt with Christine Tierney in Frankfurt and Carol Matlack in Paris Since its last recession ended a decade ago the Germany economy has struggled to get out of first gear Growth averaged a mediocre in the ls Economists business people and politicians thought the sorry performance was a temporary product of West Germanys costly and badly managed reunification with the exCommunist East But what if they are wrong There have been worrying economic indicators including nine months of sinking business confidence an uptick in unemployment and a collapse in car sales Germanys million people account for a third of gross dom estic product among euro countries No regional boom is possible without them Optimists think its slower growth is a temporary effect of economic malaise in the US Japan and other world markets Pessimists think the problems relate to Germanys persistent welfare state its coddled workers maybe even its riskaverse culture Some tough times lie ahead for Germany and for the entire Continent RATES EUROPE NEEDS A LIFTOFF TOO Commentary by David Fairlamb The economy of the nation euro zone is slowing just like its counterpar ts in the US and Asia But dont look to the European Central Bank to fol low the US Federal Reserve with interest rate cuts just yet The monetary conservatives who dominate its member governing council see their role a s fighting inflation rather than stimulating growth So with prices rising at an annualized well above the upper limit the ecb says is consist ent with price stabilitythe central bankers arent in a rush to push the price of money down below the current But there are plenty of reasons why it should A cut now would give the European economy a much needed boost Euro zone growth peaked at only last summer and will likely fall to fo r all of Tax cuts worth of the euro zones gross domestic prod uct have bolstered domestic demand a bit but not enough to make up for the effects of the global slowdown The ECB insists Europe wont be badly hu rt by the economic downturn in the US and East Asia But businesspeople aren t convinced THE WHITE KNIGHT RIDES AGAIN IN ARGENTINA But can Domingo Cavallo cure what ails the economy By Colin Barraclough in Buenos Aires with bureau reports On Mar Argentines awoke to the news that the yearold Harvard Universitytrained economist who rescued their country from hyperinflation more than a decade ago was back in his old job Cavallo is the third man to hold the post of Economy Minister in as many weeks To win the support of opposition politicians Cavallo must take a different tack than Lpez Murph y Cavallo has already abandoned his predecessors plan to push through draconian spending cuts Instead he aims to narrow Argentinas fiscal deficit by billion this year by rekindling growth thereby boosting tax collection Possible measures include cuts in some corporate tax rates to promote the reinvestment of profits and a reduction in banks reserve requirements which would free up money for loans WHOS KILLING ERICSSON ITS OWNERS Shareholders have no say under its ownership system By Stanley Reed in London with Ariane Sains in Stockholm Swedens Ericsson has just two main owners the Wallenberg family and a group of holding companies and a fund connected to Handelsbanken a Stockholm ban k maintaining an iron grip with a minimal amount of capital They do so by holding Ericsson A shares which have votes more than the B shares of which foreign shareholders have a majority Now that Ericsson is struggli ng in global markets a quick turnaround is needed The current twotier stoc k system should be reviewed THE BANK OF JAPANS REAL MESSAGE REFORM NOW Commentary by Brian Bremner in Tokyo On Mar Bank of Japan Governor Masaru Hayami appeared to abruptly rever se course by announcing measures that will effectively drive the overnight cal l rate back down to zero and pump up the money supply to push the consumer price index up Markets are now abuzz with speculation that Japan will deliberately ramp up inflation past and that Hayami is a convert to the cause of fast reflation But Hayami has not given up on the other part of h is agenda to press for real restructuring inside the banks and corporations So Hayami is signaling that he will ease up on his hardmoney ways in exchange for some real action by the banks While we are doing our part we hope the government and the financial system will do whats necessary on their si de says Deputy BOJ Governor Yutaka Yamaguchi in an interview with BusinessWeek RUMBLE OVER TOKYO As Airbus aggressively pitches its superjumbo Boeing moves to

Heidi Dawley in London and Stan Crock in Washington Its another Balkans mess and it could prove to be a dangerous test for President George W Bush and the NATO troops stationed in Kosovo After six days of fighting between insurgents and Macedonian forces near th e city of Tetovo from Mar NATO officials announced plans to bolster patrols on the Kosovo border with Macedonia Both European and US diplomats hope Macedonian forces will subdue the rebels But if the fightin g keeps up pressure will grow on NATO to play a more active role That could involve a controversial decision to send NATO troops to combat rebels in Macedonia Washington however wants to avoid an escalation Still strangely NATO troops could find themselves increasingly under fire from t he very people they were sent to

The event that did t he damage a sting operation by an online magazine which caught leading politicians and military officials on camera accepting bribes in connection with what they thought were military contracts Defense Minister George Fernandes has since quit along with the head of the Bharatiya Janata Party Raucous opposition legislators closed Parliament for six days insisting th at the government step down The administration should be embarrassed But it would be a huge mistake for the opposition to initiate a new era of politic al turmoil The principal casualty would be much needed reform Yet India desperately needs to get its house in order Last year it took in only billion in foreign direct investment Most important are the proposed reforms of the labor laws which for the first time would permit companies with fewer than employees to hire and fire without government permission Freed from these restrictions business owners could invest in promising new ventures instead of wallowing in sunset industries So inste ad of seeking to stall change the opposition would do well to embrace it BusinessWeek presents ebiz Live Europe June The Hilton Hotel Park Lane London For

expensive for developing countries It is ti me to reexamine how the intellectual property rights regime works There are many issues to be addressed Is there a way to better codify the space for

Andrew Subject High Availability Server Evaluation Results We first want to express our appreciation to both HP and Compaq for their efforts in helping make our evaluation project a sucess This did not surprise us as you have both been strong partners with us up to now As we indicated at the beginning this evaluation was specifically aimed at how well each vendor performed at helping us install develop test and engineer an effective Oracle HA solution The ability to work with our Intuit team and the strength of the vendors support were critical factors Certainly the difficultly of data migration impacted this project limited our performance testing and remains of great concern to us in considering any migration in the future We are taking the opportunity to provide you with our honest evaluation in the hopes that this information may be of value to you We do however consider this information confidential and ask that you do not share it outside of your organization In addition we are providing it with the understanding that you will not use the details contained herein to criticize each other in an effort to promote your own position Here is a summary of our evaluation Sun Clusters unacceptable lacking features and EMC disk support SunVeritas Clusters acceptable but uncertain support and future HP Clusters very good strong features strong product roadmap very good technical support marginal sales support variable support during evaluation Compaq very good stronger features strong product roadmap outstanding support higher risk It should be understood that there has not been a final decision and management has not approved a migration plan We recommended Compaq provided that we would be able to reduce the risk factor associated with the recent release of their current software and hardware architectures Management has requested that some further analysis be done which were not in the scope of this project including costbenefit analysis from our customers viewpoint and conversion cost estimates We believe we have all the vendor information necessary to complete this analysis though they may be a few pricing issues that will need clarification We will be in contact with each vendor regarding the disposition of the loaned equipment we have on site from each vendor We again thank you for your efforts You will both remain key partners of Intuit in the forseeable future and we hope to see our relationship whatever the final determination by management concerning this project to continue to improve Richard Marino Lance Bell

thank Mr Lay for agreeing to take part in both our IEA ministerial session and in the OECD Forum Sustainable Development and the New Economy As discussed he is to chair the first of two energy panels at the FORUM his is titled Fuelling Sustainable Development On his panel will be Mr Kurt Yeager of EPRI speaking on hydrocarbon issues Mr Luis Echavarri the head of the OECDs Nuclear Energy Agency speaking on nuclear power and Danish Minister of Energy and Environment Svend Auken speaking on renewables and energy efficiency The panel is scheduled to take place starting at pm at the Cit des Sciences et de lIndustrie in La Villete in northern Paris As I believe I noted in our previous email communications while the IEA is responsible for organising our ministerial session and the substantive issues related to the energy panels on the FORUM the OECD is doing the FORUM logistics They have therefore asked that I forward to all speakers the following note see below It asks that Mr Lay provide a number of logistical inputs including a biography and photo as well as information on any remarks he might choose to make I note that as the chair of the first energy panel he may not wish to make a formal presentation but time does permit this if he wishes and the decision is at his discretion I would appreciate being a cc on any material you send to the OECD so we can keep our files current On our own side the IEA concluded its Governing Board Meeting last Friday and finally approved the ministerial session agenda and arrangements While Mr Priddle will be sending out a formal invitation and set of background documents to Mr Lay this week I wanted to give you a heads up and find out if you had any lastminute questions which I might help answer In addition I note that your last email indicated Mrs Lay will be in Paris during our session Some of our ministerial representatives are also planning to bring spouses in particular US Energy Secretary Abraham who is coming with his wife do you think Mrs Lay might wish to participate in any events during this period with any of these others If you let us know we would be happy to make arrangements Also please let us know

like him to say and then he can make changes to it as he wishes That would really be helpful Thanks Rosalee Jeffrey CT PM To Kenneth NRON cc Subject Cougars Enron Ken Thank you for the opportunity to meet today at the Enron Teaching Excellence Awards It was an indeed an honor and a privilege to finally speak to you in person Ironically when I returned to the office today I received your interoffice mail concerning the below email I certainly understand that you will not be able to attend many events as I am sure that your schedule is quite demanding I believe that this group will benefit substantially by knowing that you are aware that it exists and want to support it Is it possible to send a brief email to UH alumni at Enron letting them know as such If the alumni see that you support our efforts they will take an increased interest in participating and provide us a solid foundation with which to work Please provide me any feedback you may have As we talked about today we would like to begin having occasional brown bags in an effort to get the alumni better acquainted with the university I believe that we should have one with Dr Smith to promote the image campaign changes at the university the tier status etc If you could make it that would be great but if not that is OK as well I will send you the date when I have it Chet Gladchuk has agreed to work with us to orchestrate a tailgate party on Sept th to welcome Dana Dimel in his first home football game We will have a tent food refreshments football tickets etc I suspect that it will be from approx PM to PM Please let me know if your calendar is free I am truly excited to have you as alumni and am grateful for your approachability Please let me stress that I do not expect you to make all or even most of our events I would just like to let you know what we are doing and if you find that you are free we would love to have you Thank you for your time Jeff Forwarded by Jeffrey McClellanHOUECT on PM Jeffrey McClellan PM To Kenneth NRON cc Subject Cougars Enron Mr Lay My name is Jeff McClellan and I am President of the Cougars Enron We are a group of Enron employees that are UH alumni that have banded together to form a chartered extension of the Houston Alumni Organization We had our kickoff event in the th floor dining room on March th of this year and have received substantial interest in our organization I wanted to drop you a line to tell you not only about us but also what we are doing As of today we have employees that have expressed interest in contributing to our groups success We have several stated objectives Network Enron Cougars together to build strong working relationships This will benefit the employees as well as the company Raise and present scholarships to Enron dependents to attend the University of Houston This will help to ease education costs Assist the company in its recruiting efforts concerning the university Assist the university through financial gifts whenever possible Currently here is what we have planned The HAO has given us their hall at Frontier Fiesta Frontier Fiesta is a festival thrown by the students and alumni that provides good family fun The HAO is having it catered and everyone is invited We are throwing a tailgate party to celebrate Dana Dimels first home football game against Army We are working with Chet Gladchuk to set up a tent have it catered listen to a live band football tickets etc We would like to make this event open to all of Enron if possible The university will provide Enron special recognition on both the Cougar Vision Scoreboard and over the PA in both the first and second half of the contest These are the confirmed events so far as we are still in the opening stages We anticipate to have more events planned golf tournament which I would like the opportunity to share with you This group is designed to cater to its members the company and the university and I believe it is going to be one of the most successful out there To achieve such a plateau however we need to be a continuous draw to old and new alumni alike To have you as an alumni is truly a monumental draw to our employees and the university Would you consider making several appearances with us at our events Your participation would greatly increase our exposure and ability to accomplish our goals and we would love the chance to honor you as one of our most distinguished alumni If there are any suggestions that you may have as to how to further our group I would love to hear them I understand that you are extremely busy and I do not wish to monopolize your time but this alumni charter is something that I truly believe in and I hope you will agree that it has great potential With you support we can attain a level of success that will set us aside from any other group Thank you for your time Jeff

what time the event in Cornell begins Rosie Kevin NRON COMMUNICATIONS on AM To Kenneth NRON Jeff NRON cc Rosalee NRON Sherri NRON Carol Ann BrownEnron nron Communications Subject Cornell Ken and Jeff As I think you both know I have been active in recruiting at Cornell for the Enron Associate program for several years now I also recently have become involved with something called the Park Leadership Fellowship Board which provides scholarships and forums to discuss business leadership issues They are holding a pretty prominent event called Leadership week which will include the business heads of Corning and American Express discussing their companys strategies for defining leadership in business today I hate to ask you guys to do things like this but it is a pretty big event and would really highlight Enrons recognition of Cornell as being a Core School in the MBA recruiting process The event as outlined below is scheduled for March th I appreciate your consideration Kevin Forwarded by Kevin HannonEnron Communications on AM AM To Kevin HannonEnron nron Communications cc Subject Kevin Just a quick followup on my November email regarding Enrons participation in the Johnson Schools March Leadership Week and the possibility of doing a case study on Enron Wondered if you have had a chance to float these ideas with Jeff or Ken I know you have lots on you plate Let me know if you have any sense of how this might go Below is the earlier email I sent to you Thanks for the help Hope all is well with you Nov email text We at Cornells Johnson School would like to establish a stronger link with Enron a company which we believe to be a leading example of the agile organization which will dominate in the dynamic unpredictable markets of the next decade One connecting point which we would like Enron to consider is with our Center for Leadership in Dynamic Organizations which draws faculty and students from across Cornell and beyond The specific activities that we propose at this point in time are two First we would like to invite a senior leader from Enron to be a key speaker at the Johnson Schools Leadership Week in March As described in the attached materials Leadership Week is made up of three conferences focused on academic faculty leadingedge corporations and students We very much would like Enron to present what we call a live case study at the corporate conference on underlineMarch underline You of course are an obvious candidate to do this Alternatively this is the kind of event that is made to order for Jeff Skilling or Ken Lay and would give them a chance to interact with other corporate leaders and the Cornell community Other corporate leaders we have signed up for the corporate conference are John Loose President and COO of Corning Ken Chenault incoming CEO of American Express Marty Coyne just announced President of Kodaks new Commercial Group Each of these leaders has a distinct message to deliver about the leadership challenges involved in continually reinventing themselves in a fastchanging marketplace We have several other speakers lined up for other parts of Leadership Week including Ken Blanchard and we think Abbey Cohen from Goldman Sachs We have some chance of getting Bill Ford from Ford Motor Company and an outside shot at Jack Welch through our President Emeritus Frank Rhodes but these are still long shots The point is that this is the biggest thing that will happen at the Johnson School and probably at Cornell next year If Jeff or Ken wanted a platform for telling the Enron story this would be a good one If they cant do it hopefully we could convince you to do it Again the date is March The second proposal is to develop a teaching case on Enron along the same lines In fact if we started working on the teaching case soon it could become the basis for the March conference live case study presentation We believe that Enron is unique in its ability to literally create new markets The question is how do you lead and manage an organization to keep the tight financial and risk controls in place that you do but still create the entrepreneurial behavior that seems to be the case at Enron What kind of management philosophies systems and practices make this possible I know that Enron was the subject of two Harvard cases in and around As I understand it neither focused on organizational and leadership issues We would like to devote a small research team to building this case about Enron directed by myself and Professor Lee Dyer from the ILR School We would need access to a number of people in the Enron organization but are very aware of the demands on time for fast moving organizations and are committed to doing this in a very efficient way Kevin we appreciate your willingness to entertain these two ideas and hopefully test them with your top leaders We will do anything we can to make it feasible for Enron to engage with us on these two initiatives Please let me know what I can do to help you carry this forward As always thanks for your great personal support Dick

this email includes the following An Enron contact to discuss developing smallscale generation on Tribal lan ds Our views on the impediments to distributed generation and suggestions on h ow to remove those impediments A description of the credit issues that continue to impede DWRs ability to sign contracts with power suppliers and options to resolve them Two possible options for addressing the credit issue are a California PUC order clarifying that DWR will recover its power purchase costs through rates and an amendment to ABX designed to accomplish the same goal I have attached talking points regarding the California PUC order and propose d amendments to ABX We believe that an amendment to ABX is the preferable option Our assessment of the supplydemand picture in California Our suggestions for a legislative package designed to solve both the near and longterm electricity crisis in California We will deliver to your office today detailed legislative language In those materials we will als o identify existing bills that we believe can easily accommodate our proposed language I hope that the information is useful Please do not hesitate to contact m e if you would like to discuss these materials further or if there is anythi ng else that I can do to assist you Regards Ken Lay Contact Information to Discuss Interest Expressed by Native American Tribes in Installing Smallscale Generation on Tribal Lands David Parquet VicePresident Enron North America California Street Suite San Francisco CA Phone Fax Key Barriers to Distributed Generation Excessive and Unnecessary Utility Standby Charges Solution The executive orders issued by the Governor on February th took a step in the right direction Utility standby charges have always been designed by the utilities to protect their monopoly position extract monopoly prices from customers or both But there is no reason to limit t he elimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than MW These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for California to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduc e the risk of black outs this summer We would propose lifting the cap by offering amendments to SBX which is designed to facilitate development o f distributed generation Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with investorowned and municipal utilities Solution The Governors executive order regarding interconnection is a step in the right directionDD requires utilities to complete interconnection studies within days California should ensure that this requirement applies to all generation facilities including distributed generation In addition the financial conflicts the utilities face when interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome through executive orders or other regulations To the greatest extent possible California should shift control over interconnection away from th e utility and place that control with the California ISO This could be accomplished through amendments to SB X Permitting and Air Quality Issues Developers of distributed ie onsite generation that is MWs or greater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission an d therefore face all of the impediments to development that largescale generation faces Solution California should ensure that the executive orders D thru D issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant output apply equally to smaller scale distributed generation facil ities In addition distributed generation that is less than MWs continues to face local opposition The State should ensure that local parochial interests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects These objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SBX Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in ABX to Purchase Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with suppliers Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th e goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible However ambiguities contained in ABX have created significant credit risk concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms We understand that the lions share of counterparties share Enrons c redit risk concerns Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements going forward Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority The language in ABX is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power From our analysis of the bill the language in ABX appears to leave intact the California PUCs exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California As such suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat es adequate charges to cover DWRs costs of power purchases Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract Prudence The language in ABX leaves open the possibility that the California Public Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are imprudent On the basis of such a finding the CPUC could then ref use to allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power purchases Consequently suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr ee to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that DWR has entered into with suppliers Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to Recover DWRs Costs of Power Purchases In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority noted above the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to the specific ratemaking mechanics that ABX directs the PUC to empl oy to permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs Based on our analysis it i s extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu re DWR recovers its power purchase costs Moreover as currently drafted it is difficult to determine whether ABX would even permit the PUC to include in rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWRs power purchase costs Again this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri sk issues We have identified three options Amend ABX The amendments which are attached to this email would clarify that a the PUC would accept as prudent and reasonable all purchase costs incur red by DWR and b the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary to ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases This is the preferred option though we understand that the there may be some political challenges standing in the way of amending ABX See attached file entitled AmendABXdoc Clarify the Ambiguities in ABX through an Order Issued by the PUC and through Contract Language This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to implement However it is more complicated and could take significantly mo re time to implement than the legislative fix We have attached electronic copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC would need to issue under this option See attached file entitled cpuctalkingpointsdoc Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk As indicated in our letter responding to DWRs RFP we are willing to ac cept other forms of credit from DWR Those options include a letter of credit cash prepayment or an acceptable form of collateral DWR officials have indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options That is DWR prefers to clarify the ambiguities in ABX through a PUC order and through contract amendments Californias Supplydemand Picture Heading into Summer Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research Associates CERA a private sector energy think tank have issued reports showing that California faces a severe supplydemand imbalance They diffe r only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available Al l credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer of and that unless a solution is found immediately blackouts are likely CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this summer by approximately MW These numbers are in line with our estimates Californias supply base currently has a capacity margin well below the average which is recommended for reliable system operatio n in the West Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power than other regions reserves are particularly important owing to the unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t o date In the event of a low rain and snow period the system must possess t he flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply Californias very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to this requirement Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of include the early drawdown of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage Californias seve re supplydemand gap emissions restrictions on existing plants and a reduced number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the utilities Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren t pace of siting permitting and construction adequate supplies will not be added to correct the market imbalance until at the earliest CERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately hours of rolling black outs this summer The CEC paints a considerably more optimistic scenario betting that California will bring an additional MWs on line to meet peaking summer demand It is our view that California should view the CECs rosy scenario with considerable skepticism Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California s Electricity Crisis This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution We wil l deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals As we have suggested throughout the crisis any solution to Californias crisis must focus on four issues Increase supply Decrease demand Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market Return Californias Investorowned utilities to solvency Increase supplyLegislative vehicle SBX Sher To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately years Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less than a year In California it takes about six years or longer The Governors executive orders and Senator Shers siting reform legi slation are steps in the right direction Our suggested amendments can improve tho se efforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face in securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit requirements included in the CECs certification requirements Enrons proposal seeks to streamline the process for obtaining credits and transfering credits between air districts In addition it creates an innovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund emissions in advance of obtaining certification and permits the affected a ir districts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the required reductions in pollution emissions Decrease demandLegislative Vehicle ABX Wright Because of the delay in getting a solution in place in California closing the supplydemand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer This can be accomplished mo st effectively and quickly in two ways Buydown demand California is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun d to finance DWRs power purchases California could likely reduce demand more economically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou ld be willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period eg through the summer months DWR could easily run an online auction to determine the price it could pay for these demand reductions To participate businesses would be required to have the metering equipment necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the reductions Enron has developed an online auction software package D eal Bench that it would be willing to contribute to the effort Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment To be successful customers need access to the following key elements An internet based hourahead price posting system to track the market price for hourahead power in real time Realtime metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment verification Settlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be paid for load reduction Negawatts The potential benefits of an effective demand response program would includ e creation of additional summer peaking capacity in California parti cularly in the short term without requiring construction of additional generation resources reduction of peak or superpeak load on the overstressed California electric system thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity in the state fostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full ris k of hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to customers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for responding We estimate that we could generate a summer onpeak demand response in excess of MW during certain high cost hours and a demand response for summer onpeak hours that could exceed MW We further estimate that the market response to this program from all ESPs could be to time s that amount We recommend that the State of California provide rebates directly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and control systems that would support load curtailment implementation Establish a truly competitive retail electricity marketLegislative vehi cle SBX The only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego we re customers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy service providers Ironically ABX takes that important option away from customers and businesses It is critical that ABX be amended to remove th e prohibition against Direct Access Enrons legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a direct access transaction while simultaneously addressing the Department o f Water Resources concerns about stranded power costs that might result from customer migration In addition California will only achieve a competitive retail market when the utility is removed completely from the procurement function Procureme nt is not a utility core competency as evidenced by the dire financial condition in which the utilities now find themselves California should therefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement function entirely with the goal of having all customers served by a nonutility provider within months To execute the transition Californ ia should hold a series of competitive solicitations over the month period in which competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments of utility load Return Californias Investorowned utilities to solvencyLegislative vehicle ABX Utility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand In short bankruptcy does nothing to solve Californias supplydemand imbalance In addition bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers and businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having Californ ia State government assume the role of electricity buyer for an extend ed period of time Finally bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidenc e in Californias energy markets and the private sectors willingness to participate in that market California can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a series of staged rate increases California should design those rate increases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without shocking the economy or household budgets For example California c ould amortize the recovery of the utilities past debt over a year perio d In addition the magnitude of the rate increase can be reduced in two ways First the utilities could absorb some portion of their existing debt in recognition of the risk they accepted when they agreed to the structure of AB Second California can net the revenues the utilities have r eceived from selling electricity into the Power Exchange against the debts they hav e accrued due to the retail price cap

Andrew Subject High Availability Server Evaluation Results We first want to express our appreciation to both HP and Compaq for their efforts in helping make our evaluation project a sucess This did not surprise us as you have both been strong partners with us up to now As we indicated at the beginning this evaluation was specifically aimed at how well each vendor performed at helping us install develop test and engineer an effective Oracle HA solution The ability to work with our Intuit team and the strength of the vendors support were critical factors Certainly the difficultly of data migration impacted this project limited our performance testing and remains of great concern to us in considering any migration in the future We are taking the opportunity to provide you with our honest evaluation in the hopes that this information may be of value to you We do however consider this information confidential and ask that you do not share it outside of your organization In addition we are providing it with the understanding that you will not use the details contained herein to criticize each other in an effort to promote your own position Here is a summary of our evaluation Sun Clusters unacceptable lacking features and EMC disk support SunVeritas Clusters acceptable but uncertain support and future HP Clusters very good strong features strong product roadmap very good technical support marginal sales support variable support during evaluation Compaq very good stronger features strong product roadmap outstanding support higher risk It should be understood that there has not been a final decision and management has not approved a migration plan We recommended Compaq provided that we would be able to reduce the risk factor associated with the recent release of their current software and hardware architectures Management has requested that some further analysis be done which were not in the scope of this project including costbenefit analysis from our customers viewpoint and conversion cost estimates We believe we have all the vendor information necessary to complete this analysis though they may be a few pricing issues that will need clarification We will be in contact with each vendor regarding the disposition of the loaned equipment we have on site from each vendor We again thank you for your efforts You will both remain key partners of Intuit in the forseeable future and we hope to see our relationship whatever the final determination by management concerning this project to continue to improve Richard Marino Lance Bell

meet today at the Enron Teaching Excellence Awards It was an indeed an honor and a privilege to finally speak to you in person Ironically when I returned to the office today I received your interoffice mail concerning the below email I certainly understand that you will not be able to attend many events as I am sure that your schedule is quite demanding I believe that this group will benefit substantially by knowing that you are aware that it exists and want to support it Is it possible to send a brief email to UH alumni at Enron letting them know as such If the alumni see that you support our efforts they will take an increased interest in participating and provide us a solid foundation with which to work Please provide me any feedback you may have As we talked about today we would like to begin having occasional brown bags in an effort to get the alumni better acquainted with the university I believe that we should have one with Dr Smith to promote the image campaign changes at the university the tier status etc If you could make it that would be great but if not that is OK as well I will send you the date when I have it Chet Gladchuk has agreed to work with us to orchestrate a tailgate party on Sept th to welcome Dana Dimel in his first home football game We will have a tent food refreshments football tickets etc I suspect that it will be from approx PM to PM Please let me know if your calendar is free I am truly excited to have you as alumni and am grateful for your approachability Please let me stress that I do not expect you to make all or even most of our events I would just like to let you know what we are doing and if you find that you are free we would love to have you Thank you for your time Jeff Forwarded by Jeffrey McClellanHOUECT on PM Jeffrey McClellan PM To Kenneth NRON cc Subject Cougars Enron Mr Lay My name is Jeff McClellan and I am President of the Cougars Enron We are a group of Enron employees that are UH alumni that have banded together to form a chartered extension of the Houston Alumni Organization We had our kickoff event in the th floor dining room on March th of this year and have received substantial interest in our organization I wanted to drop you a line to tell you not only about us but also what we are doing As of today we have employees that have expressed interest in contributing to our groups success We have several stated objectives Network Enron Cougars together to build strong working relationships This will benefit the employees as well as the company Raise and present scholarships to Enron dependents to attend the University of Houston This will help to ease education costs Assist the company in its recruiting efforts concerning the university Assist the university through financial gifts whenever possible Currently here is what we have planned The HAO has given us their hall at Frontier Fiesta Frontier Fiesta is a festival thrown by the students and alumni that provides good family fun The HAO is having it catered and everyone is invited We are throwing a tailgate party to celebrate Dana Dimels first home football game against Army We are working with Chet Gladchuk to set up a tent have it catered listen to a live band football tickets etc We would like to make this event open to all of Enron if possible The university will provide Enron special recognition on both the Cougar Vision Scoreboard and over the PA in both the first and second half of the contest These are the confirmed events so far as we are still in the opening stages We anticipate to have more events planned golf tournament which I would like the opportunity to share with you This group is designed to cater to its members the company and the university and I believe it is going to be one of the most successful out there To achieve such a plateau however we need to be a continuous draw to old and new alumni alike To have you as an alumni is truly a monumental draw to our employees and the university Would you consider making several appearances with us at our events Your participation would greatly increase our exposure and ability to accomplish our goals and we would love the chance to honor you as one of our most distinguished alumni If there are any suggestions that you may have as to how to further our group I would love to hear them I understand that you are extremely busy and I do not wish to monopolize your time but this alumni charter is something that I truly believe in and I hope you will agree that it has great potential With you support we can attain a level of success that will set us aside from any other group Thank you for your time Jeff

thank Mr Lay for agreeing to take part in both our IEA ministerial session and in the OECD Forum Sustainable Development and the New Economy As discussed he is to chair the first of two energy panels at the FORUM his is titled Fuelling Sustainable Development On his panel will be Mr Kurt Yeager of EPRI speaking on hydrocarbon issues Mr Luis Echavarri the head of the OECDs Nuclear Energy Agency speaking on nuclear power and Danish Minister of Energy and Environment Svend Auken speaking on renewables and energy efficiency The panel is scheduled to take place starting at pm at the Cit des Sciences et de lIndustrie in La Villete in northern Paris As I believe I noted in our previous email communications while the IEA is responsible for organising our ministerial session and the substantive issues related to the energy panels on the FORUM the OECD is doing the FORUM logistics They have therefore asked that I forward to all speakers the following note see below It asks that Mr Lay provide a number of logistical inputs including a biography and photo as well as information on any remarks he might choose to make I note that as the chair of the first energy panel he may not wish to make a formal presentation but time does permit this if he wishes and the decision is at his discretion I would appreciate being a cc on any material you send to the OECD so we can keep our files current On our own side the IEA concluded its Governing Board Meeting last Friday and finally approved the ministerial session agenda and arrangements While Mr Priddle will be sending out a formal invitation and set of background documents to Mr Lay this week I wanted to give you a heads up and find out if you had any lastminute questions which I might help answer In addition I note that your last email indicated Mrs Lay will be in Paris during our session Some of our ministerial representatives are also planning to bring spouses in particular US Energy Secretary Abraham who is coming with his wife do you think Mrs Lay might wish to participate in any events during this period with any of these others If you let us know we would be happy to make arrangements Also please let us know

for buildings transportation and industry could account for more than half of the potential greenhouse gas reductions achievable by Natural gas technologies more efficient power plant technologies and combined heat an d power play an important role in reducing fossil energy power plant emissions And lowcarbon energy systems such as renewable energy can also make an important contribution Perhaps

the opportunities for costeffective energy efficiency investment identified in energy models and the levels actually seen in practice according to SPRU a science and technology policy research group in England The origins of the gap are claimed to lie in a series of barriers such as lack of capital lack of information or hidden costs which prevent markets for energy and energyusing technologies from operating efficiently SPRU says that understanding the size and nature of this gap is essential if policies to mitigate climate change through improved energy efficiency are to be successful

<13908375.1075840295370.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,rosalee.fleming@enron.com,2001-02-16 10:07:00,Information from Ken Lay at EnronIt was a pleasure speaking with you on Wednesday Based on our conversatio n this email includes the following An Enron contact to discuss developing smallscale generation on Tribal lan ds Our views on the impediments to distributed generation and suggestions on h ow to remove those impediments A description of the credit issues that continue to impede DWRs ability to sign contracts with power suppliers and options to resolve them Two possible options for addressing the credit issue are a California PUC order clarifying that DWR will recover its power purchase costs through rates and an amendment to ABX designed to accomplish the same goal I have attached talking points regarding the California PUC order and propose d amendments to ABX We believe that an amendment to ABX is the preferable option Our assessment of the supplydemand picture in California Our suggestions for a legislative package designed to solve both the near and longterm electricity crisis in California We will deliver to your office today detailed legislative language In those materials we will als o identify existing bills that we believe can easily accommodate our proposed language I hope that the information is useful Please do not hesitate to contact m e if you would like to discuss these materials further or if there is anythi ng else that I can do to assist you Regards Ken Lay Contact Information to Discuss Interest Expressed by Native American Tribes in Installing Smallscale Generation on Tribal Lands David Parquet VicePresident Enron North America California Street Suite San Francisco CA Phone Fax Key Barriers to Distributed Generation Excessive and Unnecessary Utility Standby Charges Solution The executive orders issued by the Governor on February th took a step in the right direction Utility standby charges have always been designed by the utilities to protect their monopoly position extract monopoly prices from customers or both But there is no reason to limit t he elimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than MW These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for California to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduc e the risk of black outs this summer We would propose lifting the cap by offering amendments to SBX which is designed to facilitate development o f distributed generation Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with investorowned and municipal utilities Solution The Governors executive order regarding interconnection is a step in the right directionDD requires utilities to complete interconnection studies within days California should ensure that this requirement applies to all generation facilities including distributed generation In addition the financial conflicts the utilities face when interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome through executive orders or other regulations To the greatest extent possible California should shift control over interconnection away from th e utility and place that control with the California ISO This could be accomplished through amendments to SB X Permitting and Air Quality Issues Developers of distributed ie onsite generation that is MWs or greater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission an d therefore face all of the impediments to development that largescale generation faces Solution California should ensure that the executive orders D thru D issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant output apply equally to smaller scale distributed generation facil ities In addition distributed generation that is less than MWs continues to face local opposition The State should ensure that local parochial interests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects These objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SBX Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in ABX to Purchase Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with suppliers Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th e goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible However ambiguities contained in ABX have created significant credit risk concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms We understand that the lions share of counterparties share Enrons c redit risk concerns Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements going forward Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority The language in ABX is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power From our analysis of the bill the language in ABX appears to leave intact the California PUCs exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California As such suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat es adequate charges to cover DWRs costs of power purchases Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract Prudence The language in ABX leaves open the possibility that the California Public Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are imprudent On the basis of such a finding the CPUC could then ref use to allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power purchases Consequently suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr ee to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that DWR has entered into with suppliers Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to Recover DWRs Costs of Power Purchases In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority noted above the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to the specific ratemaking mechanics that ABX directs the PUC to empl oy to permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs Based on our analysis it i s extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu re DWR recovers its power purchase costs Moreover as currently drafted it is difficult to determine whether ABX would even permit the PUC to include in rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWRs power purchase costs Again this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri sk issues We have identified three options Amend ABX The amendments which are attached to this email would clarify that a the PUC would accept as prudent and reasonable all purchase costs incur red by DWR and b the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary to ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases This is the preferred option though we understand that the there may be some political challenges standing in the way of amending ABX See attached file entitled AmendABXdoc Clarify the Ambiguities in ABX through an Order Issued by the PUC and through Contract Language This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to implement However it is more complicated and could take significantly mo re time to implement than the legislative fix We have attached electronic copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC would need to issue under this option See attached file entitled cpuctalkingpointsdoc Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk As indicated in our letter responding to DWRs RFP we are willing to ac cept other forms of credit from DWR Those options include a letter of credit cash prepayment or an acceptable form of collateral DWR officials have indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options That is DWR prefers to clarify the ambiguities in ABX through a PUC order and through contract amendments Californias Supplydemand Picture Heading into Summer Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research Associates CERA a private sector energy think tank have issued reports showing that California faces a severe supplydemand imbalance They diffe r only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available Al l credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer of and that unless a solution is found immediately blackouts are likely CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this summer by approximately MW These numbers are in line with our estimates Californias supply base currently has a capacity margin well below the average which is recommended for reliable system operatio n in the West Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power than other regions reserves are particularly important owing to the unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t o date In the event of a low rain and snow period the system must possess t he flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply Californias very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to this requirement Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of include the early drawdown of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage Californias seve re supplydemand gap emissions restrictions on existing plants and a reduced number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the utilities Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren t pace of siting permitting and construction adequate supplies will not be added to correct the market imbalance until at the earliest CERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately hours of rolling black outs this summer The CEC paints a considerably more optimistic scenario betting that California will bring an additional MWs on line to meet peaking summer demand It is our view that California should view the CECs rosy scenario with considerable skepticism Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California s Electricity Crisis This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution We wil l deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals As we have suggested throughout the crisis any solution to Californias crisis must focus on four issues Increase supply Decrease demand Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market Return Californias Investorowned utilities to solvency Increase supplyLegislative vehicle SBX Sher To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately years Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less than a year In California it takes about six years or longer The Governors executive orders and Senator Shers siting reform legi slation are steps in the right direction Our suggested amendments can improve tho se efforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face in securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit requirements included in the CECs certification requirements Enrons proposal seeks to streamline the process for obtaining credits and transfering credits between air districts In addition it creates an innovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund emissions in advance of obtaining certification and permits the affected a ir districts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the required reductions in pollution emissions Decrease demandLegislative Vehicle ABX Wright Because of the delay in getting a solution in place in California closing the supplydemand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer This can be accomplished mo st effectively and quickly in two ways Buydown demand California is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun d to finance DWRs power purchases California could likely reduce demand more economically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou ld be willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period eg through the summer months DWR could easily run an online auction to determine the price it could pay for these demand reductions To participate businesses would be required to have the metering equipment necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the reductions Enron has developed an online auction software package D eal Bench that it would be willing to contribute to the effort Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment To be successful customers need access to the following key elements An internet based hourahead price posting system to track the market price for hourahead power in real time Realtime metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment verification Settlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be paid for load reduction Negawatts The potential benefits of an effective demand response program would includ e creation of additional summer peaking capacity in California parti cularly in the short term without requiring construction of additional generation resources reduction of peak or superpeak load on the overstressed California electric system thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity in the state fostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full ris k of hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to customers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for responding We estimate that we could generate a summer onpeak demand response in excess of MW during certain high cost hours and a demand response for summer onpeak hours that could exceed MW We further estimate that the market response to this program from all ESPs could be to time s that amount We recommend that the State of California provide rebates directly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and control systems that would support load curtailment implementation Establish a truly competitive retail electricity marketLegislative vehi cle SBX The only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego we re customers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy service providers Ironically ABX takes that important option away from customers and businesses It is critical that ABX be amended to remove th e prohibition against Direct Access Enrons legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a direct access transaction while simultaneously addressing the Department o f Water Resources concerns about stranded power costs that might result from customer migration In addition California will only achieve a competitive retail market when the utility is removed completely from the procurement function Procureme nt is not a utility core competency as evidenced by the dire financial condition in which the utilities now find themselves California should therefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement function entirely with the goal of having all customers served by a nonutility provider within months To execute the transition Californ ia should hold a series of competitive solicitations over the month period in which competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments of utility load Return Californias Investorowned utilities to solvencyLegislative vehicle ABX Utility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand In short bankruptcy does nothing to solve Californias supplydemand imbalance In addition bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers and businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having Californ ia State government assume the role of electricity buyer for an extend ed period of time Finally bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidenc e in Californias energy markets and the private sectors willingness to participate in that market California can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a series of staged rate increases California should design those rate increases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without shocking the economy or household budgets For example California c ould amortize the recovery of the utilities past debt over a year perio d In addition the magnitude of the rate increase can be reduced in two ways First the utilities could absorb some portion of their existing debt in recognition of the risk they accepted when they agreed to the structure of AB Second California can net the revenues the utilities have r eceived from selling electricity into the Power Exchange against the debts they hav e accrued due to the retail price cap

time the event in Cornell begins Rosie Kevin NRON COMMUNICATIONS on AM To Kenneth NRON Jeff NRON cc Rosalee NRON Sherri NRON Carol Ann BrownEnron nron Communications Subject Cornell Ken and Jeff As I think you both know I have been active in recruiting at Cornell for the Enron Associate program for several years now I also recently have become involved with something called the Park Leadership Fellowship Board which provides scholarships and forums to discuss business leadership issues They are holding a pretty prominent event called Leadership week which will include the business heads of Corning and American Express discussing their companys strategies for defining leadership in business today I hate to ask you guys to do things like this but it is a pretty big event and would really highlight Enrons recognition of Cornell as being a Core School in the MBA recruiting process The event as outlined below is scheduled for March th I appreciate your consideration Kevin Forwarded by Kevin HannonEnron Communications on AM AM To Kevin HannonEnron nron Communications cc Subject Kevin Just a quick followup on my November email regarding Enrons participation in the Johnson Schools March Leadership Week and the possibility of doing a case study on Enron Wondered if you have had a chance to float these ideas with Jeff or Ken I know you have lots on you plate Let me know if you have any sense of how this might go Below is the earlier email I sent to you Thanks for the help Hope all is well with you Nov email text We at Cornells Johnson School would like to establish a stronger link with Enron a company which we believe to be a leading example of the agile organization which will dominate in the dynamic unpredictable markets of the next decade One connecting point which we would like Enron to consider is with our Center for Leadership in Dynamic Organizations which draws faculty and students from across Cornell and beyond The specific activities that we propose at this point in time are two First we would like to invite a senior leader from Enron to be a key speaker at the Johnson Schools Leadership Week in March As described in the attached materials Leadership Week is made up of three conferences focused on academic faculty leadingedge corporations and students We very much would like Enron to present what we call a live case study at the corporate conference on underlineMarch underline You of course are an obvious candidate to do this Alternatively this is the kind of event that is made to order for Jeff Skilling or Ken Lay and would give them a chance to interact with other corporate leaders and the Cornell community Other corporate leaders we have signed up for the corporate conference are John Loose President and COO of Corning Ken Chenault incoming CEO of American Express Marty Coyne just announced President of Kodaks new Commercial Group Each of these leaders has a distinct message to deliver about the leadership challenges involved in continually reinventing themselves in a fastchanging marketplace We have several other speakers lined up for other parts of Leadership Week including Ken Blanchard and we think Abbey Cohen from Goldman Sachs We have some chance of getting Bill Ford from Ford Motor Company and an outside shot at Jack Welch through our President Emeritus Frank Rhodes but these are still long shots The point is that this is the biggest thing that will happen at the Johnson School and probably at Cornell next year If Jeff or Ken wanted a platform for telling the Enron story this would be a good one If they cant do it hopefully we could convince you to do it Again the date is March The second proposal is to develop a teaching case on Enron along the same lines In fact if we started working on the teaching case soon it could become the basis for the March conference live case study presentation We believe that Enron is unique in its ability to literally create new markets The question is how do you lead and manage an organization to keep the tight financial and risk controls in place that you do but still create the entrepreneurial behavior that seems to be the case at Enron What kind of management philosophies systems and practices make this possible I know that Enron was the subject of two Harvard cases in and around As I understand it neither focused on organizational and leadership issues We would like to devote a small research team to building this case about Enron directed by myself and Professor Lee Dyer from the ILR School We would need access to a number of people in the Enron organization but are very aware of the demands on time for fast moving organizations and are committed to doing this in a very efficient way Kevin we appreciate your
