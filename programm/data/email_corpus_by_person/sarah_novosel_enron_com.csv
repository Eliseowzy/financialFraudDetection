Vactor column Dan and Sarah I dont know if you see Sam VanVactors materials or not If not here is a shot from the th Richard Copyright Economic Insight Inc EDITORIAL SA VAN VACTOR Energy Crisis Myths Mythology has always been an important part of the human experience and never more so than when hard choices must be made Thus it should come as no surprise that our current energy crisis is accompanied by a seemingly endless array of apologies exaggerations and myths Far and away the most common myth concerns the persistent view of many that suppliers are holding back generation in order to jack up prices Similar charges were levied during the oil crises of the s In those days critics complained that tankers could be seen just off the coast waiting until prices rose Holding back on electricity sales makes even less sense because once a moment of demand has passed it is gone forever No rational supplier will turn down the price offers persisting in the present marketplace day after day Indeed most suppliers are laboring to squeeze out every electron possible from aging and unreliable generators An equally common error arises when the crisis is blamed on deregulation and free markets Although California was the first state to adopt widescale consumer choice its market has been heavily regulated and constrained For example after nearly three years of consumer choice in the retail market only of the total volume is served by entities other than traditional utilities The volume of direct access has actually declined in recent months as buyers have scrambled to reconnect to regulated utilities that offer frozen rates More importantly the development of reliable forward markets and planning was stillborn because the California Public Utility Commission either prohibited or limited such trading at the same time that it granted automatic prudency to spot purchases Deregulation may have changed the nature of the crisis from a physical to a financial problem but the demand and supply fundamentals at the heart of the current energy crises were inherited from an earlier era of regulatory stumbles Officials in neighboring states are eager to blame California for the crisis but nothing could be further from the truth The Western power market is fully interconnected by design and if one part is short all regions are short In fact every operating area recognized that demand would occasionally exceed supply planners simply relied on the proposition that it would not happen simultaneously in all regions of the West However this is exactly what has happened The current crisis was precipitated by a scarcity of natural gas unexpected demand growth in California and the Southwest the second hottest summer on record in the Southwest and low water runs in Northern California and the Pacific Northwest If these myths are at odds with reality how should the energy crisis be viewed Famine and pestilence are normally reserved for biblical parables but they do play a role in this story The Western power market is tied to the vast generation potential of the regions hydroelectric system The systems potential is not however always available Unlike hydro systems in Quebec and Brazil the Columbia River system has only three months worth of water storage Quebec is said to have ten years of water inventory The difference between a drought and a year flush with water can be as high as average megawatts per hour roughly the capacity of six of the Wests nuclear generating stations Thus the availability of electricity swings from abundance to scarcity in an unpredictable pattern based on the state of the regions rivers In the key months of June and July this year hydroelectric generation from the Northwest Power Pool averaged megawatts per hour below that of the favorable year of System planners in the s understood the nature of the hydroelectric system very well and planned to add thermal generation facilities to ensure adequate supply even under criticalwater conditions These conditions represented the worstcase scenario for hydroelectric generation Such planning however renders most prospective thermal plants uneconomic because they would lay idle except under the driest of conditions With the collapse of the WPPSS plants the Pacific Northwest quietly shifted its planning criteria from critical water to average water In times of heavy water flow the region is a net exporter but during a drought it must import electricity Over the last decade utility planning has been replaced by a market and not just in California Almost all new generators are independent power producers In a market new supply will only be built if there is the incentive to do so That incentive takes the form of profits and profits arise through high prices What no one has thought through is the implications of the variability of hydroelectric power on the incentive to construct thermal generation If new thermal generation is constructed but is only needed one out of every ten years then prices in years of drought must be extremely high in order to make building such thermal plants attractive to investors In short this is what the western power market is experiencing this year and will continue to experience until water flows improve and new supplies catch up with the regions overall economic growth The first step in solving a problem is to understand its cause While it is true that California and other Western states have not invested sufficiently in generation capacity and natural gas delivery systems additional supply is not by itself the answer Politicians planners and market participants alike must recognize that drought years will produce power shortages and they should plan accordingly The extremely high prices observed this last month arise in part from fear that the Pacific Northwest may be entering a cycle of cold dry weather So far the reaction has been uneven and not terribly productive Instead of blaming suppliers or each other the regions leaders should implement energy conservation programs aimed at solving a shortterm not just a longterm problem Publicity that explains the situation with the aim of conservation among consumers buyback programs for industrial and commercial customers and other such pricing incentives should be implemented as rapidly as possible before low water forces

Vactor column Dan and Sarah I dont know if you see Sam VanVactors materials or not If not here is a shot from the th Richard Copyright Economic Insight Inc EDITORIAL SA VAN VACTOR Energy Crisis Myths Mythology has always been an important part of the human experience and never more so than when hard choices must be made Thus it should come as no surprise that our current energy crisis is accompanied by a seemingly endless array of apologies exaggerations and myths Far and away the most common myth concerns the persistent view of many that suppliers are holding back generation in order to jack up prices Similar charges were levied during the oil crises of the s In those days critics complained that tankers could be seen just off the coast waiting until prices rose Holding back on electricity sales makes even less sense because once a moment of demand has passed it is gone forever No rational supplier will turn down the price offers persisting in the present marketplace day after day Indeed most suppliers are laboring to squeeze out every electron possible from aging and unreliable generators An equally common error arises when the crisis is blamed on deregulation and free markets Although California was the first state to adopt widescale consumer choice its market has been heavily regulated and constrained For example after nearly three years of consumer choice in the retail market only of the total volume is served by entities other than traditional utilities The volume of direct access has actually declined in recent months as buyers have scrambled to reconnect to regulated utilities that offer frozen rates More importantly the development of reliable forward markets and planning was stillborn because the California Public Utility Commission either prohibited or limited such trading at the same time that it granted automatic prudency to spot purchases Deregulation may have changed the nature of the crisis from a physical to a financial problem but the demand and supply fundamentals at the heart of the current energy crises were inherited from an earlier era of regulatory stumbles Officials in neighboring states are eager to blame California for the crisis but nothing could be further from the truth The Western power market is fully interconnected by design and if one part is short all regions are short In fact every operating area recognized that demand would occasionally exceed supply planners simply relied on the proposition that it would not happen simultaneously in all regions of the West However this is exactly what has happened The current crisis was precipitated by a scarcity of natural gas unexpected demand growth in California and the Southwest the second hottest summer on record in the Southwest and low water runs in Northern California and the Pacific Northwest If these myths are at odds with reality how should the energy crisis be viewed Famine and pestilence are normally reserved for biblical parables but they do play a role in this story The Western power market is tied to the vast generation potential of the regions hydroelectric system The systems potential is not however always available Unlike hydro systems in Quebec and Brazil the Columbia River system has only three months worth of water storage Quebec is said to have ten years of water inventory The difference between a drought and a year flush with water can be as high as average megawatts per hour roughly the capacity of six of the Wests nuclear generating stations Thus the availability of electricity swings from abundance to scarcity in an unpredictable pattern based on the state of the regions rivers In the key months of June and July this year hydroelectric generation from the Northwest Power Pool averaged megawatts per hour below that of the favorable year of System planners in the s understood the nature of the hydroelectric system very well and planned to add thermal generation facilities to ensure adequate supply even under criticalwater conditions These conditions represented the worstcase scenario for hydroelectric generation Such planning however renders most prospective thermal plants uneconomic because they would lay idle except under the driest of conditions With the collapse of the WPPSS plants the Pacific Northwest quietly shifted its planning criteria from critical water to average water In times of heavy water flow the region is a net exporter but during a drought it must import electricity Over the last decade utility planning has been replaced by a market and not just in California Almost all new generators are independent power producers In a market new supply will only be built if there is the incentive to do so That incentive takes the form of profits and profits arise through high prices What no one has thought through is the implications of the variability of hydroelectric power on the incentive to construct thermal generation If new thermal generation is constructed but is only needed one out of every ten years then prices in years of drought must be extremely high in order to make building such thermal plants attractive to investors In short this is what the western power market is experiencing this year and will continue to experience until water flows improve and new supplies catch up with the regions overall economic growth The first step in solving a problem is to understand its cause While it is true that California and other Western states have not invested sufficiently in generation capacity and natural gas delivery systems additional supply is not by itself the answer Politicians planners and market participants alike must recognize that drought years will produce power shortages and they should plan accordingly The extremely high prices observed this last month arise in part from fear that the Pacific Northwest may be entering a cycle of cold dry weather So far the reaction has been uneven and not terribly productive Instead of blaming suppliers or each other the regions leaders should implement energy conservation programs aimed at solving a shortterm not just a longterm problem Publicity that explains the situation with the aim of conservation among consumers buyback programs for industrial and commercial customers and other such pricing incentives should be implemented as rapidly as possible before low water forces

Vactor column Dan and Sarah I dont know if you see Sam VanVactors materials or not If not here is a shot from the th Richard Copyright Economic Insight Inc EDITORIAL SA VAN VACTOR Energy Crisis Myths Mythology has always been an important part of the human experience and never more so than when hard choices must be made Thus it should come as no surprise that our current energy crisis is accompanied by a seemingly endless array of apologies exaggerations and myths Far and away the most common myth concerns the persistent view of many that suppliers are holding back generation in order to jack up prices Similar charges were levied during the oil crises of the s In those days critics complained that tankers could be seen just off the coast waiting until prices rose Holding back on electricity sales makes even less sense because once a moment of demand has passed it is gone forever No rational supplier will turn down the price offers persisting in the present marketplace day after day Indeed most suppliers are laboring to squeeze out every electron possible from aging and unreliable generators An equally common error arises when the crisis is blamed on deregulation and free markets Although California was the first state to adopt widescale consumer choice its market has been heavily regulated and constrained For example after nearly three years of consumer choice in the retail market only of the total volume is served by entities other than traditional utilities The volume of direct access has actually declined in recent months as buyers have scrambled to reconnect to regulated utilities that offer frozen rates More importantly the development of reliable forward markets and planning was stillborn because the California Public Utility Commission either prohibited or limited such trading at the same time that it granted automatic prudency to spot purchases Deregulation may have changed the nature of the crisis from a physical to a financial problem but the demand and supply fundamentals at the heart of the current energy crises were inherited from an earlier era of regulatory stumbles Officials in neighboring states are eager to blame California for the crisis but nothing could be further from the truth The Western power market is fully interconnected by design and if one part is short all regions are short In fact every operating area recognized that demand would occasionally exceed supply planners simply relied on the proposition that it would not happen simultaneously in all regions of the West However this is exactly what has happened The current crisis was precipitated by a scarcity of natural gas unexpected demand growth in California and the Southwest the second hottest summer on record in the Southwest and low water runs in Northern California and the Pacific Northwest If these myths are at odds with reality how should the energy crisis be viewed Famine and pestilence are normally reserved for biblical parables but they do play a role in this story The Western power market is tied to the vast generation potential of the regions hydroelectric system The systems potential is not however always available Unlike hydro systems in Quebec and Brazil the Columbia River system has only three months worth of water storage Quebec is said to have ten years of water inventory The difference between a drought and a year flush with water can be as high as average megawatts per hour roughly the capacity of six of the Wests nuclear generating stations Thus the availability of electricity swings from abundance to scarcity in an unpredictable pattern based on the state of the regions rivers In the key months of June and July this year hydroelectric generation from the Northwest Power Pool averaged megawatts per hour below that of the favorable year of System planners in the s understood the nature of the hydroelectric system very well and planned to add thermal generation facilities to ensure adequate supply even under criticalwater conditions These conditions represented the worstcase scenario for hydroelectric generation Such planning however renders most prospective thermal plants uneconomic because they would lay idle except under the driest of conditions With the collapse of the WPPSS plants the Pacific Northwest quietly shifted its planning criteria from critical water to average water In times of heavy water flow the region is a net exporter but during a drought it must import electricity Over the last decade utility planning has been replaced by a market and not just in California Almost all new generators are independent power producers In a market new supply will only be built if there is the incentive to do so That incentive takes the form of profits and profits arise through high prices What no one has thought through is the implications of the variability of hydroelectric power on the incentive to construct thermal generation If new thermal generation is constructed but is only needed one out of every ten years then prices in years of drought must be extremely high in order to make building such thermal plants attractive to investors In short this is what the western power market is experiencing this year and will continue to experience until water flows improve and new supplies catch up with the regions overall economic growth The first step in solving a problem is to understand its cause While it is true that California and other Western states have not invested sufficiently in generation capacity and natural gas delivery systems additional supply is not by itself the answer Politicians planners and market participants alike must recognize that drought years will produce power shortages and they should plan accordingly The extremely high prices observed this last month arise in part from fear that the Pacific Northwest may be entering a cycle of cold dry weather So far the reaction has been uneven and not terribly productive Instead of blaming suppliers or each other the regions leaders should implement energy conservation programs aimed at solving a shortterm not just a longterm problem Publicity that explains the situation with the aim of conservation among consumers buyback programs for industrial and commercial customers and other such pricing incentives should be implemented as rapidly as possible before low water forces

Vactor column Dan and Sarah I dont know if you see Sam VanVactors materials or not If not here is a shot from the th Richard Copyright Economic Insight Inc EDITORIAL SA VAN VACTOR Energy Crisis Myths Mythology has always been an important part of the human experience and never more so than when hard choices must be made Thus it should come as no surprise that our current energy crisis is accompanied by a seemingly endless array of apologies exaggerations and myths Far and away the most common myth concerns the persistent view of many that suppliers are holding back generation in order to jack up prices Similar charges were levied during the oil crises of the s In those days critics complained that tankers could be seen just off the coast waiting until prices rose Holding back on electricity sales makes even less sense because once a moment of demand has passed it is gone forever No rational supplier will turn down the price offers persisting in the present marketplace day after day Indeed most suppliers are laboring to squeeze out every electron possible from aging and unreliable generators An equally common error arises when the crisis is blamed on deregulation and free markets Although California was the first state to adopt widescale consumer choice its market has been heavily regulated and constrained For example after nearly three years of consumer choice in the retail market only of the total volume is served by entities other than traditional utilities The volume of direct access has actually declined in recent months as buyers have scrambled to reconnect to regulated utilities that offer frozen rates More importantly the development of reliable forward markets and planning was stillborn because the California Public Utility Commission either prohibited or limited such trading at the same time that it granted automatic prudency to spot purchases Deregulation may have changed the nature of the crisis from a physical to a financial problem but the demand and supply fundamentals at the heart of the current energy crises were inherited from an earlier era of regulatory stumbles Officials in neighboring states are eager to blame California for the crisis but nothing could be further from the truth The Western power market is fully interconnected by design and if one part is short all regions are short In fact every operating area recognized that demand would occasionally exceed supply planners simply relied on the proposition that it would not happen simultaneously in all regions of the West However this is exactly what has happened The current crisis was precipitated by a scarcity of natural gas unexpected demand growth in California and the Southwest the second hottest summer on record in the Southwest and low water runs in Northern California and the Pacific Northwest If these myths are at odds with reality how should the energy crisis be viewed Famine and pestilence are normally reserved for biblical parables but they do play a role in this story The Western power market is tied to the vast generation potential of the regions hydroelectric system The systems potential is not however always available Unlike hydro systems in Quebec and Brazil the Columbia River system has only three months worth of water storage Quebec is said to have ten years of water inventory The difference between a drought and a year flush with water can be as high as average megawatts per hour roughly the capacity of six of the Wests nuclear generating stations Thus the availability of electricity swings from abundance to scarcity in an unpredictable pattern based on the state of the regions rivers In the key months of June and July this year hydroelectric generation from the Northwest Power Pool averaged megawatts per hour below that of the favorable year of System planners in the s understood the nature of the hydroelectric system very well and planned to add thermal generation facilities to ensure adequate supply even under criticalwater conditions These conditions represented the worstcase scenario for hydroelectric generation Such planning however renders most prospective thermal plants uneconomic because they would lay idle except under the driest of conditions With the collapse of the WPPSS plants the Pacific Northwest quietly shifted its planning criteria from critical water to average water In times of heavy water flow the region is a net exporter but during a drought it must import electricity Over the last decade utility planning has been replaced by a market and not just in California Almost all new generators are independent power producers In a market new supply will only be built if there is the incentive to do so That incentive takes the form of profits and profits arise through high prices What no one has thought through is the implications of the variability of hydroelectric power on the incentive to construct thermal generation If new thermal generation is constructed but is only needed one out of every ten years then prices in years of drought must be extremely high in order to make building such thermal plants attractive to investors In short this is what the western power market is experiencing this year and will continue to experience until water flows improve and new supplies catch up with the regions overall economic growth The first step in solving a problem is to understand its cause While it is true that California and other Western states have not invested sufficiently in generation capacity and natural gas delivery systems additional supply is not by itself the answer Politicians planners and market participants alike must recognize that drought years will produce power shortages and they should plan accordingly The extremely high prices observed this last month arise in part from fear that the Pacific Northwest may be entering a cycle of cold dry weather So far the reaction has been uneven and not terribly productive Instead of blaming suppliers or each other the regions leaders should implement energy conservation programs aimed at solving a shortterm not just a longterm problem Publicity that explains the situation with the aim of conservation among consumers buyback programs for industrial and commercial customers and other such pricing incentives should be implemented as rapidly as possible before low water forces

comments below Original Message From Cohen Louis Sent Thursday August AM To Jeffrey D Dan Watkiss Email Palansky IJay Plotnick Michael Cc Sarah Novosel Email Killory Ted Frankel Jonathan Cohen Louis Subject Order Argument Please think about the following In a minute Supreme Court argument the limit will be strictly observed one needs to be ready to answer questions of all sorts but one cannot co unt on being able to make more than points and each of them needs to b e clear from the first sentence points that require development dont work In light of that Should I plan to spend any minutes on the New York side of the case ie arguing that all transmissions over the grids are in interstate co mmerce and FERC has jurisdiction whether the ensuing sale is wholesale or r etail On the one hand the NY issue is more important to Enron than th e Enron issue on the other hand my sense is that we are way ahead on th e NY issue after the briefs and the SG will likely do a good job on it in argument My sense is that I should be prepared if necessary to utter so mething like the starred portion of the first sentence of this paragraph a nd to defend it against any questions but should not otherwise plan to get into these issues We should probably also have a canned sentence ready to address NYs wacky preemption argument which the one that it relied on most heavily in its op ening brief I think my most important tasks are to make clear that i this case is about FERCs power to require nondiscriminatory access to the interstate grids and not about rates or state regulation of retail sales and ii i t is important to the nation that FERC have such power I need to make the se points quickly and vividly in a way that the Justices will carry away That is going to be hard because theoretical abstractions are not vivid examples take too long to develop and provoke quarrels about details and m etaphors are generally too inexact Please consider whether I am right abo ut the two points being most important and think about how to make them I think these points are the most important along with making the Court c omfortable with the idea that if they adopted our position they would not b e turning upside down a federalstate regulatory division thats been in pl ace for years Although in a formal sense our case turns on the Chevron issue plain language no ambiguity hence no room for discretion my instinct but I am not at all sure about this is that I should not plan to devote time to these matters First they are covered well in the briefs Second whethe r one sees ambiguity does not really depend on staring at the language bu t on understanding what transmission in interstate commerce necessarily c overs in the present age In other words the way to win the Chevron point is to win the points in the previous paragraph Hence I ought to prepare to get the word unambiguous in there somewhere in the middle of a sentenc e and defend it if necessary but not do more Does this seem right I think its worth giving a little more attention since this is the key iss ue below and ultimately the issue on which the Court must rest its decisi on We dont want to lose the trees for the forest That said since wev e dealt with it at length in the briefs I dont know that we need much mor e than a reminder of the issue and the arguments FERC asserts that sectio n b does not unambiguously determine whether transmission bundled with retail sale is a transmission or a sale of electric energy at wholesale It concluded that such transmission is a sale The DC Circuit erroneou sly held that FERCs interpretation was permissible But transmission does nt stop being transmission merely because it is sold together with generat ion it is both transmission and a necessary component query whether com ponent is the best word to use of a retail sale Therefore under the cl ear language of section b jurisdiction over all transmissions includ ing transmissions bundled with retail sales is vested in FERC On the related point of NYs position that the wholesaleretail bright line applies to transmission in particular light of NYs interpretive gymnast ics in its reply re a at p isnt a good oneliner simply that i f Congress intended to limit FERCs transmission jurisdiction to transmissi ons for wholesale then s b would read The provisions of this subcha pter shall apply to the sale of electric energy at wholesale and all associ ated transmissions or something to that effect Note this issue opens the door to discussion of among other things whet her the exclusive purpose of section b was to fill the Attleboro gap and questions about the structure of the FPA eg the relationship betwee n b and d etc What do I do in argument with LPL I find the NGA parallel very comp elling and IF the Court decides to go with us it will have no problem citi ng and following that case On the other hand the argument does not seem to have persuaded anybody but our team not CADC for example On balance I am inclined to say The Court has already decided this issue under the p arallel provision of the NGA and use some time to press that point One r eason for doing so is that in general it will be much EASIER for the Court just to affirm FERC and CADC than to push thru the complexities and agree w ith us but LPL gives them both a precedent for overruling FERC on its own jurisdiction and a comparatively easy way thru the case Agreed I need to understand why FERCs powers and plans to create regional tra nsmission organizations do not fully solve the problem I need to get a de tailed understanding of the facts and a onesentence answer to why there i s still a problem The primary answer in our reply is that Order does not require RTOs i t only encourages their voluntarily formation and that theres no indicati on that monopolists will give up their market power unless compelled p Most important What other points in addition to and does anyone think I need to be sure to make Even more important what points made by NY SG EEI California are most likely to trouble the Court and provoke q uestions Which of them should I plan to answer even if I get no question We might also need to address whether our position runs against years of history Didnt the states regulate all aspects of bundled retail sales u ntil Order Does our position mean that FERC historically abdicated it s responsibility and the states were regulating without authority What is the effect of section a if not to allow states to continue to regulat e the matters that they regulated in This may be an issue to broach only if the Court indicates interest though since I think its the toughe st one for us to answer We might also reconsider our position that unbundling is merely an accounti ng issue It seems to me that reversing the position we took in our initia l brief will basically hedge our bets it makes our affirmative argument a little harder since we cant simply say that its crazy to base FERCs ju risdiction on an accounting technique but it also makes NYs argument har der since they cant simply say that but for a change in the accounting fo r electric service the states would still be regulating interstate transmis sions for retail sale This would also dovetail with some of the other bri efs that made a strong argument that unbundling is a major change in electr ic service necessary to support competition among generators and something over which the states have never exercised jurisdiction Thanks to all for thinking about this

target implementation date of the ISOs is November but the proposal clearly states that this time frame is subject to extension if new design requirements are introduced We believe the true intent of the ISOs is to delay indefinitely this process in order to retain the three existing ISO structures A copy of the Judges report and the Business Plan are attached One good aspect of the Judges report is that he asks in several areas of the report for Commission guidance We too believe this is necessary It became quite evident early in the mediation proceeding that we were not going to agree with the New York entities or the New England ISO on market design or governance We argued that FERC intended the new market design to be primarily the PJM system with enhancements where possible Others relying on the ambiguity in FERCs orders argued that FERC really intended to create a new system using PJM as the platform but pulling heavily from the other two ISOs regardless of time or complication of creating this new market We need FERC direction on this and the Judge makes this clear Background The Judges primary goal of this day mediation process was simply to establish a business plan which lays out how and when a single Northeast RTO will be created Enron along with many other participants opposed this approach arguing that we are wasting the days given to us by the Commission The Judge acknowledges in his report that there was significant opposition to his approach but he thinks it worked out perfectly Although the majority of the Judges report and the business plan focuses mainly on process for creating the business plan he does discuss two substantive issues market design and governance Market Design At the beginning of the mediation PJM NY and NE submitted a joint proposal for forming a single Northeast RTO This proposal envisions a timeintensive approached designed to reach agreement by all stakeholders with an implementation date in years Option Mof the Business Plan This proposal is now supported by the New England and New York ISOs PJM has its own approach see below The New York transmission owners also submitted a proposal for implementing the new RTO in years Option M of the Business Plan PJM submitted an alternative proposal for creating and implementing a single Northeast RTO with a single dayahead and realtime energy market by November Option M of the Business Plan We took the lead in creating a coalition of marketers generators PJM TOs industrials and other end use customers The One RTO Coalition advocating the creation of a single energy market based on PJMs system by December but no later than May Although we Enron believe PJMs November time frame is too conservative the coalition supports Option M PJMs approach since it achieves the Coalitions goals albeit on a slower timetable As noted above the Judge endorses Option M in part because it has a builtin a process for determining Best Practices Although PJM also conducted a best practices analysis the other ISOs and NY TOs do not agree with PJMs determinations of what practices from their ISOs are best practices The Judge acknowledges that support for Option M the PJM plan far outstrips the other options in diversity and extent of stakeholder support However the Judge believes that the PJM option assumes the PJM platform can work in New York and New England even though there are more generation divestiture and load pocket issues in New York and New England than in PJM The Judge states that impatience haste and greed should not be permitted to drive the RTO process at the expense of sound policy and that optimal RTO benefits should not be sacrificed in order to allow some to exploit more immediate economic opportunity in a sprint See Report page Governance The other substantive issues we have discussed are governance interim governance final governance board makeup and stakeholder process The Judge opted to not endorse any one of the options proposed instead he discusses the pros and cons of each option Here again the Judge strongly urges the Commission to provide guidance to the participants on the Commissions preferred governance approach The Judge also suggests that a settlement judge may be helpful in assisting stakeholders in finalizing governance procedures PJM has stated that in order to meet its deadline of November and certainly earlier PJM has to be in control of the implementation of the new RTO PJM proposes that the new board be made up of board members from the existing ISOs from PJM from New York and from New England The Board elects a voting CEO assumed to be Phil Harris if the PJM proposal wins NY ISO New England ISO NY PSC NY TOs and New England TOs along with other entities primarily those who are afraid to cross New York PSC all support equal representation on the new Board One proposal would have board members from each ISO with a nonvoting CEO The other proposal would have board members from each ISO with additional board members to be elected by stakeholders We support the PJM board makeup proposal to ensure a fast transition to a single Northeast RTO and energy market based on the PJM system Post Mediation The Judge in his report recommends that the Commission issue an order resolving as many of the issues in dispute as possible and then establish further proceedings under the auspice of a settlement judge The Judge urges the Commission to not accept comments from participants but he acknowledges that all participants want an opportunity to comment We are working on two sets of comments now one on our own and one in conjunction with the One RTO Coalition We will circulate drafts as soon as they are prepared Although we are disappointed that the Judge did not endorse the PJM proposal we still believe that the Commission is intent on implementing a single northeast RTO as soon as possible and that the PJM proposal provides a wellreasoned even conservative approach to reaching that goal Therefore even though the Judge sided with New York we are hopeful that the Commission will stick to its guns and go with the PJM proposal Please call any one of us if you have any questions or would like to discuss the Report Sarah Dan Howard and Tom

Rights The morning panel discussed congestion management The panelists were Na ncy Brockway Commissioner New Hampshire PSC Reem Fahey Edison Mission C arol Guthrie ChevronTexaco Shmuel Oren University of California Berkl ey and advises Texas PUC Andy Ott PJM Michael Schnitzer NorthBridge Gro up General Observations The Commissioners were again all present Wood left midmorning to give tes timony on Capitol Hill Today however FERC Staff was much more active i n the discussion and the commissioners asked very few questions The topic s are so interrelated that many of the same issues already discussed are be ing rehashed again This will probably continue for the rest of the week What I have found most encouraging so far has been the widespread support for some of the basic concepts most notably the need for a real time energ y market based using LMP Very few panelists have opposed this at most a couple of panelists have argued that the real time market should not be st andardized basically conceding that PJMs system is not going to change in the Northeast but urging that it not be mandated everywhere else Opening Statements Nancy Brockway focus on two topics flowgate vs LMP and relation ship between congestion management CM and resource planning She support s LMP and standard market design in New England Flowgate rights are cumbe rsome create unnecessary uplift costs freezing power distribution factor s is bad and could result in some free rides She is a Hogan follower and Hogan says flowgates can be done but are too difficult With regard to th e relationship between CM and resource planning transmission is a monopoly and the CM principle is that entrepreneurs make a decision decide where to site generation or transmission and take a risk FERC should not overr ide that principle Proposals for transmission expansion can undercut cong estion management Reem Fahey RTO needs to be the grid operator and the market operator Ca nnot use different bid stacks for balancing and congestion CM should have a bidbased structure with LMP Design of CM should allow flexibility for market participants to be in the spot and forward markets Transmission r ights must be financial and not physical and must allow for financial hed ging in real time FERC should work towards the creation of trading hubs a nd market participants should have rights from hub to hub and hub to load These rights should not interfere with real time dispatch of the system Carol Guthrie Her company has diverse interests in electricity market o ver service locations over suppliers more than sites where t hey have industrial generation serving own load MW Shmuel Oren Advocates minimal ISOs direct assignment of congestion costs in real time flowgate rights proposal because it requires less centralize d coordination and supports forward rights Does not support one size fit s all Need to understand gaming modes of market failure Problems in T exas people scheduled to cause congestion and then were paid to relieve t he congestion Need to charge for true congestion when it is predictable Andy Ott There is consensus in the industry that locational pricing works Its an operational tool used to manage reliability of the gird during c onstraints PJM has been using nodal pricing since Utilities have r un their system on this approach for years economic dispatch to meet dema nd Cannot do balancing and CM separately does not work Transmission rights must be financial Spot market is physical Financial model is the hedging You need this separation because it allows players to do bilater als or buy or sell from the spot market Also allows FTRs to be traded and used to protect from congestion Michael Schnitzer There is a preferred method of CM the LMP based CM sy stem with financial rights DAM and RT bidbased security constrained loca tional pricing markets Bilateral transactions are allowed Transmission rights must be financial not physical Allows transmission users to hedge congestion costs Why is CM so important Need to get the prices right t o give the right signals to the market Three goals get dispatch righ t show bilateral contracts and load the right price signal so they can re spond accordingly price signals to generation for location purposes c larifies responsibility and risk allocations market signals for when to expand the grid LMP gives economic price signal and property right in FT Rs Locational Marginal Pricing The panelists all agreed that LMP in the real time market is necessary Sch muel Oren does not oppose it Most of the panelists think this needs to b e standardized across RTOs Andy Ott says the seams will remain a problem and a barrier to trading if the real time market is not standardized Car ol Guthrie does not favor standardization and urged FERC to not standardize the PJM system throughout the eastern interconnect She said FERC should try a couple of different systems and see what works FTRs versus Flowgates The panelists agreed that transmission rights should be financial not phys ical Schmuel conceded this point for the discussion but this may not be h is preference unclear Most of the panelists including the PSC commissi oner prefer FTRs rather than flowgates Schmuel is a flowgate advocate After some discussion the panelists agreed that FTRs and flowgates could w ork together provided that the definition of flowgate is understood Andy Ott said flowgates could work with FTRs if the purpose of having flowgates is the same purpose of having hubs liquidity standard product and if a flowgate is defined as a grouping of pointtopoint rights then FTRs and flowgates can coexist If a flowgate is a hub for transmission rights it s okay However if flowgate is defined as a physical boundary requiring s cheduling the two cannot coexist Schmuel seemed to agree with this premi se although this is not his preference He seems to prefer only flowgates without FTRs Brockway seems to prefer FTRs rather than flowgates for fe ar that flowgates will result in excess socialization of costs The panelists also agreed generally that revenues generated from FTRs or fl owgates should be allocated to load but the method of allocation was not a greed upon FERC staff asked the panelists to discuss commercially significant flowgate s Many of the panelists discussed the problem with deciding what constitu tes a commercially significant flowgate and what happens when circumstance s change over time resulting in different flowgates being commercially sig nificant Schmuel said you could use either a system that relies only on c ommercially significant flowgates or one that uses all flowgates but if pa rticipants are willing to accept a system where they are not perfectly hedg ed use of commercially significant flowgates is acceptable The panelists agreed that these financial rights either FTRs or flowgates should be tr adable in the secondary market The panelists disagreed on whether FTRs or flowgates are actually more tradable Andy thinks FTRs are more tradable Schmuel thinks flowgates are more tradable Options versus Obligations The panelists discussed the benefits of having FTRs be options but also dis cussed the additional problems presented to the system operator if FTRs are only options and the FTR holder is not required to flow or pay if it does not flow Andy Ott said options will most likely result in fewer FTRs bein g allocated Schnitzer says the issue must be resolved up front The afternoon panel was on Transmission Planning and Expansion Steve Walt on was a panelist and will be providing a summary of the discussion shortly Let me know if you have any questions Sarah

<12856922.1075840895750.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,sarah.novosel@enron.com,2001-09-26 13:40:59,FW FERC Meeting Summarypst The Commission held its first open meeting with Pat Wood as the new Chairman today and discussed many interesting issues The following is a summary of the meeting The meeting is still going on and we will provide an addendum to this email updating you on what was discussed this afternoon regarding market power RTOs Chairman Wood expressed his desire to finish the RTO transition and that the Commission needs to provide guidance and leadership in order to speed up the RTO transition Chairman Wood considers the RTO effort on two tracks organizational what will the RTO organizations look like and substantive once you set up the organizations what will they do Organizational Effort Wood stated that this effort has already begun with the July orders and the Northeast and Southeast mediation efforts The Commission will be issuing additional orders in the northeast southeast and Midwest within the next couple of FERC meetings Wood also stated that it is time for RTO West and Desert Star to marry up meaning I suppose that the two should consolidate Wood does not think that California can be included in the western RTO yet since it has lingering problems Structural Effort The Commission will initiate a section proceeding to address market design and structure issues in order to translate the functions established in Order No into RTO structures To achieve this goal the Commission is establishing an RTO week of advanced workshops from October in advance of issuing a NOPR to address structural issues such as congestion management cost recovery market monitoring transmission planning reliability transmission rights Wood also envisions that the Commission will develop a new pro forma tariff to replace the existing Order No transmission tariff The new tariff will apply to all public utilities and RTOs Wood also recognized that some sticks are needed to entice RTO participation Therefore Wood proposes to have all public utilities come in by December with a declaration to join an RTO If they do not make this declaration these entities will have their market based rate authority revoked on a prospective basis Furthermore Wood states that if entities do not join RTOs they should not be authorized to merge their facilities and that FERC will also look at their rates to determine whether they are still just and reasonable rates compared with rates offered by RTOs Wood states that these sticks provide incentive but do not mandate RTO participation With regard to the pending requests for rehearing Wood asked legal staff to figure out how FERC can get there In other words I think Wood is telling them to develop the legal analysis for denying rehearing While Commissioner Breathitt is skeptical about some of these RTO proposals because she was not required to vote on anything today she only expressed her concern Upcoming Dates October RTO Workshops End of October further orders on Northeast Southeast Midwest RTOs December all public utilities must commit to an RTO or have their market based rates revoked Proposed Rule for Standards of Conduct Within the next few days FERC will be issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking NOPR on standards of conduct for transmission providers As explained at the meeting we do not have a copy of the NOPR yet the NOPR will propose to apply standards of conduct uniformly to electric transmission providers and gas pipeline transportation providers similarly The NOPR also proposes to broaden the definition of affiliate to include all energy affiliates not just marketers The standards of conduct would not apply to RTOs and transmission providers who are members of an RTO may ask for an exemption from the standards The NOPR will also likely include a proposal that the standards apply to transmissionowners marketing affiliates that are serving native load customers As you know the present standards do not apply to the affiliates of TOs that are only buying and selling power for native load customers As the interim general counsel noted these marketing affiliates can go into the control room and have unrestricted interaction with the TO There was some discussion of whether it is necessary to apply the standards to affiliates serving native load Staff told the Commissioners that market participants have been complaining for years about this loop hole in the rules Pat Wood said they will include the proposal in the NOPR Breathitt may not support but if the industry does not support the proposal FERC will pull it We of course will strongly support the proposal Provision of Adequate Electrical Capacity ICAP Chairman Wood asked Staff to prepare a presentation on reserves and installed capacity requirements Wood noted that the Commission had to issue an order on ICAP in New England during their recess in August and he is not that familiar with the issues Therefore he asked Staff to prepare a presentation which they made at the meeting this morning The presentation will be made public within the next couple of days In sum Staff seems to believe that some type of ICAP requirement is needed for reliability After the presentation Wood noted that the New England ICAP order has enough wiggle room to allow the Commission to change its mind once the commissioners better understand the issue Wood sees that there is a potential conflict between decentralized competitive markets and the need for sufficient supply without politically unacceptable prolonged price spikes Commissioner Brownell from the Pennsylvania PUC has a better understanding of ICAP and expressed concerns that ICAP may be an outdated tool that acts as a barrier to entry without any definable benefit to customers Realizing that there are many positions on this topic Chairman Wood said he will publish the Staff report and ask for comments by October We will definitely submit comments on this and will include everyone in the drafting process Sorry this is so long but a lot happened today We will provide a summary of the market power discussion as soon as it is over Let us know if you have any questions Sarah

discussed many interesting issues The following is a summary of the meeting The meeting is still going on and we will provide an addendum to this email updating you on what was discussed this afternoon regarding market power RTOs Chairman Wood expressed his desire to finish the RTO transition and that the Commission needs to provide guidance and leadership in order to speed up the RTO transition Chairman Wood considers the RTO effort on two tracks organizational what will the RTO organizations look like and substantive once you set up the organizations what will they do Organizational Effort Wood stated that this effort has already begun with the July orders and the Northeast and Southeast mediation efforts The Commission will be issuing additional orders in the northeast southeast and Midwest within the next couple of FERC meetings Wood also stated that it is time for RTO West and Desert Star to marry up meaning I suppose that the two should consolidate Wood does not think that California can be included in the western RTO yet since it has lingering problems Structural Effort The Commission will initiate a section proceeding to address market design and structure issues in order to translate the functions established in Order No into RTO structures To achieve this goal the Commission is establishing an RTO week of advanced workshops from October in advance of issuing a NOPR to address structural issues such as congestion management cost recovery market monitoring transmission planning reliability transmission rights Wood also envisions that the Commission will develop a new pro forma tariff to replace the existing Order No transmission tariff The new tariff will apply to all public utilities and RTOs Wood also recognized that some sticks are needed to entice RTO participation Therefore Wood proposes to have all public utilities come in by December with a declaration to join an RTO If they do not make this declaration these entities will have their market based rate authority revoked on a prospective basis Furthermore Wood states that if entities do not join RTOs they should not be authorized to merge their facilities and that FERC will also look at their rates to determine whether they are still just and reasonable rates compared with rates offered by RTOs Wood states that these sticks provide incentive but do not mandate RTO participation With regard to the pending requests for rehearing Wood asked legal staff to figure out how FERC can get there In other words I think Wood is telling them to develop the legal analysis for denying rehearing While Commissioner Breathitt is skeptical about some of these RTO proposals because she was not required to vote on anything today she only expressed her concern Upcoming Dates October RTO Workshops End of October further orders on Northeast Southeast Midwest RTOs December all public utilities must commit to an RTO or have their market based rates revoked Proposed Rule for Standards of Conduct Within the next few days FERC will be issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking NOPR on standards of conduct for transmission providers As explained at the meeting we do not have a copy of the NOPR yet the NOPR will propose to apply standards of conduct uniformly to electric transmission providers and gas pipeline transportation providers similarly The NOPR also proposes to broaden the definition of affiliate to include all energy affiliates not just marketers The standards of conduct would not apply to RTOs and transmission providers who are members of an RTO may ask for an exemption from the standards The NOPR will also likely include a proposal that the standards apply to transmissionowners marketing affiliates that are serving native load customers As you know the present standards do not apply to the affiliates of TOs that are only buying and selling power for native load customers As the interim general counsel noted these marketing affiliates can go into the control room and have unrestricted interaction with the TO There was some discussion of whether it is necessary to apply the standards to affiliates serving native load Staff told the Commissioners that market participants have been complaining for years about this loop hole in the rules Pat Wood said they will include the proposal in the NOPR Breathitt may not support but if the industry does not support the proposal FERC will pull it We of course will strongly support the proposal Provision of Adequate Electrical Capacity ICAP Chairman Wood asked Staff to prepare a presentation on reserves and installed capacity requirements Wood noted that the Commission had to issue an order on ICAP in New England during their recess in August and he is not that familiar with the issues Therefore he asked Staff to prepare a presentation which they made at the meeting this morning The presentation will be made public within the next couple of days In sum Staff seems to believe that some type of ICAP requirement is needed for reliability After the presentation Wood noted that the New England ICAP order has enough wiggle room to allow the Commission to change its mind once the commissioners better understand the issue Wood sees that there is a potential conflict between decentralized competitive markets and the need for sufficient supply without politically unacceptable prolonged price spikes Commissioner Brownell from the Pennsylvania PUC has a better understanding of ICAP and expressed concerns that ICAP may be an outdated tool that acts as a barrier

todays panel was RTO Markets and Design Required Markets and Optional Markets The issues in both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues Panel One Mandatory RTO Markets The morning panel consisted of the following participants Peter Cramton University of Maryland David Hadley Indiana PSC Mark Kleinginna Ormet John Meyer Reliant John ONeal Mirant and Roy Shanker consultant for generators in the Northeast Energy Spot Market There was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a real time energy or spot market Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bidbased securityconstrained system with economic dispatch In response to a question from Pat Wood most also agreed that nodal LMP pricing should be used in the spot market although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also Day Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules Most of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules Peter Cramton said that with a dayahead market no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior John Meyer agrees saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement then there might be a need for a dayahead market John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement which he does not recommend or have a dayahead market ICAP Requirement Most of the panelists except Peter Cramton University of MD support an ICAP requirement However none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week Mark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM He cannot enter into longterm contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response Standardized Markets Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and dayahead energy markets spinning and nonspinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized Massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs Panel Two Optional RTO Markets The afternoon panel consisted of the following participants Fiona Woolfe lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool Roy Thilly Wisconsin Public Power Inc Richard Pierce professor at George Washington Glen Arthur Connecticut PSC Steve Naumann Commonwealth Edison Ed Cazalet APX This panel was intended to cover optional market issues including whether a dayahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market market monitoring and other issues Mandatory Markets Other than Ed Cazalet APX the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and dayahead energy market ancillary services markets and there must be an ICAP requirement Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market perhaps with balanced schedules requirements and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create ICAP Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a dayahead market congestion management and ancillary services Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market Pat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached and perhaps that should be considered here as well He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not Shelton Cannon Staff asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO can there be different ICAP requirements within the RTO Most panelists agree that if the ICAP rules are the same within the RTO that there could be percentage requirement deviations Day Two of RTO Week focuses on Congestion Management in the morning and Transmission Planning and Expansion in the afternoon We will get summaries out on these panels tomorrow Please call me with questions or comments Sarah

discussed many interesting issues The following is a summary of the meeting The meeting is still going on and we will provide an addendum to this email updating you on what was discussed this afternoon regarding market power RTOs Chairman Wood expressed his desire to finish the RTO transition and that the Commission needs to provide guidance and leadership in order to speed up the RTO transition Chairman Wood considers the RTO effort on two tracks organizational what will the RTO organizations look like and substantive once you set up the organizations what will they do Organizational Effort Wood stated that this effort has already begun with the July orders and the Northeast and Southeast mediation efforts The Commission will be issuing additional orders in the northeast southeast and Midwest within the next couple of FERC meetings Wood also stated that it is time for RTO West and Desert Star to marry up meaning I suppose that the two should consolidate Wood does not think that California can be included in the western RTO yet since it has lingering problems Structural Effort The Commission will initiate a section proceeding to address market design and structure issues in order to translate the functions established in Order No into RTO structures To achieve this goal the Commission is establishing an RTO week of advanced workshops from October in advance of issuing a NOPR to address structural issues such as congestion management cost recovery market monitoring transmission planning reliability transmission rights Wood also envisions that the Commission will develop a new pro forma tariff to replace the existing Order No transmission tariff The new tariff will apply to all public utilities and RTOs Wood also recognized that some sticks are needed to entice RTO participation Therefore Wood proposes to have all public utilities come in by December with a declaration to join an RTO If they do not make this declaration these entities will have their market based rate authority revoked on a prospective basis Furthermore Wood states that if entities do not join RTOs they should not be authorized to merge their facilities and that FERC will also look at their rates to determine whether they are still just and reasonable rates compared with rates offered by RTOs Wood states that these sticks provide incentive but do not mandate RTO participation With regard to the pending requests for rehearing Wood asked legal staff to figure out how FERC can get there In other words I think Wood is telling them to develop the legal analysis for denying rehearing While Commissioner Breathitt is skeptical about some of these RTO proposals because she was not required to vote on anything today she only expressed her concern Upcoming Dates October RTO Workshops End of October further orders on Northeast Southeast Midwest RTOs December all public utilities must commit to an RTO or have their market based rates revoked Proposed Rule for Standards of Conduct Within the next few days FERC will be issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking NOPR on standards of conduct for transmission providers As explained at the meeting we do not have a copy of the NOPR yet the NOPR will propose to apply standards of conduct uniformly to electric transmission providers and gas pipeline transportation providers similarly The NOPR also proposes to broaden the definition of affiliate to include all energy affiliates not just marketers The standards of conduct would not apply to RTOs and transmission providers who are members of an RTO may ask for an exemption from the standards The NOPR will also likely include a proposal that the standards apply to transmissionowners marketing affiliates that are serving native load customers As you know the present standards do not apply to the affiliates of TOs that are only buying and selling power for native load customers As the interim general counsel noted these marketing affiliates can go into the control room and have unrestricted interaction with the TO There was some discussion of whether it is necessary to apply the standards to affiliates serving native load Staff told the Commissioners that market participants have been complaining for years about this loop hole in the rules Pat Wood said they will include the proposal in the NOPR Breathitt may not support but if the industry does not support the proposal FERC will pull it We of course will strongly support the proposal Provision of Adequate Electrical Capacity ICAP Chairman Wood asked Staff to prepare a presentation on reserves and installed capacity requirements Wood noted that the Commission had to issue an order on ICAP in New England during their recess in August and he is not that familiar with the issues Therefore he asked Staff to prepare a presentation which they made at the meeting this morning The presentation will be made public within the next couple of days In sum Staff seems to believe that some type of ICAP requirement is needed for reliability After the presentation Wood noted that the New England ICAP order has enough wiggle room to allow the Commission to change its mind once the commissioners better understand the issue Wood sees that there is a potential conflict between decentralized competitive markets and the need for sufficient supply without politically unacceptable prolonged price spikes Commissioner Brownell from the Pennsylvania PUC has a better understanding of ICAP and expressed concerns that ICAP may be an outdated tool that acts as a barrier to entry without any definable benefit to customers Realizing that there are many positions on this topic Chairman Wood said he will publish the Staff report and ask for comments by October We will definitely submit comments on this and will include everyone in the drafting process Sorry this is so long but a lot happened today We will provide a summary of the market power discussion as soon as it is over Let us know if you have any questions Sarah
<14932754.1075858718391.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,sarah.novosel@enron.com,2001-09-18 06:35:32,Northeast RTO Mediation Report Cc Yesterday afternoon September the Judge in the Northeast RTO mediation proceeding issued his report to the Commission on the day mediation session Although not unexpected but still disappointing the Judge endorses the market design proposal of the New York and New England ISOs This market design proposal encompasses a long drawn out process for discussing what the Northeast market should look like minimum months before work begins to develop the new RTO The target implementation date of the ISOs is November but the proposal clearly states that this time frame is subject to extension if new design requirements are introduced We believe the true intent of the ISOs is to delay indefinitely this process in order to retain the three existing ISO structures A copy of the Judges report and the Business Plan are attached One good aspect of the Judges report is that he asks in several areas of the report for Commission guidance We too believe this is necessary It became quite evident early in the mediation proceeding that we were not going to agree with the New York entities or the New England ISO on market design or governance We argued that FERC intended the new market design to be primarily the PJM system with enhancements where possible Others relying on the ambiguity in FERCs orders argued that FERC really intended to create a new system using PJM as the platform but pulling heavily from the other two ISOs regardless of time or complication of creating this new market We need FERC direction on this and the Judge makes this clear Background The Judges primary goal of this day mediation process was simply to establish a business plan which lays out how and when a single Northeast RTO will be created Enron along with many other participants opposed this approach arguing that we are wasting the days given to us by the Commission The Judge acknowledges in his report that there was significant opposition to his approach but he thinks it worked out perfectly Although the majority of the Judges report and the business plan focuses mainly on process for creating the business plan he does discuss two substantive issues market design and governance Market Design At the beginning of the mediation PJM NY and NE submitted a joint proposal for forming a single Northeast RTO This proposal envisions a timeintensive approached designed to reach agreement by all stakeholders with an implementation date in years Option Mof the Business Plan This proposal is now supported by the New England and New York ISOs PJM has its own approach see below The New York transmission owners also submitted a proposal for implementing the new RTO in years Option M of the Business Plan PJM submitted an alternative proposal for creating and implementing a single Northeast RTO with a single dayahead and realtime energy market by November Option M of the Business Plan We took the lead in creating a coalition of marketers generators PJM TOs industrials and other end use customers The One RTO Coalition advocating the creation of a single energy market based on PJMs system by December but no later than May Although we Enron believe PJMs November time frame is too conservative the coalition supports Option M PJMs approach since it achieves the Coalitions goals albeit on a slower timetable As noted above the Judge endorses Option M in part because it has a builtin a process for determining Best Practices Although PJM also conducted a best practices analysis the other ISOs and NY TOs do not agree with PJMs determinations of what practices from their ISOs are best practices The Judge acknowledges that support for Option M the PJM plan far outstrips the other options in diversity and extent of stakeholder support However the Judge believes that the PJM option assumes the PJM platform can work in New York and New England even though there are more generation divestiture and load pocket issues in New York and New England than in PJM The Judge states that impatience haste and greed should not be permitted to drive the RTO process at the expense of sound policy and that optimal RTO benefits should not be sacrificed in order to allow some to exploit more immediate economic opportunity in a sprint See Report page Governance The other substantive issues we have discussed are governance interim governance final governance board makeup and stakeholder process The Judge opted to not endorse any one of the options proposed instead he discusses the pros and cons of each option Here again the Judge strongly urges the Commission to provide guidance to the participants on the Commissions preferred governance approach The Judge also suggests that a settlement judge may be helpful in assisting stakeholders in finalizing governance procedures PJM has stated that in order to meet its deadline of November and certainly earlier PJM has to be in control of the implementation of the new RTO PJM proposes that the new board be made up of board members from the existing ISOs from PJM from New York and from New England The Board elects a voting CEO assumed to be Phil Harris if the PJM proposal wins NY ISO New England ISO NY PSC NY TOs and New England TOs along with other entities primarily those who are afraid to cross New York PSC all support equal representation on the new Board One proposal would have board members from each ISO with a nonvoting CEO The other proposal would have board members from each ISO with additional board members to be elected by stakeholders We support the PJM board makeup proposal to ensure a fast transition to a single Northeast RTO and energy market based on the PJM system Post Mediation The Judge in his report recommends that the Commission issue an order resolving as many of the issues in dispute as possible and then establish further proceedings under the auspice of a settlement judge The Judge urges the Commission to not accept comments from participants but he acknowledges that all participants want an opportunity to comment We are working on two sets of comments now one on our own and one in conjunction with the One RTO Coalition We will circulate drafts as soon as they are prepared Although we are disappointed that the Judge did not endorse the PJM proposal we still believe that the Commission is intent on implementing a single northeast RTO as soon as possible and that the PJM proposal provides a wellreasoned even conservative approach to reaching that goal Therefore even though the Judge sided with New York we are hopeful that the Commission will stick to its guns and go with the PJM proposal Please call any one of us if you have any questions or would like to discuss the Report Sarah Dan Howard and Tom

of additional thoughts Dan Allegretti sent you a note on Friday regarding the history of NEPOOL and the benefits created by regionalization In a pleading we filed early this year we argued that going from three to one RTOs in the northeast combining NY NE and PJM will result in a significant savings in administrative costs We estimated you could cut down the current budgets for the three ISOs combined M per year to much less than that simply by eliminating a lot of the redundancies currently in place We did not substantiate this it just seemed to make sense You may want to ask the Tabors or Frontier people to see if they could come up with some rough numbers of administrative cost savings as another benefit of forming large RTOs In Sues email she asks for a list of some of the benefits of creating big RTOs Here are a few reduce barriers to the free flow of energy development of free open liquid markets which will ultimately result in lower prices properly structured RTOs will get munis and coops into the transmission grid for operational purposes eliminates the native load exception removes operational control and therefore commercial advantages enjoyed by transmission owners who also operate their systems standardize interconnection procedures only RTOs in the US means a lot fewer seams to deal with and better reliability Charles Yeung may be able to help with this point You should also remind the consultants that FERC came up with a lot of good reasons for RTOs in Order No Sue also asks what are the objections to RTOs See Susan Scotts summaries of the Requests for Rehearing filed in the Northeast and Southeast RTO proceedings People argue FERC has no legal authority to order RTOs FERC did not go through the appropriate notice and comment period to make RTOs mandatory regions will lose power due to exports New England and Southeast concern resulting in reliability concerns and higher prices no justification for mandatory requirement and threatens reliability again Charles may be able to help you with this Responding to the objections is going to be more difficult On the legal question of whether FERC can mandate RTOs Order may have some information but because they did not mandate RTOs in it may not address this issue in a lot of detail Im not sure You may also want to check recent speechescomments by Pat Wood I thought I read some statements hes made recently perhaps in response to legislative issues regarding FERCs actions in the RTO orders Original Message From Guerrero Janel Sent Thursday August AM To Shelk John

Nicolay Christi L Staines Dan Cc Shapiro Richard Steffes James D Robertson Linda Fromer Howard Subject RE Information request I just wanted to second Sues motion about the idea of a map to demonstrate the visual and substantive clarity of FERCs Super RTO model The map could be augmented with information on how those regions come closer to be aligned with actual power needs and flows I recall attending an EPSA conference for congressional staff soon after I arrived June or so which showed the crazy quiltlike map of the thenproposed RTOs that just looked unworkable The simplicity of the Super RTO model combined with some basic power idea will be a powerful lobbying tool Original Message From Landwehr Susan M Sent Wednesday August PM To Guerrero Janel Briggs Tom Allegretti Daniel Novosel Sarah Nicolay Christi L Staines Dan Shelk John Cc Shapiro Richard Steffes James D Robertson Linda Fromer Howard Subject RE Information request Janelas you know most of the interaction on RTOs that I have had is with the Governors and more specifically the western govs so my comments are directed to them but I think these suggestions could work for other influencers as well RTOs are not a readily understandable issue for a governor who has issues every week to cover nor is there a natural constituency that would politically support a governor getting involved nor is it an issue that they care aboutthey just want the lights to go on and their voters to have moderate prices and reliability and for the energy crisis to go away if they perceive that it is affecting them Those that know a little bit about the RTOs are following their incumbent utility lead in opposing a west wide RTO they are invoking the states rights mantra and they dont want to be in the same playground as California I would suggest that we need materialsinformation probably a power point of pagesas follows A description of the RTOs and generally what our position is in plain english in sentences or less A minimum of or analogies to a well designed RTO The analogies need to be fleshed outie cover all objections and questions The one that comes to mind is Eisenhower and the federal highway systemwhenhow it happened who protested and why they were wrong how great the highway system was for the economy and quality of life etc Governors need something they can use as a sound bite and something they understand well to use as an analogy They do not want to look stupid and most of them know little about energy and so we need to give them something very simple to use as their underlying reasoning for supporting our position Identify and describe only the the or most important specific issues that we need to see addressed in the RTOsnative load exemption gonecongestion management solutionstiming or whatever Steffes and team identify Specifically set out what the objections of other parties would be to the governor supporting our position on those issues identified this is key in making sure that they trust our information and it also makes sure that they are prepared to answer the objections Specifically set out what the answer is to overcome those objections Provide positive effects of a governor agreeing with the or issueswhy heshe should take our position ie better reliability more transmission or generation will be built if system is truly open keep them from getting screwed by California etc somewhere in here we also need a very simple map so they can visualize what RTOs are Original Message From Guerrero Janel Sent Wednesday August PM To Briggs

contacted our friends at Frontier Economics and at Tabors Caramanis about developing a set of talking points and leavebehinds for future RTO meetings outside of the mediation process with Governors State Legislatures Utility Commissioners and Members of Congress In order to adequately provide us with the materials we need both firms are interested in getting a better idea of the following who which individuals are raising concerns about the RTO Concept that FERCEnron are advocating what specifically are the arguments these critics are making against the single mandatory RTO concept What are the priority issues that need addressing in your regions Well probably have to develop different documents depending on who we are talking with Each of you contacted me this week about wanting to meet with various policymakers in order to address their concerns and deliver our message Before you schedule your meetings I think its important to arm you with materials that can be left behind that summarize andor outline your arguments for a single RTO Your feedback is important so PLEASE send me an email by Thursday outlining the feedback youve recently received and topics that you want Frontier Economics and TC to address Time is of the essence so please send me whatever thoughts you have so that I can forward to FE and TC Thanks

Light Co mpany General Observations The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time Massey left la te in the afternoon FERC Staff was active in the discussion however t he commissioners were very active as well asking perhaps as much as of all questions There was a general consensus that standards were needed much discussion focused simply on how much and by who The Commission seeme d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo rward and how far they needed to go Panelists urged the need to mover for ward as quickly as possible but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward There was d iscussion on identifying which industry group NERC or GISB would take the reins in the future On an interesting tangential note there was noticea ble conflict between NERC and GISB with veiled insults between the two org anizations somewhat common during the discussions FERC Deliverables A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne eded from the Commission Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical The first major topic was How many RTOs What is their scope All panel ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b y FERC in strong definitive language N o one offered any specific langua ge but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement The next topic was What will be standard market design Panelists varie d on this but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent Some urged f or one mandatory design for North America one supported a set of rigid sta ndard designs one supported a single design with requests for exceptions followed by an indepth review process and one seemed to prefer the curre nt situation The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha t the industry needed to move forward They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions asking questions like Do we need to issue a MegaOrder that addresses all these issues and How much detail do you need us to provide General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas Kormos and Burkes went so far as t o say FERC should Mandate as much as they felt comfortable and then go a little further Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea bu t in general did not oppose the concept citing only general warnings and t he need for cautious investigation One item of interest Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th e RTO Design and RTO Implementation section would address many of the que stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design Korm os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry The se ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote and asked the following questions Congestion Management When Operational Security Violations occu r how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i s nonetheless efficient Will LMP based systems be standard or will there be others that must be accommodated Transmission Service Are transmission services required to sch edule covered schedules only or are they risk management tools protect ing from congestion charges both covered and uncovered schedules are a llowed Loop Flows Are contractpath based or flowbased transmission services appropriate If contractpath based how are parallel path issues to be addressed Grandfathered Transmission Service Should contracts existing pr ior to RTO development be transferred or is there an equitable way to reti re those contracts Are there other solutions Energy Imbalance Markets How are imbalance markets to function Will they serve as realtime energy markets support unbalanced schedules be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service require balanced sche dules or will they be required at all Ancillary Services Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services required to schedule or will they be treated primarily as fina ncial instruments protecting against realtime POLR charges Losses Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce ss or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs but technical ly unwieldy NonJurisdictionals How are nonjurisdictionals to be integrate d into the new world Should systems be designed with the assumption that nonjurisdictional will be part of an RTO Or should they be designed to t reat each NJE as a separate entity Hopefully FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica l questions in an assertive manner and give some solid direction in which to move Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions pointing out that vague answers ie do congestion management will t ake a year or two to resolve but specific answers ie LMP with financi al hedging instruments will take only months The Commission asked Mike about moving forward and he told them that effectively it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed Now for a funny point One of the commissioners I think Breathitt refer red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest Kormos flat out said My profession is understanding how power systems work and I dont believe that that statement is true He then backpedaled a bit and said t hat it would need more study but he stood by his statement that the assert ion by the Northwest interests was false NERC and GISB A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standardse tting organization Massey went so far as to ask Are we looking at a bea uty contest between NERC and GISB Cook and Boswell then went into severa l short polite jabs at each others organizations Other participants cont inually reiterated the need for ONE INDEPENDENT organization Interesting ly Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI SB while Cook preferred to only talk about the new structure of NERC and did not focus on its history Brownell offered some nottoosubtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions ie were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder GISB was easily a ble to say they were not but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation Poin t Brownell Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC playing Dave Cooks yesm an He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERCs suppos ed successes such as TLR and ETag If staffers have tenure they will likely remember that these successes have not been so successful resulti ng in several filings and interventions We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues but general consensus was that I could not be done There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISBEISB The arguments began winding down after a some time and Boswell strongly ur ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward NERC s omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position In general I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top Let me know if you have any questions Andy

with veiled insults between the two org anizations somewhat common during the discussions FERC Deliverables A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne eded from the Commission Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical The first major topic was How many RTOs What is their scope All panel ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b y FERC in strong definitive language N o one offered any specific langua ge but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement The next topic was What will be standard market design Panelists varie d on this but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent Some urged f or one mandatory design for North America one supported a set of rigid sta ndard designs one supported a single design with requests for exceptions followed by an indepth review process and one seemed to prefer the curre nt situation The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha t the industry needed to move forward They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions asking questions like Do we need to issue a MegaOrder that addresses all these issues and How much detail do you need us to provide General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas Kormos and Burkes went so far as t o say FERC should Mandate as much as they felt comfortable and then go a little further Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea bu t in general did not oppose the concept citing only general warnings and t he need for cautious investigation One item of interest Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th e RTO Design and RTO Implementation section would address many of the que stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design Korm os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry The se ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote and asked the following questions Congestion Management When Operational Security Violations occu r how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i s nonetheless efficient Will LMP based systems be standard or will there be others that must be accommodated Transmission Service Are transmission services required to sch edule covered schedules only or are they risk management tools protect ing from congestion charges both covered and uncovered schedules are a llowed Loop Flows Are contractpath based or flowbased transmission services appropriate If contractpath based how are parallel path issues to be addressed Grandfathered Transmission Service Should contracts existing pr ior to RTO development be transferred or is there an equitable way to reti re those contracts Are there other solutions Energy Imbalance Markets How are imbalance markets to function Will they serve as realtime energy markets support unbalanced schedules be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service require balanced sche dules or will they be required at all Ancillary Services Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services required to schedule or will they be treated primarily as fina ncial instruments protecting against realtime POLR charges Losses Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce ss or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs but technical ly unwieldy NonJurisdictionals How are nonjurisdictionals to be integrate d into the new world Should systems be designed with the assumption that nonjurisdictional will be part of an RTO Or should they be designed to t reat each NJE as a separate entity Hopefully FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica l questions in an assertive manner and give some solid direction in which to move Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions pointing out that vague answers ie do congestion management will t ake a year or two to resolve but specific answers ie LMP with financi al hedging instruments will take only months The Commission asked Mike about moving forward and he told them that effectively it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed Now for a funny point One of the commissioners I think Breathitt refer red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest Kormos flat out said My profession is understanding how power systems work and I dont believe that that statement is true He then backpedaled a bit and said t hat it would need more study but he stood by his statement that the assert ion by the Northwest interests was false NERC and GISB A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standardse tting organization Massey went so far as to ask Are we looking at a bea uty contest between NERC and GISB Cook and Boswell then went into severa l short polite jabs at each others organizations Other participants cont inually reiterated the need for ONE INDEPENDENT organization Interesting ly Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI SB while Cook preferred to only talk about the new structure of NERC and did not focus on its history Brownell offered some nottoosubtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions ie were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder GISB was easily a ble to say they were not but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation Poin t Brownell Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC playing Dave Cooks yesm an He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERCs suppos ed successes such as TLR and ETag If staffers have tenure they will likely remember that these successes have not been so successful resulti ng in several filings and interventions We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues but general consensus was that I could not be done There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISBEISB The arguments began winding down after a some time and Boswell strongly ur ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward NERC s omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position In general I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top Let me know if you have any questions Andy Rodriquez Regulatory Affairs Enron Corp

Rights The morning panel discussed congestion management The panelists were Na ncy Brockway Commissioner New Hampshire PSC Reem Fahey Edison Mission C arol Guthrie ChevronTexaco Shmuel Oren University of California Berkl ey and advises Texas PUC Andy Ott PJM Michael Schnitzer NorthBridge Gro up General Observations The Commissioners were again all present Wood left midmorning to give tes timony on Capitol Hill Today however FERC Staff was much more active i n the discussion and the commissioners asked very few questions The topic s are so interrelated that many of the same issues already discussed are be ing rehashed again This will probably continue for the rest of the week What I have found most encouraging so far has been the widespread support for some of the basic concepts most notably the need for a real time energ y market based using LMP Very few panelists have opposed this at most a couple of panelists have argued that the real time market should not be st andardized basically conceding that PJMs system is not going to change in the Northeast but urging that it not be mandated everywhere else Opening Statements Nancy Brockway focus on two topics flowgate vs LMP and relation ship between congestion management CM and resource planning She support s LMP and standard market design in New England Flowgate rights are cumbe rsome create unnecessary uplift costs freezing power distribution factor s is bad and could result in some free rides She is a Hogan follower and Hogan says flowgates can be done but are too difficult With regard to th e relationship between CM and resource planning transmission is a monopoly and the CM principle is that entrepreneurs make a decision decide where to site generation or transmission and take a risk FERC should not overr ide that principle Proposals for transmission expansion can undercut cong estion management Reem Fahey RTO needs to be the grid operator and the market operator Ca nnot use different bid stacks for balancing and congestion CM should have a bidbased structure with LMP Design of CM should allow flexibility for market participants to be in the spot and forward markets Transmission r ights must be financial and not physical and must allow for financial hed ging in real time FERC should work towards the creation of trading hubs a nd market participants should have rights from hub to hub and hub to load These rights should not interfere with real time dispatch of the system Carol Guthrie Her company has diverse interests in electricity market o ver service locations over suppliers more than sites where t hey have industrial generation serving own load MW Shmuel Oren Advocates minimal ISOs direct assignment of congestion costs in real time flowgate rights proposal because it requires less centralize d coordination and supports forward rights Does not support one size fit s all Need to understand gaming modes of market failure Problems in T exas people scheduled to cause congestion and then were paid to relieve t he congestion Need to charge for true congestion when it is predictable Andy Ott There is consensus in the industry that locational pricing works Its an operational tool used to manage reliability of the gird during c onstraints PJM has been using nodal pricing since Utilities have r un their system on this approach for years economic dispatch to meet dema nd Cannot do balancing and CM separately does not work Transmission rights must be financial Spot market is physical Financial model is the hedging You need this separation because it allows players to do bilater als or buy or sell from the spot market Also allows FTRs to be traded and used to protect from congestion Michael Schnitzer There is a preferred method of CM the LMP based CM sy stem with financial rights DAM and RT bidbased security constrained loca tional pricing markets Bilateral transactions are allowed Transmission rights must be financial not physical Allows transmission users to hedge congestion costs Why is CM so important Need to get the prices right t o give the right signals to the market Three goals get dispatch righ t show bilateral contracts and load the right price signal so they can re spond accordingly price signals to generation for location purposes c larifies responsibility and risk allocations market signals for when to expand the grid LMP gives economic price signal and property right in FT Rs Locational Marginal Pricing The panelists all agreed that LMP in the real time market is necessary Sch muel Oren does not oppose it Most of the panelists think this needs to b e standardized across RTOs Andy Ott says the seams will remain a problem and a barrier to trading if the real time market is not standardized Car ol Guthrie does not favor standardization and urged FERC to not standardize the PJM system throughout the eastern interconnect She said FERC should try a couple of different systems and see what works FTRs versus Flowgates The panelists agreed that transmission rights should be financial not phys ical Schmuel conceded this point for the discussion but this may not be h is preference unclear Most of the panelists including the PSC commissi oner prefer FTRs rather than flowgates Schmuel is a flowgate advocate After some discussion the panelists agreed that FTRs and flowgates could w ork together provided that the definition of flowgate is understood Andy Ott said flowgates could work with FTRs if the purpose of having flowgates is the same purpose of having hubs liquidity standard product and if a flowgate is defined as a grouping of pointtopoint rights then FTRs and flowgates can coexist If a flowgate is a hub for transmission rights it s okay However if flowgate is defined as a physical boundary requiring s cheduling the two cannot coexist Schmuel seemed to agree with this premi se although this is not his preference He seems to prefer only flowgates without FTRs Brockway seems to prefer FTRs rather than flowgates for fe ar that flowgates will result in excess socialization of costs The panelists also agreed generally that revenues generated from FTRs or fl owgates should be allocated to load but the method of allocation was not a greed upon FERC staff asked the panelists to discuss commercially significant flowgate s Many of the panelists discussed the problem with deciding what constitu tes a commercially significant flowgate and what happens when circumstance s change over time resulting in different flowgates being commercially sig nificant Schmuel said you could use either a system that relies only on c ommercially significant flowgates or one that uses all flowgates but if pa rticipants are willing to accept a system where they are not perfectly hedg ed use of commercially significant flowgates is acceptable The panelists agreed that these financial rights either FTRs or flowgates should be tr adable in the secondary market The panelists disagreed on whether FTRs or flowgates are actually more tradable Andy thinks FTRs are more tradable Schmuel thinks flowgates are more tradable Options versus Obligations The panelists discussed the benefits of having FTRs be options but also dis cussed the additional problems presented to the system operator if FTRs are only options and the FTR holder is not required to flow or pay if it does not flow Andy Ott said options will most likely result in fewer FTRs bein g allocated Schnitzer says the issue must be resolved up front The afternoon panel was on Transmission Planning and Expansion Steve Walt on was a panelist and will be providing a summary of the discussion shortly Let me know if you have any questions Sarah

panel was RTO Markets and Design Required Markets and Optional Markets The issues from both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues All commissioners were present Shelton Cannon was the moderator and facilitator Purpose is to have intensive discussion to develop FERC guidance Focus is on functions rather than characteristics what should and should not be standardized Midwest Commissioners Presentation Several Midwest commissioners were invited to make an opening statement David Svanda Michigan PSC made the comments He said Midwest state regulators believe there are arbitrary boundaries between ARTO and MISO State regulators worked hard on the settlement that includes single rate and IRCA MISO and ARTO have not resolved critical issues and now there needs significant bolstering of the IRAC effort Would like to work with FERC on details of Midwest issues They propose to create a Joint Board between FERC and State Regulators pursuant to section of the FPA to formalize a FERCmidwest partnership Panel One Mandatory RTO Markets The morning panel consisted of the following participants Peter Cramton University of Maryland David Hadley Indiana PSC Mark Kleinginna Ormet John Meyer Reliant John ONeal Mirant and Roy Shanker consultant for generators in the Northeast Energy Spot Market There was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a real time energy or spot market Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bidbased securityconstrained system with economic dispatch In response to a question from Pat Wood most also agreed that nodal LMP pricing should be used in the spot market although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also Day Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules Most of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules Peter Cramton said that with a dayahead market no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior John Meyer agrees saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement then there might be a need for a dayahead market John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement which he does not recommend or have a dayahead market ICAP Requirement Although this was an issue to be discussed by the second panel the issue was raised in the first panel when the discussion centered on ancillary services Most of the panelists except Peter Cramton support an ICAP requirement However none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week Mark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM He cannot enter into longterm contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response Standardized Markets Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and dayahead energy markets spinning and nonspinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized Massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs Breathitt asked whether there could be an entirely bilateral market with no mandatory balancing market All of the panelists agreed that you must have a real time energy market even with bilateral contracts Panel Two Optional RTO Markets The afternoon panel consisted of the following participants Fiona Woolfe lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool Roy Thilly Wisconsin Public Power Inc Richard Pierce professor at George Washington Glen Arthur Connecticut PSC Steve Naumann Commonwealth Edison Ed Cazalet APX This panel was intended to cover optional market issues including whether a dayahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market market monitoring and other issues Mandatory Markets Other than Ed Cazalet the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and dayahead energy market ancillary services markets and there must be an ICAP requirement Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market perhaps with balanced schedules requirements and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create ICAP Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a dayahead market congestion management and ancillary services Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market Pat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached and perhaps that should be considered here as well He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not Brownell said she thinks the ICAP debate is one that needs to be resolved now before RTOs are put in place She wonders whether ICAP requirements are needed in the interim until RTOs with working markets are up and running Not many of the panelists agreed with this saying temporary ICAP requirements will not send the needed signals to build Shelton Cannon Staff asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO can there be different ICAP requirements within the RTO Steve Naumann said he assumes two Midwest RTOs but most panelists agree that if the ICAP rules are the same within the RTO that there could be percentage requirement deviations Midwest Commissioners Proposal to Have a Joint Board Massey asked all the panelists what they thought of this idea None of the panelists even the Connecticut commissioner thought this was a good idea citing the inevitable disagreements and problems that will arise and the risk that such a Board could slow down progress Day Two of RTO Week focuses on Congestion Management in the morning and Transmission Planning and Expansion in the afternoon We will get summaries out on these panels tomorrow Please call me with questions or comments Sarah

Pat SubjectTeams for Upcoming FERC Proceedings As you know the Commission last week issued several important notices and papers regarding various policy initiatives that the Commission plans to ad dress over the next few months These issues are extremely important to En ron and we have been urging FERC to address and resolve most of these iss ues for many years There is now a Commission in charge that looks like it is ready to act and we need to be ready to respond In an effort to coordinate our efforts we have developed coverage teams to respond to these FERC initiatives The Washington advocacy group will als o work closely with all of these teams If someone is interested in a part icular issue and was not included on that team please feel free to call th e Project Lead to have your name added to the team All assistance is welc ome As you will see on the attached chart many of the deadlines for resp onding to these initiatives are within the next few weeks so the teams nee d to mobilize and establish a game plan for our responses very quickly On the attached chart we have listed in the left column each of the FERC i nitiatives that will be starting or are currently underway A Project Lea d has been named for each initiative The Project Lead will be responsibl e for developing and initiating a game plan for how Enron will respond in t he proceeding The Team Lead will be contacting each of you within the nex t couple of days to set up processes and procedures for moving forward Th e team will be responsible for the initial determination of what issues sho uld be addressed what is the best way for Enron to respond to them and pr oducing draft comments Once draft comments are prepared the comments wil l be circulated to a much wider group of Government Affairs and commercial people to ensure that the team has captured all of Enrons important issues There is a column of Inside Counsel and Outside Services In some area s we plan to use outside counsel or consultants and in others we do not Where we do not list outside counsel we will rely on our inside counsel to draft the comments with significant input from the team members Please remember however that even if outside services are listed the RCR proce ss must still be followed If applicable Project Leads should submit the necessary RCR request as soon as possible The following is a brief description of each proceeding and the Project Lea d named for each proceeding RTO Meetings and Comments to NOPR Sarah Novosel and Christi Nicolay will be the Project Leads in this proceeding The RTO meetings will be held in Washington from October and we hope to have an executive from Enron make a presentation on one of the panels Comments will be submitted to FE RC regarding the appropriate market design for RTOs This team will also b e responsible for these comments Standards of Conduct NOPR Lisa Yoho will be the Project Lead Comments a re due in approximately days Several issues are raised in this proceed ing including a proposal to apply the standards of conduct to a utilitys marketing affiliate buying and selling power to serve native load This is a significant action for FERC and we will strongly encourage the Commissio n to adopt this bold proposal ICAP Inquiry Christi Nicolay will be the Project Lead Chairman Wood has indicated that he is not very familiar with capacity and reserve requireme nts whether they are needed and what impact such requirements have on the market Enron has been a strong opponent of ICAP for many years and we p lan to show FERC that ICAP requirements are not needed We will submit exp ert testimony on this issue California Audit and Westwide Price Cap Mitigation Alan Comnes will be th e Project Lead Commissioner Brownell is leading a FERC audit of the Calif ornia ISO Although we do not have details of what the audit is intended t o cover or how expansive it will be we need to carefully monitor this proc eeding and have input into the audit process where possible Furthermore a request for rehearing is pending before the Commission regarding the curr ent price cap mitigation measures The Commission implemented these caps i n an effort to limit price spikes in California Californias summer peaki ng season is over but the Pacific Northwests winter peaking season will b e starting soon and the mitigation measures currently in effect could disc ourage power sellers from selling power to the Northwest where it will be needed this winter This team will be responsible for both of these procee dings Transmission Constraint and Energy Infrastructure Issues Steve Walton is the Project Lead FERC staff is studying two significant transmission cons traints Californias Path and the Central East Interface in New York and plans to have the study completed later this year The Commission p lans to forward the study to DOE The Commission stated that this is a hig h priority for it In a relating proceeding the Commission has stated tha t it will hold four open meetings in different regions of the country to id entify energy infrastructure issues The team will also oversee the progre ss in these proceedings Revised Public Utility Filing Requirements Susan Lindberg is the Project Lead The Commission has issued a NOPR proposing to require market partici pants to provide more information than is currently required including at

panel was RTO Markets and Design Required Markets and Optional Markets The issues from both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues All commissioners were present Shelton Cannon was the moderator and facilitator Purpose is to have intensive discussion to develop FERC guidance Focus is on functions rather than characteristics what should and should not be standardized Midwest Commissioners Presentation Several Midwest commissioners were invited to make an opening statement David Svanda Michigan PSC made the comments He said Midwest state regulators believe there are arbitrary boundaries between ARTO and MISO State regulators worked hard on the settlement that includes single rate and IRCA MISO and ARTO have not resolved critical issues and now there needs significant bolstering of the IRAC effort Would like to work with FERC on details of Midwest issues They propose to create a Joint Board between FERC and State Regulators pursuant to section of the FPA to formalize a FERCmidwest partnership Panel One Mandatory RTO Markets The morning panel consisted of the following participants Peter Cramton University of Maryland David Hadley Indiana PSC Mark Kleinginna Ormet John Meyer Reliant John ONeal Mirant and Roy Shanker consultant for generators in the Northeast Energy Spot Market There was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a real time energy or spot market Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bidbased securityconstrained system with economic dispatch In response to a question from Pat Wood most also agreed that nodal LMP pricing should be used in the spot market although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also Day Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules Most of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules Peter Cramton said that with a dayahead market no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior John Meyer agrees saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement then there might be a need for a dayahead market John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement which he does not recommend or have a dayahead market ICAP Requirement Although this was an issue to be discussed by the second panel the issue was raised in the first panel when the discussion centered on ancillary services Most of the panelists except Peter Cramton support an ICAP requirement However none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week Mark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM He cannot enter into longterm contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response Standardized Markets Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and dayahead energy markets spinning and nonspinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized Massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs Breathitt asked whether there could be an entirely bilateral market with no mandatory balancing market All of the panelists agreed that you must have a real time energy market even with bilateral contracts Panel Two Optional RTO Markets The afternoon panel consisted of the following participants Fiona Woolfe lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool Roy Thilly Wisconsin Public Power Inc Richard Pierce professor at George Washington Glen Arthur Connecticut PSC Steve Naumann Commonwealth Edison Ed Cazalet APX This panel was intended to cover optional market issues including whether a dayahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market market monitoring and other issues Mandatory Markets Other than Ed Cazalet the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and dayahead energy market ancillary services markets and there must be an ICAP requirement Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market perhaps with balanced schedules requirements and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create ICAP Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a dayahead market congestion management and ancillary services Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market Pat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached and perhaps that should be considered here as well He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not Brownell said she thinks the ICAP debate is one that needs to be resolved now before RTOs are put in place She wonders whether ICAP requirements are needed in the interim until RTOs with working markets are up and running Not many of the panelists agreed with this saying temporary ICAP requirements will not send the needed signals to build Shelton Cannon Staff asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO can there be different ICAP requirements within the RTO Steve Naumann said he assumes two Midwest RTOs but most panelists agree that if the ICAP rules are the same within the RTO that there could be percentage requirement deviations Midwest Commissioners Proposal to Have a Joint Board Massey asked all the panelists what they thought of this idea None of the panelists even the Connecticut commissioner thought this was a good idea citing the inevitable disagreements and problems that will arise and the risk that such a Board could slow down progress Day Two of RTO Week focuses on Congestion Management in the morning and Transmission Planning and Expansion in the afternoon We will get summaries out on these panels tomorrow Please call me with questions or comments Sarah

Rights The morning panel discussed congestion management The panelists were Na ncy Brockway Commissioner New Hampshire PSC Reem Fahey Edison Mission C arol Guthrie ChevronTexaco Shmuel Oren University of California Berkl ey and advises Texas PUC Andy Ott PJM Michael Schnitzer NorthBridge Gro up General Observations The Commissioners were again all present Wood left midmorning to give tes timony on Capitol Hill Today however FERC Staff was much more active i n the discussion and the commissioners asked very few questions The topic s are so interrelated that many of the same issues already discussed are be ing rehashed again This will probably continue for the rest of the week What I have found most encouraging so far has been the widespread support for some of the basic concepts most notably the need for a real time energ y market based using LMP Very few panelists have opposed this at most a couple of panelists have argued that the real time market should not be st andardized basically conceding that PJMs system is not going to change in the Northeast but urging that it not be mandated everywhere else Opening Statements Nancy Brockway focus on two topics flowgate vs LMP and relation ship between congestion management CM and resource planning She support s LMP and standard market design in New England Flowgate rights are cumbe rsome create unnecessary uplift costs freezing power distribution factor s is bad and could result in some free rides She is a Hogan follower and Hogan says flowgates can be done but are too difficult With regard to th e relationship between CM and resource planning transmission is a monopoly and the CM principle is that entrepreneurs make a decision decide where to site generation or transmission and take a risk FERC should not overr ide that principle Proposals for transmission expansion can undercut cong estion management Reem Fahey RTO needs to be the grid operator and the market operator Ca nnot use different bid stacks for balancing and congestion CM should have a bidbased structure with LMP Design of CM should allow flexibility for market participants to be in the spot and forward markets Transmission r ights must be financial and not physical and must allow for financial hed ging in real time FERC should work towards the creation of trading hubs a nd market participants should have rights from hub to hub and hub to load These rights should not interfere with real time dispatch of the system Carol Guthrie Her company has diverse interests in electricity market o ver service locations over suppliers more than sites where t hey have industrial generation serving own load MW Shmuel Oren Advocates minimal ISOs direct assignment of congestion costs in real time flowgate rights proposal because it requires less centralize d coordination and supports forward rights Does not support one size fit s all Need to understand gaming modes of market failure Problems in T exas people scheduled to cause congestion and then were paid to relieve t he congestion Need to charge for true congestion when it is predictable Andy Ott There is consensus in the industry that locational pricing works Its an operational tool used to manage reliability of the gird during c onstraints PJM has been using nodal pricing since Utilities have r un their system on this approach for years economic dispatch to meet dema nd Cannot do balancing and CM separately does not work Transmission rights must be financial Spot market is physical Financial model is the hedging You need this separation because it allows players to do bilater als or buy or sell from the spot market Also allows FTRs to be traded and used to protect from congestion Michael Schnitzer There is a preferred method of CM the LMP based CM sy stem with financial rights DAM and RT bidbased security constrained loca tional pricing markets Bilateral transactions are allowed Transmission rights must be financial not physical Allows transmission users to hedge congestion costs Why is CM so important Need to get the prices right t o give the right signals to the market Three goals get dispatch righ t show bilateral contracts and load the right price signal so they can re spond accordingly price signals to generation for location purposes c larifies responsibility and risk allocations market signals for when to expand the grid LMP gives economic price signal and property right in FT Rs Locational Marginal Pricing The panelists all agreed that LMP in the real time market is necessary Sch muel Oren does not oppose it Most of the panelists think this needs to b e standardized across RTOs Andy Ott says the seams will remain a problem and a barrier to trading if the real time market is not standardized Car ol Guthrie does not favor standardization and urged FERC to not standardize the PJM system throughout the eastern interconnect She said FERC should try a couple of different systems and see what works FTRs versus Flowgates The panelists agreed that transmission rights should be financial not phys ical Schmuel conceded this point for the discussion but this may not be h is preference unclear Most of the panelists including the PSC commissi oner prefer FTRs rather than flowgates Schmuel is a flowgate advocate After some discussion the panelists agreed that FTRs and flowgates could w ork together provided that the definition of flowgate is understood Andy Ott said flowgates could work with FTRs if the purpose of having flowgates is the same purpose of having hubs liquidity standard product and if a flowgate is defined as a grouping of pointtopoint rights then FTRs and flowgates can coexist If a flowgate is a hub for transmission rights it s okay However if flowgate is defined as a physical boundary requiring s cheduling the two cannot coexist Schmuel seemed to agree with this premi se although this is not his preference He seems to prefer only flowgates without FTRs Brockway seems to prefer FTRs rather than flowgates for fe ar that flowgates will result in excess socialization of costs The panelists also agreed generally that revenues generated from FTRs or fl owgates should be allocated to load but the method of allocation was not a greed upon FERC staff asked the panelists to discuss commercially significant flowgate s Many of the panelists discussed the problem with deciding what constitu tes a commercially significant flowgate and what happens when circumstance s change over time resulting in different flowgates being commercially sig nificant Schmuel said you could use either a system that relies only on c ommercially significant flowgates or one that uses all flowgates but if pa rticipants are willing to accept a system where they are not perfectly hedg ed use of commercially significant flowgates is acceptable The panelists agreed that these financial rights either FTRs or flowgates should be tr adable in the secondary market The panelists disagreed on whether FTRs or flowgates are actually more tradable Andy thinks FTRs are more tradable Schmuel thinks flowgates are more tradable Options versus Obligations The panelists discussed the benefits of having FTRs be options but also dis cussed the additional problems presented to the system operator if FTRs are only options and the FTR holder is not required to flow or pay if it does not flow Andy

Pat SubjectTeams for Upcoming FERC Proceedings As you know the Commission last week issued several important notices and papers regarding various policy initiatives that the Commission plans to ad dress over the next few months These issues are extremely important to En ron and we have been urging FERC to address and resolve most of these iss ues for many years There is now a Commission in charge that looks like it is ready to act and we need to be ready to respond In an effort to coordinate our efforts we have developed coverage teams to respond to these FERC initiatives The Washington advocacy group will als o work closely with all of these teams If someone is interested in a part icular issue and was not included on that team please feel free to call th e Project Lead to have your name added to the team All assistance is welc ome As you will see on the attached chart many of the deadlines for resp onding to these initiatives are within the next few weeks so the teams nee d to mobilize and establish a game plan for our responses very quickly On the attached chart we have listed in the left column each of the FERC i nitiatives that will be starting or are currently underway A Project Lea d has been named for each initiative The Project Lead will be responsibl e for developing and initiating a game plan for how Enron will respond in t he proceeding The Team Lead will be contacting each of you within the nex t couple of days to set up processes and procedures for moving forward Th e team will be responsible for the initial determination of what issues sho uld be addressed what is the best way for Enron to respond to them and pr oducing draft comments Once draft comments are prepared the comments wil l be circulated to a much wider group of Government Affairs and commercial people to ensure that the team has captured all of Enrons important issues There is a column of Inside Counsel and Outside Services In some area s we plan to use outside counsel or consultants and in others we do not Where we do not list outside counsel we will rely on our inside counsel to draft the comments with significant input from the team members Please remember however that even if outside services are listed the RCR proce ss must still be followed If applicable Project Leads should submit the necessary RCR request as soon as possible The following is a brief description of each proceeding and the Project Lea d named for each proceeding RTO Meetings and Comments to NOPR Sarah Novosel and Christi Nicolay will be the Project Leads in this proceeding The RTO meetings will be held in Washington from October and we hope to have an executive from Enron make a presentation on one of the panels Comments will be submitted to FE RC regarding the appropriate market design for RTOs This team will also b e responsible for these comments Standards of Conduct NOPR Lisa Yoho will be the Project Lead Comments a re due in approximately days Several issues are raised in this proceed ing including a proposal to apply the standards of conduct to a utilitys marketing affiliate buying and selling power to serve native load This is a significant action for FERC and we will strongly encourage the Commissio n to adopt this bold proposal ICAP Inquiry Christi Nicolay will be the Project Lead Chairman Wood has indicated that he is not very familiar with capacity and reserve requireme nts whether they are needed and what impact such requirements have on the market Enron has been a strong opponent of ICAP for many years and we p lan to show FERC that ICAP requirements are not needed We will submit exp ert testimony on this issue California Audit and Westwide Price Cap Mitigation Alan Comnes will be th e Project Lead Commissioner Brownell is leading a FERC audit of the Calif ornia ISO Although we do not have details of what the audit is intended t o cover or how expansive it will be we need to carefully monitor this proc eeding and have input into the audit process where possible Furthermore a request for rehearing is pending before the Commission regarding the curr ent price cap mitigation measures The Commission implemented these caps i n an effort to limit price spikes in California Californias summer peaki ng season is over but the Pacific Northwests winter peaking season will b e starting soon and the mitigation measures currently in effect could disc ourage power sellers from selling power to the Northwest where it will be needed this winter This team will be responsible for both of these procee dings Transmission Constraint and Energy Infrastructure Issues Steve Walton is the Project Lead FERC staff is studying two significant transmission cons traints Californias Path and the Central East Interface in New York and plans to have the study completed later this year The Commission p lans to forward the study to DOE The Commission stated that this is a hig h priority for it In a relating proceeding the Commission has stated tha t it will hold four open meetings in different regions of the country to id entify energy infrastructure issues The team will also oversee the progre ss in these proceedings Revised Public Utility Filing Requirements Susan Lindberg is the Project Lead The Commission has issued a NOPR proposing to require market partici pants to provide more information than is currently required including at least seven additional data points per transaction This will have a signi ficant administrative burden on Enron and could require the disclosure of c ommercially sensitive information Comments are due

Leslie Radford Pat Subject Teams for Upcoming FERC Proceedings As you know the Commission last week issued several important notices and papers regarding various policy initiatives that the Commission plans to ad dress over the next few months These issues are extremely important to En ron and we have been urging FERC to address and resolve most of these iss ues for many years There is now a Commission in charge that looks like it is ready to act and we need to be ready to respond In an effort to coordinate our efforts we have developed coverage teams to respond to these FERC initiatives The Washington advocacy group will als o work closely with all of these teams If someone is interested in a part icular issue and was not included on that team please feel free to call th e Project Lead to have your name added to the team All assistance is welc ome As you will see on the attached chart many of the deadlines for resp onding to these initiatives are within the next few weeks so the teams nee d to mobilize and establish a game plan for our responses very quickly On the attached chart we have listed in the left column each of the FERC i nitiatives that will be starting or are currently underway A Project Lea d has been named for each initiative The Project Lead will be responsibl e for developing and initiating a game plan for how Enron will respond in t he proceeding The Team Lead will be contacting each of you within the nex t couple of days to set up processes and procedures for moving forward Th e team will be responsible for the initial determination of what issues sho uld be addressed what is the best way for Enron to respond to them and pr oducing draft comments Once draft comments are prepared the comments wil l be circulated to a much wider group of Government Affairs and commercial people to ensure that the team has captured all of Enrons important issues There is a column of Inside Counsel and Outside Services In some area s we plan to use outside counsel or consultants and in others we do not Where we do not list outside counsel we will rely on our inside counsel to draft the comments with significant input from the team members Please remember however that even if outside services are listed the RCR proce ss must still be followed If applicable Project Leads should submit the necessary RCR request as soon as possible The following is a brief description of each proceeding and the Project Lea d named for each proceeding RTO Meetings and Comments to NOPR Sarah Novosel and Christi Nicolay will be the Project Leads in this proceeding The RTO meetings will be held in Washington from October and we hope to have an executive from Enron make a presentation on one of the panels Comments will be submitted to FE RC regarding the appropriate market design for RTOs This team will also b e responsible for these comments Standards of Conduct NOPR Lisa Yoho will be the Project Lead Comments a re due in approximately days Several issues are raised in this proceed ing including a proposal to apply the standards of conduct to a utilitys marketing affiliate buying and selling power to serve native load This is a significant action for FERC and we will strongly encourage the Commissio n to adopt this bold proposal ICAP Inquiry Christi Nicolay will be the Project Lead Chairman Wood has indicated that he is not very familiar with capacity and reserve requireme nts whether they are needed and what impact such requirements have on the market Enron has been a strong opponent of ICAP for many years and we p lan to show FERC that ICAP requirements are not needed We will submit exp ert testimony on this issue California Audit and Westwide Price Cap Mitigation Alan Comnes will be th e Project Lead Commissioner Brownell is leading a FERC audit of the Calif ornia ISO Although we do not have details of what the audit is intended t o cover or how expansive it will be we need to carefully monitor this proc eeding and have input into the audit process where possible Furthermore a request for rehearing is pending before the Commission regarding the curr ent price cap mitigation measures The Commission implemented these caps i n an effort to limit price spikes in California Californias summer peaki ng season is over but the Pacific Northwests winter peaking season will b e starting soon and the mitigation measures currently in effect could disc ourage power sellers from selling power to the Northwest where it will be needed this winter This team will be responsible for both of these procee dings Transmission Constraint and Energy Infrastructure Issues Steve Walton is the Project Lead FERC staff is studying two significant transmission cons traints Californias Path and the Central East Interface in New York and plans to have the study completed later this year The Commission p lans to forward the study to DOE The Commission stated that this is a hig h priority for it In a relating proceeding the Commission has stated tha t it will hold four open meetings in different regions of the country to id entify energy infrastructure issues The team will also oversee the progre ss in these proceedings Revised Public Utility Filing Requirements Susan Lindberg is the Project Lead The Commission has issued a NOPR proposing to require market partici pants to provide more information than is currently required including at least seven additional data points per transaction This will have a signi ficant administrative burden on Enron and could require the disclosure of c ommercially sensitive information Comments are due on October California Refund Proceeding Ray Alvarez is the Project Lead The Commis sion has ordered power sellers to pay refunds for sales made to the Califor nia ISO from October through June and has established a h earing proceeding to resolve issues of material fact Pacific Northwest Refund Proceeding Bob Frank is the Project Lead The J udge

HARRIS AM To cc Andrea Settanni Subject Portland General Electric Order Rejecting Tariff Amendments FERC UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION Before Commissioners Curt Hbert Jr Chairman William L Massey Linda Breathitt Pat Wood III and Nora Mead Brownell Portland General Electric Company Docket No ER Enron Power Marketing Inc Docket No ER ORDER REJECTING TARIFF AMENDMENTS WITHOUT PREJUDICE Issued July In this order we reject without prejudice proposed amendments of Enron Power Marketing Inc EPMI and Portland General Electric PGE to their respective marketbased rate tariffs that would allow them to make interaffiliate sales using the EnronOnline trading platform I Background On May in separate filings affiliates PGE in Docket No ER and EPMI in Docket No ER collectively Applicants filed to amend their respective market based rate schedules to allow for interaffiliate sales through the EnronOnline trading platform and to prohibit communication among affiliates regarding the contents of prices posted on EnronOnline or the times that PGE will be making trades on EnronOnline This amendment does not supplant the existing provisions of PGEs and EPMIs currently effective tariffs which allow for interaffiliate sales subject to conditions that the Commission generally imposes on interaffiliate sales where there are captive customers eg allowing a public utility to sell to its affiliated power marketer only at a rate that is no lower than the rate it charges nonaffiliates requiring simultaneous offers to nonaffiliates or requiring use of a relevant established index Rather PGE and EPMI propose to amend their respective tariffs to add a provision by which they will make The EnronOnline system is administered by Enron Networks an Enron Corp subsidiary EnronOnline is a free Internet based transaction system which allows EPMIs customers to view real time prices from EPMIs traders and transact instantly online EnronOnline is not an EPMI application but rather EnronOnline is a trading platform used as a tool by EPMI in buying from and selling power to third parties Docket Nos ER and ER interaffiliate sales via EnronOnline with restrictions different than those in place but that they state will still prevent affiliate abuse Applicants state that the Commissions requirements have become outdated due to recent developments in electronic commerce and in particular the Commissions requirement that PGE post on its website notice of a potential purchase or sale with EPMI prior to PGE entering into the transaction with EPMI prohibits PGE from using EnronOnline since EnronOnline offers only instantaneous transactions that do not provide for a waiting period before consummating the transaction According to Applicants this deprives PGE of the ability to buy or sell power from perhaps the largest marketer in its region to the detriment of PGE and its ratepayers II Notice of Filing and InterventionsProtests Notices of the filings were published in the Federal Register Fed Reg Docket No ER and Fed Reg Docket No ER with motions to intervene and protests for both due on or before June None was filed III Discussion The Commission allows power marketers and their public utility affiliates to sell to one another at marketbased rates when it can be assured that there is no possibility of affiliate abuse As the Commission has explained affiliate abuse can occur when a traditional public utility with captive customers sells power at belowmarket prices to or purchases power at abovemarket prices from an affiliate without captive customers such as a power marketer affiliate One way in which the Commission has sought to prevent this type of crosssubsidization by captive customers is to require the pricing of interaffiliate sales at an established relevant market price or index Another way when there is no assurance that the affiliates are transacting at the prevailing market price is to adopt various conditions previously established by the Commission to prevent affiliate abuse EPMI Application at PGE Application at EPMI Application at PGE Application at See eg DPL Energy Inc FERC accord First Energy Trading Services Inc FERC at Eg GPU Advanced Resources Inc FERC at continued Docket Nos ER and ER Here Applicants request that the Commission permit them to use EnronOnline to make interaffiliate sales subject to the following restrictions that they contend provide sufficient protection against affiliate abuse PGE when buying from EPMI using EnronOnline will be required to take the transaction price as posted that is generally applicable at a particular location without attempting to negotiate any adjustment In addition PGE will be prohibited from submitting Limit Orders or engaging in any other type of transaction in which the identity of the counterparty is revealed to EPMI prior to the transaction being finalized Applicants also propose to amend their respective codes of conduct to preclude any communication regarding prices posted on EnronOnline Applicants contend such restrictions ensure no affiliate abuse occurs since PGE will only be able to transact with EPMI at continued GPU Detroit Edison Company FERC at Detroit Edison In GPU the Commission allowed sales from a power marketer to its affiliated traditional public utility at a rate that was no higher than the lowest rate the public utility paid nonaffiliates under certain standard supplier agreements Accord First Energy Trading Power Marketing Inc FERC at rehg denied FERC Detroit Edison provided that a traditional public utility may sell power to its affiliated power marketer only at a rate that is no lower than the rate it charges non affiliates that the utility simultaneously offer through its electronic bulletin board to sell to nonaffiliates at the same rate offered to its affiliate and that all prices charged to the affiliate be simultaneously posted on its electronic bulletin board Accord Jersey Central Power Light Co FERC at Commonwealth Edison Co FERC at EPMI Application at PGE Application at In the case of a Limit Order on EnronOnline EPMI would know the identity of the customer requesting a price higher or lower than that currently available Applications at While Applicants do not define Limit Order the common understanding is that unlike a market order which instructs a broker to transact immediately at whatever price is currently available in the marketplace a limit order instructs a broker to fill the order only if certain conditions are met Generally a limit order may be either a day order in which case it expires when the market closes if unfilled or gooduntilcanceled in which case the limit order lasts until executed or canceled Docket Nos ER and ER the posted price a price that is offered to all market participants and there will be no transactions in which EPMI knows that PGE is the counterparty before the transaction is finalized Thus Applicants contend that not only will PGE be unable to negotiate special terms with EPMI through EnronOnline but EPMI will have no discretion to take actions which favor PGE Applicants further offer that procedures are performed by computer and are not left to the discretion of any affiliate of PGE In addition because the EnronOnline price is posted electronically and is available to all market participants Applicants state that PGEs customers have the opportunity to transact with EPMI on EnronOnline on the same terms and conditions that are available to PGE Applicants have failed to demonstrate that their proposed restrictions provide the same protections afforded under the Commissions affiliate abuse requirements and conditions eg protection against PGE buying too high or selling too low in its transactions with its affiliate EPMI The thrust of Applicants argument is that the Commissions affiliate abuse concerns are satisfied by using EnronOnline a public medium for selling power between affiliates We disagree While perhaps faster and easier to use than phone calls faxes or letters an Internetbased platform is just another medium for trade and speed and ease of use do not dictate that the Commissions affiliate abuse concerns have been satisfied There is for example no assurance that the posted prices on EnronOnline represent prevailing market prices Applicants contend that since PGE can transact with EPMI via EnronOnline only at the posted price there can be no affiliate abuse We are not certain however that the posted price necessarily represents the market price While on the surface Enron Online may bear some resemblance to an index or an auction the posted prices for any product may not be the result of a competitive market of multiple buyers and sellers in fact for sales the posted prices represent what EPMI is willing to sell at and for purchases the posted prices represent what EPMI is willing to buy at For other transactions through media other than EnronOnline including other exchanges EPMI might be See supra notes and accompanying text citing cases that discuss Commissions underlying concerns with affiliate power sales See supra note and accompanying text All transaction on EnronOnline involve EPMI as a participant For sales EPMI is the seller For purchases EPMI is the buyer Docket Nos ER and ER willing to sell at lower prices and buy at higher prices Moreover Applicants provide no information about how product prices posted by EPMI are determined or whether there would be any restrictions on what products PGE could trade via EnronOnline or even whether there are other similar but non affiliated Internetbased venues where PGE can electronically trade those products to attain similar benefits Having failed to convince us that these affiliates will be transacting at a prevailing market price via EnronOnline we now turn to whether the Applicants have met other conditions established by the Commission to prevent affiliate abuse Regarding transactions in which EPMI may be purchasing from PGE through EnronOnline there is nothing in the Applicants proposed restrictions that would require PGE to simultaneously offer to sell to nonaffiliates at the same rate offered to the affiliate The Commission requires that with respect to any power offered to its affiliate PGE make the same offer to unaffiliated entities at the same time through its electronic bulletin board But it is unclear whether PGE can or will make the same offer to nonaffiliates Applicants also offer as a protection that PGE is prohibited from submitting Limit Orders which would prevent EPMI from knowing that PGE is the counterparty to a transaction Again this would not prevent EPMI from selling power to PGE at above market prices The Commission is not assured by the Applicants proposal that transactions between PGE and EPMI conducted via EnronOnline will occur in a manner that is consistent with the Commissions expectations regarding transparent and reasonable prices for interaffiliate power sales transactions There is for example no provision in the proposed amendments regarding how unaffiliated customers or other interested parties would monitor interaffiliate transactions For the above reasons we will reject the proposed amendments without prejudice to Applicants revising their proposal to address the Commissions concerns and incorporating appropriate restrictions to protect against affiliate abuse Likewise PGE might be willing to buy at lower prices and sell at higher prices Docket Nos ER and ER The Commission orders Applicants proposed tariff amendments are hereby rejected without prejudice as discussed in the body of this order By the Commission S E A L David P Boergers Secretary

Light Co mpany General Observations The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time Massey left la te in the afternoon FERC Staff was active in the discussion however t he commissioners were very active as well asking perhaps as much as of all questions There was a general consensus that standards were needed much discussion focused simply on how much and by who The Commission seeme d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo rward and how far they needed to go Panelists urged the need to mover for ward as quickly as possible but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward There was d iscussion on identifying which industry group NERC or GISB would take the reins in the future On an interesting tangential note there was noticea ble conflict between NERC and GISB with veiled insults between the two org anizations somewhat common during the discussions FERC Deliverables A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne eded from the Commission Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical The first major topic was How many RTOs What is their scope All panel ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b y FERC in strong definitive language N o one offered any specific langua ge but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement The next topic was What will be standard market design Panelists varie d on this but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent Some urged f or one mandatory design for North America one supported a set of rigid sta ndard designs one supported a single design with requests for exceptions followed by an indepth review process and one seemed to prefer the curre nt situation The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha t the industry needed to move forward They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions asking questions like Do we need to issue a MegaOrder that addresses all these issues and How much detail do you need us to provide General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas Kormos and Burkes went so far as t o say FERC should Mandate as much as they felt comfortable and then go a little further Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea bu t in general did not oppose the concept citing only general warnings and t he need for cautious investigation One item of interest Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th e RTO Design and RTO Implementation section would address many of the que stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design Korm os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry The se ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote and asked the following questions Congestion Management When Operational Security Violations occu r how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i s nonetheless efficient Will LMP based systems be standard or will there be others that must be accommodated Transmission Service Are transmission services required to sch edule covered schedules only or are they risk management tools protect ing from congestion charges both covered and uncovered schedules are a llowed Loop Flows Are contractpath based or flowbased transmission services appropriate If contractpath based how are parallel path issues to be addressed Grandfathered Transmission Service Should contracts existing pr ior to RTO development be transferred or is there an equitable way to reti re those contracts Are there other solutions Energy Imbalance Markets How are imbalance markets to function Will they serve as realtime energy markets support unbalanced schedules be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service require balanced sche dules or will they be required at all Ancillary Services Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services required to schedule or will they be treated primarily as fina ncial instruments protecting against realtime POLR charges Losses Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce ss or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs but technical ly unwieldy NonJurisdictionals How are nonjurisdictionals to be integrate d into the new world Should systems be designed with the assumption that nonjurisdictional will be part of an RTO Or should they be designed to t reat each NJE as a separate entity Hopefully FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica l questions in an assertive manner and give some solid direction in which to move Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions pointing out that vague answers ie do congestion management will t ake a year or two to resolve but specific answers ie LMP with financi al hedging instruments will take only months The Commission asked Mike about moving forward and he told them that effectively it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed Now for a funny point One of the commissioners I think Breathitt refer red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest Kormos flat out said My profession is understanding how power systems work and I dont believe that that statement is true He then backpedaled a bit and said t hat it would need more study but he stood by his statement that the assert ion by the Northwest interests was false NERC and GISB A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standardse tting organization Massey went so far as to ask Are we looking at a bea uty contest between NERC and GISB Cook and Boswell then went into

established trust and respect in GI SB while Cook preferred to only talk about the new structure of NERC and did not focus on its history Brownell offered some nottoosubtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions ie were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder GISB was easily a ble to say they were not but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation Poin t Brownell Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC playing Dave Cooks yesm an He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERCs suppos ed successes such as TLR and ETag If staffers have tenure they will likely remember that these successes have not been so successful resulti ng in several filings and interventions We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues but general consensus was that I could not be done There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISBEISB The arguments began winding down after a some time and Boswell strongly ur ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward NERC s omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position In general I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top Let me know if you have any questions Andy

<13737163.1075852529033.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,sarah.novosel@enron.com,2001-10-15 20:21:17,Summary of RTO Week Day OneToday was the first day of FERCs RTO Week in Washington DC The topic of todays panel was RTO Markets and Design Required Markets and Optional Markets The issues from both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues All commissioners were present Shelton Cannon was the moderator and facilitator Purpose is to have intensive discussion to develop FERC guidance Focus is on functions rather than characteristics what should and should not be standardized Midwest Commissioners Presentation Several Midwest commissioners were invited to make an opening statement David Svanda Michigan PSC made the comments He said Midwest state regulators believe there are arbitrary boundaries between ARTO and MISO State regulators worked hard on the settlement that includes single rate and IRCA MISO and ARTO have not resolved critical issues and now there needs significant bolstering of the IRAC effort Would like to work with FERC on details of Midwest issues They propose to create a Joint Board between FERC and State Regulators pursuant to section of the FPA to formalize a FERCmidwest partnership Panel One Mandatory RTO Markets The morning panel consisted of the following participants Peter Cramton University of Maryland David Hadley Indiana PSC Mark Kleinginna Ormet John Meyer Reliant John ONeal Mirant and Roy Shanker consultant for generators in the Northeast Energy Spot Market There was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a real time energy or spot market Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bidbased securityconstrained system with economic dispatch In response to a question from Pat Wood most also agreed that nodal LMP pricing should be used in the spot market although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also Day Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules Most of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules Peter Cramton said that with a dayahead market no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior John Meyer agrees saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement then there might be a need for a dayahead market John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement which he does not recommend or have a dayahead market ICAP Requirement Although this was an issue to be discussed by the second panel the issue was raised in the first panel when the discussion centered on ancillary services Most of the panelists except Peter Cramton support an ICAP requirement However none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week Mark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM He cannot enter into longterm contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response Standardized Markets Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and dayahead energy markets spinning and nonspinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized Massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs Breathitt asked whether there could be an entirely bilateral market with no mandatory balancing market All of the panelists agreed that you must have a real time energy market even with bilateral contracts Panel Two Optional RTO Markets The afternoon panel consisted of the following participants Fiona Woolfe lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool Roy Thilly Wisconsin Public Power Inc Richard Pierce professor at George Washington Glen Arthur Connecticut PSC Steve Naumann Commonwealth Edison Ed Cazalet APX This panel was intended to cover optional market issues including whether a dayahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market market monitoring and other issues Mandatory Markets Other than Ed Cazalet the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and dayahead energy market ancillary services markets and there must be an ICAP requirement Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market perhaps with balanced schedules requirements and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create ICAP Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a dayahead market congestion management and ancillary services Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market Pat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached and perhaps that should be considered here as well He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not Brownell said she thinks the ICAP debate is one that needs to be resolved now before RTOs are put in place She wonders whether ICAP requirements are needed in the interim until RTOs with working markets are up and running Not many of the panelists agreed with this saying temporary ICAP requirements will not send the needed signals to build Shelton Cannon Staff asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO can there be different ICAP requirements within the RTO Steve Naumann said he assumes two Midwest RTOs but most panelists agree that if the ICAP rules are the same within the RTO that there could be percentage requirement deviations Midwest Commissioners Proposal to Have a Joint Board Massey asked all the panelists what they thought of this idea None of the panelists even the Connecticut commissioner thought this was a good idea citing the inevitable disagreements and problems that will arise and the risk that such a Board could slow down progress Day Two of RTO Week focuses on

Rights The morning panel discussed congestion management The panelists were Na ncy Brockway Commissioner New Hampshire PSC Reem Fahey Edison Mission C arol Guthrie ChevronTexaco Shmuel Oren University of California Berkl ey and advises Texas PUC Andy Ott PJM Michael Schnitzer NorthBridge Gro up General Observations The Commissioners were again all present Wood left midmorning to give tes timony on Capitol Hill Today however FERC Staff was much more active i n the discussion and the commissioners asked very few questions The topic s are so interrelated that many of the same issues already discussed are be ing rehashed again This will probably continue for the rest of the week What I have found most encouraging so far has been the widespread support for some of the basic concepts most notably the need for a real time energ y market based using LMP Very few panelists have opposed this at most a couple of panelists have argued that the real time market should not be st andardized basically conceding that PJMs system is not going to change in the Northeast but urging that it not be mandated everywhere else Opening Statements Nancy Brockway focus on two topics flowgate vs LMP and relation ship between congestion management CM and resource planning She support s LMP and standard market design in New England Flowgate rights are cumbe rsome create unnecessary uplift costs freezing power distribution factor s is bad and could result in some free rides She is a Hogan follower and Hogan says flowgates can be done but are too difficult With regard to th e relationship between CM and resource planning transmission is a monopoly and the CM principle is that entrepreneurs make a decision decide where to site generation or transmission and take a risk FERC should not overr ide that principle Proposals for transmission expansion can undercut cong estion management Reem Fahey RTO needs to be the grid operator and the market operator Ca nnot use different bid stacks for balancing and congestion CM should have a bidbased structure with LMP Design of CM should allow flexibility for market participants to be in the spot and forward markets Transmission r ights must be financial and not physical and must allow for financial hed ging in real time FERC should work towards the creation of trading hubs a nd market participants should have rights from hub to hub and hub to load These rights should not interfere with real time dispatch of the system Carol Guthrie Her company has diverse interests in electricity market o ver service locations over suppliers more than sites where t hey have industrial generation serving own load MW Shmuel Oren Advocates minimal ISOs direct assignment of congestion costs in real time flowgate rights proposal because it requires less centralize d coordination and supports forward rights Does not support one size fit s all Need to understand gaming modes of market failure Problems in T exas people scheduled to cause congestion and then were paid to relieve t he congestion Need to charge for true congestion when it is predictable Andy Ott There is consensus in the industry that locational pricing works Its an operational tool used to manage reliability of the gird during c onstraints PJM has been using nodal pricing since Utilities have r un their system on this approach for years economic dispatch to meet dema nd Cannot do balancing and CM separately does not work Transmission rights must be financial Spot market is physical Financial model is the hedging You need this separation because it allows players to do bilater als or buy or sell from the spot market Also allows FTRs to be traded and used to protect from congestion Michael Schnitzer There is a preferred method of CM the LMP based CM sy stem with financial rights DAM and RT bidbased security constrained loca tional pricing markets Bilateral transactions are allowed Transmission rights must be financial not physical Allows transmission users to hedge congestion costs Why is CM so important Need to get the prices right t o give the right signals to the market Three goals get dispatch righ t show bilateral contracts and load the right price signal so they can re spond accordingly price signals to generation for location purposes c larifies responsibility and risk allocations market signals for when to expand the grid LMP gives economic price signal and property right in FT Rs Locational Marginal Pricing The panelists all agreed that LMP in the real time market is necessary Sch muel Oren does not oppose it Most of the panelists think this needs to b e standardized across RTOs Andy Ott says the seams will remain a problem and a barrier to trading if the real time market is not standardized Car ol Guthrie does not favor standardization and urged FERC to not standardize the PJM system throughout the eastern interconnect She said FERC should try a couple of different systems and see what works FTRs versus Flowgates The panelists agreed that transmission rights should be financial not phys ical Schmuel conceded this point for the discussion but this may not be h is preference unclear Most of the panelists including the PSC commissi oner prefer FTRs rather than flowgates Schmuel is a flowgate advocate After some discussion the panelists agreed that FTRs and flowgates could w ork together provided that the definition of flowgate is understood Andy Ott said flowgates could work with FTRs if the purpose of having flowgates is the same purpose of having hubs liquidity standard product and if a flowgate is defined as a grouping of pointtopoint rights then FTRs and flowgates can coexist If a flowgate is a hub for transmission rights it s okay However if flowgate is defined as a physical boundary requiring s cheduling the two cannot coexist Schmuel seemed to agree with this premi se although this is not his preference He seems to prefer only flowgates without FTRs Brockway seems to prefer FTRs rather than flowgates for fe ar that flowgates will result in excess socialization of costs The panelists also agreed generally that revenues generated from FTRs or fl owgates should be allocated to load but the method of allocation was not a greed upon FERC staff asked the panelists to discuss commercially significant flowgate s Many of the panelists discussed the problem with deciding what constitu tes a commercially significant flowgate and what happens when circumstance s change over time resulting in different flowgates being commercially sig nificant Schmuel said you could use either a system that relies only on c ommercially significant flowgates or one that uses all flowgates but if pa rticipants are willing to accept a system where they are not perfectly hedg ed use of commercially significant flowgates is acceptable The panelists agreed that these financial rights either FTRs or flowgates should be tr adable in the secondary market The panelists disagreed on whether FTRs or flowgates are actually more tradable Andy thinks FTRs are more tradable Schmuel thinks flowgates are more tradable Options versus Obligations The panelists discussed the benefits of having FTRs be options but also dis cussed the additional problems presented to the system operator if FTRs are only options and the FTR holder is not required to flow or pay if it does not flow Andy Ott said options will most likely result in fewer FTRs bein g allocated Schnitzer says the issue must be resolved up front The afternoon panel was on Transmission Planning and Expansion Steve Walt on was a panelist and will be providing a summary of the discussion shortly Let me know if you have any questions Sarah

proceeding issued his report to the Commission on the day mediation session Although not unexpected but still disappointing the Judge endorses the market design proposal of the New York and New England ISOs This market design proposal encompasses a long drawn out process for discussing what the Northeast market should look like minimum months before work begins to develop the new RTO The target implementation date of the ISOs is November but the proposal clearly states that this time frame is subject to extension if new design requirements are introduced We believe the true intent of the ISOs is to delay indefinitely this process in order to retain the three existing ISO structures A copy of the Judges report and the Business Plan are attached One good aspect of the Judges report is that he asks in several areas of the report for Commission guidance We too believe this is necessary It became quite evident early in the mediation proceeding that we were not going to agree with the New York entities or the New England ISO on market design or governance We argued that FERC intended the new market design to be primarily the PJM system with enhancements where possible Others relying on the ambiguity in FERCs orders argued that FERC really intended to create a new system using PJM as the platform but pulling heavily from the other two ISOs regardless of time or complication of creating this new market We need FERC direction on this and the Judge makes this clear Background The Judges primary goal of this day mediation process was simply to establish a business plan which lays out how and when a single Northeast RTO will be created Enron along with many other participants opposed this approach arguing that we are wasting the days given to us by the Commission The Judge acknowledges in his report that there was significant opposition to his approach but he thinks it worked out perfectly Although the majority of the Judges report and the business plan focuses mainly on process for creating the business plan he does discuss two substantive issues market design and governance Market Design At the beginning of the mediation PJM NY and NE submitted a joint proposal for forming a single Northeast RTO This proposal envisions a timeintensive approached designed to reach agreement by all stakeholders with an implementation date in years Option Mof the Business Plan This proposal is now supported by the New England and New York ISOs PJM has its own approach see below The New York transmission owners also submitted a proposal for implementing the new RTO in years Option M of the Business Plan PJM submitted an alternative proposal for creating and implementing a single Northeast RTO with a single dayahead and realtime energy market by November Option M of the Business Plan We took the lead in creating a coalition of marketers generators PJM TOs industrials and other end use customers The One RTO Coalition advocating the creation of a single energy market based on PJMs system by December but no later than May Although we Enron believe PJMs November time frame is too conservative the coalition supports Option M PJMs approach since it achieves the Coalitions goals albeit on a slower timetable As noted above the Judge endorses Option M in part because it has a builtin a process for determining Best Practices Although PJM also conducted a best practices analysis the other ISOs and NY TOs do not agree with PJMs determinations of what practices from their ISOs are best practices The Judge acknowledges that support for Option M the PJM plan far outstrips the other options in diversity and extent of stakeholder support However the Judge believes that the PJM option assumes the PJM platform can work in New York and New England even though there are more generation divestiture and load pocket issues in New York and New England than in PJM The Judge states that impatience haste and greed should not be permitted to drive the RTO process at the expense of sound policy and that optimal RTO benefits should not be sacrificed in order to allow some to exploit more immediate economic opportunity in a sprint See Report page Governance The other substantive issues we have discussed are governance interim governance final governance board makeup and stakeholder process The Judge opted to not endorse any one of the options proposed instead he discusses the pros and cons of each option Here again the Judge strongly urges the Commission to provide guidance to the participants on the Commissions preferred governance approach The Judge also suggests that a settlement judge may be helpful in assisting stakeholders in finalizing governance procedures PJM has stated that in order to meet its deadline of November and certainly earlier PJM has to be in control of the implementation of the new RTO PJM proposes that the new board be made up of board members from the existing ISOs from PJM from New York and from New England The Board elects a voting CEO assumed to be Phil Harris if the PJM proposal wins NY ISO New England ISO NY PSC NY TOs and New England TOs along with other entities primarily those who are afraid to cross New York PSC all support equal representation on the new Board One proposal would have board members from each ISO with a nonvoting CEO The other proposal would have board members from each ISO with additional board members to be elected by stakeholders We support the PJM board makeup proposal to ensure a fast transition to a single Northeast RTO and energy market based on the PJM system Post Mediation The Judge in his report recommends that the Commission issue an order resolving as many of the issues in dispute as possible and then establish further proceedings under the auspice of a settlement judge The Judge urges the Commission to not accept comments from participants but he acknowledges that all participants want an opportunity to comment We are working on two sets of comments now one on our own and one in conjunction with the One RTO Coalition We will circulate drafts as soon as they are prepared Although we are disappointed that the Judge did not endorse the PJM proposal we still believe that the Commission is intent on implementing a single northeast RTO as soon as possible and that the PJM proposal provides a wellreasoned even conservative approach to reaching that goal Therefore even though the Judge sided with New York we are hopeful that the Commission will stick to its guns and go with the PJM proposal Please call any one of us if you have any questions or would like to discuss the Report Sarah Dan Howard and Tom

discussed many interesting issues The following is a summary of the meeting The meeting is still going on and we will provide an addendum to this email updating you on what was discussed this afternoon regarding market power RTOs Chairman Wood expressed his desire to finish the RTO transition and that the Commission needs to provide guidance and leadership in order to speed up the RTO transition Chairman Wood considers the RTO effort on two tracks organizational what will the RTO organizations look like and substantive once you set up the organizations what will they do Organizational Effort Wood stated that this effort has already begun with the July orders and the Northeast and Southeast mediation efforts The Commission will be issuing additional orders in the northeast southeast and Midwest within the next couple of FERC meetings Wood also stated that it is time for RTO West and Desert Star to marry up meaning I suppose that the two should consolidate Wood does not think that California can be included in the western RTO yet since it has lingering problems Structural Effort The Commission will initiate a section proceeding to address market design and structure issues in order to translate the functions established in Order No into RTO structures To achieve this goal the Commission is establishing an RTO week of advanced workshops from October in advance of issuing a NOPR to address structural issues such as congestion management cost recovery market monitoring transmission planning reliability transmission rights Wood also envisions that the Commission will develop a new pro forma tariff to replace the existing Order No transmission tariff The new tariff will apply to all public utilities and RTOs Wood also recognized that some sticks are needed to entice RTO participation Therefore Wood proposes to have all public utilities come in by December with a declaration to join an RTO If they do not make this declaration these entities will have their market based rate authority revoked on a prospective basis Furthermore Wood states that if entities do not join RTOs they should not be authorized to merge their facilities and that FERC will also look at their rates to determine whether they are still just and reasonable rates compared with rates offered by RTOs Wood states that these sticks provide incentive but do not mandate RTO participation With regard to the pending requests for rehearing Wood asked legal staff to figure out how FERC can get there In other words I think Wood is telling them to develop the legal analysis for denying rehearing While Commissioner Breathitt is skeptical about some of these RTO proposals because she was not required to vote on anything today she only expressed her concern Upcoming Dates October RTO Workshops End of October further orders on Northeast Southeast Midwest RTOs December all public utilities must commit to an RTO or have their market based rates revoked Proposed Rule for Standards of Conduct Within the next few days FERC will be issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking NOPR on standards of conduct for transmission providers As explained at the meeting we do not have a copy of the NOPR yet the NOPR will propose to apply standards of conduct uniformly to electric transmission providers and gas pipeline transportation providers similarly The NOPR also proposes to broaden the definition of affiliate to include all energy affiliates not just marketers The standards of conduct would not apply to RTOs and transmission providers who are members of an RTO may ask for an exemption from the standards The NOPR will also likely include a proposal that the standards apply to transmissionowners marketing affiliates that are serving native load customers As you know the present standards do not apply to the affiliates of TOs that are only buying and selling power for native load customers As the interim general counsel noted these marketing affiliates can go into the control room and have unrestricted interaction with the TO There was some discussion of whether it is necessary to apply the standards to affiliates serving native load Staff told the Commissioners that market participants have been complaining for years about this loop hole in the rules Pat Wood said they will include the proposal in the NOPR Breathitt may not support but if the industry does not support the proposal FERC will pull it We of course will strongly support the proposal Provision of Adequate Electrical Capacity ICAP Chairman Wood asked Staff to prepare a presentation on reserves and installed capacity requirements Wood noted that the Commission had to issue an order on ICAP in New England during their recess in August and he is not that familiar with the issues Therefore he asked Staff to prepare a presentation which they made at the meeting this morning The presentation will be made public within the next couple of days In sum Staff seems to believe that some type of ICAP requirement is needed for reliability After the presentation Wood noted that the New England ICAP order has enough wiggle room to allow the Commission to change its mind once the commissioners better understand the issue Wood sees that there is a potential conflict between decentralized competitive markets and the need for sufficient supply without politically unacceptable prolonged price spikes Commissioner Brownell from the Pennsylvania PUC has a better understanding of ICAP and expressed concerns that ICAP may be an outdated tool that acts as a barrier to entry without any definable benefit to customers Realizing that there are many positions on this topic Chairman Wood said he will publish the Staff report and ask for comments by October We will definitely submit comments on this and will include everyone in the drafting process Sorry this is so long but a lot happened today We will provide a summary of the market power discussion as soon as it is over Let us know if you have any questions Sarah

Vactor column Dan and Sarah I dont know if you see Sam VanVactors materials or not If not here is a shot from the th Richard Copyright Economic Insight Inc EDITORIAL SA VAN VACTOR Energy Crisis Myths Mythology has always been an important part of the human experience and never more so than when hard choices must be made Thus it should come as no surprise that our current energy crisis is accompanied by a seemingly endless array of apologies exaggerations and myths Far and away the most common myth concerns the persistent view of many that suppliers are holding back generation in order to jack up prices Similar charges were levied during the oil crises of the s In those days critics complained that tankers could be seen just off the coast waiting until prices rose Holding back on electricity sales makes even less sense because once a moment of demand has passed it is gone forever No rational supplier will turn down the price offers persisting in the present marketplace day after day Indeed most suppliers are laboring to squeeze out every electron possible from aging and unreliable generators An equally common error arises when the crisis is blamed on deregulation and free markets Although California was the first state to adopt widescale consumer choice its market has been heavily regulated and constrained For example after nearly three years of consumer choice in the retail market only of the total volume is served by entities other than traditional utilities The volume of direct access has actually declined in recent months as buyers have scrambled to reconnect to regulated utilities that offer frozen rates More importantly the development of reliable forward markets and planning was stillborn because the California Public Utility Commission either prohibited or limited such trading at the same time that it granted automatic prudency to spot purchases Deregulation may have changed the nature of the crisis from a physical to a financial problem but the demand and supply fundamentals at the heart of the current energy crises were inherited from an earlier era of regulatory stumbles Officials in neighboring states are eager to blame California for the crisis but nothing could be further from the truth The Western power market is fully interconnected by design and if one part is short all regions are short In fact every operating area recognized that demand would occasionally exceed supply planners simply relied on the proposition that it would not happen simultaneously in all regions of the West However this is exactly what has happened The current crisis was precipitated by a scarcity of natural gas unexpected demand growth in California and the Southwest the second hottest summer on record in the Southwest and low water runs in Northern California and the Pacific Northwest If these myths are at odds with reality how should the energy crisis be viewed Famine and pestilence are normally reserved for biblical parables but they do play a role in this story The Western power market is tied to the vast generation potential of the regions hydroelectric system The systems potential is not however always available Unlike hydro systems in Quebec and Brazil the Columbia River system has only three months worth of water storage Quebec is said to have ten years of water inventory The difference between a drought and a year flush with water can be as high as average megawatts per hour roughly the capacity of six of the Wests nuclear generating stations Thus the availability of electricity swings from abundance to scarcity in an unpredictable pattern based on the state of the regions rivers In the key months of June and July this year hydroelectric generation from the Northwest Power Pool averaged megawatts per hour below that of the favorable year of System planners in the s understood the nature of the hydroelectric system very well and planned to add thermal generation facilities to ensure adequate supply even under criticalwater conditions These conditions represented the worstcase scenario for hydroelectric generation Such planning however renders most prospective thermal plants uneconomic because they would lay idle except under the driest of conditions With the collapse of the WPPSS plants the Pacific Northwest quietly shifted its planning criteria from critical water to average water In times of heavy water flow the region is a net exporter but during a drought it must import electricity Over the last decade utility planning has been replaced by a market and not just in California Almost all new generators are independent power producers In a market new supply will only be built if there is the incentive to do so That incentive takes the form of profits and profits arise through high prices What no one has thought through is the implications of the variability of hydroelectric power on the incentive to construct thermal generation If new thermal generation is constructed but is only needed one out of every ten years then prices in years of drought must be extremely high in order to make building such thermal plants attractive to investors In short this is what the western power market is experiencing this year and will continue to experience until water flows improve and new supplies catch up with the regions overall economic growth The first step in solving a problem is to understand its cause While it is true that California and other Western states have not invested sufficiently in generation capacity and natural gas delivery systems additional supply is not by itself the answer Politicians planners and market participants alike must recognize that drought years will produce power shortages and they should plan accordingly The extremely high prices observed this last month arise in part from fear that the Pacific Northwest may be entering a cycle of cold dry weather So far the reaction has been uneven and not terribly productive Instead of blaming suppliers or each other the regions leaders should implement energy conservation programs aimed at solving a shortterm not just a longterm problem Publicity that explains the situation with the aim of conservation among consumers buyback programs for industrial and commercial customers and other such pricing incentives should be implemented as rapidly as possible before low water forces

To cc Subject Possible EPSA Response to FERCs December th Order MEMORANDUM TO Regulatory Affairs Committee Power Marketers Working Group FROM Don Santa Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair Joe Hartsoe Power Marketing Working Group Chair Julie Simon Vice President of Policy DATE December RE Possible EPSA Response to FERCs December th Order Directing Remedies for California Wholesale Electric Markets Conference Call Scheduled for Wednesday January rd at pm EST On December th FERC issued an Order Directing Remedies for California Wholesale Electric Markets The Order retains many features of the Commissions November st order outlining proposed remedies for the California markets However there are several aspects of this Order which vary from the earlier proposal EPSA has previously forwarded FERCs press release outlining the major features of the Order along with a brief memo highlighting the benchmark for finding forward contracts prudent and the January nd filing requirement for forward contract offers We need to consider whether EPSA should seek rehearing or clarification of any aspect of this Order Filings would be due at FERC no later than January th Based on a review of the order there are limited issues on which EPSA might seek rehearing included the continued finding that the rates in California were unjust and unreasonable and the removal of opportunity costs as a basis for justifying prices above the benchmark We will discuss these issues on our next weekly conference call which is scheduled for Wednesday January rd at pm EST If you have additional issues you want EPSA to raise please forward them to Julie Simon at or at before the call To access the call dial and ask for the Julie SimonEPSA Call December th Order Finding that the electric power situation in California has worsened since the November order was issued the December th Order retained many of the proposals contained in its November st order as well as new remedial measures Briefly summarized the order includes the following measures Elimination of the requirement that California utilities buy and sell power through the Power Exchange PX This modification to the California market structure returns the MWs of generation owned by the IOUs to the rate jurisdiction of the California PUC FERC also urges the California PUC to release the IOUs from their obligation to purchase from the PX The PXs current rate schedules are terminated as of April This new ability of the IOUs to selfschedule is intended to be the primary mitigation measures to dampen prices in California A benchmark price for wholesale bilateral contracts set at MWh for fiveyear roundtheclock arrangements The Commission hopes that establishing a level at which purchases can be deemed prudent will encourage the California PUC to do likewise The benchmark was derived from the prerestructuring average embedded cost of generation in California To corroborate the benchmark and make adjustments as necessary the Commission directed all sellers with marketbased rate authority to report no later than January on a confidential basis roundtheclock longterm products in annual increments between two and five years which they are willing to offer in California These informational reports should include price terms and conditions and amounts This information can also be reported on a nonconfidential basis Addition of a penalty for scheduling imbalances of more than five percent in the realtime energy market Market monitoring and price mitigation for the residual realtime market including modifications to the single price auction that preclude bids over MWh from setting the market clearing price The November st Order had proposed this remedy for a twoyear period which has been shortened to four months in this Order The Commission will convene a technical conference no later than January th to develop a comprehensive and systematic monitoring and mitigation program which incorporates thresholds and screens and specific mitigation measures if those thresholds and screens are breached A proposed plan is due by March so that it can be in place by May An important modification to the November st proposal suggested by EPSA is that the review period for sales over will be limited to days Imposed a reporting requirement on the ISO and PX and jurisdictional sellers on sales over the MWh breakpoint Elimination of the stakeholder boards of the ISO in favor of independent boards The directive for replacing ISO board has been modified to requiring the current governing board to relinquish decisionmaking power and operating control to the ISO management on January although the governing board can continue to function as an advisory board The issue will be addressed and resolved in the context of the anticipated January th RTO filing Requiring the ISO and the three IOUs to develop and file generation interconnection procedures Much of the Order is focused on eliminating the PX mandatory buysell requirement and incenting more forward contracting with the goal of shrinking the realtime market to the extent possible The Commission stated We cannot emphasize enough that the California Commission must act decisively and immediately to eliminate the requirement for the IOUs to buy the balance of their load from PX This is the most serious flaw in the market design created by AB and the California Commissions implementing orders Continued delay in making this fundamental change places all other aspects of our remedial plan at risk and prolongs the dysfunction of this market In addition it is critical that the California Commission move quickly to provide the IOUs with approval of their forward purchases The specter of afterthefact disallowance for transactions other than PX purchases has certainly chilled the decisionmaking process and continues to subject Californias ratepayers to the volatility of spot prices California is in a state of economic emergency and there is little chance that the IOUs will rise to the task if they are not afforded certainty The Commission went on Some parties to this proceeding argue that the prices in the forward markets will be affected by last summers spiraling spot prices and should therefore be deemed unreasonable We do not agree Sellers will certainly be aware that supplies of power are tight and that the IOUs are now aggressively seeking to avoid the exposure of the spot markets Under these circumstances we will be vigilant in monitoring the possible exercise of market power However suppliers also benefit from the stable revenue stream of forward markets and have every bit as much incentive to avoid the volatility of spot markets as do purchasers Moreover suppliers will bargain knowing that the spot markets size will be greatly reduced and that next summers spot prices will therefore not be fueled by frenzied buyers whose overreliance on last minute purchases have forced them to bid up the prices to obtain needed supply On the issue of the breakpoint the Commission pointed out that it is intended to be a safety net for a vastly reduced spot market The Commission emphasized that by design and definition spot markets must be allowed to reflect the price swings which capture their temporal nature Since spot market prices are subject to dramatic drops in times of surplus and increases in times of shortage those who remain in the spot market for buying their residual load or selling their residual supply should be there in full recognition of the effects on price of last minute sales and purchases In discussing plans for careful market monitoring and review of sales over the breakpoint the Commission announced plans to look at outage rates for the sellers resources failure to bid unsold megawatts into the realtime market and variations in bidding patterns The order recognizes that sellers may bid above their marginal costs in times of scarcity but does not expressly include the concept of opportunity costs which were included in the November st Order On an issue that EPSA raised the Commission concluded that the review of asbid transactions will close within days after the report is filed with FERC Unless notified by the Commission or its staff transactions will be considered final and not subject to mitigation or other refund liability after the day period In response to requests to revise or clarify the finding in the November st order that the flawed market rules in California have caused and continue to have the potential to cause unjust and unreasonable rates for shortterm energy the Commission clarified that the November st order did not find that all rates at all times were unjust and unreasonable in these spot markets The Commission points out that We have been faced in this case with the difficult question of what makes a marketbased rate unjust and unreasonable There is no precise legal formulation for setting a just and reasonable rate and no precise bright line for when a rate becomes unjust and unreasonable Under longstanding Supreme Court case law rates must fall within a zone of reasonableness where the rates are neither so low as to be less than compensatory nor so high as to be excessive to consumers While high prices in and of themselves do not make a rate unjust and unreasonable because for instance underlying production prices may be high if over time rates do not behave as expected in a competitive market the Commission must step in to correct the situation The Commission goes on to conclude that it has no evidence of specific abuses of market power However other circumstances such as over reliance of spot markets and a supply and demand imbalance can lead to rates being excessive relative to the benchmark of producer costs or competitive market prices and a finding that prices are not just and reasonable In other words even in the absence of market power abuses prices are not necessarily just and reasonable Possible Area for Comment Overall the December th Order is consistent with the comments filed by EPSA in response to the November st Order The Order largely strikes a reasonable balance between principles and political practicality with the Commission bending very little in response to intense political pressure from California Specifically the Order does not find abuse of market power order refunds or impose California or regional price caps However there are two issues that remain troubling The Commission reiterates its earlier conclusion that rates were not just and reasonable under certain circumstances in California While we argued strenuously against this conclusion in our November nd comments and the Commission clarified its early findings in this Order the implications of this conclusion continue to have significant adverse political ramifications Without merely repeating our early arguments we should consider taking another run at this issue The November st Order expressly provided for opportunity cost as a justification for prices above the breakpoint The reference to opportunity costs has been deleted from this Order apparently based on a belief that opportunity costs dont exist in realtime If we can make a credible case that sellers can sell out of California into other Western markets in a realtime or nexthour market we may want to ask the Commission to reconsider allowing opportunity costs as a justification for prices over the breakpoint

the Commission plans to ad dress over the next few months These issues are extremely important to En ron and we have been urging FERC to address and resolve most of these iss ues for many years There is now a Commission in charge that looks like it is ready to act and we need to be ready to respond In an effort to coordinate our efforts we have developed coverage teams to respond to these FERC initiatives The Washington advocacy group will als o work closely with all of these teams If someone is interested in a part icular issue and was not included on that team please feel free to call th e Project Lead to have your name added to the team All assistance is welc ome As you will see on the attached chart many of the deadlines for resp onding to these initiatives are within the next few weeks so the teams nee d to mobilize and establish a game plan for our responses very quickly On the attached chart we have listed in the left column each of the FERC i nitiatives that will be starting or are currently underway A Project Lea d has been named for each initiative The Project Lead will be responsibl e for developing and initiating a game plan for how Enron will respond in t he proceeding The Team Lead will be contacting each of you within the nex t couple of days to set up processes and procedures for moving forward Th e team will be responsible for the initial determination of what issues sho uld be addressed what is the best way for Enron to respond to them and pr oducing draft comments Once draft comments are prepared the comments wil l be circulated to a much wider group of Government Affairs and commercial people to ensure that the team has captured all of Enrons important issues There is a column of Inside Counsel and Outside Services In some area s we plan to use outside counsel or consultants and in others we do not Where we do not list outside counsel we will rely on our inside counsel to draft the comments with significant input from the team members Please remember however that even if outside services are listed the RCR proce ss must still be followed If applicable Project Leads should submit the necessary RCR request as soon as possible The following is a brief description of each proceeding and the Project Lea d named for each proceeding RTO Meetings and Comments to NOPR Sarah Novosel and Christi Nicolay will be the Project Leads in this proceeding The RTO meetings will be held in Washington from October and we hope to have an executive from Enron make a presentation on one of the panels Comments will be submitted to FE RC

To cc Subject Possible EPSA Response to FERCs December th Order MEMORANDUM TO Regulatory Affairs Committee Power Marketers Working Group FROM Don Santa Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair Joe Hartsoe Power Marketing Working Group Chair Julie Simon Vice President of Policy DATE December RE Possible EPSA Response to FERCs December th Order Directing Remedies for California Wholesale Electric Markets Conference Call Scheduled for Wednesday January rd at pm EST On December th FERC issued an Order Directing Remedies for California Wholesale Electric Markets The Order retains many features of the Commissions November st order outlining proposed remedies for the California markets However there are several aspects of this Order which vary from the earlier proposal EPSA has previously forwarded FERCs press release outlining the major features of the Order along with a brief memo highlighting the benchmark for finding forward contracts prudent and the January nd filing requirement for forward contract offers We need to consider whether EPSA should seek rehearing or clarification of any aspect of this Order Filings would be due at FERC no later than January th Based on a review of the order there are limited issues on which EPSA might seek rehearing included the continued finding that the rates in California were unjust and unreasonable and the removal of opportunity costs as a basis for justifying prices above the benchmark We will discuss these issues on our next weekly conference call which is scheduled for Wednesday January rd at pm EST If you have additional issues you want EPSA to raise please forward them to Julie Simon at or at before the call To access the call dial and ask for the Julie SimonEPSA Call December th Order Finding that the electric power situation in California has worsened since the November order was issued the December th Order retained many of the proposals contained in its November st order as well as new remedial measures Briefly summarized the order includes the following measures Elimination of the requirement that California utilities buy and sell power through the Power Exchange PX This modification to the California market structure returns the MWs of generation owned by the IOUs to the rate jurisdiction of the California PUC FERC also urges the California PUC to release the IOUs from their obligation to purchase from the PX The PXs current rate schedules are terminated as of April This new ability of the IOUs to selfschedule is intended to be the primary mitigation measures to dampen prices in California A benchmark price for wholesale bilateral contracts set at MWh for fiveyear roundtheclock arrangements The Commission hopes that establishing a level at which purchases can be deemed prudent will encourage the California PUC to do likewise The benchmark was derived from the prerestructuring average embedded cost of generation in California To corroborate the benchmark and make adjustments as necessary the Commission directed all sellers with marketbased rate authority to report no later than January on a confidential basis roundtheclock longterm products in annual increments between two and five years which they are willing to offer in California These informational reports should include price terms and conditions and amounts This information can also be reported on a nonconfidential basis Addition of a penalty for scheduling imbalances of more than five percent in the realtime energy market Market monitoring and price mitigation for the residual realtime market including modifications to the single price auction that preclude bids over MWh from setting the market clearing price The November st Order had proposed this remedy for a twoyear period which has been shortened to four months in this Order The Commission will convene a technical conference no later than January th to develop a comprehensive and systematic monitoring and mitigation program which incorporates thresholds and screens and specific mitigation measures if those thresholds and screens are breached A proposed plan is due by March so that it can be in place by May An important modification to the November st proposal suggested by EPSA is that the review period for sales over will be limited to days Imposed a reporting requirement on the ISO and PX and jurisdictional sellers on sales over the MWh breakpoint Elimination of the stakeholder boards of the ISO in favor of independent boards The directive for replacing ISO board has been modified to requiring the current governing board to relinquish decisionmaking power and operating control to the ISO management on January although the governing board can continue to function as an advisory board The issue will be addressed and resolved in the context of the anticipated January th RTO filing Requiring the ISO and the three IOUs to develop and file generation interconnection procedures Much of the Order is focused on eliminating the PX mandatory buysell requirement and incenting more forward contracting with the goal of shrinking the realtime market to the extent possible The Commission stated We cannot emphasize enough that the California Commission must act decisively and immediately to eliminate the requirement for the IOUs to buy the balance of their load from PX This is the most serious flaw in the market design created by AB and the California Commissions implementing orders Continued delay in making this fundamental change places all other aspects of our remedial plan at risk and prolongs the dysfunction of this market In addition it is critical that the California Commission move quickly to provide the IOUs with approval of their forward purchases The specter of afterthefact disallowance for transactions other than PX purchases has certainly chilled the decisionmaking process and continues to subject Californias ratepayers to the volatility of spot prices California is in a state of economic emergency and there is little chance that the IOUs will rise to the task if they are not afforded certainty The Commission went on Some parties to this proceeding argue that the prices in the forward markets will be affected by last summers spiraling spot prices and should therefore be deemed unreasonable We do not agree Sellers will certainly be aware that supplies of power are tight and that the IOUs are now aggressively seeking to avoid the exposure of the spot markets Under these circumstances we will be vigilant in monitoring the possible exercise of market power However suppliers also benefit from the stable revenue stream of forward markets and have every bit as much incentive to avoid the volatility of spot markets as do purchasers Moreover suppliers will bargain knowing that the spot markets size will be greatly reduced and that next summers spot prices will therefore not be fueled by frenzied buyers whose overreliance on last minute purchases have forced them to bid up the prices to obtain needed supply On the issue of the breakpoint the Commission pointed out that it is intended to be a safety net for a vastly reduced spot market The Commission emphasized that by design and definition spot markets must be allowed to reflect the price swings which capture their temporal nature Since spot market prices are subject to dramatic drops in times of surplus and increases in times of shortage those who remain in the spot market for buying their residual load or selling their residual supply should be there in full recognition of the effects on price of last minute sales and purchases In discussing plans for careful market monitoring and review of sales over the breakpoint the Commission announced plans to look at outage rates for the sellers resources failure to bid unsold megawatts into the realtime market and variations in bidding patterns The order recognizes that sellers may bid above their marginal costs in times of scarcity but does not expressly include the concept of opportunity costs which were included in the November st Order On an issue that EPSA raised the Commission concluded that the review of asbid transactions will close within days after the report is filed with FERC Unless notified by the Commission or its staff transactions will be considered final and not subject to mitigation or other refund liability after the day period In response to requests to revise or clarify the finding in the November st order that the flawed market rules in California have caused and continue to have the potential to cause unjust and unreasonable rates for shortterm energy the Commission clarified that the November st order did not find that all rates at all times were unjust and unreasonable in these spot markets The Commission points out that We have been faced in this case with the difficult question of what makes a marketbased rate unjust and unreasonable There is no precise legal formulation for setting a just and reasonable rate and no precise bright line for when a rate becomes unjust and unreasonable Under longstanding Supreme Court case law rates must fall within a zone of reasonableness where the rates are neither so low as to be less than compensatory nor so high as to be excessive to consumers While high prices in and of themselves do not make a rate unjust and unreasonable because for instance underlying production prices may be high if over time rates do not behave as expected in a competitive market the Commission must step in to correct the situation The Commission goes on to conclude that it has no evidence of specific abuses of market power However other circumstances such as over reliance of spot markets and a supply and demand imbalance can lead to rates being excessive relative to the benchmark of producer costs or competitive market prices and a finding that prices are not just and reasonable In other words even in the absence of market power abuses prices are not necessarily just and reasonable Possible Area for Comment Overall the December th Order is consistent with the comments filed by EPSA in response to the November st Order The Order largely strikes a reasonable balance between principles and political practicality with the Commission bending very little in response to intense political pressure from California Specifically the Order does not find abuse of market power order refunds or impose California or regional price caps However there are two issues that remain troubling The Commission reiterates its earlier conclusion that rates were not just and reasonable under certain circumstances in California While we argued strenuously against this conclusion in our November nd comments and the Commission clarified its early findings in this Order the implications of this conclusion continue to have significant adverse political ramifications Without merely repeating our early arguments we should consider taking another run at this issue The November st Order expressly provided for opportunity cost as a justification for prices above the breakpoint The reference to opportunity costs has been deleted from this Order apparently based on a belief that opportunity costs dont exist in realtime If we can make a credible case that sellers can sell out of California into other Western markets in a realtime or nexthour market we may want to ask the Commission to reconsider allowing opportunity costs as a justification for prices over the breakpoint

Vactor column Dan and Sarah I dont know if you see Sam VanVactors materials or not If not here is a shot from the th Richard Copyright Economic Insight Inc EDITORIAL SA VAN VACTOR Energy Crisis Myths Mythology has always been an important part of the human experience and never more so than when hard choices must be made Thus it should come as no surprise that our current energy crisis is accompanied by a seemingly endless array of apologies exaggerations and myths Far and away the most common myth concerns the persistent view of many that suppliers are holding back generation in order to jack up prices Similar charges were levied during the oil crises of the s In those days critics complained that tankers could be seen just off the coast waiting until prices rose Holding back on electricity sales makes even less sense because once a moment of demand has passed it is gone forever No rational supplier will turn down the price offers persisting in the present marketplace day after day Indeed most suppliers are laboring to squeeze out every electron possible from aging and unreliable generators An equally common error arises when the crisis is blamed on deregulation and free markets Although California was the first state to adopt widescale consumer choice its market has been heavily regulated and constrained For example after nearly three years of consumer choice in the retail market only of the total volume is served by entities other than traditional utilities The volume of direct access has actually declined in recent months as buyers have scrambled to reconnect to regulated utilities that offer frozen rates More importantly the development of reliable forward markets and planning was stillborn because the California Public Utility Commission either prohibited or limited such trading at the same time that it granted automatic prudency to spot purchases Deregulation may have changed the nature of the crisis from a physical to a financial problem but the demand and supply fundamentals at the heart of the current energy crises were inherited from an earlier era of regulatory stumbles Officials in neighboring states are eager to blame California for the crisis but nothing could be further from the truth The Western power market is fully interconnected by design and if one part is short all regions are short In fact every operating area recognized that demand would occasionally exceed supply planners simply relied on the proposition that it would not happen simultaneously in all regions of the West However this is exactly what has happened The current crisis was precipitated by a scarcity of natural gas unexpected demand growth in California and the Southwest the second hottest summer on record in the Southwest and low water runs in Northern California and the Pacific Northwest If these myths are at odds with reality how should the energy crisis be viewed Famine and pestilence are normally reserved for biblical parables but they do play a role in this story The Western power market is tied to the vast generation potential of the regions hydroelectric system The systems potential is not however always available Unlike hydro systems in Quebec and Brazil the Columbia River system has only three months worth of water storage Quebec is said to have ten years of water inventory The difference between a drought and a year flush with water can be as high as average megawatts per hour roughly the capacity of six of the Wests nuclear generating stations Thus the availability of electricity swings from abundance to scarcity in an unpredictable pattern based on the state of the regions rivers In the key months of June and July this year hydroelectric generation from the Northwest Power Pool averaged megawatts per hour below that of the favorable year of System planners in the s understood the nature of the hydroelectric system very well and planned to add thermal generation facilities to ensure adequate supply even under criticalwater conditions These conditions represented the worstcase scenario for hydroelectric generation Such planning however renders most prospective thermal plants uneconomic because they would lay idle except under the driest of conditions With the collapse of the WPPSS plants the Pacific Northwest quietly shifted its planning criteria from critical water to average water In times of heavy water flow the region is a net exporter but during a drought it must import electricity Over the last decade utility planning has been replaced by a market and not just in California Almost all new generators are independent power producers In a market new supply will only be built if there is the incentive to do so That incentive takes the form of profits and profits arise through high prices What no one has thought through is the implications of the variability of hydroelectric power on the incentive to construct thermal generation If new thermal generation is constructed but is only needed one out of every ten years then prices in years of drought must be extremely high in order to make building such thermal plants attractive to investors In short this is what the western power market is experiencing this year and will continue to experience until water flows improve and new supplies catch up with the regions overall economic growth The first step in solving a problem is to understand its cause While it is true that California and other Western states have not invested sufficiently in generation capacity and natural gas delivery systems additional supply is not by itself the answer Politicians planners and market participants alike must recognize that drought years will produce power shortages and they should plan accordingly The extremely high prices observed this last month arise in part from fear that the Pacific Northwest may be entering a cycle of cold dry weather So far the reaction has been uneven and not terribly productive Instead of blaming suppliers or each other the regions leaders should implement energy conservation programs aimed at solving a shortterm not just a longterm problem Publicity that explains the situation with the aim of conservation among consumers buyback programs for industrial and commercial customers and other such pricing incentives should be implemented as rapidly as possible before low water forces
