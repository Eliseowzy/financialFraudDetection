I have copied Herman Manis on this since he wasnt part of your distribution and I want him to read what the sales plan is to insure that he is comfortable with it and that it agrees with what the originators and legal folks have been telling him Re your email intro The amount owed to ENext does not need to be included in this Notice It must be included in the second notice we must provide to ENext for the purchase We refer to it as the Prepayment Notice I dont understand the flow of the sales process for this deal My last understanding was that it was to be handled like the CA Development sale In that deal my understanding is that ENA assigned its purchase option to CA Dev The sale of the LLC originally owned by ENA was sold to CA Dev prior to the flowing to ENext for the purchase of the equipment CA Dev put the in escrow first then we issued the purchase notice Please advise if this was not the case and why ENA is the entity purchasing the equipment in this deal Has accounting and the originator agreed on the accounting treatment this transaction will receive based on the sale processflow of described below Notice of Intent to Purchase Since CA Development was completed the form of the Notice has been changed to be more detailed with respect to the underlying financing This letter will serve as written notice to the Administrative Agent that the Development and Construction Manager under the Development and Construction Management Agreement dated as of December among ENext Generation LLC the Developer Subsidiaries from time to time parties thereto and Enron North America Corp as Development and Construction Manager as such terms are define in such agreement has designated name of purchaser and state of incorpation as its designee pursuant to Section a of such Development and Construction Management Agreement and purchaser intends to purchase the Specified Option Property listed and as defined in Exhibit attached hereto The applicable purchase date shall be insert date The Notice should be signed by ENA with Consent provided by Salmon Energy LLC as purchaser These documents in draft form should be approved by CSFBMilbank prior to us sending the Notice When the Notice is sent the execution copies of all documents associated with the purchase should also be sent to the appropriate parties Sending one package is the most expedient method and most likely to have the documents executed in the five business days that we need Rose Engeldorf can provide you with the information you need for whom to send it to Exhibit to Notice to Purchase As noted above item can be deleted in this Notice In item please spell out the parties involved in the Agreement in Principle as the foregoing parties can be interpreted to include WestLB as stated in the May turbine purchase agreement As we all know they are not a party to the Ag in Principle Also Kay had been talking with Rose about perhaps changing the AIP to become a change order to the existing LM master turbine purchase agreement Is this happening If so wont this change this description in every schedule to these purchase agreements Assumption Assumption Agreement This Schedule should mirror the Schedule in the Bill of Sale In Schedule please add an attention line to Shazia Sarker CSFB Phone Bill of Sale In first paragraph please correct ENexts name There should not be a I at the end of it Also insert the before the definition of Developer Schedule needs to have the same changes made as I discussed above under Notice of Intent to Purchase UCCs Not part of your package but a required document for releasing the equipment from ENext to Salmon Rose can help you insure that these are created Please provide your comments to the above group along with the next draft of documents which should probably be ready for review by CSFBMilbank Original Message From Sole Carlos Sent Friday April AM To Engeldorf Roseann Mann Kay Bills Lisa Clark Catherine Subject Turbopark Notices and Documents for Delta Turbine Sale In connection with the required Turbopark notices and documents related to the turbine sale to Delta attached for your initial review and comment are drafts of the initial notice to CSFB an assignment and assumption agreement and a bill of sale Three of the turbines being sold derive from the May agreement with GE and one of the turbines being sold derives from the April Agreement in Principle with GE Please note if possible we would prefer not to identify what amount is owed by ENext on the turbines this impacts the purchase price section in the exhibit on the initial notice Lastly as a background refresher ENA is effectively selling turbines to Delta Power as follows ENA presently owns of Salmon Energy LLC Delta is going to place in escrow the monies owed on turbines as well as ENAs profit on the transaction and after such escrow deposit ENA will then proceed with the submittal of the CSFB notice and execution of the assignment and assumption agreement and bill of sale After these steps have occurred then ENA will sell of its interest in Salmon to Delta Power At some future date ENAs remaining interest in Salmon will be transferred to Delta Thank you and please call me with any questions Carlos Sole Senior Counsel Enron North America Corp Smith Street Houston Texas phone fax

below I have copied Herman Manis on this since he wasnt part of your distribution and I want him to read what the sales plan is to insure that he is comfortable with it and that it agrees with what the originators and legal folks have been telling him Re your email intro The amount owed to ENext does not need to be included in this Notice It must be included in the second notice we must provide to ENext for the purchase We refer to it as the Prepayment Notice I dont understand the flow of the sales process for this deal My last understanding was that it was to be handled like the CA Development sale In that deal my understanding is that ENA assigned its purchase option to CA Dev The sale of the LLC originally owned by ENA was sold to CA Dev prior to the flowing to ENext for the purchase of the equipment CA Dev put the in escrow first then we issued the purchase notice Please advise if this was not the case and why ENA is the entity purchasing the equipment in this deal Has accounting and the originator agreed on the accounting treatment this transaction will receive based on the sale processflow of described below Notice of Intent to Purchase Since CA Development was completed the form of the Notice has been changed to be more detailed with respect to the underlying financing This letter will serve as written notice to the Administrative Agent that the Development and Construction Manager under the Development and Construction Management Agreement dated as of December among ENext Generation LLC the Developer Subsidiaries from time to time parties thereto and Enron North America Corp as Development and Construction Manager as such terms are define in such agreement has designated name of purchaser and state of incorpation as its designee pursuant to Section a of such Development and Construction Management Agreement and purchaser intends to purchase the Specified Option Property listed and as defined in Exhibit attached hereto The applicable purchase date shall be insert date The Notice should be signed by ENA with Consent provided by Salmon Energy LLC as purchaser These documents in draft form should be approved by CSFBMilbank prior to us sending the Notice When the Notice is sent the execution copies of all documents associated with the purchase should also be sent to the appropriate parties Sending one package is the most expedient method and most likely to have the documents executed in the five business days that we need Rose Engeldorf can provide you with the information you need for whom to send it to Exhibit to Notice to Purchase As noted above item can be deleted in this Notice In item please spell out the parties involved in the Agreement in Principle as the foregoing parties can be interpreted to include WestLB as stated in the May turbine purchase agreement As we all know they are not a party to the Ag in Principle Also Kay had been talking with Rose about perhaps changing the AIP to become a change order to the existing LM master turbine purchase agreement Is this happening If so wont this change this description in every schedule to these purchase agreements Assumption Assumption Agreement This Schedule should mirror the Schedule in the Bill of Sale In Schedule please add an attention line to Shazia Sarker CSFB Phone Bill of Sale In first paragraph please correct ENexts name There should not be a I at the end of it Also insert the before the definition of Developer Schedule needs to have the same changes made as I discussed above under Notice of Intent to Purchase UCCs Not part of your package but a required document for releasing the equipment from ENext to Salmon Rose can help you insure that these are created Please provide your comments to the above group along with the next draft of documents which should probably be ready for review by CSFBMilbank Original Message From Sole Carlos Sent Friday April AM To Engeldorf Roseann Mann Kay Bills Lisa Clark Catherine Subject Turbopark Notices and Documents for Delta Turbine Sale In connection with the required Turbopark notices and documents related to the turbine sale to Delta attached for your initial review and comment are drafts of the initial notice to CSFB an assignment and assumption agreement and a bill of sale Three of the turbines being sold derive from the May agreement with GE and one of the turbines being sold derives from the April Agreement in Principle with GE Please note if possible we would prefer not to identify what amount is owed by ENext on the turbines this impacts the purchase price section in the exhibit on the initial notice Lastly as a background refresher ENA is effectively selling turbines to Delta Power as follows ENA presently owns of Salmon Energy LLC Delta is going to place in escrow the monies owed on turbines as well as ENAs profit on the transaction and after such escrow deposit ENA will then proceed with the submittal of the CSFB notice and execution of the assignment and assumption agreement and bill of sale After these steps have occurred then ENA will sell of its interest in Salmon to Delta Power At some future date ENAs remaining interest in Salmon will be transferred to Delta Thank you and please call me with any questions Carlos Sole Senior Counsel Enron North America Corp Smith Street Houston Texas phone fax

completed the form of the Notice has been changed to be more detailed with respect to the underlying financing This letter will serve as written notice to the Administrative Agent that the Development

Enron North America Corp as Development and Construction Manager as such terms are define in such agreement has designated name of purchaser and state of incorpation as its designee pursuant to Section a of such Development and Construction Management Agreement and purchaser intends to purchase the Specified Option Property listed and as defined in Exhibit attached hereto The applicable purchase date shall be insert date The Notice should be signed by ENA with Consent provided by Salmon Energy LLC as purchaser These documents in draft form should be approved by CSFBMilbank prior to us sending the Notice When the Notice is sent the execution copies of all documents associated with the purchase should also be sent to the appropriate parties Sending one package is the most expedient method and most likely to have the documents executed in the five business days that we need Rose Engeldorf can provide you with the information you need for whom to send it to Exhibit to Notice to Purchase As noted above item can be deleted in this Notice In item please spell out the parties involved in the Agreement in Principle as the foregoing parties can be interpreted to include WestLB as stated in the May turbine purchase agreement As we all know they are not a party to the Ag in Principle Also Kay had been talking with Rose about perhaps changing the AIP to become a change order to the existing LM master turbine purchase agreement Is this happening If so wont this change this description in every schedule to these purchase agreements Assumption Assumption Agreement This Schedule should mirror the Schedule in the Bill of Sale In Schedule please add an attention line to Shazia Sarker CSFB Phone Bill of Sale In first paragraph please correct ENexts name There should not be a I at the end of it Also insert the before the definition of Developer Schedule needs to have the same changes made as I discussed above under Notice of Intent to Purchase UCCs Not part of your package but a required document for releasing the equipment from ENext to Salmon Rose can help you insure that these are created Please provide your comments to the above group along with the next draft of documents which should probably be ready for review by CSFBMilbank Original Message From Sole Carlos Sent Friday April AM To Engeldorf Roseann Mann Kay Bills Lisa Clark Catherine Subject Turbopark Notices and Documents for Delta Turbine Sale In connection with the required Turbopark notices and documents related to the turbine sale to Delta attached for your initial review and comment are drafts of the initial notice to CSFB an assignment and assumption agreement and a bill of sale Three of the turbines being sold derive from the May agreement with GE and one of the turbines being sold derives from the April Agreement in Principle with GE Please note if possible we would prefer not to identify what amount is owed by ENext on the turbines this impacts the purchase price section in the exhibit on the initial notice Lastly as a background refresher ENA is effectively selling turbines to Delta Power as follows ENA presently owns of Salmon Energy LLC Delta is going to place in escrow the monies owed on turbines as well as ENAs profit on the transaction and after such escrow deposit ENA will then proceed with the submittal of the CSFB notice and execution of the assignment and assumption agreement and bill of sale After these steps have occurred then ENA will sell of its interest in Salmon to Delta Power At some future date ENAs remaining interest in Salmon will be transferred to Delta Thank you and please call me with any questions Carlos Sole Senior Counsel Enron North America Corp Smith Street Houston Texas phone fax
