objectives for are to continue to substantially improve our safety and environmental record throughout this year These objectives supersede any and all of our financial objective for EOTT Objectives Environmental Reduce reportable spills and leaks by Safety Reduce lost time accidents by I am pleased to report that our Regional Business Managers District Managers and their teams are working closely with Operations Governance to ensure that those objectives are met Please take time to read the following article When pipelines are time bombs million miles of them deliver potential catastrophe every day By Patrick McMahon USA TODAYFront Page Article BELLINGHAM Wash Last summer an underground pipeline ruptured in a city park here and sent a torrent of gasoline along a wooded streambed toward two yearolds playing with a barbecue lighter After the inch pipeline had been hemorrhaging for an hour and minutes an explosion sent a fireball racing through the park A plume of smoke rose feet Authorities say the blast probably was triggered by a spark from the lighter There was a spark and the sky turned orange the boys both told me afterward says Frank King whose son Wade was one of the boys in the park Wade and his friend Stephen Tsiorvas were burned over of their bodies They died the next day Also killed was yearold Liam Wood who had graduated from high school five days before The collegebound Wood was flyfishing in the park when he was overcome by fumes fell into the creek and drowned To many people the boys were considered heroes says Mark Asmundson the mayor of this seaside city north of Seattle In sparking the explosion the boys kept the most extensive damage confined to the acre park he says The river of gasoline was heading right for the center of the city On Monday the Senate Commerce Committee held a oneday hearing here about five minutes from where the incident occurred on legislation to improve safety and government oversight of pipelines and the companies that operate them The hearing included gripping sometimes tearful testimony from the boys parents as well as statements from state and federal officials My baby died because of inaction His death was preventable said Katherine Dalen Stephens mother More than million miles of iron steel and plastic pipes some as large as feet in diameter snake beneath the earth and deliver oil gasoline natural gas and potential disaster across America every day They range from the transAlaskan pipeline to tiny pipes carrying natural gas to peoples homes Safer than gasoline trucks or oceangoing tankers by most measures onceremote pipelines are prompting new worries as sprawling metropolitan areas grow into their paths US pipeline accidents have fluctuated in the past years In the s there were liquid fuel spills and natural gas leaks roughly one a day The incidents most involving local lines carrying natural gas resulted in deaths injuries and million in property damage from through There also are environmental costs In January one of the nations largest pipeline companies Koch Industries of Wichita Kan paid a million civil fine to settle Environmental Protection Agency waterpollution charges involving oil spills from to The EPA said Koch failed to inspect its pipelines and waited for leaks before making repairs Liam Woods mother Marlene Robinson is focused on stronger regulations nationwide including more and better inspections and regional watchdog committees I dont have any children left to protect she said in an interview and repeated at the hearing This didnt have to happen to Liam and it doesnt have to happen to other peoples children Although the cause of the Bellingham incident remains under investigation one factor might have been damage to the pipeline from a backhoe when a water line was being installed in But investigators also have many questions about the role of Olympic Pipeline Co which operates a network of pipelines along a mile corridor from north of Bellingham to Portland Ore Investigators for the National Transportation Safety Board NTSB want to know whether Olympic ignored warning signs and whether it could have acted more swiftly after the leak But the inquiry has been delayed by a parallel investigation by the US Attorneys Office Several Olympic employees have declined to testify and have invoked their constitutional rights against selfincrimination Pipeline owners and government regulators defend the safety of transporting twothirds of the nations fuels by pipeline and they warn that more rules could boost energy prices Critics say pipelines are too loosely regulated not fully inspected and in some cases deteriorating The US Transportation Department oversees pipelines Its Office of Pipeline Safety sets standards for design operation maintenance and emergency response Richard Felder who heads the office testified at Mondays hearing Our goal is to prevent incidents like Bellingham from ever happening again he said In an earlier interview he defended his offices performance and the industry Its a good record Its the safest form of transporting fuel far and away The office has extensive rules on pipeline safety including requirements for signs along the route and programs to alert potential diggers but theres no such thing as risk elimination Felder says All you can do is manage it But the chairman of the federal governments transportation safety watchdog agency is unimpressed with Felders office and says it deserves a grade of F Its been the most frustrating area Ive had to deal with as chairman says Jim Hall NTSB chairman since He says no agency has a worse record of responding to NTSB recommendations In a recent speech he said theres no indication that the Office of Pipeline Safety is in charge or that its regulations its inspections its assets its staffing and its spirit are adequate to the task Felder takes issue with much of the criticism but he endorses calls for more research into pipeline safety He said his office is in the final stages of preparing new safety standards for heavily populated and environmentally sensitive areas He emphasized that the leading cause of pipeline failure is thirdparty damage from road utility and construction work The agency has worked to enhance a system to alert pipeline companies of digging with one telephone call Felder is critical of local authorities who ignore pipelines when making decisions on housing and commercial development Local planning has not kept people away from pipelines he says Its astounding to me Felder bristles at critics suggestions that his agency is a tool of the oil and gas industry I cant agree with that one iota he says We try to balance the safety issue and the economic issue The Senate Commerce Committee will consider a bipartisan bill sponsored by Sens Patty Murray DWash and Slade Gorton RWash Rep Jack Metcalf the Republican who represents Bellingham and Rep Jay Inslee a Democrat whose district includes an operating section of the pipeline The bill would require periodic internal inspections of pipelines boost federal spending on research increase the number of federal pipeline inspectors nationwide there now are and expand states regulatory authority On Monday the Office of Pipeline Safety gave the state of Washington the temporary right to do more inspections The MurrayGorton bill also would require federal certification of pipeline workers and expand the publics right to know about spills and leaks I was totally shocked and amazed when this happened Murray says You always assume that your neighborhood is safe and somebody has taken care of this The Bellingham rupture not only dumped gallons of gasoline into this city of near the Canadian border but also unleashed civic furor at Olympic Pipeline Its hard for people to get interested in things they cant see Out of sight is out of mind Mayor Asmundson says He has visited the boys grieving families and lobbied Congress The blast has dominated my life since June Pipeline operators portray accidents as isolated to escape national scrutiny he says The whole focus of the industry is containment Do whatever you have to do locally but dont stir things up nationally Last week Murray released a report she requested from the Transportation Departments inspector general It faults the Office of Pipeline Safety for ignoring enhanced safety requirements including increased inspections inside pipes in highly populated and environmentally sensitive areas as Congress required in and A US General Accounting Office audit of operations is due in May Also pending is a decision from Felder and the pipeline safety office on whether to restart the mile section shut down since the Bellingham accident Olympic Pipeline has repaired the line and is eager to reopen it People living along the route and officials are pushing for more extensive testing of the stilloperating section of the line south of Bellingham Felder says he has not decided whether it should be shut down Last week Felders office ordered a new round of testing along the entire line but critics such as Inslee are not convinced it will be enough The tests must be conducted on the closed section of the pipeline before a decision is made on reopening it

objectives for are to continue to substantially improve our safety and environmental record throughout this year These objectives supersede any and all of our financial objective for EOTT Objectives Environmental Reduce reportable spills and leaks by Safety Reduce lost time accidents by I am pleased to report that our Regional Business Managers District Managers and their teams are working closely with Operations Governance to ensure that those objectives are met Please take time to read the following article When pipelines are time bombs million miles of them deliver potential catastrophe every day By Patrick McMahon USA TODAYFront Page Article BELLINGHAM Wash Last summer an underground pipeline ruptured in a city park here and sent a torrent of gasoline along a wooded streambed toward two yearolds playing with a barbecue lighter After the inch pipeline had been hemorrhaging for an hour and minutes an explosion sent a fireball racing through the park A plume of smoke rose feet Authorities say the blast probably was triggered by a spark from the lighter There was a spark and the sky turned orange the boys both told me afterward says Frank King whose son Wade was one of the boys in the park Wade and his friend Stephen Tsiorvas were burned over of their bodies They died the next day Also killed was yearold Liam Wood who had graduated from high school five days before The collegebound Wood was flyfishing in the park when he was overcome by fumes fell into the creek and drowned To many people the boys were considered heroes says Mark Asmundson the mayor of this seaside city north of Seattle In sparking the explosion the boys kept the most extensive damage confined to the acre park he says The river of gasoline was heading right for the center of the city On Monday the Senate Commerce Committee held a oneday hearing here about five minutes from where the incident occurred on legislation to improve safety and government oversight of pipelines and the companies that operate them The hearing included gripping sometimes tearful testimony from the boys parents as well as statements from state and federal officials My baby died because of inaction His death was preventable said Katherine Dalen Stephens mother More than million miles of iron steel and plastic pipes some as large as feet in diameter snake beneath the earth and deliver oil gasoline natural gas and potential disaster across America every day They range from the transAlaskan pipeline to tiny pipes carrying natural gas to peoples homes Safer than gasoline trucks or oceangoing tankers by most measures onceremote pipelines are prompting new worries as sprawling metropolitan areas grow into their paths US pipeline accidents have fluctuated in the past years In the s there were liquid fuel spills and natural gas leaks roughly one a day The incidents most involving local lines carrying natural gas resulted in deaths injuries and million in property damage from through There also are environmental costs In January one of the nations largest pipeline companies Koch Industries of Wichita Kan paid a million civil fine to settle Environmental Protection Agency waterpollution charges involving oil spills from to The EPA said Koch failed to inspect its pipelines and waited for leaks before making repairs Liam Woods mother Marlene Robinson is focused on stronger regulations nationwide including more and better inspections and regional watchdog committees I dont have any children left to protect she said in an interview and repeated at the hearing This didnt have to happen to Liam and it doesnt have to happen to other peoples children Although the cause of the Bellingham incident remains under investigation one factor might have been damage to the pipeline from a backhoe when a water line was being installed in But investigators also have many questions about the role of Olympic Pipeline Co which operates a network of pipelines along a mile corridor from north of Bellingham to Portland Ore Investigators for the National Transportation Safety Board NTSB want to know whether Olympic ignored warning signs and whether it could have acted more swiftly after the leak But the inquiry has been delayed by a parallel investigation by the US Attorneys Office Several Olympic employees have declined to testify and have invoked their constitutional rights against selfincrimination Pipeline owners and government regulators defend the safety of transporting twothirds of the nations fuels by pipeline and they warn that more rules could boost energy prices Critics say pipelines are too loosely regulated not fully inspected and in some cases deteriorating The US Transportation Department oversees pipelines Its Office of Pipeline Safety sets standards for design operation maintenance and emergency response Richard Felder who heads the office testified at Mondays hearing Our goal is to prevent incidents like Bellingham from ever happening again he said In an earlier interview he defended his offices performance and the industry Its a good record Its the safest form of transporting fuel far and away The office has extensive rules on pipeline safety including requirements for signs along the route and programs to alert potential diggers but theres no such thing as risk elimination Felder says All you can do is manage it But the chairman of the federal governments transportation safety watchdog agency is unimpressed with Felders office and says it deserves a grade of F Its been the most frustrating area Ive had to deal with as chairman says Jim Hall NTSB chairman since He says no agency has a worse record of responding to NTSB recommendations In a recent speech he said theres no indication that the Office of Pipeline Safety is in charge or that its regulations its inspections its assets its staffing and its spirit are adequate to the task Felder takes issue with much of the criticism but he endorses calls for more research into pipeline safety He said his office is in the final stages of preparing new safety standards for heavily populated and environmentally sensitive areas He emphasized that the leading cause of pipeline failure is thirdparty damage from road utility and construction work The agency has worked to enhance a system to alert pipeline companies of digging with one telephone call Felder is critical of local authorities who ignore pipelines when making decisions on housing and commercial development Local planning has not kept people away from pipelines he says Its astounding to me Felder bristles at critics suggestions that his agency is a tool of the oil and gas industry I cant agree with that one iota he says We try to balance the safety issue and the economic issue The Senate Commerce Committee will consider a bipartisan bill sponsored by Sens Patty Murray DWash and Slade Gorton RWash Rep Jack Metcalf the Republican who represents Bellingham and Rep Jay Inslee a Democrat whose district includes an operating section of the pipeline The bill would require periodic internal inspections of pipelines boost federal spending on research increase the number of federal pipeline inspectors nationwide there now are and expand states regulatory authority On Monday the Office of Pipeline Safety gave the state of Washington the temporary right to do more inspections The MurrayGorton bill also would require federal certification of pipeline workers and expand the publics right to know about spills and leaks I was totally shocked and amazed when this happened Murray says You always assume that your neighborhood is safe and somebody has taken care of this The Bellingham rupture not only dumped gallons of gasoline into this city of near the Canadian border but also unleashed civic furor at Olympic Pipeline Its hard for people to get interested in things they cant see Out of sight is out of mind Mayor Asmundson says He has visited the boys grieving families and lobbied Congress The blast has dominated my life since June Pipeline operators portray accidents as isolated to escape national scrutiny he says The whole focus of the industry is containment Do whatever you have to do locally but dont stir things up nationally Last week Murray released a report she requested from the Transportation Departments inspector general It faults the Office of Pipeline Safety for ignoring enhanced safety requirements including increased inspections inside pipes in highly populated and environmentally sensitive areas as Congress required in and A US General Accounting Office audit of operations is due in May Also pending is a decision from Felder and the pipeline safety office on whether to restart the mile section shut down since the Bellingham accident Olympic Pipeline has repaired the line and is eager to reopen it People living along the route and officials are pushing for more extensive testing of the stilloperating section of the line south of Bellingham Felder says he has not decided whether it should be shut down Last week Felders office ordered a new round of testing along the entire line but critics such as Inslee are not convinced it will be enough The tests must be conducted on the closed section of the pipeline before a decision is made on reopening it
