Subject Enron trading unit sale Creditors Ask Bankruptcy Judge to Delay Sale of Enrons Trading Business Updated Wednesday January PM ET Dow Jones Newswires NEW YORK Even before an auction of bankrupt Enron Corps trading business later this week creditors are lining up to oppose the sale Creditors are concerned about how Enron ENE news msgs will allocate money from that auction to its bankrupt units and are asking federal bankruptcy judge Arthur J Gonzalez to oppose or at least delay an approval of the sale which was to come as early as Friday More than companies have now filed motions asking the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York to delay the approval of any offer for Enrons powertrading business which was by far the largest and most profitable operation of the vast company The companies want time to figure out which assets are up for sale which of the more than Enron affiliates and other entities will benefit from the sale and how various creditors will be affected Under a plan to bring back some value to its now moribund trading operations including EnronOnline which until not so long ago accounted for of all wholesale energy trading in the US Enron is seeking a jointventure partner to form a new company dubbed New Energy Trading Company or NETCO Enron plans to contribute its trading software and hardware among other things to the joint venture in exchange for a share So far Citigroup Inc C news msgs and UBS AG UBS news msgs have been reported to have made sealed bids An auction is scheduled for Thursday At stake is how cash that may potentially be generated by the sale will be used In its motion opposing the sale for instance the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC RBSB news msgs said Absent a disclosure of the intended uses for the proceeds of this sale the creditors are unable to gauge that the benefits are adequate appropriate and directed to the proper beneficiaries Further scrutinizing the way Enron has been managing its cash the Royal Bank of Scotland one of Enrons large creditors raises the possibility that Enron may have already consolidated cash between different entities before it filed for bankruptcy on Dec If this anecdote were to be correct no disclosure has been made nor has the time necessary to conduct a review elapsed to the extent if any that any of these businesses stand as a constructive trustee of assets or monies for the benefit of other entities or creditors the Royal Bank of Scotland stated in a court filing Gas and electricity trading company Aquila Inc also expressed concerns about the use of the proceeds of the tradingassets sale saying that proceeds of the sale should be put in escrow until it can be determined which units should get the money It isnt the first time that questions have arisen about how Enron will distribute money coming into the company Last month Merrill Lynch Co MER news msgs briefly withheld million of the distressed companys funds in a brokerage account until Enron and the bankruptcy court could clarify which of the companys entities was entitled to it The courts verdict The money will be governed by a centralized cash management system put in place shortly after Enron filed for bankruptcy under which all funds collected by any Enron entity are swept up to the parent and later dispersed accordingly to subsidiaries For now this means that any cash generated on settlements to Enrons units should be used to pay those units debtors But that could change according to bankruptcy experts if Enron decides in the future to effect a substantive consolidation of its assets This is relatively common in Chapter cases and in essence would put all of the companys assets into one pot to be distributed to a larger circle of creditors A substantive consolidation if it eventually occurs is likely to simplify Enrons role in dispersing funds but may benefit some creditors and put others at a disadvantage Given that the Chapter proceedings are still in the early stages it is difficult to gauge whether this is a viable option said Joel Kay an attorney who specializes in bankruptcy cases at Hughes Watters Askanase LLP Houston Enron attorneys didnt immediately return phone calls seeking comment There is also another concern Wiser Oil Co WZR news msgs a creditor who is owed about million under oil and gashedging contracts with the Enron North America unit believes that Enrons billion debtorinpossession financing could mean bad news for the beleaguered companys subsidiary The concern is that Enron North Americas assets are being pledged as collateral to secure repayment of the DIP facility even though its unclear how much if any of the DIP borrowing will actually go to this unit said Deborah A Reperowitz of Reed Smith LLP which represents Wiser So far Enron hasnt drawn on its DIP facility which is led by JP Morgan and Citigroup But if the company does and there are insufficient funds to repay this loan in the future then Enron North Americas assets may be on the hook according to Ms Reperowitz Wiser in a filing late Tuesday also objected to the courts expected approval of the sale of a portion of Enrons energytrading unit Energy trading accounted for about of Enrons billion in revenue last year The sale shouldnt be allowed to go through because the timing and terms make it impossible for creditors to determine which assets are to be sold the value of these assets and where proceeds will be allocated Wiser said Other entities that have expressed concern about the sale in recent court filings include General Electric Cos GE news msgs General Electric Capital Corp Pure Resources Inc PRS news msgs Tenaska Marketing Ventures Forest Oil Corp FST news msgs Devon Energy Corp DVN news msgs Magnum Hunter Production Inc PetroHunt LLC and Spinnaker Exploration Co SKE news msgs Exco Resources Inc EXCO news msgs EcoTankship Inc Powerex Corp and El Paso Corps EPG news msgs El Paso Merchant Energy LP
