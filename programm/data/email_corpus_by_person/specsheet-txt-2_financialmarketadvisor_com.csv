Records International Inc Unity Through Diversity North American Record Label Decides On MultiCultural Approach Arabel Record International Inc Pink Sheets ARBL received a BUY recommendation from Investor Spec Sheet on A target price of has been set for FY See the complete Research Report at wwwinvestorcommunicationsnetreportsarbl ShareRelated Items Recent Price Market Capitalization M Shares Outstanding M Float M Though there are a few acts currently under development the research clearly supports the Arabel managements decision to focus a substantial amount of its time energy and development budget on a MultiCultural Pop Act The US success of the Backstreet Boys is directly attributed to their initial success in Asia and Europe Given the multicultural competitive edge combined with critics acclaim of the music lyrics composition arrangement the Arabel act could meet if not exceed Backstreet Boys success The idea is to bring together five of the best English as a first language male performers in North America between the ages of regardless of their ethnic heritage or belief system The vision is to show that through pop music diverse cultures do get along and can thrive as both a pop and business entity Economic geographic technological and social trend research overwhelmingly supports the managements decision to go in this direction Developing countries have been leading the globe in GDP for the past few years with China leading the way It is estimated that by China will have a middle class population of million and India will have a middle class of million For an enhanced demographic report wwwinvestorcommunicationsnetreportsarblARBLa cthtm Foreign corporations especially in economically developing countries will find the MultiCultural Act concept very attractive for sponsorship and product endorsement Whether to increase their local visibility through affiliation with a North American pop group or to use this as a means to expand to other geographic markets Arabel will target both traditional and nontraditional youth oriented sponsors For the last years the youth culture in North America has become increasingly more socially conscious than ever before but has also grown up with an appreciation and acceptance of ethnic and cultural diversity like no other previous generation Especially since we believe an act that promotes procultural diversity by visual example will be readily accepted by mainstream North American youth Teens from other regions around the world continue to be infatuated with North American culture Product and performance sales for North American pop acts continue to break records in these regions A MultiCultural Act will provide performers that different ethnic groups around the globe can relate to and identify with This role model appeal does not only impact product sales which can have certain hit songs released with the chorus remixed in various languages but from a business perspective as well The focus on a MultiCultural Act is more than just a shortterm astute strategy It not only allows Arabel to remain true to its core value of business growth through the strengths inherent with ethnic diversity it also positions the company on the ground floor of the developing economies whose creative industries will also be looking to develop through joint ventures with North American companies The Company has retained The Investor Online Group for Investor Relations to implement and maintain an ongoing market awareness program for an initial period of six months See the
