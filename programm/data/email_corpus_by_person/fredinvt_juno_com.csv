remained stubborn and resisted the TRUTH until I was Anyway though you may not have shared the gospel with me you were a powerful witness for HIM just the same Thank you for your love courage and service for the Lord God bless Beek On Wed Oct Hess Hester writes Dear Beta Bros I fully intended to respond to Woodys email and forward about President Bush much more quickly than this I noticed that there was no response out there when Woody posted this and I didnt want him to feel so lonely so here goes warning this is not lighthearted fare Im sure that life for all of us has changed to some extent since September th That day was a vivid reminder that I dont have a choice in determining how or when Im going to die barring suicide of course but I do have a choice about how Im going to live September th and the events which continue to unfold have caused me to focus a whole lot more on whats truly important in life family relationships faith Believing that those terrorists were willing to die for a lie Ive been forced to ask myself what am I willing to sacrifice for what I believe is the TRUTH For many of you guys I confess I failed to personally share what I believed was the truth even back in college I was not willing to sacrifice acceptance a hard thing for a college kid to give up Forgive me for that Unbelievably just after I wrote that last statement I was interrupted by a telephone call from the father of a guy named Gary Vale who some of you may have known He was a football player and on my freshman floor at SMU I wish I had room to tell you Garys whole story In short we were friends I watched him begin trashing his life in the Spring semester but failed to try to help much Gary became an alcoholic just sobering up three years ago But too late to recover from damage that had been done He walked into my life again two months ago when through a series of coincidences he ended up at our church His father just called to tell me that Gary died last night I cant help but wonder if this tragedy could have been avoided had I done more in the Spring of So its now with grief and an even greater sense of urgency that I write this today If recent events have moved you to a place of searching and seeking please read on and allow me a few moments of your time to share what Ive experienced as real truth about real life Ive found the evidence to be very compelling that this planet and all it contains including us is the design of a very imaginative Creator That Creator is not an impersonal force or removed and simply watching us from a distance He is a personal being who knows His creation and desperately desires to be known by them He so much desires to be known by us that in a manner that will remain a mystery until we see Him face to face He became a man in the person of Jesus Christ Some think perhaps Jesus was merely a great teacher or prophet However I realized that in order to be intellectually honest I could not accept that Jesus claimed to be God and he claimed to hold the key to peoples eternal destiny Jesusclaims left only three options He was either a liar the worst kind because he deceived people about their eternity a lunatic or he was who he said he was he was Lord Could God love me that much to go that far To allow His own Son to come and show us and teach us what God is like To die on a cross to pay the penalty of my sin and obtain my forgiveness To rise from the dead to secure the opportunity to have a personal relationship with God both now and forever Personally Ive found all of the above to be true God is a personal God Jesus is Lord And God does love me that much to suffer the death of His own Son in order to offer real life now and forever to me and anyone else who is willing to do just one thing receive that gift just accept Him A number of years ago I did accept Him And in doing that Ive experienced everything He said to be true Life has not been problemfree Thats not what He promised in fact Jesus assured us that we will have problems in this life But He has always personally been there He has always given His strength wisdom guidance peace contentment patience encouragement hope and love These Scriptures tell about it John Romans Romans Ephesians Corinthians and many more As Woodys email stated it is encouraging to know where this President is turning at such a time as this Thank God thats a personal relationship thats offered to anyone who seeks it not just the big boys Thanks for giving me a few moments to share these thoughts If youd like to talk more about this Id love to do so My phone number is office home and my email addresses are or I wish I could be at more of the gatherings but weekends are a tough time to get away in this business May God bless you all kai Hess Hester

Casey Hamacher Crystal Hobbs ken wall Danny Debbie Sewell Elaine Higgins Gary Campbell Jamie Campbell Jeanette Killebrew Katie katieJordanAOLCOM Kristine Rowans Mark Werkheiser Emily Pacheco Carolyn Richardson Kayla Pacheco Torrey Hukill Tyler Hukill Woody Berry Mike Stevens Subject President Bush Date Sat Oct A friend of mine sent this to me It is well worth your time to read and pray President Bush This was the same man who came within a hairs breadth of losing an election in November who withstood the political chicanery of the Florida Democratic machine to fix the vote count This was the same man who admitted to having a drinking problem in younger years and whose happygolucky lifestyle led him to mediocre grades in college and an illfated oil venture This was the same man who mangled syntax even more than his father and whose speaking missteps became known as Bushisms And on Friday this was the man who bore the weight of the world and the responsibilities of a generation with dignity class confidence appropriate solemnity and even muchneeded wit One thing struck me during the campaign that difficult rollercoaster campaign that now seems years ago It was that George W Bush never seemed to get ruffled Whether the theft of a campaign debate video or the sudden some would say vicious release of a DUI arrest two decades ago at a key moment W did not lose his cool At times his staff seemed overconfident as did many of us A electoralvote win they quietly implied and we optimistically believed Then they counted the votes miscounted others and recounted still others At the end he was still there Whereas Al Gore almost frantically huffed and puffed trying to gin up something out of nothing Bush quietly but confidently waited at his ranch He didnt do nothing that is the mistake people have constantly made with this man confusing lack of bluster for absence of action No his team of attorneys and the ironwilled James Baker were carrying out his orders but W stayed in the background confident and faithful You see it is this faith business that confounded everyone We have had such actors and liars in public office that we have looked skeptically whenever anyone used the term faith But this was the same man who was the first politician ever in recent memory to name Jesus Christ as the Lord of his life on public TV Not an oblique reference to being bornagain or having a life change He said the unPClike phrase Jesus Christ to which his handlers and advisors no doubt off stage were also saying Jesus Christ in a much different tone God has a way of honoring those who honor Him David learned that while he was on the run from Sauls armies Job learned that after his time of horrible tribulation The Messiah said so Himself many times So this was the man who actually put faith into practice He actually loves those who hate him It is a staggering concept so foreign in daily occurrence that few thought it anything but grandstanding Even one of Ws biggest supporters chided the President for adhering to his new tone Yet there he was again and again thanking the Democrats Appointing his enemies to high places in his government Inviting his former foes and their wives to private movie screenings and I know this is hard to stomach even treating them with dignity See this was the man who learned early on how faith worked by praying for his enemies you heap burning coals upon their heads This was the man who named the absolute top people in national security and defense then caught barbs from the politically righteous that this one didnt have the right views on abortion or that one didnt have the right position on guns And on September at midmorning this was the man thrust into a position only known by Roosevelt Churchill Lincoln and Washington The weight of the world was on his shoulders and the responsibility of a generation was on his soul So this same manthe one that the media repeatedly attempted to tarnish with charges of illegitimacy and the one whose political opponents desperately sought to stonewall until midterm electionswalked to his seat at the front of the National Cathedral just three days after the two most impressive symbols of American capitalism and prosperity virtually evaporated along with perhaps thousands of Americans As he sat down next to his wife immediately I knew that even if his faith ever faltered hers didnt I have never seen a more peaceful face than Laura Bush whose eyes seemed as though they were already gazing at the final outcome not just of this conflict but of her reward in Heaven itself In this marriage you indeed got two for the price of one Then came the defining moment of our generation Some people fondly recall their Woodstock days Others mark with grim sadness November as the day America lost her innocence But I firmly believe when the history of this time is written it will be acknowledged by friend and foe alike that President George W Bush came of age in that cathedral and lifted a nation off its knees It wasnt so much his words though read a decade later they will indeed be as stirring as any This conflict would end he noted at a time of our choosing It certainly wasnt his emotion What had to have been one of the most stunning exhibitions of selfcontrol in presidential history W was able to deliver his remarks without losing either his resolve or his focus or more important his confidence It was as if Gods hand which had guided him through that sliverthin election now rested fully on him His quiet confidence let our enemies know and believe me they know that they made a grave miscalculation Now this same man who practiced his faith through a tough election who steeled his convictions even more in a drawnout Florida battle and who never once gave in to the temptation to get in the gutter with his foes well ok maybe the Clymer comment is an exception this same man now lifted the weight of the world and the responsibility of a generation and put it on his modest shoulders as though it were another unpleasant duty As he walked back to his seat the camera angle was appropriate He was virtually alone in the scene alone in that massive place of God just him and the Lord But thats the way its always been in his life recently In that brief time it took him to return to his seat I believe he heard words to the effect of You can do this George I am with you always And you can do this well because I am going before you And dont worry about the weight Ive got it And I saw in his eyes a quiet acknowledgement I know Thank you Lord Back at his seat when W sat down George H W Bush reached over and took his sons hand The elder Bush always struck me as a religious man but not someone who shared his life on a daily basis with the Lord George H W treats the Father like a respected uncle visiting Him on appropriate holidays and knowing the relationship is real but not constant Anyway I believe that in that fatherly squeeze George H W said I wish I could do this for you son but I cant You have to do this on your own W squeezed back and gave him that look of peace that Laura had kept throughout It said I dont have to do it alone dad Ive got help What a blessing to have a professing Christian as President one who is not ashamed to admit it Please take a moment after you read this to pray for him he truly does have the weight of the world on his shoulders Pray that God will sustain him and give him wisdom and discernment in his decisions Make no mistake about it the decisions he makes in the coming days weeks and months will literally define the future of our country and the free world Pray for his protection and that of his family After you have prayed send this to everyone on your email list Our President needs Christians around the world to be praying for him As this makes the email rounds eventually there could literally be people praying for him He needs it John K OwensGet more from the Web FREE MSN
