in responding to your Email but Ill do my best to answer your questions Please keep in mind that my knowlege of MAPPs transmission charges are limited to what I have been told or read and if someone at MAPP has any additional information that would be helpful they should respond or perhaps you could address your questions to them It appears that you may be confusing MAPPs scheduling fee with the SD fee for the CAs it is confusing that they call theirs a scheduling fee also and theres two of them The CAs didnt charge their SD fee in the past as that was the practice but also MAPP was in the past telling CAs that they shouldcould NOT charge their SD fee also I believe that it was for simplicity based on the assumption that if no one charged that would be the same if all charged as we were all members Clearly the language in Sched F now indicates that the transmission customer will pay MAPPs Scheduling and Tariff Administration fee and also the CAs SD fee The following is an excerpt from MAPP tariff found on their Home page Ancillary Services are needed with transmission service to maintain reliability within and among the Control Areas affected by the transmission service The Contractor shall provide and the Transmission Customer is required to purchase under this Tariff i Scheduling and Tariff Administration and ii Reactive Supply and Voltage Control from Generation Sources In addition the Transmission Customer shall schedule transmission service directly with the applicable Transmission Provider and shall be subject to the Transmission Providers charges for scheduling service for each Transmission Provider system in which i the Transmission Customers resource is located ii the Transmission Customers load is located iii power is scheduled into the MAPP Region and iv power is scheduled to leave the MAPP Region provided that the Transmission Customer shall not be subject to more than one scheduling charge for a single system A Transmission Provider that is the local Control Area operator shall offer to provide through its individual openaccess transmission tariff either itself or through arrangements with other parties the following Ancillary Services to a Transmission Customer serving load within the Transmission Providers Control Area i Regulation and Frequency Response ii Energy Imbalance iii Operating Reserve Spinning and iv Operating Reserve Supplemental The Transmission Customer serving load within the Transmission System is required to acquire these Ancillary Services from the local Control Area operator from a third party or by selfsupply Sections and list the Ancillary Services offered under this Tariff Scheduling and Tariff Administration Service The rates andor methodology are described in Schedule Reactive Supply and Voltage Control from Generation Sources Service The rates andor methodology are described in Schedule In regards to the examples that you have listed it would be my opinion that the act of reserving transmision does not result in a Scheduling and Dispatch fee it is the actual Scheduling of the energy which would incur the charge Transmission reserved but not scheduled on would not incur a charge If you were to schedule energy on the examples you have given then a SD fee would be charged against each of your examples If I can be of any more help please let me know Thanks Terry PM Terry Excuse me for my ignorance but it is my understanding that the original MAPP F rate included scheduling fees when transacting between MAPP members With MAPP F being extended to the border companys interconnects again it was my understanding that the border company would charge their scheduling fee for any schedule that leftentered their control area as part of a MAPP F request So that I am clear on what you are planning to do could you please tell me what charges WAPA would assess for the following examples WR reserves transmission from OAHE to ShercoGen using MAPP F WR reserves transmission from OAHE to KCPLWR using MAPP F WR reserves transmission from MILESCITY TO KCPLWR using MAPP F Thank you in advance for clearing this issue up for me John Energy Trader Generation

APAGOV Steve Sanders APAGOV porg Subject RE MAPP Transmission Customers Bruce Ill try to answer your question and clarify our current policy As you will recall WAPA originally administered its own tariff and transmission was purchased directly from WAPA for all of our constrained paths There wasnt a separate Scheduling and Dispatch fee assessed for transmission purchased under the WAPA tariff as this fee was built into the transmission rate We posted ATCs for all of our constrained paths Miles City SPC SWPA now AECI and MAPP Schedule F was not offered for energy transfers into or out of the MAPP area WAPA did not charge a Scheduling and Dispatch fee for transmission purchased under MAPP Schedule F because it was not a common practice by any of the MAPP members to do so A FERC ruling required MAPP to offer MAPP Schedule F to Members and nonmembers alike and to eventually open up the use of MAPP F from border to border without the requirement to purchase transmission from the border company These were major changes and they occurred in steps with MAPP initially offering service schedule F to everyone then offering Service Schedule F rates or the border company tariff across the constrained interfaces and finally using service schedule F for all transmission into out of or through MAPP if less than years in duration During the transition WAPA was still responsible for posting the constrained interfaces monitoring the flows and reposting when required We charged our Scheduling and Dispatch fee for all requests that used service Schedule F to transition across the constrained interfaces and continue to do so today Now the system has evolved where anyone can purchase MAPP schedule F and MAPP F can be utilized to transfer e nergy into across and out of the entire MAPP member system WAPA no longer administers the constrained interfaces for short term transactions and MAPP as the transmission provider is responsible for approving all transmission requests less then years When that change took place MAPP was approached and asked to include the SD fee as part of the MAPP Schedule F service Fee but MAPP was unwilling to take on this responsibility WAPA management therefore made the decision to start separately charging a Scheduling and Dispatch fee for all service Schedule F utilizing our transmission This was initially delayed until we were able to develop the software necessary to implement a billing program automatically If the software and programming had been available earlier WAPA would have assessed the fee earlier Now the programming is in place and the decision was made to proceed I hope this answers your question Yes we have always charged the SD fee for MAPP Schedule F transactions across our constrained interfaces but have now expanded this fee to include all MAPP Schedule F OASIS requests into out of or through our system whether they cross a constrained interface or not The fee is per OASIS request per day and the fee is assessed to the purchaser of the transmission If you have any additional questions please feel free to call or Email Thank you Terry McIver Bruce Bruce CHydrobcca AM I thought we were already getting

APAGOVmapporg on AM Sent by To cc Jim Croston APAGOV Ron Klinefelter APAGOV Lloyd Linke APAGOV Darrick Moe APAGOV Steve Sanders APAGOV Subject RE MAPP Transmission Customers John Sorry for the delay in responding to your Email but Ill do my best to answer your questions Please keep in mind that my knowlege of MAPPs transmission charges are limited to what I have been told or read and if someone at MAPP has any additional information that would be helpful they should respond or perhaps you could address your questions to them It appears that you may be confusing MAPPs scheduling fee with the SD fee for the CAs it is confusing that they call theirs a scheduling fee also and theres two of them The CAs didnt charge their SD fee in the past as that was the practice but also MAPP was in the past telling CAs that they shouldcould NOT charge their SD fee also I believe that it was for simplicity based on the assumption that if no one charged that would be the same if all charged as we were all members Clearly the language in Sched F now indicates that the transmission customer will pay MAPPs Scheduling and Tariff Administration fee and also the CAs SD fee The following is an excerpt from MAPP tariff found on their Home page Ancillary Services are needed with transmission service to maintain reliability within and among the Control Areas affected by the transmission service The Contractor shall provide and the Transmission Customer is required to purchase under this Tariff i Scheduling and Tariff Administration and ii Reactive Supply and Voltage Control from Generation Sources In addition the Transmission Customer shall schedule transmission service directly with the applicable Transmission Provider and shall be subject to the Transmission Providers charges for scheduling service for each Transmission Provider system in which i the Transmission Customers resource is located ii the Transmission Customers load is located iii power is scheduled into the MAPP Region and iv power is scheduled to leave the MAPP Region provided that the Transmission Customer shall not be subject to more than one scheduling charge for a single system A Transmission Provider that is the local Control Area operator shall offer to provide through its individual openaccess transmission tariff either itself or through arrangements with other parties the following Ancillary Services to a Transmission Customer serving load within the Transmission Providers Control Area i Regulation and Frequency Response ii Energy Imbalance iii Operating Reserve Spinning and iv Operating Reserve Supplemental The Transmission Customer serving load within the Transmission System is required to acquire these Ancillary Services from the local Control Area operator from a third party or by selfsupply Sections and list the Ancillary Services offered under this Tariff Scheduling and Tariff Administration Service The rates andor methodology are described in Schedule Reactive Supply and Voltage Control from Generation Sources Service The rates andor methodology are described in Schedule In regards to the examples that you have listed it would be my opinion that the act of reserving transmision does not result in a Scheduling and Dispatch fee it is the actual Scheduling of the energy which would incur the charge Transmission reserved but not scheduled on would not incur a charge If you were to schedule energy on the examples you have given then a SD fee would be charged against each of your examples If I can be of any more help please let me know Thanks Terry PM Terry Excuse me for my ignorance but it is my understanding that the original MAPP F rate included scheduling fees when transacting between MAPP members With MAPP F being extended to the border companys interconnects again it was my understanding that the border company would charge their scheduling fee for any schedule that leftentered their control area as part of a MAPP F request So that I am clear on what you are planning to do could you please tell me what charges WAPA would assess for the following examples WR reserves transmission from OAHE to ShercoGen using MAPP F WR reserves transmission from OAHE to KCPLWR using MAPP F WR reserves transmission from MILESCITY TO KCPLWR using MAPP F Thank you in advance for clearing this issue up for me John Energy Trader Generation

APAGOV Steve Sanders APAGOV porg Subject RE MAPP Transmission Customers Bruce Ill try to answer your question and clarify our current policy As you will recall WAPA originally administered its own tariff and transmission was purchased directly from WAPA for all of our constrained paths There wasnt a separate Scheduling and Dispatch fee assessed for transmission purchased under the WAPA tariff as this fee was built into the transmission rate We posted ATCs for all of our constrained paths Miles City SPC SWPA now AECI and MAPP Schedule F was not offered for energy transfers into or out of the MAPP area WAPA did not charge a Scheduling and Dispatch fee for transmission purchased under MAPP Schedule F because it was not a common practice by any of the MAPP members to do so A FERC ruling required MAPP to offer MAPP Schedule F to Members and nonmembers alike and to eventually open up the use of MAPP F from border to border without the requirement to purchase transmission from the border company These were major changes and they occurred in steps with MAPP initially offering service schedule F to everyone then offering Service Schedule F rates or the border company tariff across the constrained interfaces and finally using service schedule F for all transmission into out of or through MAPP if less than years in duration During the transition WAPA was still responsible for posting the constrained interfaces monitoring the flows and reposting when required We charged our Scheduling and Dispatch fee for all requests that used service Schedule F to transition across the constrained interfaces and continue to do so today Now the system has evolved where anyone can purchase MAPP schedule F and MAPP F can be utilized to transfer e nergy into across and out of the entire MAPP member system WAPA no longer administers the constrained interfaces for short term transactions and MAPP as the transmission provider is responsible for approving all transmission requests less then years When that change took place MAPP was approached and asked to include the SD fee as part of the MAPP Schedule F service Fee but MAPP was unwilling to take on this responsibility WAPA management therefore made the decision to start separately charging a Scheduling and Dispatch fee for all service Schedule F utilizing our transmission This was initially delayed until we were able to develop the software necessary to implement a billing program automatically If the software and programming had been available earlier WAPA would have assessed the fee earlier Now the programming is in place and the decision was made to proceed I hope this answers your question Yes we have always charged the SD fee for MAPP Schedule F transactions across our constrained interfaces but have now expanded this fee to include all MAPP Schedule F OASIS requests into out of or through our system whether they cross a constrained interface or not The fee is per OASIS request per day and the fee is assessed to the purchaser of the transmission If you have any additional questions please feel free to call or Email Thank you Terry McIver Bruce Bruce CHydrobcca AM I thought we were already getting
