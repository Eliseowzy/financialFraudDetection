either solicitors or registered foreign lawyers Dear Paul and Edmund Thank you Edmund for sending me the proposed amendments for the GTCs including those amendments agreed by your tax departments in London and the US The mark up was very helpful and as requested I now attach revised copies of the UK and US GTCs showing those amendments The amendments shown in the UK GTC have been made in the other GTCs except for Canada where the amendments follow the US GTC amendments I have tinkered slightly with your proposed wording on Section which deals with consent for assignments where an assignment would lead to a withholding or deduction I have deleted the reference to a grossingup or withholding in respect of the payment falling on the next succeeding Payment Date This could theoretically be a Seller Payment although at the time of the assignment it would not be known whether the Seller Payment would fall due before the next Buyer Payment Given that the wording is for the avoidance of doubt only I think it is acceptable to state the position in more general terms I wonder whether or not there should also be a specific reference to withholding consent where rights are assigned to an entity which is outside the jurisdictions where we have taken a legal advice on the product The wording could for example refer to a requirement for a legal opinion to be given in respect of a proposed transferee to satisfy the nontransferring party that the transferee would be bound by the terms of the GTC However you may wish to rely on the more general protection that to withhold consent in these circumstances would be reasonable and it is therefore covered by the existing wording It is also arguable that it would be reasonable to withhold consent in circumstances where there is an assignment to a particular assignee and a withholding or deduction is likely to occur as a result of that assignment and that the additional for avoidance of doubt wording is also unnecessary One point which has occurred to us is that the final sentence of Section which permits transfers by Enron for financing purposes is not qualified by the need to obtain consent to an assignment This is clearly in Enrons favour but the additional for avoidance of doubt wording may in fact highlight the final sentence of Section to the counterparty and on that basis it may be better to leave out the for avoidance of doubt wording altogether Perhaps we could like to discuss this point further in the morning There seems little point at this stage circulating the GTCs for the other jurisdictions as further changes may be required depending on the responses from the foreign lawyers Subject to those responses my understanding is that the GTCs are now in their final form If there are any additional comments to come form your tax or commercial teams it would be helpful if these could be sent over before close of play today so that we can produce a final round of drafts with all comments included Of course if you have any comments on the attached please let me know Kind regards Gavin CAdoc CAdoc

both then ask unless you already know what products traders want as tokenised and set these up for them They can then start using the new tokenised products the day after they have been set up as the

Edmund Forwarded by Edmund CooperLONECT on PM Janine Juggins PM To David CT cc Edmund CT Stephen H CT Louise CT Subject Business process language On line payee tax representation issues The final generic payee tax representation language is being sent through by Slaughter May tonight and will be incorporated into the Generic Financial GTC As we discussed earlier the approach taken will require two additional fields in our Financial Confirmations Since we are continuing to prepare these written Financial confirmations the normal back office procedures will apply to their issuance and thus this requirement should not have any direct impact on the on line systems It does however introduce a requirement to make a change to the confirmation templates which needs to be in place ready for the first on line transactions in September I believe there are different templates in use for the different Financial businesses I suggest that the two new fields required in the Financial Confirmations are included under the section outlining the general terms of the swapThese will take the form of Counterparty Payor Jurisdiction Insert country of incorporation of the Counterparty Counterparty Payee Jurisdictions Insert country in which the trading office through which the Counterparty transacts is located If different to insert country in which the office through which the Counterparty will make payment is located Once new customers are established and also for existing customer base would this be a good way of approaching dealing with the existing customer base with the aim of eliminating Annex A which are different only because of the tax reps perhaps a good way of maintaining this data would be to set it up on a spreadsheet or the counterparty database direct link from the New Customer Registration Form Thus the decision on which countries to insert would only need to be made once on setting up a new counterparty For example the spreadsheet could look like this Counterparty Description Counterparty Payor Jurisdiction Counterparty Payee Jurisdiction Counterparty Payee Juris Morgan Stanley Singapore Pte Ltd Singapore Singapore Morgan Stanley London branch US UK Morgan Stanley Paris branch US France There will also need to be a clear statement on the Financial Confirmation that it is the Counterpartys responsibility to notify Enron where the Counterparty Payor or Payee Jurisdiction information is incorrect This is particularly important for the tax representations as Enron is using its judgement to identify the relevant countries but this may not always be correct sometimes the place of management of the business is the relevant factor and Enron is not in a position to know this This actually is no different to the situation we have today when it is Enron which determines which variety of the Annex A gets sent out New Customer Registration Form a Please add an additional question under Legal Information required Country from which payment is to be made if different b The following has not yet been agreed by Steve Douglas but I wanted to raise the subject to get comments on the issue of European counterparties trading financials directly with US Enron entities Statement to be added under the heading of Tax Information Required US new customer registration form only Please submit to ECTRC IRS Form W and IRS Form or IRS Form W and IRS Form as applicable indicating the authority under which payments to be made to you are not subject to US Federal Income Tax withholding Since this statement is not required for ECTRI European counterparties this leads to a New Counterparty Registration Form for US counterparties and a separate New Counterparty Registration Form for European counterparties is this an issue Also is it the intention to give to European counterparties the ability to trade financial products which would be contracted for by US Enron entities eg Pulp Financials and Plastics etc in this case it would make commercial sense to send the European counterparty the correct IRS Forms in order to eliminate this as an obstacle to the registration process I have also asked Edmund to confirm whether we would want to avoid European counterparties contracting financials directly with US Enron entities for European financial regulatory reasons Business Process You asked for some language to include in the Business Process to describe this procedure Heres my suggestion Tax Representations The responses to the Legal Information Requirements set out on the New Customer Registration Form will link directly to the Counterparty Payor Jurisdiction and the Counterparty Payee Jurisdiction fields on the relevant Financial confirmation or should be entered into the counterparty database or should be entered into the spreadsheet for maintaing tax representation data The response to question is the Counterparty Payor Jurisdiction the responses to questions and if any are the Counterparty Payee Jurisdictions Tax Department should review the New Customer Registration forms periodically frequency daily weekly currently we do this every time a new counterparty is set up but we do not want to introduce unnecessary delays to the registration process when there is a window of time to make an adjustment to the databaseother medium feeding into the confirms before the first trade has been done to identify obvious inconsistencies in the responses the onus is on the customer to identify errors but we should probably act in good faith in assisting to identify obvious errors Sorry this is so long Regards Janine

loadshape is referenced in another part of the description and so does not need to be referenced here eg in Uk power ones says fro pm on trade day to pm ont he following day for Day Ahead You need to both then ask unless you already know what products traders want as tokenised and set these up for them They can then start using the new tokenised products the day after they have been set up as the

Edmund Forwarded by Edmund CooperLONECT on PM Janine Juggins PM To David CT cc Edmund CT Stephen H CT Louise CT Subject Business process language On line payee tax representation issues The final generic payee tax representation language is being sent through by Slaughter May tonight and will be incorporated into the Generic Financial GTC As we discussed earlier the approach taken will require two additional fields in our Financial Confirmations Since we are continuing to prepare these written Financial confirmations the normal back office procedures will apply to their issuance and thus this requirement should not have any direct impact on the on line systems It does however introduce a requirement to make a change to the confirmation templates which needs to be in place ready for the first on line transactions in September I believe there are different templates in use for the different Financial businesses I suggest that the two new fields required in the Financial Confirmations are included under the section outlining the general terms of the swapThese will take the form of Counterparty Payor Jurisdiction Insert country of incorporation of the Counterparty Counterparty Payee Jurisdictions Insert country in which the trading office through which the Counterparty transacts is located If different to insert country in which the office through which the Counterparty will make payment is located Once new customers are established and also for existing customer base would this be a good way of approaching dealing with the existing customer base with the aim of eliminating Annex A which are different only because of the tax reps perhaps a good way of maintaining this data would be to set it up on a spreadsheet or the counterparty database direct link from the New Customer Registration Form Thus the decision on which countries to insert would only need to be made once on setting up a new counterparty For example the spreadsheet could look like this Counterparty Description Counterparty Payor Jurisdiction Counterparty Payee Jurisdiction Counterparty Payee Juris Morgan Stanley Singapore Pte Ltd Singapore Singapore Morgan Stanley London branch US UK Morgan Stanley Paris branch US France There will also need to be a clear statement on the Financial Confirmation that it is the Counterpartys responsibility to notify Enron where the Counterparty Payor or Payee Jurisdiction information is incorrect This is particularly important for the tax representations as Enron is using its judgement to identify the relevant countries but this may not always be correct sometimes the place of management of the business is the relevant factor and Enron is not in a position to know this This actually is no different to the situation we have today when it is Enron which determines which variety of the Annex A gets sent out New Customer Registration Form a Please add an additional question under Legal Information required Country from which payment is to be made if different b The following has not yet been agreed by Steve Douglas but I wanted to raise the subject to get comments on the issue of European counterparties trading financials directly with US Enron entities Statement to be added under the heading of Tax Information Required US new customer registration form only Please submit to ECTRC IRS Form W and IRS Form or IRS Form W and IRS Form as applicable indicating the authority under which payments to be made to you are not subject to US Federal Income Tax withholding Since this statement is not required for ECTRI European counterparties this leads to a New Counterparty Registration Form for US counterparties and a separate New Counterparty Registration Form for European counterparties is this an issue Also is it the intention to give to European counterparties the ability to trade financial products which would be contracted for by US Enron entities eg Pulp Financials and Plastics etc in this case it would make commercial sense to send the European counterparty the correct IRS Forms in order to eliminate this as an obstacle to the registration process I have also asked Edmund to confirm whether we would want to avoid European counterparties contracting financials directly with US Enron entities for European financial regulatory reasons Business Process You asked for some language to include in the Business Process to describe this procedure Heres my suggestion Tax Representations The responses to the Legal Information Requirements set out on the New Customer Registration Form will link directly to the Counterparty Payor Jurisdiction and the Counterparty Payee Jurisdiction fields on the relevant Financial confirmation or should be entered into the counterparty database or should be entered into the spreadsheet for maintaing tax representation data The response to question is the Counterparty Payor Jurisdiction the responses to questions and if any are the Counterparty Payee Jurisdictions Tax Department should review the New Customer Registration forms periodically frequency daily weekly currently we do this every time a new counterparty is set up but we do not want to introduce unnecessary delays to the registration process when there is a window of time to make an adjustment to the databaseother medium feeding into the confirms before the first trade has been done to identify obvious inconsistencies in the responses the onus is on the customer to identify errors but we should probably act in good faith in assisting to identify obvious errors Sorry this is so long Regards Janine

London and the US The mark up was very helpful and as requested I now attach revised copies of the UK and US GTCs showing those amendments The amendments shown in the UK GTC have been made in the other GTCs except for Canada where the amendments follow the US GTC amendments I have tinkered slightly with your proposed wording on Section which deals with consent for assignments where an assignment would lead to a withholding or deduction I have deleted the reference to a grossingup or withholding in respect of the payment falling on the next succeeding Payment Date This could theoretically be a Seller Payment although at the time of the assignment it would not be known whether the Seller Payment would fall due before the next Buyer Payment Given that the wording is for the avoidance of doubt only I think it is acceptable to state the position in more general terms I wonder whether or not there should also be a specific reference to withholding consent where rights are assigned to an entity which is outside the jurisdictions where we have taken a legal advice on the product The wording could for example refer to a requirement for a legal opinion to be given in respect of a proposed transferee to satisfy the nontransferring party that the transferee would be bound by the terms of the GTC However you may wish to rely on the more general protection that to withhold consent in these circumstances would be reasonable and it is therefore covered by the existing wording It is also arguable that it would be reasonable to withhold consent in circumstances where there is an assignment to a particular assignee and a withholding or deduction is likely to occur as a result of that assignment and that the additional for avoidance of doubt wording is also unnecessary One point which has occurred to us is that the final sentence of Section which permits transfers by Enron for financing purposes is not qualified by the need to obtain consent to an assignment This is clearly in Enrons favour but the additional for avoidance of doubt wording may in fact highlight the final sentence of Section to the counterparty and on that basis it may be better to leave out the for avoidance of doubt wording altogether Perhaps we could like to discuss this point further in the morning There seems little point at this stage circulating the GTCs for the other jurisdictions as further changes may be required depending on the responses from the foreign lawyers Subject to those responses my understanding is that the GTCs are now in their final form If there are any additional comments to come form your tax or commercial teams it would be helpful if these could be sent over before close of play today so that we can produce a final round of drafts with all comments included Of course if you have any comments on the attached please let me know Kind regards Gavin CAdoc CAdoc

<16632670.1075860044988.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,edmund.cooper@enron.com,1999-10-20 11:08:00,Online Trading GTCMaster variation Cc Jeff and Mark Justin and I have been discussing the way we should approach variation of the ETA in respect of counterparties with whom we have an existing master agreement but for whom we want to have transactions governed by the applicable GTC for the product in question The initial plan was to issue a letter to the counterparty asking it to sign and return a letter agreement which would vary the provision of ETA which states that a master agreement will govern all transactions We have now reformulated our position and drafted a letter attached below which will simply be sent to the relevant counterparty but which will not require it to sign and return any documents We believe that this letter will provide for an effective variation of the ETA by stating that the counterpartys acceptance of the GTC on the EOL system will mean that that GTC will govern transactions and not the master agreement We do not think that we need to make an explicit reference to the ETA Obviously for this to work such counterparty will have to be presented with the Accept GTC button at the usual juncture in the system In addition we thought it best to remove an explantory paragraph stating that we will be writing to the counterparty at a future date to revise the credit provisions of the master the whole reason for having the counterparty accept the GTC over the master Obviously we welcome your thoughts on this issue and the attached draft I also presume you will need to take a view as to whether varying the ETA in this way will be effective under New York law Best regards Edmund
