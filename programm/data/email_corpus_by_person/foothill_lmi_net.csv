talk at the WPTF General Meeting in Phoenix a few weeks ago The story takes place in the good ol days of the Soviet Union when Brezhnev was Premier Brezhnev and the rest of the Politburo one fine May Day were watching the tanks and missiles pass by the Kremlin Wall when Leonid noticed in the middle of the parade a truck carrying a group of civilians He turned to Dmitri Ustinov the Defense Minister and asked Who are they Ustinov replied Those a re our economists You just wouldnt believe their destructive potential This is appropriate for our time and our situation The economists descend ed upon us when the California market was designed but we know not from where Aliens Since weaving conspiracy theories is a popular past time in Sacramento We just know they are gouging us them bullies I believe th at one must do the same by following the money Im not talking about the campaign contributions in Gray Davis pocket The most money has gone from power sales in California to the Canadian Province of British Columbia It was a plot the Canadians hatched I mean look at Governor Davis He looks kind of BCish Skinny and lanky wimpy hair and a hesitation in his speech He talks their language a mix of misspelled French meet me at th e centre English and Eh One night in the BC government secretl y sent us some economists by the truckload to destroy California The utilities probably paid for the bus tickets I happen to know that Frank Wolak Chair of the ISO Market Surveillance Committee once lectured at a University in Vancouver BC What more evidence do you need The BC Government sent us cheap hydro power sold at inflated market prices so tha t they could do what the citizens of California wanted to do with their budge t largess build roads schools and hospitals They didnt think we coul d figure out their plot but we did Now is the time for California to counterattack Well send them some of our politicians a bipartisan grou p including a few who can add and some of our select energy thugs from the CPUC and the Blind Oversight Board Speaking of times and situations there was a time when discussing the ISO words such as communist and Nazi were only uttered by my pal Carl Imparato We would shake our heads and chuckle at Carls extremism We arent laughing now The descriptors seem to arise again and again in poli te conversation by a wider circle of people I watch with utter amusement because the alternative is retching breakfast at the demagoguery of the I SO Governing Board the Market Despair Team the Governors office and some members of the California Legislature Like an audience watching a tragedy from hell we scream aloud These people are crazy And indeed they are Mr President is not helping us at all by continuing to wrangle over who ge ts the musical Chair at FERC Bubba Curt or Bubba Patrick Listen to us Mr President Let Bubba Curt keep the reigns for a year or two and let Bubba Patrick take a seat at the table We need someone with a shockproof BS detector Someone who can honestly field a motion to dismiss the Californi a ISO The time is long overdue to shoot this horse in the head Not all is evil This week in Houston the resource capital of California I visited the trading floor folks at Dynegy before attending the WTPF Board meeting The coolest thing I saw besides all the neat gadgets on each traders desk was the coffee machine Brother Jolly Hayden showed me how to use it You pick the type of coffee you want The contents of the coffee are in a shotglass sized plastic tub with a foil top I picked Venezuelan Decaffeinated Waxy Crude The tub is placed inside the brewing machine and the start button is pushed Presto coffee drips from the spout into a waiting cup I asked Jolly How did the hot water get mixed into the grou nd beans He removed the tub from the machine and showed me a pin prick hole made in the foil top and another that was made at the bottom Is that nea t or what I would like to buy a brewing machine just like the Dynegy coffee machine but a little larger I would set up a booth in Sacramento on the corner o f th and L and bark out to passing members of the Legislature Free spa ce shuttle Come and see life on other planets They would jump at the chanc e to visit other planets I would seat them in the machine push the start button and voila Dripping out would be the essence of democracy Dont worry about the holes needed at the top and the bottom They are already there and quite enlarged Back to my day at Dynegy Trade floors might seem similar across companies but the small differences speak to the management style embraced by the cre w and its leaders Each electric trading desk for various parts of the country is set up a little bit differently For example some desks have a person doing assetbacked trading but some dont When I arrived at am Houston time the Eastern desk was busy in its trade day The Western folk s hadnt arrived yet Later I sat with Randy LeForce of the Western desk Captain LeForce to you he told me He could talk big because Dave Francis who sits next to Randy and hangs witty quotes from the ceiling above his head Even a blind pig could make money in this market was on vacation As the pace of the trading gathered steam Randy kept an eye on all the different people working the Western trading desk The Captain worked it like a maestro During my visit some Dynegy folks came up to me introduced themselves an d said how much they enjoyed the Friday Burrito Ill tell you what There are few things in life that give me as much satisfaction Complete strange rs who tell you that something you do makes them feel good well it doesnt g et any better than that Garrison Keillor the wellknown author of Lake Woebegone Days and NPR radio entertainer once said a writer should have an audience Not everyone in the world should be in the audience but an audience nonetheless of some people I now know what he means And the people I met on the trading floor felt like they knew me and shared with m e their thoughts and opinions on a lot of things Often they asked me Are those California people really that crazy Since last week you might have noticed the pace at the FERC has picked up somewhat Last Friday the FERC issued an Order on possible refunds for alleged overcharges by parties selling to the ISO last January That was news worthy Then on Wednesday the FERC issued an Order to remove barrie rs to additional electric generation in the West The Order admits that it wont change the dire situation in the West but these are steps in the rig ht direction The FERC also issued on Wednesday a showcause order to AES and Williams regarding the maintenance of RMR units that were called by the ISO in April and May of That is a serious case that we must watch closely Also this week the California Senate kicked off its own investigation this will be the tenth such investigation of the California markets to uncover alleged price manipulation The Senate Committee will have subpoena rights and if I understand it correctly they plan to subpoe na individuals Sounds like a Kangaroo Court and a ThreeRing Circus to me Thursday Secretary Abraham stated in a congressional hearing that the West would certainly experience power outages this summer Finally an LA Times reporter asked me if I had heard that a small QF company had filed for seizure of SCE property to satisfy an outstanding debt That would be step one of the bankruptcy chacha All in all a typical week among crazy people Lets see what else we can talk about Things in the Peoples Republic of California PUC Updates Utility Liabilities Be a Source for Energy Price Update BPA Misquoted in the WSJ Things FERC Market Monitoring Proposal Letters Jobs and People Odds Ends DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDD Things in the Peoples Republic of California PUC Updates Utility Liabilities My favorite regulator the California PUC issued an Order in the Utilities Rate Stabilization case to reopen the record on utility audits Although the text of the order is unremarkable the data tables bring up to date as of March the outstanding liabilities of PGE and SCE The PGE commercial paper obligation due as of March increased by million since January for a total default amount of million QF purchases increased by million for the same fiveweek period now totaling million The ISO payments increased million now totali ng billion and the direct access charge backs for negative PX credits increased million now totaling million PGEs total default amount is now billion excluding amounts yet to be collected from PGE customers for DWR purchases The SCE balance is as follows The commercial paper obligation that is due as of March increased by million since January for a total default amount of million SCE defaulted on a significant amount of longterm debt principal and interest roughly million QF purchase defaults increased by million for the same fiveweek period now totaling million The ISO obligations decreased million and the direct access charge backs for negative PX credits increased million now totaling million SCEs total default amount is now billion excluding amounts yet to be collected from SCE customers for DWR purchases There is little question that the QFs are taking it on the chin big time In the last five weeks between January and March the defaulted payments to the QF owners from both utilities has increased million The total QF default for both utilities as of March stands at billion Does anyone wonder why MW of QF capacity has shut down in California Without these payments being made very soon I would expect th e amount of shut down QF capacity to easily double or more Why would these projects produce without the promise of being paid Things in the Peoples Republic of California Be a Source for Energy Price Update Art ODonnell editor and associate publisher of the wellknown and widely read California Energy Market CEM is looking for traders willing to participate in his survey in exchange for receiving an advanced copy The Survey is a regular feature in CEM The information collected by Art is matched against the responses of the other people he interviews and some posted sources Pricewaterhouse Coopers BPAs daily offerings for instance It is written up in narrative form The report goes out twice weekly once on Wednesday afternoonevening via email as a courtesy to the respondents because the week is pretty much done by then and a rewrite o n Friday that is emailed around am posted on the newsdatacom Web site and published in the newsletter for general consumption The Friday report also features a brief story about natural gas markets in the West The WPTF Board of Directors has allowed me to publicize this offering and to explain that if your company is interested in participating the informatio n you provide to Art would be protected as confidential In Arts words Th e price survey is unlike some attempts at creating a tradable index numb er eg McGrawHills Power Markets Week index or the Dow Jones indices is more of a narrative about the state of the market d a pulse reading as opposed to a blood pressure number or an EKG As such I do not ask traders and schedulers for precise dollar figures or volumes associated with specif ic trades but rather questions like Whats MidColumbia going for today What about offpeak How has that changed since this morning Oh yeah why is that Anything else I should know The WPTF Board asked Art to explain how the information he collects would b e protected since so many marketers and generators are under State data subpoenas Art replied The Constitution of the State of California provides for a blanket immunity against government intrusions for news gathering from confidential sources and unpublished information something which we believe in strongly at Energy NewsData Corporation and which we ar e willing to go to jail to protect So if for instance the Attorney General tried to subpoena me or anyone from my staff about power price information we would refuse to divulge anything other than the already published accounts send back a copy of the Constitution contact the attorneys for the Society of Professional Journalists and start preparing a benef it party to raise legal fees If you would like to participate in Arts survey please email him at Things in the Peoples Republic of California BPA Misquoted in the WSJ In last weeks Burrito I referred to a Wall Street Journal article that portrayed a BPA trader as admonishing the DWR for accepting bids over marke t prices I was surprised when I received the following email from BPAs David Mills His message to me copied a letter he sent to DWRs Ray Hart explaining what he meant as opposed to what he was quoted as saying Dear Ray As per our telephone discussion I just wanted to reiterate a few things rethe Wall Street Journal article and the quotes attributed to me At no time during the interview with Ms Smith did I state that I thought that CDWRs offers were out of line with the prevailing market price in Californ ia or that your traders should check that price before entering the market T he reporter was quite interested in the price difference between California an d the MidC price here in the Northwest and when I asked I told her that currently that price delta was roughly MWhr with MidC being lower than the CA prices I did not indicate to the reporter that I thought that CDWR was paying more than the California market price and was simply trying to make a comparison of price relativity between California and the Northwest Lastly BPA has on occasion charged extraregional entities less than the prevailing market price but has only done so to remain consistent with our own pricing strategies I apologize for any misconceptions or miscommunications that may have resulted from this and look forward to a continuing working relationship between CDWR and BPA Things FERC Market Monitoring Proposal FERC Staff issued a report with Recommendations on Prospective Market Monitoring and Mitigation for the California Wholesale Electric Power Market WPTF members are taking this proposal very seriously and we inte nd to provide comments on March If you are interested in a copy of the report go to bulkpowerbulkpowerhtm General members are able to participate along with the Board members and other general members working on our response We have retained the servic es of Dr Ben Zycher of the RAND Corporation to help us draft the policy issues He will be working with our counsel Dan Douglass of Arter Hadde n to craft our reply In short our submission will point out the flaws in FERCs proposed methodology and demonstrate the shortcomings of narrowly limiting the definition of producer marginal cost to operating variable cost Further excluding measures of credit worthiness are an important missing variable i n the FERC analysis Next week I will include a short summary of our respon se in the Burrito Letters I received a note from one of our legal beagles that drop me a line every n ow and then I dont have the facts of the case to which this person refers but I hope the sender provides us with an update if a judgement should occu r Universal Studios wants FERC to find that Universal owes no penalty to SCE for not interrupting its interruptible load under a CPUC rate schedule because SCE did not adhere to the FERC requirement in the Dec order to schedule of its load in the day ahead market according to Universal if SCE had done so then it would have had to provide Universal power at below its cost SCE didnt and Universal got interrupted and now Universal owes Does anyone else know about this filing Lind Guerry veteran of the PX halcyon days wrote Hi Gary Hope youre having a nice day Just wanted to let you know that Im really enjoying th e Burrito and am so glad youre sending it to my home email I really got a kick out of the Ten Reasons Its hard to believe that our wonderful state is in such incompetent hands isnt it And not only are they incompetent they continue to remain so with such regularity you could probably make a killing marketing their incompetence as a laxative Do you think if we tried to do that wed get accused of exercising market power Think of the power wed wield as the holder of the largest amount of incompetence Lind we need a product name for the laxative idea Any ideas How about Sane Away Jobs and People The folks at Dynegy sent me a couple of job postings If your company has similar posting or job openings or if you are reader looking for a new gig drop me a line After all its free Position Description Dynegys position has responsibility for the development of transmission an d power markets in a geographic region of the US Duties are driven primari ly by federal regional and state activities to restructure and deregulate th e electric power industry and the need for industry participants to develop and implement market structures policies and regulations that promote liquid and competitive transmission and power markets Significant activit y within a region to reshape the structure and operation of the transmission grid is resulting from FERC Order which directs the establishment of Regional Transmission Organizations Extensive travel and higher at times is highly probable Primary goals of this position are to Create more liquid and competitive transmission and power markets Maximize th e value of Dynegys positions and assets by working closely with the trading and power groups to develop and implement commercial strategies that crea te and capture significant business opportunities and Provide timely and accurate information market intelligence and recommendations to clients Maximize the value of Dynegys positions and assets by working closely with the trading and power groups to develop and implement commercial strategies that create and capture significant business opportunities and recommendations to clients Interested parties should contact Jolly Hayden at Odds Ends First I would like to welcome WPTFs newest general member Wellhead Electric Hal Dittmer is the founder and president of Wellhead I have known Hal for a couple of years first as a client for my over priced consulting services and later as a friend and source of all kinds of usefu l information Wellhead is one of those QF owners who are owed a boatload of money However Hals company is developing some new projects and he is looking for prospective power buyers Hence his interest in WPTF is obvious Wellhead is WPTFs st member Well the Dynegy gang has been a source of comfort and joy to me this week They couldnt let me leave their abode without stuffing a song in my pocket that is a tribute to their creative skills Timely too Sing it to the tu ne of California Dreaming by the Mamas and the Papas ISO California to the tune of Hotel California On a dark Western highway No wind in my hair No rain for the hydro No NOX in the air Up ahead in the distance I saw a flickering sight The load grew heavy and the lights grew dim No relief in the night So we stood in the darkness Down at the Taco Bell And I was thinking to myself This could be Heaven or this could be Hell We lit up a candle No power in the Bay There were voices down the corridor I thought I heard them say Welcome to the ISO California Such a lovely place Such a lovely place Such a lovely face Powering up for the ISO California What a nice surprise What a nice surprise Bring your alibis Its mind is policy twisted Cant stop consumption trends Got a lot of NIMBY boys Cisco calls friends How we sweat in the courthouse Sweet summer sweat Without the AC We try

was a close one Favre threw the ball down field to his favorite receiver last Monday night Antonio Freeman in what turned out to be the last play of the game in overtime Vikings defenseman Dishman flicked the ball up in the air Freeman went to the ground but the ball landed on Freemans back It slid down Freemans jersey and as he turned to look the ball gently poured into Freemans waiting open hands The ball and Freeman made a fair catch and a quick trip to the end zone Game over Packers won That was the closest and best ending to a football game I can recall in a long time Otherwise it was a hohum week Oh yah The State of California held its oneparty election last Tuesday and all members of that party won I think There is no Republican Party anymore in California Those politicians have been exported like our instate electrons under pricecaps to Arizona or Nevada The radical minority is now firmly in place This will make powerrelated legislation a hoot in the coming legislative session A vetoproof Assembly and Senate with a billion surplus Jeez What would you care to bet that we dont see one nickel of that billion in tax reductions You know were in trouble when Lady Bird Bowen and Steve Peace claim that they are each to the far right of their Democratic colleagues Speaking of Mr Peace we had a chance to meet for the first time and have a real conversation It was in Washington DC a good neutral turf at the hotel where quite a few other Californians and I were staying We were attending FERCs technical conference on the Order issued last week It was all an accident I suppose I was sipping a brewski with CMUAs Tony Braun in the hotel bar I was explaining to Tony what a terrible thing it was for CMUA to support a return to cost of service rates and what are we going to do about the ISOs GMC filing In walks Peace and his legislative aide John Rozsa So being a nice guy I utilized your hardearned WPTF dues and bought them both a drink A bloody Mary for Rozsa and decaf coffee for the Senator Twoandonehalf hours later we were still drinking and talking I hate to admit it but I had a good time Why do you call John Fielder The Great Warrior Peace asked me after I shared with him my nickname for JF I told him the story skipping all the nicknames handed out in past Burritos to the two gentlemen in my then present company A lot of what we discussed Peace repeated to the FERC Commissioners the next day Below I review the logic of his case concerning the future of Californias restructured power industry For the first time I see the method in his madness He takes a very political view of things which means economics and physics dont hold a candle to political factors We also talked about the power business movie production Attack of the Killer Tomatoes V is coming out soon I asked wasnt ATKT I through IV enough He said he was going to keep on doing it until he got it right I offered that that was exactly what Glen Campbell said when he married his fifth wife Dennis Miller on Monday Night Football we dont like DM on MNF and why he ever took an interest in the power industry answer he goes into it and out of our industry from time to time just for a visit And at the moment I am working on the Burrito in my DC hotel room watching the clock advance into the wee hours of the night Whats a Thursday night without a Burrito to write I wont finish this weeks edition on time I only have my travel computer with me So the Burrito will go out Friday or Saturday Be patient and dont get pushy If its going to take another week to declare George W the new President assuming the Florida vote remains stable then you can wait a day or two for the Burrito By the way Last weeks Burrito was a great companion for those of you without much humor in your life Pity Many of the newer readers lapped up the ISO Going Out of Business items One reader wanted to know if they could purchase the Market Power Exercise Bike in California export to Oregon where it sells for ten times the price and then bring it back in the State I said you could do that but it would be wrong I would report that person to the Market Surveillance Committee and as punishment that person would have to read every document the ISOs Department of Market Analysis ever wrote Some arent even colored in yet Here is this weeks menu Things at the FERC A Day at the FERC The Mailbag Odds Ends Things at the FERC A Day at the FERC There is one thing you have to give the FERC Commissioners They put in a full day and more when they hold one of these touchy feely meetings at their headquarters in Washington DC From am to pm they kept up the QA panel after panel What was accomplished Again it is hard to say because I had trouble reading the will of the Commissioners based on body language or questions they posed to the panelists The four Commissioners gave little hint of what was on their minds and you wonder what they were absorbing I did notice that all four Commissioners reviewed any and all written material presented by the panelists I couldnt figure out how they were able to read listen and ask questions simultaneously The highlight of the day unquestionably was our California Delegation of Lynch Keese Kahn Peace Bowen and a Republican supervisor from the County of San Diego They brought with them a video address from Governor Gray Davis I dont know how to describe the video but I will try Imagine a talking head with hands behind a desk with the American and California flags in the background Imagine the Gov castigating the FERC Commissioners for not following through with their jobs after claiming that wholesale markets are dysfunctional and that wholesale power rates are unjust and unreasonable Imagine this State official verbally whipping the Gang of Four for not ordering refunds Imagine the Gangs surprise to hear the Gov tell them that reappointment of the ISO Governing Board members is not within FERCs jurisdiction THEN imagine the same Gov camera close up smiling and ending with Other than that youre a pretty nice group of people That was the States opening to the FERC The crowd first stunned roared with laughter Was this intentional or an outtake some one slipped into the tape Well never know Steve Peace went into his explanation about the facts of life Listen The political landscape of California has changed It is wildly liberal nee socialist If there is another summer of price spikes like last summer with the very real possibility that both SCE and PGE will be done with their respective rate freezes then over million electric customers will be susceptible to damagingly high rates The populace will revolt A ballot initiative not unlike the failed Prop will appear in November of and the Governor running for reelection will support the proposition The proposition will also be supported by the three underpinnings of the Democratic Party labor minorities and environmentalists The proposition may require that all IOU assets be condemned by the State including the output of the divested power plants The proposition will pass and like all good propositions will be challenged in court The court case will lead to a settlement whereby consumers and generators will rearrange the money transfer between buyers and sellers and FERC will sit idly by as over fifty percent of the generation assets in the West are controlled by the State of California Stuff that in your RTO pipe Does Senator Peace think this is a good idea No Does he think it is politically possible Yes Why He refers to a landmark case he calls Texaco vs Federal Power Commission as the case which makes this a slam dunk I am not familiar with this case but we have plenty of Burrito readers who might Educate us please and give us your assessment In any event the whole kit and caboodle will end up in a court challenge and if FERC wants to avoid the ballot initiative and the challenge FERC should retroactively order the refunds from the generators because the FERC has deemed wholesale rates to be unjust and unreasonable Now whether or not I agree with the Peaces scenario and Lady Bird Bowen nodded to it too the logic isnt flawed The premises may be but not the logic I think a ballot initiative to wipe out the competitive market is likely regardless of what FERC does or doesnt do The UDCs wont object Their stranded costs will be paid and what the heck maybe they can return to the days of rateofreturn regulation The unions will love it no doubt because it implies jobs Minorities will support it no doubt because the havenots need to stop the alleged gouging by the generators Environmentalists will be stuck between a rock and a hard place They want conservation and demand management which you dont get without market prices Environmentalists may be iffy DKNY give us your opinion That was the card the California Delegation played upon FERCs table I didnt see one FERC Commissioner blink I didnt see one person on our side blink either I can tell you why I think this plan wont work But that isnt important Whats important is that each of you understands the logic that drives the scenario Ballot initiatives are a California specialty So we are faced with the stark reality of having to face an initiative in two years that is challangeable time consuming and expensive Impossible Maybe maybe not Mr Florio of TURN made comments early in the day one of which suggested that if FERC orders the ISO stakeholder Governing Board to be replaced thats good he says then the State and FERC should compromise on a board with a mix of State and techno interests In other words lets keep the EOBs finger in the ISO pie Without a negotiation on Governing Board replacement there will be a long legal wrangle that will leave the ISO rudderless To this I responded on my panel as did others there is no way FERC can allow a compromise That would put the same problems before the Commission at a later date Its Governance more so than market structure In fact you could summarize the three competing theses about the problems in California thusly Governance first and market structure second thats us I believe or market structure first and Governance second SEMPRA TURN fellow travelers or the hell with both Governance and market structure just force the generators to refund the alleged excesses Peoples Republic Of course there was plenty of discourse on the Orders proposed price cap of I think FERC got the usual amount of confusing signals from all parties Some say the cap is too high some say too low some say just right and some say to hell with price caps just force the generators to refund the alleged excesses Peoples Republic The Commissioners ended the long day with a series of questions they would like respondents to address in their November nd written comments What should the CPUC do either on its own or in conjunction with FERC to establish policies that provide for UDC reasonableness for cost recovery if the UDCs procure power from a supplier other than the PX Day Ahead market What is the definitive story as to the price spike in California this summer given all the information on generating costs opportunity costs etc How did we get to the prices to which we observed This was Hoeckers question and I find it disturbing because the FERC staff report did a great job I thought explaining the factors What more does he want What are peoples observation regarding the division of responsibilities between FERC and the CPUC in handling Californias wholesale bulk power market What should be the selection process to replace the ISO and PX Governing Boards that will avoid the resurrection of the influences currently found among the stakeholder boards What should FERC do as an alternative to the price cap and how should FERC evaluate bids above the cap level Should the ISO be rid of the secondprice auction How can FERC move California into the regional power market of the West Did FERC get it right when they specified a replacement board for the ISO and PX of members From the Mailbag I got a lot of mail on last weeks stuff A lot and I love it It means I have to create less original tripe and at the same time allow you all to educate the rest of the group For example BPAs Don Wolfe wrote Putting price caps in place until the market is proved to be competitive is like nailing your foot to the floor until you prove you can dance Jim Kritikson had some interesting comments about the FERC Order He said p FERC Order elimination of the requirement for balanced schedules p We therefore direct the ISO and the PX to pursue establishing an integrated day ahead market in which all demand and supply bids are addressed in one venue These items seem to call for an ISO dayahead integrated dispatch In fact this goes further then elimination of the market separation constraint that was previously discussed That is it would seem to say it is OK for you to send in a demand schedule with no supply and a bid indicating how much you are willing to pay via your adjustment bid and the ISO will find a suitable supply for you p Therefore we will require that the proposal at a minimum include a meaningful number of zones that significantly address congestion on the system In this regard we also require that the proposal provide a comparison with a nodal energy price proposal ie locational marginal prices for each bus or node on the grid We also expect the ISO to conduct a periodic annual review to evaluate the accuracy of the zones for congestion management This seems to send a fairly strong signal that nodal pricing is the standard to be met Is your model as good as nodal Do you suppose the single price at each node is also subject to the soft and hard price cap Re transparency the impact on congestion pricing of the soft price cap does not seem have been considered At present the Usage Charge is the difference in zonal energy prices In the future it may not be Consider the following The soft cap is hit in both zones so the PX price is in both the NP and SP zones but the Usage Charge is set by a inc bid in the north and a dec bid in the south The PX is sending MW from south to north and must pay in congestion rents So there is a Usage Charge to go between zones with the same energy price Of course this is not limited to the PX The same situation would apply to the ISO in real time It looks like uplifts will be needed to collect the rents Where and how the rent is collected will become very important Preserving locational signals will be a challenge under these conditions Harry Singh of PGE National Energy Group also chimed in on the inference in the Order to the elimination of market separation in forward markets He said You could interpret this in more than one way For example you can interpret it as the end of balanced schedules and giving the ISO a new role in operating the dayahead energy market Id think thats more significant than imposing LMP and spells the end of the market structure we have in California You can also take a weaker interpretation and assume they are talking about market separation in congestion management Maybe this is the more likely explanation but they should probably have included it in the section on congestion reform Our resident environmentalist Dan Kirshner NoYes wrote to us that On the new ISO and PX Boards note that FERC says nothing about how those six new Board members will be replaced Nor do I see any reason for optimism that the EOB is out of the picture here Wont the state assert at least this authority You seem to ascribe more meaning than I do to the soft cap It cannot be an attempt to hold bids below The number is simply too low especially when youre trying to attract new capacity as all the rhetoric proclaims More likely its an attempt to be seen as doing something rather than nothing Like a parents lame all right but NEXT time You probably know how effective THAT is At first I thought as I may have mentioned that the pay as bid above approach was a clever response to the supposed game where a bidder with multiple plants would bid a few of them high in an effort to set the MCP and the rest low insuring that they wouldnt get shut out of high prices if their high bids didnt get selected The only odd part to me was that no one has yet claimed that this game is whats actually going on It reminds me of one of the audio messages my wife has attached to mouse events on her computer They are based on the old Frankenstein movies Opening a program causes Dr Frankenstein to exclaim Give my creation life Very appropriately applied to most computer work and now to FERCs work when you close a program the voice intones Youve accomplished nothing fool I tried to dissuade Dan from including in the Burrito the mouse event which I thought was hilarious He insisted stating that No This is a tying arrangement You have to use the mouse trigger stuff So I did Finally one reader who shall remain anonymous wrote Okay I definitely want the Market Power Exercise Bike havent been out very much lately and dont want to put on those dreaded holiday pounds between fruitcake and latkes But the price is somewhat foggy what if I buy it in state export it and then send it back in under a different name Ill also take one of the Singing the Blues by Loretta and Michael but I was hoping it included a song that should be so near and dear to our hearts Folsom Prison Blues but maybe thats on their best of album along with Achy Breaky Heart Anyway the ISO attire for sale is really last years fashion and you know I would not be caught dead in anything outdated But by the looks of the last Board meeting Im sure youll have plenty of takers You know I just need to be more careful with the distribution of these Burritos When I walked into the hearing room at FERC this week about a dozen people said hello and jumped right into a discussion about Burrito busters Keep in mind it was am my time Can we talk Another anonymous writer penned the following the FERC order makes it clear that FERC doesnt see California as big enough to be an RTO Installing an independent board is problematic given SB unless CalISO goes regional So what if Desert Star offered up its man board CalISO added Terry and a seventh independent director and the two finally consolidated The current ISO Board and the DS advisory committee could be trimmed and consolidated as the advisory group But wouldnt this be an opportune time The DS guys could be more assured of not being run over if their board is installed They havent created an infrastructure or software and CalISO needs to redo a bunch of stuff Could it be a winwin Nothing out here is winwin Its loselose Odds Ends Back in California after a long flight home Its raining My son is playing guitar in his room because today he doesnt have school For him it is a holiday I forgot What are holidays A number of you folks called me after the FERC Conference yesterday The item you most wanted to talk about was the dialogue between Steve Peace and Commissioner Hebert Hebert became quite upset with our Senator Hebert doesnt like being interrupted with comments such as The Governor wasnt including you in his comment when he said Youre a great group of people After the bantering went back and forth Hebert frustrated and feeling that the seriousness of the Commission was impugned by Peaces behavior threw up his arms and uttered Im not going to debate with you anymore Its a waste of time My panel was next on so when the California Delegation was dismissed I walked over to my spot on the panels table Peaceman was grabbing his suitcase and making a run for the exit I told him Ill mop this up for you man stick with me I mean what are friends for The Great Warrior was on my panel He was great as always When Dan Larcamp of the FERC staff asked a question comparing wholesale rates in California to UDC generation rates The Great One responded that if you take out the QF payments the frozenrate generation component for SCE was about kwh I shot back you have to include the QF payments Those are fixed capital costs in the SCE portfolio that SCE charges its retail customers The number for Edison is kWh And MWh is for all months since competition began in except the last four months higher than the wholesale prices have been The Great One didnt lose a moment and said on the record Gary is right It would be seven cents And that is what I love about this business You can sit with a group of people ususally men sip some coffee or some beer you tell each other lies That is how you become good friends Here is this weeks cookie Its

<17098831.1075843037686.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,foothill@lmi.net,2000-11-18 05:59:00,WPTF Sunday Wee the People BurritoFRIDAY BURRITO If you arent confused then you dont understand the problem At first I refused to deliver this Burrito until the next President is elected But I eventually gave up How much longer will this craziness go on The events are firmly stitched into the fabric of our culture now and for decades hence You cant go to a conference nor have a casual conversation with someone without the topic arising Columnist Dave Berry had the best solution to fix the Florida ballots Put a picture of each candidate on the ballot give the voter a handheld hole punch and punch out the eyes of the candidate for whom you wish to vote Naturally there would be squabbles about double punching holes that didnt penetrate the picture hence the intent to vote and all the other particulars which disqualify a ballot Speaking of elected officials Governor Davis redelivered his message to FERC this week live and in person in San Diego He spoke to three of the FERC Commissioners in San Diego Ms Breathitt being absent I wasnt there but I heard the reports of those who were The reactions ranged from so whats new to this is good news The Gov reiterated the request for refunds I dont think that is good news and I dont think the State has a legal prayer to order such One power marketer in the Pacific Northwest not a WPTF member but who soon will be called me to ask if he was going to lose his bonus because the State was going to order refunds from generators and power marketers If Mr Davis wants to settle nerves of the investment community then this isnt the way to do it The Gov also endorsed the implementation of loaddifferentiated price caps Read our lips Mr Gov Price caps dont work and loaddifferentiated price caps damage markets They throw unnecessary burdens on the settlement of transactions and would all but effectively kill longterm forward contracts Forward contracts seem to the be the preferred way to solve Californias problems assuming the PUC doesn t give blanket reasonableness to any and all contracts There must be appropriate mechanisms for the PUC to provide incentives for the UDCs to procure prudently and to avoid selfdealing with their nonregulated subsidiaries Clue license the utility owned plants to be Exempt Wholesale Generators under the Energy Policy Act of The Gov also claimed that he supports competitive markets but that the markets are dysfunctional at present and need time to mature and work out the severe demandsupply imbalance Mr Gov is taking quite a risk that the investment community will continue to invest while he tries to cap prices I dont think this is a wise bet but on the other hand it is his political future at risk not mine Once upon a time Mr Peace unsuccessfully tried to tame the power market hoping it would be an arrow in his political quiver He thought it would be both fun and expedient I my estimation the ploy exploded in his hands and sullied his reputation Mr Gov is headed in the same direction It will only take one small slip and then he will be trying eagerly to cleanse himself of the power dilemma I dont think Davis advisor on energy matters is at all up to the task of protecting his boss I wonder how you folks outside of California feel about this I mean California politics are definitely having an effect on your ability to transact business in the West I guess that is the way it goes Mr Davis doesnt need to solve Californias power problem to be reelect ed Governor He is a shoo in best I can tell and given the political leanings of the State He is staging himself as a presidential candidate As such he must appear to be fixing problems of a much larger scale and guess what shows up on his radar screen If the market survives the purge then the Gov and all the other politicians will take credit for saving the world I had the privilege of speaking at two seminars this week both hosted by New West Energy and one taped investigative interview at the local NBC station in San Francisco The speaking engagements gave me an opportunity to test sound bites on real humans and I am relaxing the definition of human a bit to include TV reporters I was pleased with the outcome The public speeches were in Oakland and Irvine respectively When I arrived at the hotel in Oakland Enron Energy Services also was having a customer seminar just down the hall I walked over to their room to see if I could get my speakers fee bid up from Guess who was in front of Enrons very packed room Sue Mara one of our Board members She like I in the adjoining room started our presentation lamenting the political stew in which our restructured power industry currently simmers Great minds think alike The fact that two ESPs were holding customer meetings simultaneously might signal a longawaited turn around in the business Have we reached the ebb of ESP existence I dont know Here are the themes that I believe struck a chord with the audiences and I hope with the investigative report First California started the restructuring process from a system of regulated costbased rates that was controlled by a few people the utilities the PUC and not very many others The fewpeople system responded to the Arab Oil Embargo crises in the early s by dumping tons of money into renewable energy and signing longterm QF deals that embedded oilprice escalators that assumed bbl a decade hence Add a nuclear unit into the portfolio and the sum of those brilliant decisions led to California retail rates being higher than the national average The response to higher prices led to a better idea That is marketbased rates that come from competition could be utilized to pay off the egregious excesses of the past and open up the system to all who both desired and could chart their own energy future It would either erase or significantly lessen the influence of the fewpeople system and replace that old system with a well populated manyagent paradigm eg ISO PX scheduling coordinators direct access customers merchant generators etc After almost three years of the manypeople competitive system where not too many people opted for direct access but we sure populated those stakeholder governing boards now didnt we the situation remains problematic Some would say the current dilemma is a signal that competition cant work that is until we have either more supply or more demand response or both and we would be better off if everyone had stable costbased rates just like the good ol days THEN I ask do you believe that giving back the power grid to the control of a few will solve todays problems or do you think a market based approach will more quickly resolve the supplydemand imbalance If you dont want to make choices about your energy future then give Mr Davis and the UDCs your support They will gladly turn back the hands of the clock If you want the freedom to make economic choices then speak out publicly regarding your support for continuing the competitive markets for power Using the latter approach lower prices will come about much quicker The problems we have are difficult but not impossible to fix Sermon is over Here is what is on this weeks agenda Things in the Peoples Republic of California WPTF Written response to the FERC Order of November ISO files GMC Unbundled Rates Data Subpoena for WPTF No Joke Some responses to last weeks Burrito questions Things in the Peoples Republic of California WPTF Written response to the FERC Order of November Everyone I talk to is preparing written comments to FERCs Order of November Or at least it seems that way Did you know that FERCs Order was immediate in that the time clock for notice started on November I dont understand why we are providing written comments to the Order unless amendments to the Order can be implemented without disturbing the initial time clock WPTF plans to file a substantive document It seems this venue is the appropriate one for laying out our version of the epic The Order you know never says that wholesale power rates are unjust and unreasonable It says that the markets rules that led to high prices are unjust and unreasonable It sounds a little like reading between the lines so it would be helpful if FERC clarifies someday exactly what it meant We will also highlight the fact that FERC should encourage California to pursue competition for UDC procurement of forward energy The markets need price transparency Regulators and market participants should know the prices within a reasonable time after bilateral contracts are signed Third if FERC is going to understand the story of why prices rose dramatically in California then the generation component of the UDCs frozen rates needs to be compared to the monthly wholesale power rates since competition began We calculated and reported such to FERC in our October reply to the PGE and SCE emergency petitions In all but the last five months the UDC generation component average of kWh was higher than the monthly wholesale power rates How is this a dysfunctional market if it has worked so well prior to May of this year And isnt it still working well given the cost factors are continuing to escalate such as natural gas price and Nox emission credits And from where did approximately onehalf of the stranded cost get collected if not from the headroom between wholesale power prices and the UDC fixed generation component Fourth there is absolutely no room for a compromise solution on governance of the ISO and the PX The CPUC should have no authority over Californias wholesale power markets The stakeholder boards must disband and be replaced per FERCs recommended method Further the CEOs of each institution respectively and without the approval of the stakeholder boards should write the job descriptions for the consultants who will be retained to create the slate of suitable candidates Unless FERC rids the ISO of pestering State influence we are never going to have wellfunctioning wholesale markets in California or the West Consumers are affected by wholesale prices in power as in all commodities and consumables However that doesnt mean consumers representatives vis a vis the State have jurisdiction over the regulation of the markets that govern the rules for those markets It is impossible for any California consumer to request of the ISO any of the ISOs services Consumers must make those requests through certified FERCregulated agents called Scheduling Coordinators FERC should take note that singlestate RTOs are an anathema to FERCs policy interes ts and the promotion of competitive markets as directed in FERCs Orders and Fifth the proposed soft price cap is an inferior solution compared to mandating prescheduling of load and supply in forward markets Caps distort markets and discourage both new supply and demand responses Forward agreements can settle jittery nerves by locking in firm prices during volatile price periods The remaining volume left to spotmarket purchase would be less damaging to consumers even if prices reach extremely high levels The weighted average price of forward and spot purchases would be easily more digestible to the public relative to gobbling down the spot price every day Both the PX block forward and overthecounter markets amply provide evidence to that effect With sufficient forward contracting no price caps are necessary If there is a price cap as proposed by FERC then FERC should reduce the time under which the bids over or whatever the cap happens to be are subject to refund Sixth robust retail competition is the key to solving the States woes The State should separate the default customer provision by the UDCs and FERC should encourage the State to take that step Mr Hoecker asked at the San Diego hearing for parties to comment on how more ESPs could enter the California market Consumers want rate stability of that there is little argument It boils down to the choice of either saddling the UDCs with the procurement responsibility or putting large vs small core vs noncore consumers in charge of their own energy procurement Today the TRA balances of the UDCs are bursting with liabilities because the UDCs are unable to raise their rates to collect the different between the frozen generation component and the wholesale rate The State regulatory system will never move quick enough to balance these procurement accounts within a reasonable time As a result we have the UDCs playing the begging game for rate relief It would make far more sense to reduce or eliminate the UDCs responsibility to be the default provider Things in the Peoples Republic of California ISO files GMC Unbundled Rates If you have nothing better to do this holiday weekend then you may want to pick up a copy of the ISOs Grid Management Charge filing to the FERC dated November It is five inches thick in two separate volumes Although thick the filing does not include the budget numbers for Year I have heard and read in independent reports that the GMC budget will escalate or so to cover the ISOs operating costs Is it true the ISO ties the escalation of the GMC to the earnings of the UDCs I just wonder how that mechanism works Hence the unbundling of the GMC into cost components is the essence of the filing The ISO develops billing determinants for ISO services into three buckets controlarea and scheduling interzonal scheduling and market operations billing and settlements The reason WPTF will intervene in this matter is that also at stake is the refund we have sought for the different GMC rates applied at the start of the market for some of the public power and municipal loads in PGEs service territory Our petition on this issue dates back almost two years and the refunds may reach back almost as long So I thought it would be a good idea to alert you to the fact that three big things are coming down the road One the ISO has filed for an unbundled GMC rate that is split into three buckets of costs Two WPTF will be seeking to collect the refund for the difference in GMC application to different types of load And three very soon most likely in December the ISO will file its budget estimates for and I expect you all to go berserk when you see that Just a little preparation thats all Things in the Peoples Republic of California Data Subpoena for WPTF No Joke Last week I received a telephone call from the local branch of the State Attorneys General office in San Francisco Apparently WPTF is among the special groups in the State who have received a data subpoena Some of you have suggested that this is a direct result of my meeting last

General office would ask me what I was thinking on any given day I cant wait for them to see copies of the Burritos That will tie them up for a good long time I find the data subpoena both offensive and a badge of honor Why should we be left out when all of you folks have had to put up with the same I play the martyr well It is a sad state of affairs and I guess the best thing for us to do is answer all the questions to the best of our ability On the other hand it will cost us more than a handful of dollars to prepare the data Phew What an odor Things in the Peoples Republic of California Some responses to last weeks Burrito questions Last week I wrote about the likelihood of a ballot initiative in California to eliminate competition in the electric industry I mentioned that Environmentalists will be stuck between a rock and a hard place They want conservation and demand management which you dont get without market prices Environmentalists may be iffy Our resident environmentalist Dan DKNY Kirshner gave us his opinion on the matter Iffy is the right word Some of us consider the late searly s the good old days when there were significant utility energy efficiency programs absent one may note market prices And we are reluctant to fight the tide whether the tide is going with or against a market But I think reality dictates that the grander schemes reregulation new state energy utilities etc are unlikely at best and that markets can help us imagine that charging customers the marginal cost of resource use This is all of course a topic of active discussion Think default provider I think this is the most productive area to work on there may be room for agreement across a wide range of parties Odds Ends Blessed events are all over the place First our congratulations to Rob Lamkin Chair of WPTF as well as VP at Southern Energy Rob is the proud father of a new baby girl Jessa Nicole who was born last Monday Everyone in the family is doing well we are happy to report The WPTF family is growing too At last weeks Board meeting Constellation Power Source became our th Board member Constellation is a subsidiary of Baltimore Gas Electric and headquartered in the same location Their California based office is in Newport Beach and headed by Nam Nguyen Manager of Strategic Planning We are very pleased to have the Constellation people on our Board A new general member is also in our rank Los Angeles Department of Water and Power LADWP No doubt their membership will limit some of my more colorful editorials but we are pleased to have LADWP with us It reinforces the fact that we are a broadbased membership with many different points of view And while we are speaking of births new members and things family let me share with you a story about mine I took my parents to lunch after I was done speaking in Irvine last week Each time I play the goodson role I reflect very early on during the experience that I should have known better My parents are retired living a great life spending my inheritance travelling around the globe and doing what retired people should be doing The early bird special is a big part of their life After my presentation in Irvine I called the rents in Laguna Hills at pm and asked Do you want me to take you to lunch I should have known better Well my Mom answered we were just sitting down to lunch Nothing special Really it was only some left over bread I wouldnt give it to a stranger but we can put it away and have lunch with you When are you coming I said Ill be there in fifteen minutes When I arrive at their Leisure World retirementvillage condo their residence since moving from Cleveland years ago a dialogue ensues that my brain has suppressed I should know better There is a secret part of ones memory reserved for conversations with ones parents All the dizzying and confusing parts of talking with ones parents are conveniently stored in that secret part of the brain and you are reminded of these conversations only after it is too late Where do you want to go she asks knowing that my Father will defer to her judgement the secret of a year marriage I suggest Mimis Cafe a local chain eatery with reasonably good food What are you going to order I say I dont know but I remember I once had lamb shanks at Mimis I state without pretense that Ill order lamb shanks Oh you cant get lamb shanks at Mimis You have to go to the Greek restaur ant for lamb shanks Or you know who else has lamb shanks is Ten minutes later I have explained at least three times that I really dont need to have lamb shanks We can go anywhere they want Well go to Mimis even if I cant order lamb shanks At this point in the conversation if you were to put a heat recovery system and a glass of water on my head then you could generate enough waste heat to spin a handheld steam turbine We drive into the parking lot at the local strip mall where Mimis is located Now we start Act II We have to drive all over the parking lot looking for a space that is located not more than twelve seconds by foot from the door of the restaurant Why I dont know because both of my parents are in good health I think the reason is they like to argue and parking space selection is an Olympic event for the retired Park over there says my Mother to which my Father says who would want to park there We can get closer he insists Why would you want to park closer asks my Mother This is close enough she insists Not wanting to take a side thats a laugh I keep driving around the parking lot I glimpse a parking spot within the goldenager perimeter and nab it See says my Father We would have had to walk all that way This spot isnt much closer my Mom warns him Now Im synche d to the grid and selling spinning reserve We are seated in the restaurant and my Mother recalls each and every time they have eaten at Mimis over the last ten years who was with them and what each person ordered Your Mother never forgets a meal says my Dad a line that I have heard over million times since I was a kid The debate rages about what to order and will it be too much food I know with certainty that whatever they order it will be too much food I havent been with them once when they didnt ask for th e boxes or Styrofoam containers to bring home the excess the booty the loot and the leftovers These are the meals that will last a Depressionera couple at least a week Sure enough they ask for the instruments of portage Everything goes in The hot sauce for the quesadillas the bread rolls and dont forget the butter pats for the bread I numbly ask Dont you have butter at home No says my Mom we have margarine With after dinner mints in mouth and the excess inventory in youknowwhos purse we head back to the car Next time you come to visit we can have lamb shanks at the ItalianGreek restaurant says my Dad No my Mom reminds him that place is out of business Well have to go into LA to get lamb shanks Now Im receiving EMS signals every seconds from the grid Come to think of it I really dont like lamb shanks all that much I should have known better Maybe if I write this down Ill be reminded for future reference On the other hand the lack of memory is mightier than the pen DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD This weeks cookie comes from Paul Gribik A little humor to usher in the holiday season These are the nominees for the Chevy Nova

back Were live Were living Actually we are still in limbo land As of yet no prez elect The week was typical by California standards The utilities filed their plans to raise rates over the next fi ve years the consumer advocates held a press conference to kick off their hol y war against electric restructuring a class action suit was filed for billion against the generators and the utilities gas prices hovered betwee n and mmcf on day trading the Secretary of Energy spat on FERC regarding the remedies proposed to fix the alleged dysfunctional California market and the Governor announced his options for curing what ails us I think that pretty well covers it It was just another week in paradise I was on KRON TV last week for a couple of second sound bites Chomp chomp That is what was distilled from fifty minutes of taping It was a learning experience for me more so than it was for the general viewing public The station did an investigative report on Californias restructur ed power industry and the slant was fairly predictable although it could hav e been far worse Two moms on my sons hockey team told me they saw the clip s on TV and I used these ladies as my unbiased sample to gather some opinions There are about twenty families on my sons team so that means using testimonial math that about ten percent of the Bay Area watched the news piece One mom said she saw me really didnt listen to what the news was covering but that she recognized me Im sure that her experience les s the recognition applies easily to half or more of the viewing public The second mom who I have known for many years asked me So who is doing th e gouging This from a person who is well educated very involved with the community and is part of a routine family he says of husband wife thre e kids and a dog Alas I realized the battle for Californias power market will not rest no r be resolved in chaotic meetings at the ISO or AB working groups The w ar will be won or lost based on public opinion Will Californians support the continuation of electric restructuring I dont know if they will but I a m not at all surprised that the vast majority of people do not understand the issues As an industry we have a long long way to go in educating the public And I have tremendous doubt that we are going to cough up the necessary money to publicly demonstrate a positive image on power restructuring Nancy Day wrote me last week You and your associates must prove to the policymakers and the public that in the long run competitive markets are always better than command and control regulation How do you do that You hire a PR firm and you get them to help you s hape your messages to a variety of audiences Shape a message I know that some of you folks think you are doing that now I disagree Individually or collectively we have not made even a sma ll dent in the public image for our cause There is some name recognition to be sure The paid TV ads for Enron and Southern have made those company names more familiar Green Mountain Energy has done a good job of getting its name out too But that is hardly the point As an industry of privat e interests we are kaput on the PR side Imagine this Imagine Joe Montana fourtime Superbowl wining quarterback for the San Francisco ers standing next to the Lombardi Trophy talking into the camera He smiles and says Hi Im Joe Montana I believe in competition A few side clips some simple explanations how competition i s going to more quickly bring prices into line with expectations and back to Joe We can also do some follow on ads with Jerry Rice and Jim Plunket twotime Superbowl QB for the Oakland Raiders thereby making a connectio n with different factions of Californias ethnic and racial makeup That is what I call PR Touching the soul of the public with simple messages from credible wellknown likeable people Id be interested in hearing your thoughts Here is what is on this weeks leftover turkey menu Things in the Peoples Republic of California Oh when the comments come marching in ISO Super Peak Market books first transaction Consumers Rattle the Saber for a Ballot Initiative All Injured Parties form a line to

FERC comments coming to my address weighing four or five pounds per delivery Hes a mailman not a pediatrician He is leaving small hints o f his displeasure such as dropping my mail in the middle of the driveway or delivering the goodies to my neighbors house Most of the copies received I confess go into the trash bin without a second thought I dont even bre ak the gummy seal on most I check the senders name and decide if the fortu ne inside the envelope might be worth a read I always open the envelopes fro m the CPUC the Electric Oversight Board and Steptoe Johnson SCEs counse l for really important filings These filings are the most entertaining of the lot The holiday weekend gave me some time to read a selection of comments submitted to FERC regarding the Commissions November Order I dont know whether I should laugh or cry at some of these pleadings The comments I read from some of my favorite sectors of Californias power industry are so childish that I wonder if it is a joke Or is the joke on us Take for example the CPUCs comments The first pages are more or less what you would expect refund our money change this hearing from a paper hearing to a fullblown evidentiary hearing request a rehearing the CPUC should get copies of everything the MSC and DMA publish at the same ti me FERC gets them FERC got the soft pricecap issues and just about everythin g else wrong the State has jurisdiction etc The CPUC claims that there is insufficient evidence to support the FERCs conclusions Since the CPUC als o lacks sufficient evidence because the generators and power marketers will not comply with the CPUCs data requests then well what the heck we ne ed a lengthy hearing with evidence and crossexamination of witnesses This line of reasoning sounds very much like the Florida vote recount litigation but I dont want to go there Here is the real kicker If you go to page of the CPUCs comments ther e is the signature block of the CPUC attorneys dated November The next page begins with the Separate Statement of Commissioners Duque Neeper an d Bilas I did a double take on the title not understanding at first tha t the first pages were never adopted by the CPUC by vote Our politically hypercorrect couple Ms Lynch and Mr Wood forced it in What do the three Republican Commissioners say We find much to support i n FERCs Market Order and are filing this statement to insure that FERC has access to our full thinking concerning the technical aspects of the wholesa le market which are not the principal focus of the Commissions filing I remain astounded that in essence the CPUC has two replies One that lambastes the FERC Order and another that encourages the Order with some modifications For example the evil part of the CPUC commentary shakes a finger at FERC for ordering elimination of the requirement for the UDCs to buy all power through the PX That says the attorneys is a violation of jurisdiction and you federal people should stay off of our lawn The trio of Duque Neeper and Bilas DNB say While the state maintains jurisdiction we are willing to cede to FERC temporary jurisdiction over th is matter Which of the two responses sounds more cooperative to you I wonder he asks why the CPUC comments never came to a vote Sounds to me like the CPUC comments a la DNB would have passed quite nicely thank you But those days are long gone The CPUC expert witness testimony appended to the CPUC comments includes th e direct testimony of Michael Scheible a supervisor of the California Air Resources Board staff responsible for energy issues including electricity This is a person who was part of the development of the RECLAIM program of tradable emission credits utilized in the South Coast Air Quality Managemen t District SCAQMD Here is what Mr Scheible testifies The average pric e paid for a NOx RTC went from a pound in January to in June to in October What is he talking about He took the yeartodate expenditures on NOx credits and divided the total by the number of traded RECLAIM Trading Credits RTC He used the average value not the marginal or incremental price NOx credits are today trading in the to per pound range But he doesnt stop there He takes another leap at the impact of the RTC prices on electricity prices RECLAIM affects only thermal power generating units in the SCAQMD These units account for about percent o f the power generating capacity in the State Thus the market price of RT Cs was a factor for only a relatively small percentage of the States generati on capacity in Markets What are markets This is the basis upon whic h the State hopes to persuade FERC that the markets are not working because o ne cost factor only affects of the States capacity Okay it is your turn Do you want to laugh or cry I reviewed one of the UDC proposals PGE PGEs comments included three expert witness affidavits that in total were about one inch thick PGE as ks the FERC to replace the MWh soft cap with a costbased load differentiated cap pay as bid for bids accepted over the load differentiat ed cap force instate generators to bid into the California PX before seeking to participate in other markets penalize both load and generation if eithe r does not sufficiently participate in forward markets and return to costofservice ratemaking in California for an interim period In their proposed relief for electricity prices realized after October PGE requests a waiver of the payment provisions of the ISO and PX Tariffs requests that the utility only be required to pay based on levels and that after refund claims are adjudicated PGE will pay the extra amounts that may be ordered Shakespeare couldnt have said it any better To sleep To sleep perchan ce to dream Things in the Peoples Republic of California ISO Super Peak Market books first transaction Ziad Alaywan of the ISO talked with me today during my attendance at the IS O Governing Board meeting He had a sad face as he told me We made our fir st transaction using the Super Peak Market instead of issuing an outofmarket OOM order It was for MW Grand says I Why the long face He w as disheartened because the accepted bid was higher than the price cap of I said to my man Ziad that bids either above or below the price cap are not a reason to be upset What do you want the bidders to do I asked He confessed that it troubles him when all the offers are above the cap but nevertheless he is going to maintain the request for bids every day for th e remainder of December In case you havent seen the form of the ISO request for bids it is dispatched via email and looks like this For operating day XXXXXX the CAISO will be participating in its Seasonal Super Peak Day of Market via the Automated Power Exchange APX This Market will close at Purchase may be made during this time for the peak hours of through It is the intent of the CAISO to reduc e the amount of OutOfMarket purchase for XXXXXX through this Seasona l Super Peak Day of Market I encourage marketers and generators to look closely at this market in whic h to post offers The Super Peak Market is the best hope we have to bring order to the otherwise somewhat chaotic method by which the ISO operators g o hunting for outofmarket energy I told Ziad that the more the ISO access es the Super Peak Market the more offers he is likely to see and the more competition there will be to bring prices down Markets do not develop overnight I dont think offers below the cap are either unlikely or illogical Anyone disagree Things in the Peoples Republic of California Consumers Rattle the Saber for a Ballot Initiative I told you it was going to occur Harvey Rosenfield President of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights FTCR a consumer watchdog group held a press conference last Tuesday to announce the kick off of a campaign to influence the Governor and the State Legislature to enact measures that will reverse the progress of electric competition or face o n the November ballot no butterflies an initiative to achieve the same He tried this tactic two years ago when he launched Proposition It failed but the instate utilities spent million in advertising to educate the public regarding the ills of oldtime religion The alleged purpose of the proposalballot initiative it to protect California consumers and small businesses against higher electricity bills Rosenfield submitted a concept draft of their proposal to the Governor and Legislature that you can review on the web site utilitiesprprphp FTCRs Key Points of Reform requires refunds to San Diego customers of excessive electricity charges through a windfall profits tax on profiteering power generators requires oversight of electricity rates by the Public Utilities Commission PUC institutes an integrated resource planning process to address future energy needs creates a state power authority to ensure the fulfillment Californias ener gy needs promote conservation and construct and operate power plants transmission and distribution facilities facilitates the authority of local and state government to exercise the pow er of eminent domain if necessary and creates strong accountability mechanisms for state agencies The advocates expressed doubt concerning whether state officials were willi ng to defy the powerful energy lobbies And they warned elected officials against another bailout of the utility companies at the expense of taxpayer s and consumers If there is any part of the proposal I like then it is the organization asked the Governor and legislators to refuse any campaign contributions fro m utility or power companies during the consideration of legislative proposals According to Rosenfield history shows that whenever elec ted officials must choose between the interests of the private utilitypower companies and protecting the public interest they will choose to protect t he utility and energy companies That is how we got into this mess Whether th e public officials currently in office are willing to do so especially in the midst of a ratepayer revolt remains an open question You know windfall profit tax aside the more I read the proposal the more I am intrigued The proposal boxes in the utilities and you can easily expe ct that the utilities will come slugging back in two directions simultaneously First the utilities will slug back with the bankruptcy argument if they are stuck with the undercollection risk Second the utilities will step up their accusations against the generators for gouging The opportunities for schizophrenic behavior will be legion because the utilities are less and less the largest sources of earnings for their corporate holding companies Stay tuned It promises to be interesting Things in the Peoples Republic of California All Injured Parties form a line to the left In the Chinese calendar it is the Year of the Lawyer When I first heard about the billion class action suit against the generators and utilities in California I wanted to make a public statement to express my outrage However I was too busy handing out free cigarette samples to school age children Between endless squabbles over presidential vote counting and pot shots at the restructured electric system in California it always seems the lawyers come out ahead You know what I am saying Our litigation bills for WPTF in October almost hit a new monthly high So what is this class action suit all about You can read the suit as fil ed on the web site of the filing attorneys at relianthtm However here is a summary In the Superior court of the State of California for the county of San Diego a suit has been filed on behalf of Pamela R Gordon in a class acti on complaint for violations of California business and professions code and antitrust and unfair business practices The defendants are Reliant Energ y Inc Southern Company NRG Energy Dynegy Inc AES Corporation Williams Energy Duke

Act Bas ed Upon Defendants Unfair Business Acts and Practices FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION Violations of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION Unconscionability It is that fifth cause of action that has me wondering Were we not conscious during this whole episode with the possible exception of SDGE when they didnt hedge their summer energy procurement This is what the suit claims That Defendants charged rates for wholesale electricity that were unconscionable given their cost of production the newly emergent markets for that product and the consumers need for electrical power Defendants rates were inherently excessive invalid and unconscionable particularly in light of the deceptive and manipulative practices they used to inflate the market prices and the vital need consumers and businesses ha ve for electrical power Defendants unconscionable prices were passed through to Plaintiff and the majority of the Class in the retail electricity rates charged by SDGE and thereby directly damaged Plaintiff and the Class Things in the Peoples Republic of California The Governors Plan Well we have had quite a week havent we Top it off with this Today Governor Davis of California will float his proposals for fixing the California electricity market It is reassuring to know that so many peopl e are rushing in to fix our problems Here is what Jason Leopold of the Dow Jones Newswire reported about the Gov s draft plan It will include options to Develop a state power authority to build power plants and own and operate transmission systems Eliminate the California Independent System Operator Extend the freeze on retail electricity rates Require utilities to retain existing generation and to build new power plan ts Consider reasserting state authority over the operation maintenance and safety practices of all instate generating facilities for public health an d safety purposes Authorize utilities to purchase the majority of their power in forward mark ets

the proposals next week assuming we survive that long Odds Ends Jim Kritikson sent me an email that has different thoughtprovoking sayings such as the byline header at the top of todays Burrito The one I selected is among my favorites Every week I will rotate a new byline fro m the list Jim provided me thereby lengthening the pure joy these morsels bring rather than blowing the whole wad in one Burrito Speaking of learning new things I mentioned in the introduction that my experience being interviewed on TV gave me a world of insight into the phrases and words that get through the media filter I am becoming a stude nt of the sound bite as any reader of these Burritos will attest I am compiling a list of key words that either work or dont work when talking with the media or the press For example if you are talking to a reporter and you say The dayahead ancillary service markets are too illiquid and the price is highly variable then you will not only strike out with the media people but you will go to the back of the soundbite class On the other hand if you say something like Of course they are gouging then I can assure you they will take your bite to print or video I have developed a simple chart of words and phrases either to embrace or to avoid when addressing members of the press the public or when mingling wi th people at holiday cocktail parties with whom your spouse works but you can t stand There are Inwords they are good and Outwords to be avoided lik e the plague Feel free to add to the list as you learn new terms Inwords generator manipulate gouging market power demand response consumer rights undercollection excess profits abuse utilities competition withholding Outwords default provider markets high price ancillary services penny loafers Eric scarcity interruptible customer stakeholder outages investments Burrito Now here is how you utilize the system I have invented You pick three numbers randomly Lets take todays hourly electric price say MWH So the numbers are and You can select any three numbers it real ly doesnt matter So for example if you want to create a quotable quote then you take the words Manipulate Market Power and Abuse an d put them in a sentence eg The abuse of market power is an attempt to manipulate price See how easy that was The press will eat it up Try it the Outwordily way Using the same three numbers select the words Markets Ancillary Service and Stakeholder You might get T he Ancillary Service markets are designed by stakeholders Dry as bone and essentially useless Suitable for ISO Governing Board public comment but youll never be a press maven Keep a copy of these words in your wallet o r purse It could save your life or the life of an innocent consumer see I did it again As the political rhetoric heats up we being soldiers of fortune must be prepared at any moment to whip out the handy quote sheet necessary to calm the jittery nerves of the masses lest there be a ratepay er revolt As

I have been unhappy with the public image our industry portrays I feel there needs to be a stronger more effective group public relations media blitz that has yet to materialize I asked one journalist with whom I have had several interviews When you write a column who is your audience S he said she writes as if she was explaining the matter to her mother Its an old journalists trick Amazed at the answer I decided to call my mother and ask her what she thought about the whole electric situation After all she qualifies as a typical fixedincome California resident living in a retirement community i n Laguna Hills Mom I asked what do you make of the whole situation Oh I am disgusted she chirped with that Supreme Court ruling Thats no democracy No not that situation Mom I said to calm her down bu t the electricity restructuring thing Well she sighed everyone is worried about their electric bills How much are they going up And why havent you called me more often I could have died and my children would be the last to know Every tag line has a message So there it is If you want a simple view that people understand then the re it is People are worried about their electric bill The reasons for the increase are of less concern than how much their bills may go up All the blather about forward contracts alleged gouging Stage emergencies governance jurisdiction and FERC Orders is not on the minds of ordinary California citizens They want to know how much more they are going to hav e to pay And they are worried Focus then on how we as an industry will help We want to hold down consumer electric bills in three different ways by adding new generation by giving people more choice as to their energy provider and by assuring ther e is always a provider of last resort to keep the

protector Someone is watching out for your interests and concerns His name amigos is Senator Steve Peace Our Herr Peace wrote to FERC Commissioner Hoecker on December a letter that is suitable for plastic covered place mats at your dining table You can guess why He heard abou t the MWH prices quoted for MidC on Monday He wrote Today the LA Time reported that Kaiser Aluminum Corp the secondlarge st US aluminum maker said it will shut its smelter in Mead Wash for about months and lay off about employees Kaiser said it had resold the electricity it was to received this month from the BPA netting proceeds of million or nearly nine times the million that the company has earned so far this year I read this passage to the WPTF Board at our meeting in Phoenix Kent Wheatland said Thats the finest example of demand response I have ever heard Indeed Kent hit the nail on the head Why is the Peacemeister decrying the very thing that we have been begging for The socalled inelastic demand curve for electricity just got less steep But never min d that read the next paragraph of Peaces letter It is clear that neither the prospect of postOctober refunds ordered under Section will be adequate to discipline marketers behavior Marketers know full well that FERC simply doesnt have the resources to police this wholesale market and that the odds are that they can act with impunity Moreover they know they have a fellow traveler in your colleagu e Commissioner Hebert who sees the prospect of the lights going out in California as a vindication of his positions on price caps rather

AB Restructuring Map showing by colo r code the jurisdictional boundaries of the different regulatory agencies Yellow is reserved for the State of California and it covers the entire lower the Province of British Columbia and Cleveland Ohio Things in the Peoples Republic of California SCEs Bryson Rattles the Restructuring Cage Not to be outdone by Herr Peace SCE Sufferin Chutzpah Edison issued a press release by its CEO John Bryson calling for dramatic reform of the California electricity market I know this will shock you but now that S CE has recovered most but not all of its stranded costs they want to revers e the engine of progress and reregulate Californias electric system Guess how By allowing utilities to once again be charged with the responsibility to plan for acquire and assure sufficient power to meet the states needs without the threat of interruption By charging costbased rates By protecting customers Hallelujah Lets talk about a few things here First lets discuss the credit issue that is plaguing the Pacific Northwest power producers who are increasingly unwilling to sell supplemental energy into California The last I checked most PNW producers paid their counterparties on a day basis but receive the cash from ISO about days after the trade day The PNW producers mu st cover their owed position by borrowing funds and at the prices posted in the last two weeks the credit limit has been reached Where is the securi ty for the payment It lies not with the ISO but with the utilities who are the major customers Therefore if the utilities undercollect because froz en rates are below wholesale prices then the utilities accumulate a debt If the debt continues unabated then the credit rating companies downgrade the UDC ratings That has occurred several times in the last few months If t he utilities claim bankruptcy or refuse to pay the PX then the PX cant pay the ISO the ISO cant pay the sellers and the PNW sellers are kaput This is my longwinded way of saying that two entities still hold all the cards at least for now in the region SCE and metoo PGE They have th e leverage to bring the whole system to its knees Hark recall that WPTF ha s continually called for a breakup of the UDCs default customer base for thi s very reason We argued that two dominant buyers could extract monopsony rents from sellers And here it is big time What does Bryson have to lose by rattling the cage Nothing In fact it is so delicious to watch for the umpteenth time SCE exercise brute force whe n they have an advantage You must respect that The golden rule aptly applies Those who have the gold make the rules Another aspect of Brysons gambit is that he is playing a trump card on his buddy the Governor who as of last week through the PUC suspended the requests of Edison and PGE for rate increases starting next January Davi s has painted himself into a corner and is no match for the cunning of the Sufferin Chutzpah gang I predicted that Davis would stumble and fall on electricity matters I didnt expect it to happen so soon Do you think the public will buy Brysons argument To tell you the truth Im not sure Things in the Peoples Republic of California Rate Relief Reviewed Again Well in a complete reversal the CPUC put back on the docket list the rate stabilization plans for PGE and Edison Last week President Lynch suspended both companies applications denying them the right to raise rat es subject to refund Now this week Lynch allowed for the rate stabilizatio n applications to be reopened and duly considered Next Tuesday I will be on the local San Francisco station KQED FM t o debate the merits of electric competition with the likes of Lynch and TURN s Netie Hogue I did this last September on the same onehour callin show that begins at am I didnt know it was a callin show until the calle rs started firing crazy questions at the panelists If you are in the area then listen in and better yet call in Ask Ms Lynch a few questions wi ll you I listened to a taped interview Ms Lynch did on another local station KCB S that aired last Sunday Here are some of her more memorable quotes There is plenty of power in California There is no shortage It is ju st not being managed properly on a day to day basis There are power plants th at should be available right now but are not running The State of California has MW of power available at any hour Plant unavailability is an artificial issue There is plenty of power i f they power plants run The PUC is trying to figure out what is wrong The plant owners only give the ISO oneword explanations such as boiler or fire We are sending our inspection team in to better understand the problems I wont speculate as to price manipulation but last summer we saw very suspicious bids and offers More power plants have been approved during the first two years of the Dav is administration than in all the years of the Wilson administration This week the State stepped in to save the system by turning off lights an d computers The ISO is governed by a board made up of individuals from the utilities a nd the power sellers There is one consumer representative and one environmental representative The San Diego economy couldnt stand the price volatility of last summer The former Governor Pete Wilson administration created the wholesale pow er market The market design of the PX is counterintuitive It takes the highest pri ce bid and pays it to everyone So if you offer MWH for a MW and another person offers for a MW then both parties get Things FERC and Federal Secretary Richardson Serves Smashed Salmon Pate Mr Richardson is the US Secretary of Energy Most people dont know him nor have ever heard of him Last Wednesday with only four weeks left in h is job he decided to take a bold step He did something Richardson invoked a rarely used authority in the Federal Power Act to require outofstate generators and marketers to sell into California upon demand The Section of the statute cited had not been invoked since World War II If it was good enough then then it is good enough now Richardson also ordered BPA and WAPA to ship as much power to California as possible In a way the Order worked Because of credit issues outofstate parties have been loath to violate their credit policies just to sell to California Hence the imports into California became scarce and the ISO was teetering on another Stage Alert yesterday morning Because of the Order BPA started drafting from its hydro reserves somewhere in the neighborhood of MW and PowerEx delivered another MW From where did this power emanate Clearly in the case of BPA they are selling to California at the risk of being unable to meet their own requirements later this year and next No rain and cold weather could put BPA in a world of hurt Further the increased hydro spill may effect salmon I sent by email to Mr Richardson that included some wonderful recipes for the damaged salmon I mean what do you do with tons of smashed salmon that you would otherwise love to eat Pates souffls patties chilled ground winter run smashed spring run primavera roasted mashed fall run You na me it We can whip up a mess of smashed salmon for just about any occasion And the added benefit is that California gets to continue the holiday seas on festively with lights on without interruption I was reminded of a letter written to the Burrito last year It was a phon y announcement that in retrospect wasnt far off Do you remember it Exclusive Christmas Lights Cause Crisis Due to increased evening ramps caused by heavy Christmas light loads the California Independent System Operator ISO will begin running a series of Public Service Announcements PSAs this week designed to lessen electricit y reliability concerns Because homeowners tend to turn their Christmas lights on at dusk there is a surge of electricity demand that can create havoc on the balancing act between generators and users of power The ads will request that homes with odd numbered addresses turn on their Holiday lights between pm and even numbered homes between pm According to Kellan Flukiger ISO Vice President of Operations the rationi ng is required to avert an electricity crisis Were seeing extreme ramps tha t are causing demands on the grid well use this voluntary process for now t o try and manage the problem The Author has learned however that the ISO intends to turn to a more direct approach to control the problem after December th Tariff Amendme nt g a little known document that to date has been internal to the California ISO could have a major impact on the Holiday plans of Californians The memo calls for some combination of a twopronged attack to keep Californians from all turning on their Christmas lights at the same ti me The biggest question outside of the deliveries of BPA and PowerEx is what price is being paid for the power ordered by the California ISO The Order states that power will be sold to the ISO at a level that would ensure generators receive a fair return Whats that I know that some of the Northwest power producers are sleeving their sales through creditworthy third parties But other than that I am not sure of the details Things FERC and Federal WPTF Supports PX Emergency Filing The Power Exchange filed an emergency motion on Monday to keep alive its energy markets in light of the emergency changes made by the ISO the previo us Friday The PX requested an emergency order from FERC removing the hard cap on Adjustment Bids and replacing it with an energy price equivalent th at allows forward buyers and sellers to transact ahead of the ISO realtime market Currently the ISO hard caps the Adjustment Bids at MWH whic h becomes the zonal price if congestion is present The mix of hard and soft caps pushes more people into the realtime market and wipes out much of th e supply that would otherwise show up in the forward markets The WPTF Board filed comments with FERC on Wednesday supporting the PXs motion The ISO filed against the PX motion and the ISO offered a plan of their own Copies of our filing can be found along with all our other FER C and PUC filings on our web page If you dont have a password for our website wptforg then email and request such She will be glad to assist you Mailbag I received so many great emails that

the importance of PR was Tom Allen VP of External Affairs at Southern Energy Tom wrote Gary I am new to this issue as an employee i n External Affairs Southern Energy West Region I am in transition to

consumer pain that was felt in San Diego this past summer Consumers elect the Gov et al and thei r pulse will dictate final direction in the political arena While we all prepare for the legislative and regulatory battles lets not forget that t he idea here was to provide consumer value over time I think a blanket attack on consumer messaging is very possible The ke y will be how coalitions formal or informal decide to come together to fund such an initiative Being a transplant to the issue and somewhat of an outsider here are some messages that must articulated clearly with some sort of definitive documentation beyond our opinion meaning we need to pay for it somewhere The value of competition to the consumer Why go forward Whats i n it for me The true effects cost negative value for going back to costbased approach Lets live in lifelong subsidy The issue is bigger than energy The investment world is watching I s California a good place for business to do business I agree with the PR blitz I think there needs to be backup when challenged What California institution could provide such in a very short time frame Thank you Tom for sharing your thoughts and welcome to the club

Oer many a quaint and curious promise of political lore While we nodded nearly napping suddenly there came a yapping As of some votes overlapping energyzapping to the core Tis a mess here we all

Christmas when all through the courts All the plaintiffs made stirring bad ballot reports Which leaves the problem Perhaps the best way to stop complaints raucous Is to start over again with the Iowa caucuses Odds and Ends The Toughest Interview Ever The nights I drive my son to hockey practice especially in winter are silent Its dark the weather is cold and we each drift into our own thoughts He listens to the rock station of his choice on the way to practice I get my choice of station usually jazz or classical on the w ay home We both have agreed to set the volume in either travel direction at a tolerable level four ticks on the analogue scale Last night the silence was suddenly broken Okay he said as we started the thirtyminute ride to his practice this is boring Were going to have a conversation What do you want to talk about I asked somewhat startled He said he would ask me some questions Gary he asked always addressing me in the familiar what was your favorite thing to do when you were a kid I was struck dumb I didnt kn ow how to answer the question because I was afraid that whatever I selected h e would say BORING So I drifted a bit in my answer I was very tentative I started with my high school years and what I liked and who I hung around with I then spoke about younger days when I was my sons age and then continued into my elementary school experiences He listened to every word and asked more questions What were my brothers like which on e of my brothers was I close to why did I look forward to going to high school what instrument did I play in the band and on and on We didnt stop until we reached the ice rink I had butterflies in my stomach Picture this I have suddenly found my professional life awash with newspaper interviews TV interviews microphon es stuck in my face and audiences asking me dozens of tough questions The more of that I do the more comfortable it becomes Compare that with my fear of answering these simple questions posed to me by my son about my life Would I be judged harshly Would my answers disappoint him Every Dad wants to be a superstar to his son I guess I passed and I am thankful for the experience Ill probably treasure that conversation for a lifetime not knowing why When you think about I received the most precious gift a son can give a father Well on that note I will wish each and every one of you a happy holiday season whether you celebrate Chanukah or Christmas or both as we do It has been a privilege to write these Burritos for you I cherish your kind comments to me about our weekly get togethers I look forward to serving y ou next year in good health and with less stress Im looking for a quite time maybe in April or May when we can look back at the last few weeks a nd wonder how did we ever get through it all Have a great holiday gba

The bigger the missed payment the more they care And how we Californians care about the potentially biggest missed payment of the Century Hey I ca n say that now and be telling the truth John Yurkanin COO of the PX was telling me at the end of our phone conversation yesterday You know Gary you might be the only friend I have left anymore I informed John that if my friendship was so prized then he was in big trouble A situation like that rates TPCs Totally Pathetic Circumstance But hey John stick with me dont worry about a thing Were going to get through this Now lets take an inventory of this weeks crises There is the electric shortage crisis We entered the Stage Alert zone Thursday afternoon and early this morning There is the natural gas payasyouburn crisis Most of you natural gas sellers have determined that PGE might not be the secured buyer they once were There is the cash crisis Our two major utilities ha ve no liquid funds to pay their energy bills Mush all three crises together and you get a new word Egash Like our State Motto Eureka which me ans I have found it we can exclaim Egash Im Screwed And everyone is starting to feel some of the pain The ESPs or what remai ns of that class of market participants were informed by PGE that the paymen t of the PX credit for the directaccess customer bills the ESPs are due unde r consolidated billing are henceforth suspended The rate freeze ended last August so the logic goes PGE doesnt need to acknowledge the PX credit That puts a serious breach of contract kink in the ESPUtility relationship Of course who is going to write about hundreds of millions of dollars of short payments when you can write about billions of dollars of short payments I mean who cares about the financial well being of the remainin g competitors to the UDCs Let them fold their tent California customers dont want a choice of energy provider do they I dont know Its gettin g too easy to be cynical Commissioner Carl Wood also handed out a couple of late Christmas gifts H e ruled that QFs under Standard Offer Contracts could at most be paid MWH regardless of the SO formula for energy payment The QFs have to buy wintertime natural gas at market prices and their production costs ar e easily in the range of MWH What a great idea Force MW or so of remaining SOQF capacity to voluntarily shut down at a time when that capacity is so desperately needed I know I have been picking on Mr Wood a lot This week we served on the same FM radio talk show KQEDs Forum I hate to admit this but Carl is really a nice person I dont like disagreeing with people who are basical ly decent Thats is why I would rather gently tease people like Mike Florio rather than outandout disagree with him I figure that deep inside thes e misguided souls there is a crossed wire that gives them the wrong answer to every major policy question Carl and I started talking about good places to get corned beef sandwiches as we were leaving the studio and he was positively effusive about some delicatessens he has frequented in Orange County I asked Carl are you Jewish He said yes that he grew up in a Jewish section of Baltimore Carl I confessed you dont look Jewish and you talk like a Communist Whats your story So we laughed about th at and chatted away as he walked to his car at the radio station parking lot and I walked to mine I asked him Carl what did you think of that Mark Twain quote I used to dance on your Deregulation is Dead statement when I said that rumors of deregulations death have been greatly exaggerated H e replied From the moment I uttered those words on the dais of the PUC hearing room I feared someone was going to tag me with that Twain quote And it was I Nettie Hogue was the other panelist on the FM show She spoke of the desir e for a corenoncore split of the default customers whereby the small customers would be core and the large customers would be noncore The UDC s would be required to procure for the core but not for the noncore The larger customers who have the ability and the resources could negotiate longterm contracts with suppliers other than the UDC If you take her platform and tweak it a little you get something that looks very much lik e our Morro Bay principle for releasing the greater than kW connected load customers from UDC default service There is wrinkle in TURNs plan however They want to keep all the retain ed generating assets eg PGEs hydro plants for the core procurement portfolio I dont think the customers in the noncore group are going to like that They contributed revenue requirement to those retained plants too They will want a credit for their contributions On the other hand if PGE and SCE were to transition to the corenoncore split you can be assured the Utility Companys will charge both core and noncore classes fo r the carried stranded costs the undercollection of revenue from todays frozen rate debacle The saw cuts both ways Speaking of saws our Governor simply did one bang up job on the State of t he State message last Monday night Now that I am a semiprofessional talking head Give Us Quote I was lined up by four news reporters prior to the address to standby with my opinion on the Governors speech I was diplomatic sort of to the press Let me tell you what I really thought He stunk up the joint I couldnt believe how nervous he was during the delivery I can understand a few slurred words or a mispronunciation or two But Gray was grim As he rockandrolled into the guts of his comments he sounded more and more like Mr Rogers Can you say Eminent Domain He said at the outset that he wasnt going to assign blame or poin t fingers I was just a little hopeful that he would be conciliatory in tone Not He ranted and raved for forty minutes half of which was bashing you folks for being well you folks You are selling his power out of State What is wrong with you people Portland based Avistas Linda Hamilton wrot e me a note and as an aside asked quite entertainingyour governor Somehow I have yet to put together how he intends to solve the problem We dont get it either Linda It is a mystery Okay Egash heads Lets get it on Things in the Peoples Republic of California PX has Writ all over it What are they doing in DC We have a Winner Letters Odds Ends General Meeting on February and Tell Us If Your Company will be Represented at the FERC Jan Meeting WPTF accepts th Member Things in the Peoples Republic of California PX has Writ all over it The California PX did something that SCE couldnt do last week That is they got a federal court to take notice on a Writ for a stay on aspects of FERCs December Order The Writ asked the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal s to Stay the FERC Orders prohibition against the IOUs selling into the PX Make such sales voluntary rather than mandatory Stay the April termination of the PXs CTS rate schedule because a termination halts forward longterm trading in the PXs block forward marke t for contract deliveries that extend beyond April and Stay the requirement that the PX implement the breakpoint The WPTF Board deliberated on whether or not the group should support the P X in their petition The discussion was lengthy and the vote took several days of email correspondence between Directors Yesterday the Board approved its support and filed such with the Court all parties and FERC At the same time the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals acted to set the question of whether it should grant a writ of mandamus to the PX and a stay of the December th order The Ninth Circuit set the matter for oral argument on Wednesday February at pm in Pasadena Each side will be allowed minutes to present their argument The three issues to b e argued are the issues raised by the PX in its motion for rehearing and stay Good luck gang Things in the Peoples Republic of California What are they doing in DC This segment of the Burrito should be hilarious I will attempt to describ e what I think is happening at the negotiations in Washington DC between th e utilities our generator and power marketing members and the State The reason this will be laughable is that I dont have a clue what those people are doing nor does the press Some press people have called me to see if I know That is a sure sign they are raking the bottom of the barrel Plus when you folks in DC read this you will mutter It didnt happen that way at all But without hard evidence the best thing to do is make it up as you go along Hey it works for the PUC There are several issues on the table In the general area of deferred payments and the like I think there is general agreement that something c an be worked out I bet that was concluded early on in the discussions However I believe the sticking point in the negotiations is the longterm forward contract prices The State wants to look tough and get a to kWh price The sellers need a lot of backend revenue recovery and securi ty to provide such Contract length of a decade or more may be required But more difficult than contract term are the payment safeguards required on th e part of the buyers to secure a lengthy contract How will the sellers hold the buyers feet to the fire forcing the buyers to pay the contract price when future spot prices are well below the contract price Will the State guarantee no regulatory out No State agency much less the Governors office could make assurances that bind future administrations So how can the sellers be sure they will be paid during the out years when the contrac ts are attractive to the sellers and less attractive to the buyers Banks will not finance deals especially multibillion dollar undertakings if there is a regulatory out clause in the contracts That clause alone could make the contracts worthless The clock is ticking too The Bush team is set to move into the White Hou se in ten days and in preparation for the new FERC Chairman Hoecker announce d his resignation effective January The Chairman despite the faults we may assign to him did one hell of a stand up job during his tenure I thi nk his greatest failure led to his greatest success He failed when he negotiated with the ISO and the State of California to allow the State some role in the governance of the ISO and the PX vis a vis SB That was a regrettable slip for which we are still paying the consequences Hoeckers greatest moment was his fierce opposition to the barrage of political pressure from California politicians to solve Californias problems with a regional price cap I never thought he would stand up to that kind of pressure Back to our folks in DC If I were one of them I would let the utilities talk their hearts out about the need for reasonable longterm contract prices I would then show them the security I would need to provide those reasonable prices without me taking on any incremental risk The utiliti es would tell me they are unable to provide the necessary assurances and I would sit back and say to them Okay lets talk about a higher average price And around and around it would go Time is on our side The new federal administration will be more sympathetic to my goals of competition and deregulation So why not wait If the contract talks fail then whose fault would that be Here is my advice to you folks freezing in the Nations Capital SIGN NOTHING Help the utilities with deferred payment schedules but hold the line on the longterm forward price until the buyers and the buyers regulatory agencies get realistic Things in the Peoples Republic of California We have a Winner Just when you thought you have seen it all along comes the superduper winner of the Longest Petitioners Title in a Regulatory Filing category We also issue a companion award for the longest coffee order at Starbucks Okay Im not making this one up The Chief Legal Counsel for the Californ ia State Auditor filed at FERC the following motion OPPOSITION OF CALIFONRIA BUREAU OF AUDIT TO EMERGENCY MOTION OF MARKET PARTICIPANTS TO REQUIRE THAT THE CALIFORNIAINDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR CORPORATION AND CALIFORNIA POWER EXCHANGE MAKE NO DISCLOSURES OF CONFIDENTI AL INFORMATION IN OTHER PROCEEDINGS UNLESS THERE IS IN PLACE A PROTECTIVE ORDE R OR CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT THAT IS SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSIONS MODEL PROTECTIVE ORDER AND MOTION TO SHORTEN TIME FOR ANSWERS OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE TO STAY AND DISCLOSURE PENDING COMMISSION CONSIDERATION OF THE EMERGENCY MOTION What the hell does that mean I would hate to get an email from the Auditors Counsel The subject heading may be longer than the mbyte on my download size limit Letters A letter from APXs Jack Ellis who is based in London and soon to return t o the Bay Area for more than just a weeks visit sent me the following Theres so much being written about this whole situation that it is impossible for a mere mortal to read it all every day California has turn ed from a mess into a disaster which raises an interesting question The Governor and Commissioner Wood among others have made very strong statements against the while idea of a deregulated really a competitive electricity market However I think we have to ask ourselves if deregulating an electricity market is such a terrible idea given the experience in other countries Scandinavia for example has an extremely successful market that has been operating for ten years without the problem s that have become endemic in California Same for Germany the UK and several other European countries Prices are reasonable customers have choice and the market works well by any account Could it be that competitive markets are actually a pretty good idea done right but Californ ia went about it the wrong way Thank you Jack We look forward to seeing you back here where things are a little less static You might miss Western Europe On the other hand giv en some of the actors in our local California power play it may become more obvious to you why the Dark Ages lasted years The next letter is from BPAs Don Wolfe who asks the philosophers stone question Why He says Concerning the CPUC proposed criteria for forward procurement you specula te that they are confusing physical hedging with physical delivery Although I dont claim to have mastered the nuances of hedging versus delivery my impression was that their goal was less technical that is to eliminate th e traders and any intermediate transactions likely based on the belief that prices are marked up as power changes hands The result is de facto reregulation with suppliers and loads bound to one another in longterm forward contracts with prices subject to close scrutiny and approval leaving only a residual nearterm and realtime markets When thats done what sort of competitive market is there From an anonymous friend I received this critique of my style The author said Im sorry Gary but your Gou Jing and Speedy Bailout analogy is just too damn onesided The generators are gouging in a very imabalanced market a nd youre pretty much saying that the utilities should bear the brunt of the failure of the market What viable business ever made a deal to absorb the cost when prices got out of whack Why shouldnt the consumers pay the fair market price for the electricity theyre consuming If the price isnt fair and they dont want to pay it why not use less energy It is a commodity for chrissakes I just turn off the lights when I think my bi ll is going to be too high My hackles go up thinking that the generators can just raise the price as they see fit As difficult for you as it is to accept the State of California actually needs the utilities to transmit and distribute electricitydo you know any other entity with the means to keeps your lights on Well yes and no Any transmission operator can do the same job regardless of the location and type of physical assets One can buy that kind of expertise in the labor market As to market failures and such I suppose this letter demonstrates that there is a deep hurt or emotional wrench fr om being on the wrong side of an unhedged bet I know I would feel the same w ay if the decision were mine to hedge against the downside If I didnt and prices moved against me then I would pay the consequences I would also fe el angry and foolish Here we have millions of people who are feeling not on ly the economic pain of someone elses stupid decision but adding insult to injury the decision was not in the consumers hands It was definitely outside the reach of the people who will one way or another pay the bill I remain unmoved that the fault is the generators and power marketers They are and have been doing what they have always been trained to do manage risk pick positions and relentlessly pursue opportunities Sorry I thin k the anger directed toward the generators and power marketers is totally misplaced Finally Phil Muller of SDC Energy responded to last weeks anonymous ruminations about those greedy power marketers Here is what Phil said As I look back on this weeks burrito and in particular the anonymous critique of high prices I cant help but working on these analogies a bit to add in some forgotten reality Lets start with the cattle business analogy This is exactly the way cattl e producers run their businesses Lets say the rancher actually grazes his cattle on government range land at low cost which allows him to raise many head of cheap cattle that is sold to McDonalds to make Big Macs The price that McDonalds is willing to pay for his beef has not gone up he doesnt g et to set the price for his product remember in fact it is at a low level because people are eating fewer big macs The reason that hay is worth per bale is that theres a shortage of hay and ranchers who are raising pri me beef for Mortons or breeding stock or thoroughbred race horses are willing to pay that much because of the value of their livestock By selling his h ay for Old McDonald is making it possible for more valuable animals to be fed rather than wasting hay to feed scrawny cattle that no one wants to buy The fact that hes idling his land and equipment means that he might have the time and money to invest some of his excess profits in upgrading his ranch to maybe allow him to grow more beeves more efficiently in the future This is a damned good way to run a business The gas station example is another good one In this case a monopoly sell er uses his market power to achieve the maximum possible return Just suppose this actually happened What would you do if you pulled into a gas station and were told that youd be charged gallon for gas because your tank w as empty If it were a matter of life or death you might buy as little as possible to get you to the next gas station Otherwise you might call AAA or someone to come to your rescue and deliver enough gas to get you out of there Or you might just leave your car there and hitch a ride to the next gas station If this gas station owner were able to pull this off with any frequency however you might decide to get into the gas business yourself and open a station nearby to provide gas at slightly lower prices We all know what happens then competition Finally moving to the airline analogy going from the bottom and working up is exactly what happens in the electricity market If you have demand responsiveness the first consumers to stop using are those unwilling to pa y the lowest high price When youre getting MWh prices it means that everyone is willing to pay that price the price is not being passed through to the consumer or the consumer is not aware of the price level Unfortunately in our overregulated deregulated market the second and thi rd results are what happen most of the time There are only ways to ration electricity during a shortage by price o r by prescribed rolling blackout I never would have thought that several anonymous analogies would inspire s o much Egash Odds Ends General Meeting on February and Have you made your hotel reservations at the Old Scottsdale Marriott for th e evening of February The cut off date for the cheaper hotel rate is January next Tuesday The phone number for the Marriott Hotel in old town Scottsdale is or I have two additional announcements about the General Meeting First on Thursday evening we will have an open discussionkeynote speaker led by Dr Ben

Friday our General Meeting will begin at am and e nd at noon Lunch will be provided by WPTF Odds Ends Tell Us If Your Company will be Represented at the FERC Jan Meeting At the WPTF Board meeting this week there was a discussion regarding the upcoming FERC technical conference on market monitoring to be held on Janua ry at the FERC headquarters building in DC It was understood by several of the WPTF Board members that days before the meeting the ISO staff will release a policy or position paper on market monitoring A suggestion was made that any and all WPTF members who might attend that meeting should wor k together on a joint position paper that would collect our opinions and idea s in response to the ISO position and promote any new concepts that we might develop Therefore could you please email to me the attendees from your company to the FERC meeting We will set up a future conference call to assemble a group and discuss the merits of different market monitoring ideas The purpose of the group effort is that a joint response to the ISO position ma y be more efficient and timely Any discussion WPTF conducts on market monitoring will be an advocacy response to anticipated policies that may emanate from the ISO and FERC Odds Ends WPTF accepts th Member We are still growing WPTFs th member and seventeenth general member i s Xcel Energy Marketing Xcel is located in

colleagues at Xcel Odds Ends Well it is the end of another long week in paradise Someone said to me that the rest of the year will be like this Every week throughout the year It makes me cringe to think of it Usually I put some humor in the Burrito right about here But I have another idea Dan Douglass of Arter Hadden sent me a copy of an article in Reason Magazine that was so good it deserves to be read It was written b y Michael Lynch and it is entitled California Scheming Dont blame deregulation for the Golden States electricity snafus The publisher granted my request to distribute the

Phoenix with the other WPTF geeks enjoyin g perfect weather a little golf and party time Those of you not attending our general meeting in Old Town Scottsdale shame on you please hold down the fort in California while we are gone Be sure to turn out all the ligh ts before you go to bed At pm every night check to see that legislators are still in session debating another mindnumbing emergency session bill Pray for our Governor and our StateAppointed ISO Governing Board for they know not what they do Give an amen to direct access customers all snug and safe in the utilities bosom as default customers We really have done a bang up job here in California Who do we get to ba il out next It is the favorite topic of the day A utility bailout that is what todays newly approved legislation ABX is being called Society makes choices the utilities do what they are told at a reasonable rate of return and investments that might have been made in new electric generatio n facilities were deferred and deferred Its not a utility bailout that we are witnessing but rather a California bailout We are bailing out our own dirty mess for not providing sufficient generating capacity Have you wondered in these last few weeks why everything went south at the same time I have thought about this a lot and have determined there are no good explanations What are the odds that a capacity shortage a draught and ultrahigh natural gas prices would occur at the same time Well just as the utilities like to say with each missed payment these are forces beyond our control Let the waves hit the beach and what survives the storm survives Everything else must perish There is no electric tooth fairy to bring back the California PX or the tensofthousands of direct access customers returned to default service this week The Western Governors the US Congress and the Presidents cabinet have al l taken photo op shots at the issues I dont think those meetings will add much to the pile of solutions to our thorny problems Who knows maybe the WSCC will get a mandated price cap Would we endorse a price cap even at I dont know Some of you might support that whereas others would stay the course No price caps Of course I dont understand how a price cap of say the same cap used in other regions of the country can help us in the West The economic impact we have witnessed has come about from prices well below MWH Here is this weeks line up The Peoples Republic of California Stop the Bleeding Bill They Wrote to Me Things National California seeks to be a party in our DC Circuit Court Case against FE RC Letters A Few Thoughts by George Sladoje More Tributes to Kent Wheatland Odds Ends DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD The Peoples Republic of California Stop the Bleeding Bill ABX was signed into law today It is the most curious piece of legislation Legislate in haste and repent in leisure The Governor claimed in his press release This measure offers our best hope of avoidin g electricity rate increases in future years We will now put together a portfolio of lowcost contracts With new contracts for alternative and renewable energy sources it is my hope and expectation that we can live within the existing rate structure I have read the bill several times a nd I dont see how it is even remotely possible to avoid electricity rate increases Someday I want to be Governor Then I will have the freedom to make up the truth as I go along and voters in the State will blindly belie ve me Thats the job I want Here is the gist of the bill First that DWR will enter into long term contracts to cover PGEs and SCEs net short position The first round of bids yielded less than MW of power Hardly enough by a factor of four I reckon to cover the net short positions of both utilities Next the power delivered by those contracts will be delivered to Californias en d use customers utilizing the poles and wires of the utility distribution companies UDC Each utilitys cost for the delivered power own generation QFs bilateral deals DWR purchases and ancillary services in excess of the generation component of the UDCs rate will be called the California Procurement Adjustment The PUC has the authority to pass on so me or all of the California Procurement Adjustment to customers for the energy consumed in excess of of customers baseline quantity That sounds to me like a rate increase The first block of monthly consumption and above that will not be charged for the new Adjustment All monthly consumption above that level will get a pro rata share of the Adjustment The DWR purchases will be backed by stateissued bonds the maximum of which can not be an aggregate amount greater than the amount calculated by multiplying by a factor of four the annual revenues generated by the California Procurement Adjustment as determined by the PUC pursua nt to Section The media was reporting a billion bond bailout for the utilities but I dont see how they derived that number Currently PGE and SCE are accumulating a bill for their net short positio n of billion per month The average system load is to MWs and the average purchase price for the spot energy being purchased is aroun d kWh Assuming that longterm contracts would price the power at say kWh and at least half the net short position could be covered utilizing longterm contracts the monthly cost for the net short position would be around million and the annual figure would be billion Lets allocate the annual cost of billion over the energy consumed above the baseline quantity I have heard that of the energy consumed by customers of the three IOUs is above the baseline quantity Well assume that or of the energy consumed is above of the baseline consumption level The annual energy delivered by the ISO is roughly TWh and therefore of that is TWh The average cost per applicable kWh of uplift in a customers bill would be kWh thereby roughly doubling the current generation component of the current frozen rates Of course the additional revenue collection isnt expected to keep up with the cost of the net short position Electricity costs will fall off as gas prices ease and more supply comes on line However it is breathtaking to observe that for the kWh that are bearing the uplift the kWh rate increa se for residential customers is about and blended with the of baseli ne energy the rate increase is about Thats a lot of math to get to the same percent increase the utilities were claiming they needed to satisfy th e revenue shortfall A thirty percent increase in my PGE electric bill wou ld add between to to the monthly tab I am beginning to wonder why we Californians are making such a fuss Falling interest rates on my variablerate home mortgage will probably boost my aftertax income to per month Hell I gladly would pay a higher electric bill plus an additional to per month to assist those consumers on fixed income or otherwise unable to absorb the cost increase Are we properly focused on the right problem Another flea on this legislation is the suspension of new direct access customers during the time that DWR is procuring energy The bill states the right of retail end use customers to acquire service from other providers shall be suspended until the department no longer supplies power hereunder Voila Not only do we get a rate increase but our ability to choose an alternative energy supplier is hereby waived I would think the average Californian would be outraged by that dictate Of course most Californians didnt know that they had a choice Therefore the legislatio n made a grand leap forward by lowering our opportunity set to be in line wit h expectations I wonder what the Legislature will do next week The Peoples Republic of California They Wrote to Me On Monday the LA Times published my first Op Ed I attempted in that piec e to compare our role as electricity marketers and producers to lending institutions that offer homeloan mortgages in various riskadjusted instruments variablerate loans fixed rate loans etc The comparison i s less accurate than apt However I think we as an industry get too focus ed on things about which the public cares little Does the public need to understand how banks arbitrage loans in order for a consumer to obtain a ho me loan Does the public need to understand the workings of the internal combustion engine to drive a car So I tried my level best to describe how the consumer should view our side of the demandsupply interaction I included in the article my email address I wanted to get a feel for th e thoughts of people who would make the effort to write Even though there were only a handful of responses I was pretty much taken aback by the tone of the letters The edge in their language was sharp They generally distrust our industry sometimes confusing us with utilities I would characterize their thinking as first assume you suppliers and marketers ar e crooks and everything else flows from there Here are some excerpts I read your article in todays LA Times in which you make out that yo ur members the electrical power generators are completely innocent of any ha rm and were only trying to help Oh yeah Where did that billion dollars go It did not go to the utility companies they are on the verge of bankruptcy It went to your members who are laughing all the way to the ba nk at our predicament As a consumer in the SCE service area I was disappointed with your analog y or comparison of variablerate home loans with the current high cost of energy Variablerate home loans offer more disclosure to consumers than t he information that was provided to residential consumers and possibly the legislature that weighed in on AB exactly how stupid do you think we are you assholes buy the politicians rig the bidding process and then say we should quit calling you names after you have stolen billions from people who work for a living Ed This response won the Miller Brewing CoWriters Guide Award for Keen Articulati on Under Dim Light I dont mind paying for a service that I use and makes my life comfortable but BIG BUSINESS is playing with us once again and this is NOT RIGHT The State of California has grown in the last decade and no new power plants They were warned about their lack of future vision for not allowin g new power plants to be built and now were paying the price as usual This boom to bust cycle in oil natural gas and now electric energy is we ll chronicled and almost always precipitated by gaming on the supply side of the equation namely OPEC Personally I think it is high time the Fed eral Government or the State of California started investing in and buildin g nuclear power plants with a vengeance again Things National California seeks to be a party in our DC Circuit Court Case against FE RC I attended the Electric Power Supply Association EPSA annual meeting in Palm Desert this week It was a really nice event and the speakers were excellent Among the guests was former FERC Chairman Jim Hoecker I chatted with him about our dilemma in California regarding the Stateappointed ISO Governing Board and he admitted that we must do all we can to give the FERC Staff more spine I was thinking about a steel rod a nd the FERC staff in a compromising position but more on that later I asked Citizen Jim what he was going to do for a living now that he is ri d of his Commission robe He said he was thinking about hanging a sign aroun d his neck Will Regulate for Food but he wasnt quite sure Mr Lockyer Californias Attorney General who did not attend the EPSA conference filed in our case against FERC to appear as Amicus Curiae I am not a Latin scholar but that means Strange Friend before the DC Circuit Court of Appeals For cases involving highvoltage electricity I think the re should be an AC Circuit Court But more on that later The petition state s In the event that the Court concludes that the new California legislation ABX does not moot this appeal we respectfully request the opportunit y to submit a brief on the preemption issues inherent in this litigation within a reasonable period of time as determined by the Court Yeah come on in I want this case to get a little wider Last Friday ou r attorney Bracewell Patterson and FERCs counsel made oral arguments before the Court The ordeal took minutes and the judges asked pretty tough questions The new StateAppointed Governing Board is doing its best to gum up the works Yesterday they met for a second time had a completely revised agenda and proposed to meet in executive session to discuss how the transmission system works Further in executive session individual membe rs of the ISO executive team were called in one by one to appear before the Board My guess is that each had to take a secret oath swearing allegianc e to the Governor Chairman Kahn and the Dark Side But more on that later Letters A Few Thoughts by George Sladoje I asked California PX CEO George Sladoje to write a letter to the Burrito expressing his thoughts at this difficult time Here is what George wrote Dear Gary As you know the California Power Exchange has begun to wind up its affairs with the intention of closing its doors soon In fact our last DayAhead auction will probably take place in the coming week Note it closed last Wednesday While I believe that our leaving the power scene will ultimately hurt the consumers and businesses of this state I am most disappointed that the outstanding efforts of nearly dedicated hard working and innovative employees and contractors ultimately could not withstand the environment we find ourselves in today In my working career of nearly years it can t be I have never witnessed an effort of the magnitude that our group has given CalPX began with much opposition and really no passionate support In the end we still had no real advocates though everyone claimed to support the concept of a transparent fair and honest price under rules that did not discriminate and that everyone could follow The final indignity was our attempt to fight the arbitrary discriminatory and unconstitutional aspects of the December FERC order as it pertained to CalPX The Governors office the EOB and the CPUC declined to support us even though the order was in effect directed largely at those bodies They were content to let CalPX be the scapegoat for high prices in the West Only the WPTF stepped forward and your group is to be commended f or taking a stand Our major operational setback was our inability to persuade users to participate in our forward market which would have spared California much o f the current chaos we are now experiencing In January at our first meeting to develop these contracts I told our management group that these forward contracts would establish us as a major financial institution and that they would become the springboard to a successful deregulated market Instead when we introduced them in the summer they were greeted with a ya wn and only grudgingly utilized Suddenly in June of every expert from Washington D C to Berkeley began proclaiming the value of forward contracting Today the IOUs continue to obscure their reluctance to participate in this market claiming they were victims of a forced spot market Generators on the other hand have apparently never supported exchange based forwards for their own reasons Our goal of developing the first real futures products i n this business will not be achieved I find it ironic that today we are in court over guess what d forward contracts that the IOUs didnt really em brace anyway Just imagine if they saved billion in seven months without really trying Anyway the Burrito has consistently been one of the few of hundreds of emails that I receive each week that I look forward to Keep up the good work To all of your readers d good luck and keep plugging away There are tremendous possibilities ahead Finally the concept of exchange based power products is a good one and is the right way to go It has worked in other countries and will work in othe r areas of this country Unfortunately it cant be done in California at this time Thanks and good luck Letters More Tributes to Kent Wheatland This Sunday at pm the family of our friend and colleague Kent Wheatland who passed away on January will hold a memorial service Information about the service is posted on a web site managed by Kents brother The address is kent If you are in the B ay Area on Sunday afternoon please consider attending Here are some more notes I received from fellow WPTF members about Kent Jimmy Thomas who is recently retired from Dynegy Although I did not work with Kent closely the few personal encounters were memorable His zest for life is what sticks with me No matter the conversation his smile was infectious You could feel the joy he had in a ll he did When we discussed business he smiled as though he was ahead of yo u with your thoughts When we discussed pleasure he smiled as though to say Ive done that and would like you to join me next time It was my pleasure to know Kent We should all learn the lesson of his attitude and how it impacts everyone who comes into contact I pray in earnest for his family I pray that they will find peace and ca lm and reconciliation in the loss of Kent at such a young age I pray that hi s family will find the meaning and reasons for God wanting Kent to come home I pray that God will reveal His truths to Kents family so they will experience comfort through their sorrow Kent will be missed but I know his smile is still infecting all around himin an eternal way now From SCUG buddy and Dynegy friend Jolly Hayden I have so many good memories of Kent his sense of humor his wit and his unbelievable intelligence I learned so much from him He kept me on my toes he was a blast to argue with we could go for days on a single topic and often did via phone calls and email His passion was phenomenal he loved this stuff It was a privilege and honor to have know n Kent these last few years From Max Bulk of the California PX I was shocked to read about Kent While I didnt know him as well as yo u I highly respected him and thoroughly enjoyed his company His ability to inject humor into dry and often confrontation situations was wonderful Hi s passing is truly our loss One memory to share It was one of the CMR meetings towards the end of th e process I think where the ISO was introducing subjects willynilly with almost no forethought Kent had been particularly vocal in his condemnatio n of the more ridiculous proposals and when he took the mike ISO staff visibl y winced Kent never losing his smile tore into Kellan about the rapid timeline and apparent disorganization As he neared his crescendo he said Ive got one more question for you Whats up with the ISO logo Is that a drowning dolphin or what From Dynegys Dave Francis I have often commented that this business is still about people While our coworkers may come and go the bonds of friendship carry over time and distance It warms me to know that my feelings about Kent are shared acros s our industry Everytime I am at the Sacramento Sheraton I distinctly remember Dennis Flaherty and I speaking with Kent about the market while standing in the courtyard I believe that was the beginning of getting him here where he belonged Man he was a good guy So to the extent Im abl e to express it thank all of you Greg Blue former Chair of WPTF wrote the following One of the most cherished moment I had with Kent was in one of his first weeks of employment at Dynegy he was able to join us at a Dynegy sponsored golf tournament Coming from the CPUC they did not get to participate in many corporate golf outings Kent was all smiles as he came in with a scor e of He was then told that in order to work at Dynegy he had to take go lf lessons Kent also had one thing that you cannot teachenthusiasm Written by Jeff Roarke of Mirant formerly Southern Energy You know given everything that has been going on in the power markets this just seems to be part of it all One more thing Kent was always a huge presence at the meetings that I went to But as we know those stakeholder meetings are gone forever too Combine it with the death of the PX and it is a very sobering set of circumstances Finally Dennis Flaherty formerly of Dynegy and now with Cynergy wrote a long letter of which a part I have included here Over a couple of beers in the Sacramento Hyatt bar one evening Kent a nd I philosophized on life His conclusion was that we should not be sadden ed by our departure from this world but instead we should embrace the departure thinking that the person isnt gone but instead the person s spirit now fills the earth wind water and fire So now that you Kent have departed us I ask all whom you left in this world to remember you our dear friend colleague and loved one not for the person you were but for the spirit you share with us all So when we feel that brisk breeze dancing on our necks or when we see that rare beautiful flower let us remember to embrace your philosophy and to strive to replicate and share the feeling yo u provided to all of us We all should consider ourselves the most fortunate people in the world for having the opportunity to see all the beautiful aspects of the world rolled into one very special human spirit we knew as Kent Wheatland A final note for Burrito readers I will be asking the WPTF Board of Directors to honor Kent by naming an award in his name The Kent Wheatland Award will be given to special people in our industry who share the passion Kent had for doing the right thing and persisting under any set of circumstances both favorable or unfavorable I hope that Gregg Wheatland Kents surviving brother will help us select suitable candidates and in s o doing keep our departed friends name alive We wont give up that easily Odds Ends Responses for the WPTF General Meeting on February

the abyss of the dreaded B word The State Legislature and our illustrious Governor Emperor of the Dark Side are showing a trait that heretofore I never noticed They are impotent in tackling complex issues that involve big bucks They are simply unable to manage the task I used to hold these institutions in relatively high regard Forget the bellyaching in which all taxpayers and voters engage I mean there was an element of something bigger than the PUC the ISO and the utilities when reference was made to the boys and girls working in the State Capital I a m no longer impressed I suppose there are things the Gov and the Legislature do well Let me think Well law enforcement environment transportation water agriculture education parks and recreation and health I suppose they d o all right managing those things But as for electricity it seems this top ic is like a hungry monster that chews up politicians and spits them out after sucking the political marrow from their bones The mix of money and electrons is too rich for their appetites Yet hope springs eternal Today the Governor will announce his package for curing Californias energy crisis There is one part of his plan that is good news He will announce a new component of electric rates that will increase revenue to cover the undercollected wholesale power costs of PGE and SCE The smelly parts include purchase of the transmission grid by the State thereby transferring revenue collection for the grid to the Californ ia Department of Water Resources We discuss the whole package below Howeve r it is mind boggling to me how deep the State is willing to sink to avoid a straight up rate increase I understand based on recent emails you folks have sent to me that DWR will reorganize and take on a new name Californ ia Utility Buyers Agency CUBA The head of CUBA will be S Fidel Freeman a wellknown advocate of public systems Helping Fidel fiddle at the helm wil l be Che Budraja a jungle revolutionary who steals from the rich and invest s the money in Tbills We look for great things from CUBA not the least of which will be cigars that have printed on the label The Attorney General Has Determined that Retail Competition May Be Hazardous to Our Health As the state struggles to punch its way out of the mess I have discovered a solution to our energy woes whilst in the comfort of my own home My propos al is that we ship all our teenage children to Montana for the summer This will conserve thousands of megawatts of instate electric generating capacity bring down the price of alcohol and make our roads safe The other day I entered the bedroom of my year old boy and noticed that everything electrical was humming His computer was the main focus of his attention at that moment but at the same time his TV was on the electricguitar amplifier was on standby ready all the lights were on and a CD player was filling the air with the sounds of screeching voices One megawatt may light homes so they say but it only energizes teenagers Send our teenagers to Montana I have a name for this program Energy Conserpation We Dont Give a about Saving Energy and put them on the right side of the Western grid Plenty of coal power out there and the program will lessen the need for burning natural gas to produce electricity When Montana gets tired of our million California teenagers because they emptied the state of Snicker Bars Pepsi and cellophane wrapp ed junk food well send them by bus to Mexico Our Governor and even Preside nt Bush believe that all the power we be needin is south of the border Anyway the dollar is strong relative to the peso and we can feed our beloved children snacks from Source Taco Bell with enough gorditas and chalupas until the cows come home which is soon When school restarts in the Fall the summer rolling blackout threat The ISO is in Day of a Stage Alert will be over and we can welcome home our new heroes Its a plan ISO Governing Board Chairman Ghengis Kahn is reported to be constantly reminding the ISO staff at Governing Board meetings that reality is an important element of their new strategy I wonder how he would know And PUC President Loretta Lets Do Lynch the Darth Vaderess to Davis DarkSide Emperor is reported to be loving her job at the PUC Im not making this up She actually told the San Francisco Chronicle how much she loves getting things back to the way they were before I hear that wh en she is done with electricity reform she will be assigned to work on Civil Rights Return that system back to circa The way I see it the State will enter into relatively costly longterm contracts The effect will nail consumers to default utility service by suspending direct access and in just a few years we will be back to where we were in high cost electricity against which businesses want an out because spot wholesale prices will be below the longterm price benchmark But this time we can take advantage of our hindsight to craft a bette r solution I have a suggestion Lets gather together in advance representatives of all segments of our business and develop a memorandum o f understanding The MOU will spell out a new competitive market that allows utilities by then financially upright to collect their new stranded costs Consumers will be given the Province of British Columbia soon to b e purchased by Governor Davis as a peace offering to Harvey Rosenfield All the nuclear plants will be purchased by the state and operational control will be turned over to the consumer advocates Everyone will be happy Al l we need is a Republican Governor for California in we can rely upon to enact the necessary legislation I am delighted to be back in Burritoville Phoenix was nice the crowd wa s great our speakers were terrific but I need my weekly slab of salty meat and salsa Things in the Peoples Republic of California Dr Davis Miracle Cure Phoenix Principles are on the Table Is there a Credit Committee in your future APX Announces Special Workshop on Feb Things National FERC Kicks ISO Tariff Amendment in the Chops Ohio Ushers in Retail Competition Odds Ends DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD Things in the Peoples Republic of California Dr Davis Miracle Cure As I write this weeks Burrito the Governor and his aides are trying to convince the Democratic Caucus in the state legislature that his plan has legs If it had legs then I wish it would run away Here are the major points of Dr Davis plan as I heard it yesterday afternoon Authorize DWR to acquire the high voltage transmission grid andor other assets enter into related agreements with utilities and contract for operation of transmission with utilities Direct the PUC to amend and transfer the appropriate portion of retail rates applicable to transmission from utilities to DWR Authorize revenue bond financing for acquisition and required improvement s of the transmission grid The states purchase of the transmission system is conditional upon PGEs and SCEs parent companies returning their Year tax refunds back to th e affected utility about billion extending costbased rates on native generation for additional years banning the sale of generating assets a nd dismissing the pending rate litigation against the state in federal Distric t Court If the utilities are willing to accept the deal then the state will direct the PUC to establish a Dedicated Rate Component DRC to allow recovery of portions of the utilities unrecovered costs pursuant to negotiations with the administration The state will authorize the utilities to sell revenue bonds secured by the DRC Shoot me for saying this but bankruptcy is beginning to look like an attractive alternative Sure we might not get all the money owed to the power marketers and generators but there is no guarantee of getting all th e money in the Govs plan There are loopholes big enough through which you can drive a wheeler Further shouldnt we do something to help the sta te from swallowing itself The right thing to do is say Mr Governor thank you so much You have tried mighty hard to wipe your hands clean of this mess but your plan just isnt enough Well take our chances I cant believe the Wall Street investors and bondholders will encourage the utilities to accept the offer although they might The plan has too many bureaucratic traps Too much that can go wrong and incur potentially long delays It smells bad What do you folks think Things in the Peoples Republic of California Phoenix Principles are on the Table While the Governor is busy peddling his plan last week in Phoenix our gro up also got involved with longterm and shortrun solutions to Californias electricity market About WPTF members had a discussion with a wide ran ge of ideas and options WPTF Chair Rob Lamkin and I facilitated the discussion and took notes of peoples comments Over the weekend Phil Muller helped me draft the shortterm principles in a summary document that is three pages The meaning of shortterm is recommendations that can be implemented in time for Summer of We are still working on the details and as many of you know we will teleconference next week to discuss the recommendations and hear your comments However below is a thumbnail synopsis of the seven shortterm recommendations that we are currently considering Electric price must be an incentive for energy conservation Pleas for voluntary conservation are not taken seriously unless accompanied by meaningful price signals Rely on positive incentives to achieve demand reductions Positive incentives align the interests of consumers with the need to reduce consumption and give consumers the ability to choose for themselves how to participate Market participants in the Western states should agree to a selfimposed damage control circuitbreaker mechanism for wholesale prices Market participants should individually establish for a limited time a voluntary circuitbreaker wholesale price above which their company will not charge a ny load serving entity Suppliers must be paid Suppliers who are still owed for deliveries made last October can not continue to sell power to California if they are not confident that they will be paid Temporarily ease airquality requirements to allow older power plants to operate more hours during the year Retain consumer choice options in selection of electricity suppliers A preferred alternative to the state becoming the only creditworthy party is for consumers themselves to take on the credit responsibility by purchasing directly from a third party supplier Suppliers bid data should be released on a timedelayed basis to an authorized monitor In order to satisfy the needs of both the public and the desires of the sellers a repository of suppliers bid data should be kept by an authorized market monitor that is independent of both buyer and seller influence There are major policy changes for WPTF in a few of the bullet items above Therefore the WPTF Board will need to hear from you either via email or a t next weeks teleconference We are anticipating that a Board vote will tak e place next Thursday at the earliest Things in the Peoples Republic of California Is there a Credit Committee in your future Get organized now and avoid the rush It may come to pass that we will learn a whole new facet of business That is the rules and procedures of bankruptcy I was introduced to Mr Jonathon Rosenthal of Saybrook Capital earlier this week Saybrook is an investmentbanking firm in LA that specializes in purchasing defaulted bonds from issuers going through difficult workouts and bankruptcies They represented many creditors in th e Orange County bailout in Remember that one Well currently Saybroo k is representing MBIA the largest bond insurance company in the world and a major creditor against the utilities if the utilities do not pay their bondholders MBIA is interested in discussing with other potential credito rs the role of an informal credit committee prior to a petition for bankruptcy WPTF is playing a role by introducing Saybrook and MBIA to our membership Towards that end a teleconference call has been scheduled next Tuesday for WPTF members and Saybrook Capital Because it is a members only call an d limited to potential creditors interested parties must contact me for the callin number and time If you want to learn more about Saybrook Capital their website address is wwwsaybrooknet Things in the Peoples Republic of California APX Announces Special Workshop on Feb The PX markets are gone and the ISO transmission market is a mess There are no adjustment bids to provide economic signals regarding SCs willingnes s to alter their schedules at various congested intertie points John Streme l of APX made a presentation in Phoenix last week at the WPTF general meeti ng on a proposal that APX may undertake to fill the adjustmentbid gap The folks at APX wanted me to alert you regarding the special meeting on Februa ry and encourage you to attend the workshop at their offices in Santa Clar a California Without a congestion market all SCs stand to loose millions of dollars by having schedules cut by the CAISO because there are no other short term alternatives to congestion management The investment APX will require fro m participants to develop an interim solution will be minor compared to the financial impact without it APX is asking you to attend this meeting and to confirm your desire to help fund a solution to be provided by APX Ultimately they will seek financial commitments prior to developing a solution but they believe it is feasible to have a system in place well before the summer season Due to its interi m nature APX will seek a flat fixed fee such that its planned abandonment wi ll not negatively impact APX with the more permanent change to congestion management that will eventually be implemented by the CAISO Contact Michael L Heinrich at APX for more information His email address is Things National FERC Kicks ISO Tariff Amendment in the Chops On Wednesday FERC issued an order that you can download at bulkpowerbulkpowerhtm The order is in response to several petitions not the least of which is the ISOs proposed Tariff Amendment The Amendment requested a relaxation of the credit requireme nt of PGE and SCE so that the ISO could continue ordering realtime generatio n to meet the load of the two major loadserving entities FERC stated that the credit requirement may be relaxed for the utilities scheduling of thei r own generation to meet their own load However for all net short purchases the ISO can not relax the credit limit The FERC wisely counsel ed the ISO to have a third party creditworthy buyer sleeve the net short schedules such as DWR A credit worthy backer said FERC would encourage more supply into the realtime market eg supplemental energy and reduc e the need for out of market calls It would be tempting to conclude that generators with ISO PGAs given the FERC Order do not have to respond to ISO calls if a credit worthy buyer is not available to back the ISO payments But I dont think that is what FER C was saying FERC was careful to avoid stepping on the toes of the US District Court that is addressing that very petition made by the ISO and under which a temporary restraining order is in effect mandating that all generators with ISO PGAs comply with ISO orders That case continues toda y in federal court in Sacramento However the FERC Order did do two things One if removed the risk that generators had the burden to sell to the ISO even if the buyers were not credit worthy Two it affirmed that reasonable price is in FERCs authority not the power buyer ie DWR Although not stated directly DWR had been chanting in word and deed that i t wouldnt pay prices that in their sole discretion were unreasonable That is the type of uncertainty that can stop a market stone cold Maybe in next weeks Burrito we will have a matrix of legal suits filed on behalf of or against our members and the state It would make things so much easier to understand You cant tell the players without a program Things National Ohio Ushers in Retail Competition Green Mountains Rick Counihan is excited about a news release regarding a community aggregation deal that his company is entering in Ohio even as California is moving to end such possibilities Green Mountain Energy Company was selected to serve over Ohio electricity customers in the countrys largestever energy aggregation contract The selection was made by the Northeast Ohio Public Energy Counc il NOPEC a governmental public electricity buying group formed to serve nearly communities in the area surrounding Cleveland Under the letter of understanding NOPEC and Green Mountain Energy Company will enter into a sixyear supply contract With the addition of these new Ohio customers Green Mountain Energy Companys total customer base will surpass across deregulated markets in California Pennsylvania New Jersey and Connecticut The Company received regulatory approval in Januar y to enter the Texas market later this year Under the terms of the letter of understanding the NOPEC and Green Mountai n Energy Company supply contract will provide for the Company to begin servin g customers in September Odds Ends Today my wife and I played hooky It was a belated Valentines Day celebration We took to the beautiful Napa Valley and enjoyed a threehour lunch on the Napa Valley Wine Train I highly recommend the journey The food is superb the train is a classic and watching the valley of wineries unfold to the rocking motion of the train is incredibly relaxing Nothing in the world not even our state energy crisis meant a thing during todays adventure The train speaks to another era a world that we might vaguely remember fr om our childhood Nothing like it exists in our daily lives today Iron steel brass and wood paneling are everywhere The girth of the train car s and engines are unlike the plastic moldings that coat our automobiles computers and modern day tools Dining in a dome car with heavy sterling silverware starched white linen attentive waiters and waitresses and classic cuisine lifts you from the humdrum of fast food to another time and place In short it was a thankful break from a stressfilled reality that is taking all of us down Dont forget to let go every now and then Okay Jobs jobs jobs It seems that many of you folks are changing jobs and others of you are eagerly trying to find people The demise of the PX certainly provides the rest of us with some very qualified candidates I encourage those of you trying to hire employees to post in the Burrito the positions you are trying to fill Also those of you looking for new opportunities should drop me a Burrito line and tell me what you are looki ng for We might as well make the search as easy as possible Speaking of new jobs Marcie Milner formerly of Enrons Phoenix office recently

of trouble His business was failing he had put everything he had into the business he owed everybody it was so bad he was even contemplating suicide As a last resort he went to a priest and poured out his story of tears and woe When he had finished the priest said Heres what I want you to do Put a beach chair and your Bible in your car and drive down to the beach Take th e beach chair and the Bible

a new customtailored suit his wife in a mink coat the children shining The businessman pulled an envelope stuffed with money out of his pocket gave it to the priest as a donation in thanks for his

be a great trade But I havent told her that because she has a fairly decent left jab typically to my head I drive a Ford Taurus that has k miles It looks like hell and gets me to where I want to go My wife wants a new Jaguar top of the line faster than a bullet I was telling this story to our WPTF counsel Dan Douglass who asked I dont get it You are drivin g a beat up old Ford and your wife is getting a new Jaguar How does that work Its not too hard to explain You see my wife works in Palo Alto about miles from our house whereas I operate the world headquarters of this pirate trade association from my home office Each work morning we like to arrive at our respective offices at the same time in about seconds Now if that makes sense to you then maybe you can explain how an d why the State of California thinks it can grow MWs of peaker generatio n from seed to flower in five months None of the above has much to do with the electricity crisis but it is a f ar more enjoyable conversation In fact this week needs a good slug of humor Therefore I have expanded the Odds Ends section to include more stories and jokes We deserve it I get about six calls a day from newspaper reporters and they always ask m e at the outset a tough question How are you Im never sure All the other questions are easy but the HowAreYou question usually trips me up One of our members called me and asked if I had heard about Steve Peaces quote placing the Texas State Flag on top of the California State Capital I had but I discouraged the caller from sending Peace a Texas Flag as a prank I suggested instead sending the Senator a pair of boxer briefs wi th the emblem of Texas as the pattern We could put a note in the box Dont put your ass in Texas Does anyone have a connection on where we can get the goods Our Governor and his staff are actively negotiating the purchase of the transmission systems from the states three utilities Today the LA Times reported that PGE is being obdurate whereas SCE and SDGE are being helpf ul in the negotiations Why does this sound familiar to me Most people say the negotiations are stalled The Governor says he will announce a deal today this Friday The Governor and the rest of the world never seem to b e on the same page In the meantime I am learning all about prepetition credit committees an d how they operate My hopes are modest for a clean solution to the financia l woes of the California market On the other hand consider all the new things I am learning For example the difference between a secured and unsecured creditor has become quite clear If you hold a mortgage bond th en you are a secured creditor If you are an electric generator or marketer w ho sold to the ISO or to the PX then you are unsecured If you have a pictur e of a utility executive think male coming out of a motel room with women other than his spouse then you are a secured creditor If you are a consumer taxpayer and a voter then you are screwed As one financial advisor told me there are only two sources of revenue to make up the shortage of money rate increases and the sale of assets Then the advisor said think of the money from those funding sources like water at the top o f Yosemite Falls As the money cascades down like falling water secured creditors are near the top and get very wet Unsecured creditors are near the bottom and might only get some mist in their face It all depends how much water is running over the precipice If the state doesnt offer enough money for the assets then I expect the unsecured creditors will be like Yosemite tourists at the bottom of the Fal ls after a dry summer The mist spray will be a figment of ones imagination If the state condemns the transmission assets then there will be a long an d protracted court settlement regarding the fair market value of the assets Not a good outcome if you were expecting to get paid soon Alternatively i f the state said to all the generators How about on the dollar for each dollar we owe you I doubt there would be many takers The secured creditors by the way are going to be patient so it seems T he bond underwriters place billions of dollars of bond issues and they are no t too excited about upsetting the State of California Could get in the way of future business because the state does issue quite a lot of bonds and the underwriting fees are good So I dont expect the bondholders to pull th e trigger anytime soon If you thought I was drawing a conclusion based on the discussion above th en think again A conclusion is the place where you rest because you got tired of thinking Here is this weeks menu Things in the Peoples Republic of California LA Times Poll Shows We Have Met the Enemy and It Is Us APX Opens Discussions on a New Transmission Market Some Nasty Legislation Responses to Last Weeks Burrito Jobs and People Odds Ends DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD Things in the Peoples Republic of California LA Times Poll Shows We Have Met the Enemy and It Is Us Last Sunday the LA Times published the results of a poll they conducted on Californians all over the state I encourage you to read the survey Its available at newsstatethtm l The bottom line is that Californians are mixed up about the electricity crisis in ways that I could have not predicted For example the Governor gets the highest marks relative to all other players His approval rating has gone up from January approval rating to in February However the approval rating of the PUC is the lowest among the Gov the legislature the utilities and even President Bush The PUC is a tool of the Governor but apparently that is a secret on ly known to the several thousands of us in the regulated power business There there Ms Lynch They really love you but they just dont understand you No telling where merchant generators and power marketers might have placed had our names been on the list although I am sure it would be at the low e nd of the curve More than half of those surveyed do not believe there is an actual shortage of electricity in California The response to that issue was the same last month and has changed very little Can someone explain this attitude to me I dont get it What do you have to do to convince Californians th at we are short on capacity Thirty days in a row of Stage alerts doesnt do it I do not believe that anyone reading the LA Times say on a regular basis for the last month would conclude that there is no electricity shortage That means few people are reading newspapers for their information The rest of the folks get their information from TV word of mouth comic books or Stunning result Oddly enough the public doesnt think too highly of longterm power contracts very little about nuclear power but they do favor by a margin of three out of four more thermal power plants They would be willing to see such facilities built and operating in their own communities In summary the Gov is up the Legislature down the shortage is nonexistent we need more power plants there is a bailout of the utilitie s but that is okay and people are conserving more than ever Is it any wonder then that the legislation we see emanating from the State Capital is so mixed up We are mixed up What are you going to do about us Things in the Peoples Republic of California APX Opens Discussions on a New Transmission Market Automated Power Exchange APX now under the helm of new CEO John Yurkanin held a oneday seminar on the development of a new market to replace the no w defunct PX adjustment bid market Adjustment bids for those of you that d o not trade or schedule in California are economic signals to the ISO about ones willingness to adjust your schedule to satisfy transmission constrain ts at various transmission bottlenecks on the ISOs grid APX has provided us with a thoughtful instrument for managing transmission congestion I attended the meeting and my take away was that APX is proposing an energy market that allows different parties to be matched for the purpose of adjusting energy deliveries on either side of a transmission constraint I t looks very much like the InterSC Adjustment Bid market that market participants so desperately wanted but never received from the ISO The beauty here however is that all the InterSC adjustment bids fall under o ne portfolio APXs that allows the ISO to maintain the market separation constraint Another benefit provided by APXs new market is the scheduling of RMR units John Stremel of APX told us that the CAISO can contribute to the APX market if there is a feature to instruct the RMR units The ISO could place their orders through the APX market if the RMR units are willing to submit adjustment bids in the same So doing would give much needed and now lost price transparency Nothing is free except grief and heartache and we all have enough of that APX needs funders to get their market off the ground I have heard several people grumble about the sales pitch but lets face it We have been complaining for years that the PX was forced on us the ISOs CONG model wa s forced on us and the RMR dispatch was forced on us Now that for the firs t time we have an opportunity to exercise choice I find it ironic that peopl e are fumbling over the dollars The way the ISO is currently handling congestion management with no or few adjustment bids wreaks havoc on the energy markets APX is at least giving us a chance to fix that and do mor e If you support the APX market in concept then call John Stremel and tell h im If money is a problem then call him and tell him that too Lets get creative and demonstrate to those who doubt o ur ability to pull ourselves up by the bootstrap that we are able and willing to do so Things in the Peoples Republic of California Some Nasty Legislation On the heels of the major pieces of legislation enacted in the last few weeks we have the me too bills that are absolutely nauseating Here are short summaries of two legislative turds that simply demonstrate what can occur when you have too many law makers taking on too few crises SB x Speier D This bill would make facilities that have been deemed exempt wholesale generators by FERC become public utilities subject to CPUC jurisdiction It would authorize the CPUC to ensure that generators located in California are operated in a manner that assures their availability to maintain reliability It would allow the CPUC to issue orders and directiv es as it deems necessary to accomplish this It would authorize the CPUC to prevent the exercise of market power by prohibiting economic or physical withholding The bill would also authorize the CPUC to prescribe inspectio n maintenance and operating practices and procedures for any generator to ensure the public health and safety reliability and adequacy of the syste m AB x Herztberg D This bill would require as a condition of receivi ng a CEC certification for new or repower the applicant to offer to sell to California IOUs Municipal utilities or DWR at just and reasonable cost based price electrical power generated from the facility It would also prohibit the operation of the facility until a maintenance and outage schedule has been approved by the CEC A violation of this would be a criminal act Responses to Last Weeks Burrito Always helpful and friendly Ms Sheryl Lambertson from PPL Montana Butte wrote to me about my idea to send Californias teen population to Montana She said I personally invite your son to spend the summer with me However million teenagers in a state with a population of less than a million I think we could potentially have power shortages though Im sure Montana would do a great job of managing them I think we can take on e more teenager but well leave it at that Phil Muller of SCD Solutions offered the following in response to Dr Davis Cure for What Ails Us Now that our distinguished governor has finally announced his plan to save the utilities by taking over their transmission systems in exchange for paying some of their operating expenses I can see the long term plan First continue to stall resolution of the credit situation while generators continue to sell to the ISO with no immediate prospect of getting paid Second cap QF payments at the just and reasonable price of MWh Third offer to bail out all the generator s by having the state pay a portion of what theyre owed in exchange for turning their power plants over to the state It looks like Gray learned business from John D Rockefeller Force your competitors prices below cos t until theyre forced to sell out to you Once you own everything you can s et your own just and reasonable prices depending on whether youre running for election or not This shouldnt be a problem since the state is not subjec t to antitrust laws Longtime friend Bill Metcalfe in Salt Lake City offered the following response to the WPTF sevenpoint solution He wrote Price is always a factor for the individual consumer and some commercial establishments who c an exercise discretionary conservation but may only discourageencourage industrial expansion Price must reflect the pure mechanics of supply and demand Therefore the health of the California economy is closely linked to the ability to build capacity that will yield a price reflective of our desires for industrial competitiveness and growth The more we move to State control and the Governors plan the more difficult this all becomes and the costs well The Dedicated Rate Component DRC should provide the necessary incentive for consumer conservation Industry may just close up shop when seeing thi s and considering the future As you said this is like a hungry monster that chews up politicians an d spits them out after sucking the political marrow from their bones Watch out for quick and seemingly painless fixes the damage of the past ills do es cost Finally I received a very thoughtful note from Nancy Day my personal advisor although she doesnt know that but I listen very closely to everything she tells me You should too Here is what she wrote I want to offer my thoughts on the Governors plan and make a few suggestions When Mike Peevey Note Peevey was Nancys former business partner in the firm New Energy Ventures was named advisor I sent him th e following words of encouragement do no harm Now I ask you will the Governors plan do no harm If the answer is yes work with your members and the utilities to fix the gigantic holes in the cost recovery portion of the plan Although I agree with you that the simplest way to fix what ails us is to allow the utilities to recover their electricity purchase costs evidently that approach carries with it too much political baggage So ho w can we make the Governors plan work Be prepared with talking points that all of your members can use in their discussions with the press with other lobbyists and with the leadership in the legislature Burton Hertzberg et al Here are my suggestions on points you may want to cover How much does the State really believe the utilities are owed for past electricity purchases is the number billion If so what amortizati on period is being assumed in the calculation of the rate increase How much of a rate increase will be required just to cover that past debt Is there enough headroom in the utilities rates to cover the ongoing cost of electricity both the utilities own generation and the DWR purchases that have to be passed on to consumers Since existing rates are predicated on the authorized return on the underlying book value is this number billion of the Transmission assets will the rates have to increase to cover the States capital costs I am assuming that the State will have to pay market value for the purchase of Transmission plus invest another billion to eliminate congestion a nd add transmission where it is needed and the new administrative bureaucracy to oversee their new assets Even with the States lower cost of capital wont rates have to go up to pay off the bonds and pay salaries to the new bureaucrats I am also assuming that the Democrats will not eliminate the existing Union employee infrastructure of the utilities who will maintain t he system under contract to the State and will therefore not save any money on OM The State believes that purchase of the Transmission grid will remove FE RC interference and they can leverage their asset ownership to bring generators to their knees Is this a valid assumption Wont the State have to comply with FERCs Order requiring open accessnondiscrimination I assume the only relief from FERC oversight will come in the form of no rate cases Who will oversee the economics of the new Bureaucracy the CPUC not a chance The EOB The ISO The n ew CUBA Will this new bureaucracy look and feel just like the ISO whose ongoing costs of operation continue to spiral skyward Are there some potential benefits to State ownership of the Transmission grid Will the State be capable of acting more quickly than the utilities that would be forced to litigate potential transmission expansion before on e or more regulatory bodies before any project can go forward Is the State in a better position to work with Transmission builders in Canada and Mexico t o coordinate the expansion of systems there Or like Cal Trans is the Stat e likely to be just as crippled as the utilities because they have their own set of bureaucratic handcuffs that keep progress stifled and slowed If we are going to buy into the Governors plan should we hold out fo r reforms that will be needed to create viable retail competition I am told that the reason the no more direct access provision was added to AB X w as at the insistence of the Department of Finance Finance was afraid that DW R would contract to buy firm energy for Californians and they would abandon the State in favor of a retail competitor One way to resolve this problem is to require very large customers could we define the criteria to stay with their retail competitor for a least months so that DWR will have ample opportunity to adjust their purchases to track the changes Without viable retail competition the utilities must continue to suffer under hindsight reasonableness reviews I believe if customers all customers including residential had viable retail alternatives we could let the utilities buy whatever they wanted and pass those costs through to their customers with no regulatory oversight no profit on generation sales If the utilities retail generation costs get out of line with competitors offers the customers will have the unfettered ability to switch Gary the only way we will be able to survive this next legislative onslaught will be to fix what is wrong It will be impossible to derail th e train Jobs and People I guess one of the low points this week was the letter a number of us received from Green Mountains Julie Blunden In her letter she says Mos t of you aware of the profound changes that have occurred in Californias electricity markets and political stage over the past nine months Those changes have touched our customers our partners and our team I am writing to tell you of my very difficult decision to leave Green Mountain Energy As a result of the state of the market in California our team out here wi ll need to reflect the lower level of market activity At this time its appropriate for me to move on to the next set of challenges It has been my privilege to work with my teammates in California and a pleasure watching o ur company grow and attract a large set of talented people I feel fortunate to be able to hand the baton to Rick Counihan I will be working on the transition with Rick through March th After that you can continue to reach me at or Julie you will be missed I first met you at a PUC all parties meeting wit h Commissioner Conlon way back in or so I cant remember the topic At that meeting you where so soft spoken but nevertheless forceful First impressions being misleading as always I thought you were some kind of tr ee hugger if you know what I mean But over time I found your comments to be truly insightful meaningful interesting and relevant You are a leader and one of the few females besides Avistas Linda Hamilton who likes to tour power plants I hope our professional paths cross again soon Good luck to you in all your endeavors Rob Lamkin of Mirant used to be Southern Energy but now you must learn ho w to pronounce Mirant It sounds like mirror with an ant is searching talented people Rob writes As you know I am looking to hire a few regulatory people Any suggestions Please post in the next Burrito Done buddy Robs phone number is and his email address is Seth Wilson formerly of the Cal PX is looking for employment He is an excellent analyst he has over years experience in electricity and gas market negotiating energy contracts and energy risk management He has bo th municipal and investorowned utility experience in resource planning asset evaluation load forecasting and demandside management He is very effective communicating at all management levels and to present informatio n and recommendations to corporate officers board members and regulators I would encourage anyone interested in talking to Seth to call him at Cell Odds Ends Paul Gribik formerly of Perot Systems and now a consultant with PA Consulting handed me a great compliment He said the Friday Burrito was li ke a breath of fresh air each week He also said the Burrito was like driving on Highway between the Grapevine and Stockton where the only relief from the bleak landscape is the Harris Ranch The Burrito is the Harris Ranch I asked Paul if he wasnt confusing the Harris Ranch with the mountain of cow crap talk about a breath of fresh air miles north of the Harris Ranch in Coalinga He said no The sight and smell of the cow station only remind ed him of things going on in Sacramento Fair enough Sister Camden Collins clipped a good one from USA Today Check it out It was reported in the USA Today that Governor Davis secret weapon in the design of these innovative solutions is Jerry Springer There will be a Jer ry Springer show on the negotiations and resolutions later this month entitled Politicians That Love Mud Wrestling with Themselves Finally my bud from Modesto Ken Weisel sent me this gem with which we wil l close out the week What is electricity Todays scientific question is What in the world is electricity And where does it go after it leaves the toaster Here is a simple experiment that will teach you an important electrical lesson On a cool dry day scuff your feet along a carpet then reach your hand in to a friends mouth and touch one of his dental fillings Did you notice how your friend twitched violently and cried out in pain This teaches us that electricity can be a very powerful force but we must never use it to hurt others unless we need to learn an important electrical lesson It also teaches us how an electrical circuit works When you scuff ed your feet you picked up batches of electrons which are very small objec ts that carpet manufacturers weave into carpet so that they will attract dirt The electrons travel through your bloodstream and collect in your finger where they form a spark that leaps to your friends filling then travels down to his feet and back into the carpet thus completing the circuit AMAZING ELECTRIC FACT If you scuffed your feet long enough without touchin g anything you would build up so many electrons that your finger would explode But this is nothing to worry about unless you have carpeting Although we modern persons tend to take our electric lights radios mixers etc for granted hundreds of years ago people did not have any of these things which is just as well because there was no place to plug them in Then along came the first Electrical Pioneer Benjamin Franklin who flew a kite in a lightning storm and received a serious electrical shock This proved that lightning was powered by the same force as carpets but it also damaged Franklins brain so severely that he started speaking only in incomprehensible maxims such as A penny saved is a penny earned Eventually he had to be given a job running the post office After Franklin came a herd of Electrical Pioneers whose names have become part of our electrical terminology Myron Volt Mary Louise Amp James Wat t Bob Transformer etc These pioneers conducted many important electrical experiments Among them Galvani discovered this is the truth that when he attached two different kinds of metal to the leg of a frog an electrical current developed and the frogs leg kicked even though it was no longer attached to the frog which was dead anyway Galvanis discovery led to enormous advances in the field of amphibian medicine Today skilled veterinary surgeons can take a frog that has been seriously injured or killed implant pieces of metal in its muscles and watch it hop back into the pond just like a normal frog except for the fact that it sinks like a stone But the greatest Electrical Pioneer of them all was Thomas Edison who was a brilliant inventor despite the fact that he had little formal education and lived in New Jersey Edisons first major invention in was the phonograph which could soon be found in thousand of American homes where it basically sat until when the record was invented But Edisons greate st achievement came in when he invented the electric company Edisons design was a brilliant adoption of the simple electrical circuit The electric company sends electricity through a wire to a customer then immediately gets the electricity back through another wire then this is t he brilliant part sends it right back to the customer again This means that an electric company can sell a customer the same batch of electricity thousands of times a day and never get caught since very few customers take the time to examine their electricity closely In fact the last year any new electricity was generated was the electric companie s have been merely reselling it ever since which is why they have so much time to apply for rate increases Today thanks to men like Edison and Franklin and frogs like Galvanis we receive almost unlimited benefits from electricity For example in the pas t decade scientists have developed the laser an electronic appliance so powerful that it can vaporize a bulldozer yards away yet so precise that doctors can use it to perform delicate operations to the human eyeball provided they remember to change the power setting from Vaporize Bulldozer to Delicate DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD Okay Ive got my TV set tuned to vaporize killer tomatoes Have a great weekend gba

did you enjoy this week Unlike default electric service when it comes to California disasters you have a wide range of choices among competing options For example there was the Governor our Governor preaching the gospel among the Democratic Governors in Washington DC and the financial analysts in New York City In Sacramento there was Senate Energy Committee hearings And from the poiso n tipped pens of the Department of Market Analysis at the ISO there was a report that I can assure you will stir the pot Which event was your favorite This was a Holy Week of sorts for Catholics Tuesday was Fat Tuesday an d Wednesday was Ash Wednesday I saw a married couple in Starbucks on Wednesday night that had ashen smudges on their forehead At a distance I wasnt sure about the marking At first I only saw the woman waiting for h er coffee order I assumed she was marked as an Untouchable you know the Indian type although she looked more Eastern European than Indian You never know I couldnt figure out how her marking was so indistinct becaus e the Untouchable tattoo is a very bright color It wasnt until I saw her husband also marked on his forehead in the same way that I realized the meaning of the symbol the day and its significance When I lived in Chicago a long time ago and worked downtown in the Loop I would see thre e out of four adults either at work or on the street with the Ash Wednesday indicia on their forehead I havent seen the same interest in religious practice for all the years I have lived in California Amazing the thing s one can learn while sipping a Grande Nonfat Chai Tea at Starbucks Do you think there could be one day a year where people would wear the following insignia on their forehaead IMAGE I dont often go to Starbucks at night A caffeine beverage keeps me awake However when my son is at his icehockey practice in Belmont visiting the local coffeehouse in order to kill time is just too tempting I watch people sip coffee and hunt for a used newspaper to read For some reason last Wednesday evening I checked my voice mail just in case someone left me a message about a mistake in my favor on my bank account Instead a reporter from the Orange County Register called me at pm and asked me to return his call Having nothing better to do than watch people take communion at the coffee bar and contemplate how Untouchable tattoos can tur n gray I called the reporter He answered the phone He wanted to know my meaning your reaction to the ISOs study to be filed at FERC explaining h ow generators have overcharged the ISO relative to their likely operating cost s for real time energy The amounts of the overcharges for December and Janua ry are alleged in the study to be hundreds of millions of dollars As always I was equipped with sufficient ignorance to provide a meaningful quote I said Huh He went on Did I think the study was politically motivated by the Governo r Davis handpicked ISO Governing Board This time I nailed the answer I said What Actually I backed away from entangling myself in the finger pointing game It was tempting to indulge I might add but I didnt do it I said No the politics wouldnt change this outcome The ISO has a righ t to ask for an audit of the bids and they did Simple Maybe Im right or maybe Im wrong Who knows Last week I received an email from ISO Governing Board member Michael Pet er Florio a cat I long ago nicknamed Old Deuteronomy for reasons I can no longer remember Deut responded to a comment I made to him that Mr Florio is the most senior and knowledgeable member of the ISO Governing Board Th at isnt surprising I told Deut but it does speak volumes about the current Boards composition Deut wrote back Thats comforting I think I trie d to make the point after Kent Palmerton Williams Energy spoke at the last public comment period that I want to hear what people think about issues coming up at the ISO even if requires use of personal email to bypass the ISO Despite all the anguished rhetoric we all have to live together wor k together and understand each other going forward Deut asked me to put that in the Burrito so I did But as Governors go it gives me a heartache to listen to our State Governor This man is a oneact disaster I suppose we Californians get what we deserve The Govs comment this week to a group in Washington DC floored me He said and I am not making this up that California is on th e backside of the electricity crisis problem I thought that comment deserve d some special attention When a San Francisco Chronicle reporter asked for m y opinion I couldnt shut up I exclaimed Backside of the problem No I think we are on the dark side of the moon If we dont turn this thing around there wont be any light Huff and puff Bankruptcy or not to bankrupt that is the question Here is my take on th e issue this week By next week I should have an entirely different answer If PGE folds that is accepts a deal with the State to sell its transmissi on assets then it would appear as if the utilities are serious about remainin g financial whole and working out their payments with creditors Clearly there is many a slip tween the cup and the lip Creditors could demand mo re than the utilities have received from the sale of the assets My crude analysis suggests that after the utilities pay off the bonds and obligation s secured by the transmission assets there might not be enough money to cove r the outstanding balances with the unsecured creditors The remaining open question then is will the PUC allow as a cost the pass through of additional revenue requirements to fully cover the amounts owed It seems these days the PUC can do and does anything it wants with or without leg al procedure Of course most of what they do make things worse but hey th at is why we have a PUC I noticed that the PUC informed the world that any power purchases made by DWR will be deemed just and reasonable Now why couldnt they say the same thing to the utilities for their longterm power purchase deals Lets put some hot coffee on the burner and see what we can brew Things in the Peoples Republic of California Community Choice may be a Savior of Direct Access And the Award for the Silliest Bill Goes to ABX Creditors Committee for Power Marketers Out of State Generators and Public Power Entities Jobs and People Odds Ends DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD Things in the Peoples Republic of California Community Choice may be a Savior of Direct Access ABx suspended all new direct access customers in California until the DW R no longer purchases energy This will occur when our grandchildren graduat e from college Although clean up legislation has been suggested to reverse this crippling effect of ABx I am not hopeful Alas our friend from Local Power Paul Fenn located in Oakland has found at long last a sponso r for his proposed bill to allow communities to select energy providers other than the incumbent utilities Here are the details Assemblywoman Carole Migden DSan Francisco announced her sponsorship of the California Community Choice bill drafted by Local Power last year on February A hearing will be announced shortly and could be as early as next week Local Power has also submitted an amendment to ABx to facilitate distributed generation in urban areas such as solar wind small hydro fuel cells etc This amendment will be heard at the same time This bill would allow a city for example to assign power on a real time basis from a solar cell or other local generation at one location in a city to load points elsewhere in the city on the same distribution system The languag e would enable many forms of distributed generation to develop but would be particularly valuable for Community Choice cities to jumpstart large scale urban solar wind fuel cell small hydro and other local power projects Community Choice is the solution to Californias failure to implement retai l access in any meaningful way Local governments are authorized to aggregate all market nonparticipants in their jurisdictions into citynegotiated contracts much like cable television or garbage services have been negotiated for decades but with an optout clause for consumers who are ab le to participate directly in the market Groups of contiguous municipalities may join together and county governments may coordinate consenting municipalities in regional power contracts Things in the Peoples Republic of California And the Award for the Silliest Bill Goes to ABX Each week our State Legislators try to outdo each other I think they meet at a local watering hole in Sacramento and dare each other to see who can come up with the most absurd emergencysession energy bill We have a new winner Assembly Member La Suer and it is called ABx Here is what th is odious piece of legislation is all about ABX attempts to criminalize acts of unregulated generators if they perform maintenance at times other than the California Public Utilities Commission requires Further the commission is required to allow scheduled maintenance of only one generator at a time I can hear you outofstate Burrito readers howling with laughter slapping your thighs and shaking your heads Hey Joe listen to this A guy name d La Sewer is forcing generators to be out on maintenance only one at a time I admit there is a certain amount of disbelief that anyone who can read write and run for the California Assembly could actually craft this bill If you want to have some fun then in the above paragraph replace the word maintenance with the word sex and the word generator with utility executives We might call MiltonBradley to see if they want a piece of the action on our new game Well call it Legendary Shall we analyze the impacts Lets see there are about major generators in the state That means if you own one of those puppies you c an go down for maintenance once every ten years That works for me It reminds me of a story about the communist government that once ruled the USSR A Russian asks a plumber when he can come to this house to fix a leak The plumber opens his appointment book and says The soonest I can fit you in Comrade is in February What day asks the Russian The plumber rubs his chin and contemplates an answer February he answers Morning or afternoon asks the Russian Afternoon answers t he plumber Good says the Russian with a sigh of relief the electrician is coming in the morning The bill if enacted will allow generators to be out for maintenance durin g the peak season which is rapidly becoming all year long in California Well I would like you people to do me a favor Lets play the same game that the Legislators like to play in Sacramento Think of the most outrageous legislation you can imagine and write it down on a piece of paper Wait a few weeks and I bet you will see legislation proposed in California that makes your suggestion look pale in comparison Stick aroun d here long enough and either you are nuts or you will be Things in the Peoples Republic of California Creditors Committee for Power Marketers Out of State Generators and Public Power Entities Several goodnews points to tell you regarding the formation of a creditor s committee for those among you who are feeling disenfranchised Worry not You are in good company The WPTF Board this week provided guidelines for your favorite executive director to apply his organizational skills to facilitate the development o f a creditors committee I have targeted WPTF members who either have expressed an interest in joining a committee or those who might be among unsecured creditors that want to protect their ability to recover amounts owed to them by PGE and SCE through the ISO and the PX Any creditors committee so developed will be independent and unaffiliated with WPTF Tha t is understandable and necessary so that WPTFs status as a taxexempt trade association is not effected with credit issues of individual members I have talked to many outofstate generators power marketers and instat e public power agencies about the formation of a committee and the interest is very high Here is why If SCE and PGE both strike deals with the state to sell their transmission assets to raise some or all of the cash to pay back due amounts there is an increasing likelihood that the debtors the utilities will try to stave off bankruptcy A creditors committee is ver y valuable in that instance A committee of likeminded creditors with similar objectives will give participants a window and a voice into the disbursement of payments the debtors will make to all creditors Saybrook Capital will represent the interests of the committee once formed Saybrook will seek recognition of the committee from the debtors and becom e a pipeline of information between the creditors and the debtors and vice versa If there is any member among our group who I have not talked to an d thinks your interests would be aligned with the targeted participants eith er give me a call or send me an email I will be happy to provide you with t he information you need to participate An organizational meeting of the committee is scheduled for the middle of next week If your company or organization is unable to join a creditors committee now but might be abl e to in the future then there should be no problem Being involved with the committee at the front end provides participants with an opportunity to cra ft the objectives and goals of the group Participation at a later date shoul d be open For information

was a close one Favre threw the ball down field to his favorite receiver last Monday night Antonio Freeman in what turned out to be the last play of the game in overtime Vikings defenseman Dishman flicked the ball up in the air Freeman went to the ground but the ball landed on Freemans back It slid down Freemans jersey and as he turned to look the ball gently poured into Freemans waiting open hands The ball and Freeman made a fair catch and a quick trip to the end zone Game over Packers won That was the closest and best ending to a football game I can recall in a long time Otherwise it was a hohum week Oh yah The State of California held its oneparty election last Tuesday and all members of that party won I think There is no Republican Party anymore in California Those politicians have been exported like our instate electrons under pricecaps to Arizona or Nevada The radical minority is now firmly in place This will make powerrelated legislation a hoot in the coming legislative session A vetoproof Assembly and Senate with a billion surplus Jeez What would you care to bet that we dont see one nickel of that billion in tax reductions You know were in trouble when Lady Bird Bowen and Steve Peace claim that they are each to the far right of their Democratic colleagues Speaking of Mr Peace we had a chance to meet for the first time and have a real conversation It was in Washington DC a good neutral turf at the hotel where quite a few other Californians and I were staying We were attending FERCs technical conference on the Order issued last week It was all an accident I suppose I was sipping a brewski with CMUAs Tony Braun in the hotel bar I was explaining to Tony what a terrible thing it was for CMUA to support a return to cost of service rates and what are we going to do about the ISOs GMC filing In walks Peace and his legislative aide John Rozsa So being a nice guy I utilized your hardearned WPTF dues and bought them both a drink A bloody Mary for Rozsa and decaf coffee for the Senator Twoandonehalf hours later we were still drinking and talking I hate to admit it but I had a good time Why do you call John Fielder The Great Warrior Peace asked me after I shared with him my nickname for JF I told him the story skipping all the nicknames handed out in past Burritos to the two gentlemen in my then present company A lot of what we discussed Peace repeated to the FERC Commissioners the next day Below I review the logic of his case concerning the future of Californias restructured power industry For the first time I see the method in his madness He takes a very political view of things which means economics and physics dont hold a candle to political factors We also talked about the power business movie production Attack of the Killer Tomatoes V is coming out soon I asked wasnt ATKT I through IV enough He said he was going to keep on doing it until he got it right I offered that that was exactly what Glen Campbell said when he married his fifth wife Dennis Miller on Monday Night Football we dont like DM on MNF and why he ever took an interest in the power industry answer he goes into it and out of our industry from time to time just for a visit And at the moment I am working on the Burrito in my DC hotel room watching the clock advance into the wee hours of the night Whats a Thursday night without a Burrito to write I wont finish this weeks edition on time I only have my travel computer with me So the Burrito will go out Friday or Saturday Be patient and dont get pushy If its going to take another week to declare George W the new President assuming the Florida vote remains stable then you can wait a day or two for the Burrito By the way Last weeks Burrito was a great companion for those of you without much humor in your life Pity Many of the newer readers lapped up the ISO Going Out of Business items One reader wanted to know if they could purchase the Market Power Exercise Bike in California export to Oregon where it sells for ten times the price and then bring it back in the State I said you could do that but it would be wrong I would report that person to the Market Surveillance Committee and as punishment that person would have to read every document the ISOs Department of Market Analysis ever wrote Some arent even colored in yet Here is this weeks menu Things at the FERC A Day at the FERC The Mailbag Odds Ends Things at the FERC A Day at the FERC There is one thing you have to give the FERC Commissioners They put in a full day and more when they hold one of these touchy feely meetings at their headquarters in Washington DC From am to pm they kept up the QA panel after panel What was accomplished Again it is hard to say because I had trouble reading the will of the Commissioners based on body language or questions they posed to the panelists The four Commissioners gave little hint of what was on their minds and you wonder what they were absorbing I did notice that all four Commissioners reviewed any and all written material presented by the panelists I couldnt figure out how they were able to read listen and ask questions simultaneously The highlight of the day unquestionably was our California Delegation of Lynch Keese Kahn Peace Bowen and a Republican supervisor from the County of San Diego They brought with them a video address from Governor Gray Davis I dont know how to describe the video but I will try Imagine a talking head with hands behind a desk with the American and California flags in the background Imagine the Gov castigating the FERC Commissioners for not following through with their jobs after claiming that wholesale markets are dysfunctional and that wholesale power rates are unjust and unreasonable Imagine this State official verbally whipping the Gang of Four for not ordering refunds Imagine the Gangs surprise to hear the Gov tell them that reappointment of the ISO Governing Board members is not within FERCs jurisdiction THEN imagine the same Gov camera close up smiling and ending with Other than that youre a pretty nice group of people That was the States opening to the FERC The crowd first stunned roared with laughter Was this intentional or an outtake some one slipped into the tape Well never know Steve Peace went into his explanation about the facts of life Listen The political landscape of California has changed It is wildly liberal nee socialist If there is another summer of price spikes like last summer with the very real possibility that both SCE and PGE will be done with their respective rate freezes then over million electric customers will be susceptible to damagingly high rates The populace will revolt A ballot initiative not unlike the failed Prop will appear in November of and the Governor running for reelection will support the proposition The proposition will also be supported by the three underpinnings of the Democratic Party labor minorities and environmentalists The proposition may require that all IOU assets be condemned by the State including the output of the divested power plants The proposition will pass and like all good propositions will be challenged in court The court case will lead to a settlement whereby consumers and generators will rearrange the money transfer between buyers and sellers and FERC will sit idly by as over fifty percent of the generation assets in the West are controlled by the State of California Stuff that in your RTO pipe Does Senator Peace think this is a good idea No Does he think it is politically possible Yes Why He refers to a landmark case he calls Texaco vs Federal Power Commission as the case which makes this a slam dunk I am not familiar with this case but we have plenty of Burrito readers who might Educate us please and give us your assessment In any event the whole kit and caboodle will end up in a court challenge and if FERC wants to avoid the ballot initiative and the challenge FERC should retroactively order the refunds from the generators because the FERC has deemed wholesale rates to be unjust and unreasonable Now whether or not I agree with the Peaces scenario and Lady Bird Bowen nodded to it too the logic isnt flawed The premises may be but not the logic I think a ballot initiative to wipe out the competitive market is likely regardless of what FERC does or doesnt do The UDCs wont object Their stranded costs will be paid and what the heck maybe they can return to the days of rateofreturn regulation The unions will love it no doubt because it implies jobs Minorities will support it no doubt because the havenots need to stop the alleged gouging by the generators Environmentalists will be stuck between a rock and a hard place They want conservation and demand management which you dont get without market prices Environmentalists may be iffy DKNY give us your opinion That was the card the California Delegation played upon FERCs table I didnt see one FERC Commissioner blink I didnt see one person on our side blink either I can tell you why I think this plan wont work But that isnt important Whats important is that each of you understands the logic that drives the scenario Ballot initiatives are a California specialty So we are faced with the stark reality of having to face an initiative in two years that is challangeable time consuming and expensive Impossible Maybe maybe not Mr Florio of TURN made comments early in the day one of which suggested that if FERC orders the ISO stakeholder Governing Board to be replaced thats good he says then the State and FERC should compromise on a board with a mix of State and techno interests In other words lets keep the EOBs finger in the ISO pie Without a negotiation on Governing Board replacement there will be a long legal wrangle that will leave the ISO rudderless To this I responded on my panel as did others there is no way FERC can allow a compromise That would put the same problems before the Commission at a later date Its Governance more so than market structure In fact you could summarize the three competing theses about the problems in California thusly Governance first and market structure second thats us I believe or market structure first and Governance second SEMPRA TURN fellow travelers or the hell with both Governance and market structure just force the generators to refund the alleged excesses Peoples Republic Of course there was plenty of discourse on the Orders proposed price cap of I think FERC got the usual amount of confusing signals from all parties Some say the cap is too high some say too low some say just right and some say to hell with price caps just force the generators to refund the alleged excesses Peoples Republic The Commissioners ended the long day with a series of questions they would like respondents to address in their November nd written comments What should the CPUC do either on its own or in conjunction with FERC to establish policies that provide for UDC reasonableness for cost recovery if the UDCs procure power from a supplier other than the PX Day Ahead market What is the definitive story as to the price spike in California this summer given all the information on generating costs opportunity costs etc How did we get to the prices to which we observed This was Hoeckers question and I find it disturbing because the FERC staff report did a great job I thought explaining the factors What more does he want What are peoples observation regarding the division of responsibilities between FERC and the CPUC in handling Californias wholesale bulk power market What should be the selection process to replace the ISO and PX Governing Boards that will avoid the resurrection of the influences currently found among the stakeholder boards What should FERC do as an alternative to the price cap and how should FERC evaluate bids above the cap level Should the ISO be rid of the secondprice auction How can FERC move California into the regional power market of the West Did FERC get it right when they specified a replacement board for the ISO and PX of members From the Mailbag I got a lot of mail on last weeks stuff A lot and I love it It means I have to create less original tripe and at the same time allow you all to educate the rest of the group For example BPAs Don Wolfe wrote Putting price caps in place until the market is proved to be competitive is like nailing your foot to the floor until you prove you can dance Jim Kritikson had some interesting comments about the FERC Order He said p FERC Order elimination of the requirement for balanced schedules p We therefore direct the ISO and the PX to pursue establishing an integrated day ahead market in which all demand and supply bids are addressed in one venue These items seem to call for an ISO dayahead integrated dispatch In fact this goes further then elimination of the market separation constraint that was previously discussed That is it would seem to say it is OK for you to send in a demand schedule with no supply and a bid indicating how much you are willing to pay via your adjustment bid and the ISO will find a suitable supply for you p Therefore we will require that the proposal at a minimum include a meaningful number of zones that significantly address congestion on the system In this regard we also require that the proposal provide a comparison with a nodal energy price proposal ie locational marginal prices for each bus or node on the grid We also expect the ISO to conduct a periodic annual review to evaluate the accuracy of the zones for congestion management This seems to send a fairly strong signal that nodal pricing is the standard to be met Is your model as good as nodal Do you suppose the single price at each node is also subject to the soft and hard price cap Re transparency the impact on congestion pricing of the soft price cap does not seem have been considered At present the Usage Charge is the difference in zonal energy prices In the future it may not be Consider the following The soft cap is hit in both zones so the PX price is in both the NP and SP zones but the Usage Charge is set by a inc bid in the north and a dec bid in the south The PX is sending MW from south to north and must pay in congestion rents So there is a Usage Charge to go between zones with the same energy price Of course this is not limited to the PX The same situation would apply to the ISO in real time It looks like uplifts will be needed to collect the rents Where and how the rent is collected will become very important Preserving locational signals will be a challenge under these conditions Harry Singh of PGE National Energy Group also chimed in on the inference in the Order to the elimination of market separation in forward markets He said You could interpret this in more than one way For example you can interpret it as the end of balanced schedules and giving the ISO a new role in operating the dayahead energy market Id think thats more significant than imposing LMP and spells the end of the market structure we have in California You can also take a weaker interpretation and assume they are talking about market separation in congestion management Maybe this is the more likely explanation but they should probably have included it in the section on congestion reform Our resident environmentalist Dan Kirshner NoYes wrote to us that On the new ISO and PX Boards note that FERC says nothing about how those six new Board members will be replaced Nor do I see any reason for optimism that the EOB is out of the picture here Wont the state assert at least this authority You seem to ascribe more meaning than I do to the soft cap It cannot be an attempt to hold bids below The number is simply too low especially when youre trying to attract new capacity as all the rhetoric proclaims More likely its an attempt to be seen as doing something rather than nothing Like a parents lame all right but NEXT time You probably know how effective THAT is At first I thought as I may have mentioned that the pay as bid above approach was a clever response to the supposed game where a bidder with multiple plants would bid a few of them high in an effort to set the MCP and the rest low insuring that they wouldnt get shut out of high prices if their high bids didnt get selected The only odd part to me was that no one has yet claimed that this game is whats actually going on It reminds me of one of the audio messages my wife has attached to mouse events on her computer They are based on the old Frankenstein movies Opening a program causes Dr Frankenstein to exclaim Give my creation life Very appropriately applied to most computer work and now to FERCs work when you close a program the voice intones Youve accomplished nothing fool I tried to dissuade Dan from including in the Burrito the mouse event which I thought was hilarious He insisted stating that No This is a tying arrangement You have to use the mouse trigger stuff So I did Finally one reader who shall remain anonymous wrote Okay I definitely want the Market Power Exercise Bike havent been out very much lately and dont want to put on those dreaded holiday pounds between fruitcake and latkes But the price is somewhat foggy what if I buy it in state export it and then send it back in under a different name Ill also take one of the Singing the Blues by Loretta and Michael but I was hoping it included a song that should be so near and dear to our hearts Folsom Prison Blues but maybe thats on their best of album along with Achy Breaky Heart Anyway the ISO attire for sale is really last years fashion and you know I would not be caught dead in anything outdated But by the looks of the last Board meeting Im sure youll have plenty of takers You know I just need to be more careful with the distribution of these Burritos When I walked into the hearing room at FERC this week about a dozen people said hello and jumped right into a discussion about Burrito busters Keep in mind it was am my time Can we talk Another anonymous writer penned the following the FERC order makes it clear that FERC doesnt see California as big enough to be an RTO Installing an independent board is problematic given SB unless CalISO goes regional So what if Desert Star offered up its man board CalISO added Terry and a seventh independent director and the two finally consolidated The current ISO Board and the DS advisory committee could be trimmed and consolidated as the advisory group But wouldnt this be an opportune time The DS guys could be more assured of not being run over if their board is installed They havent created an infrastructure or software and CalISO needs to redo a bunch of stuff Could it be a winwin Nothing out here is winwin Its loselose Odds Ends Back in California after a long flight home Its raining My son is playing guitar in his room because today he doesnt have school For him it is a holiday I forgot What are holidays A number of you folks called me after the FERC Conference yesterday The item you most wanted to talk about was the dialogue between Steve Peace and Commissioner Hebert Hebert became quite upset with our Senator Hebert doesnt like being interrupted with comments such as The Governor wasnt including you in his comment when he said Youre a great group of people After the bantering went back and forth Hebert frustrated and feeling that the seriousness of the Commission was impugned by Peaces behavior threw up his arms and uttered Im not going to debate with you anymore Its a waste of time My panel was next on so when the California Delegation was dismissed I walked over to my spot on the panels table Peaceman was grabbing his suitcase and making a run for the exit I told him Ill mop this up for you man stick with me I mean what are friends for The Great Warrior was on my panel He was great as always When Dan Larcamp of the FERC staff asked a question comparing wholesale rates in California to UDC generation rates The Great One responded that if you take out the QF payments the frozenrate generation component for SCE was about kwh I shot back you have to include the QF payments Those are fixed capital costs in the SCE portfolio that SCE charges its retail customers The number for Edison is kWh And MWh is for all months since competition began in except the last four months higher than the wholesale prices have been The Great One didnt lose a moment and said on the record Gary is right It would be seven cents And that is what I love about this business You can sit with a group of people ususally men sip some coffee or some beer you tell each other lies That is how you become good friends Here is this weeks cookie Its

<5083625.1075843152170.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,foothill@lmi.net,2000-11-18 05:59:00,WPTF Sunday Wee the People BurritoFRIDAY BURRITO If you arent confused then you dont understand the problem At first I refused to deliver this Burrito until the next President is elected But I eventually gave up How much longer will this craziness go on The events are firmly stitched into the fabric of our culture now and for decades hence You cant go to a conference nor have a casual conversation with someone without the topic arising Columnist Dave Berry had the best solution to fix the Florida ballots Put a picture of each candidate on the ballot give the voter a handheld hole punch and punch out the eyes of the candidate for whom you wish to vote Naturally there would be squabbles about double punching holes that didnt penetrate the picture hence the intent to vote and all the other particulars which disqualify a ballot Speaking of elected officials Governor Davis redelivered his message to FERC this week live and in person in San Diego He spoke to three of the FERC Commissioners in San Diego Ms Breathitt being absent I wasnt there but I heard the reports of those who were The reactions ranged from so whats new to this is good news The Gov reiterated the request for refunds I dont think that is good news and I dont think the State has a legal prayer to order such One power marketer in the Pacific Northwest not a WPTF member but who soon will be called me to ask if he was going to lose his bonus because the State was going to order refunds from generators and power marketers If Mr Davis wants to settle nerves of the investment community then this isnt the way to do it The Gov also endorsed the implementation of loaddifferentiated price caps Read our lips Mr Gov Price caps dont work and loaddifferentiated price caps damage markets They throw unnecessary burdens on the settlement of transactions and would all but effectively kill longterm forward contracts Forward contracts seem to the be the preferred way to solve Californias problems assuming the PUC doesn t give blanket reasonableness to any and all contracts There must be appropriate mechanisms for the PUC to provide incentives for the UDCs to procure prudently and to avoid selfdealing with their nonregulated subsidiaries Clue license the utility owned plants to be Exempt Wholesale Generators under the Energy Policy Act of The Gov also claimed that he supports competitive markets but that the markets are dysfunctional at present and need time to mature and work out the severe demandsupply imbalance Mr Gov is taking quite a risk that the investment community will continue to invest while he tries to cap prices I dont think this is a wise bet but on the other hand it is his political future at risk not mine Once upon a time Mr Peace unsuccessfully tried to tame the power market hoping it would be an arrow in his political quiver He thought it would be both fun and expedient I my estimation the ploy exploded in his hands and sullied his reputation Mr Gov is headed in the same direction It will only take one small slip and then he will be trying eagerly to cleanse himself of the power dilemma I dont think Davis advisor on energy matters is at all up to the task of protecting his boss I wonder how you folks outside of California feel about this I mean California politics are definitely having an effect on your ability to transact business in the West I guess that is the way it goes Mr Davis doesnt need to solve Californias power problem to be reelect ed Governor He is a shoo in best I can tell and given the political leanings of the State He is staging himself as a presidential candidate As such he must appear to be fixing problems of a much larger scale and guess what shows up on his radar screen If the market survives the purge then the Gov and all the other politicians will take credit for saving the world I had the privilege of speaking at two seminars this week both hosted by New West Energy and one taped investigative interview at the local NBC station in San Francisco The speaking engagements gave me an opportunity to test sound bites on real humans and I am relaxing the definition of human a bit to include TV reporters I was pleased with the outcome The public speeches were in Oakland and Irvine respectively When I arrived at the hotel in Oakland Enron Energy Services also was having a customer seminar just down the hall I walked over to their room to see if I could get my speakers fee bid up from Guess who was in front of Enrons very packed room Sue Mara one of our Board members She like I in the adjoining room started our presentation lamenting the political stew in which our restructured power industry currently simmers Great minds think alike The fact that two ESPs were holding customer meetings simultaneously might signal a longawaited turn around in the business Have we reached the ebb of ESP existence I dont know Here are the themes that I believe struck a chord with the audiences and I hope with the investigative report First California started the restructuring process from a system of regulated costbased rates that was controlled by a few people the utilities the PUC and not very many others The fewpeople system responded to the Arab Oil Embargo crises in the early s by dumping tons of money into renewable energy and signing longterm QF deals that embedded oilprice escalators that assumed bbl a decade hence Add a nuclear unit into the portfolio and the sum of those brilliant decisions led to California retail rates being higher than the national average The response to higher prices led to a better idea That is marketbased rates that come from competition could be utilized to pay off the egregious excesses of the past and open up the system to all who both desired and could chart their own energy future It would either erase or significantly lessen the influence of the fewpeople system and replace that old system with a well populated manyagent paradigm eg ISO PX scheduling coordinators direct access customers merchant generators etc After almost three years of the manypeople competitive system where not too many people opted for direct access but we sure populated those stakeholder governing boards now didnt we the situation remains problematic Some would say the current dilemma is a signal that competition cant work that is until we have either more supply or more demand response or both and we would be better off if everyone had stable costbased rates just like the good ol days THEN I ask do you believe that giving back the power grid to the control of a few will solve todays problems or do you think a market based approach will more quickly resolve the supplydemand imbalance If you dont want to make choices about your energy future then give Mr Davis and the UDCs your support They will gladly turn back the hands of the clock If you want the freedom to make economic choices then speak out publicly regarding your support for continuing the competitive markets for power Using the latter approach lower prices will come about much quicker The problems we have are difficult but not impossible to fix Sermon is over Here is what is on this weeks agenda Things in the Peoples Republic of California WPTF Written response to the FERC Order of November ISO files GMC Unbundled Rates Data Subpoena for WPTF No Joke Some responses to last weeks Burrito questions Things in the Peoples Republic of California WPTF Written response to the FERC Order of November Everyone I talk to is preparing written comments to FERCs Order of November Or at least it seems that way Did you know that FERCs Order was immediate in that the time clock for notice started on November I dont understand why we are providing written comments to the Order unless amendments to the Order can be implemented without disturbing the initial time clock WPTF plans to file a substantive document It seems this venue is the appropriate one for laying out our version of the epic The Order you know never says that wholesale power rates are unjust and unreasonable It says that the markets rules that led to high prices are unjust and unreasonable It sounds a little like reading between the lines so it would be helpful if FERC clarifies someday exactly what it meant We will also highlight the fact that FERC should encourage California to pursue competition for UDC procurement of forward energy The markets need price transparency Regulators and market participants should know the prices within a reasonable time after bilateral contracts are signed Third if FERC is going to understand the story of why prices rose dramatically in California then the generation component of the UDCs frozen rates needs to be compared to the monthly wholesale power rates since competition began We calculated and reported such to FERC in our October reply to the PGE and SCE emergency petitions In all but the last five months the UDC generation component average of kWh was higher than the monthly wholesale power rates How is this a dysfunctional market if it has worked so well prior to May of this year And isnt it still working well given the cost factors are continuing to escalate such as natural gas price and Nox emission credits And from where did approximately onehalf of the stranded cost get collected if not from the headroom between wholesale power prices and the UDC fixed generation component Fourth there is absolutely no room for a compromise solution on governance of the ISO and the PX The CPUC should have no authority over Californias wholesale power markets The stakeholder boards must disband and be replaced per FERCs recommended method Further the CEOs of each institution respectively and without the approval of the stakeholder boards should write the job descriptions for the consultants who will be retained to create the slate of suitable candidates Unless FERC rids the ISO of pestering State influence we are never going to have wellfunctioning wholesale markets in California or the West Consumers are affected by wholesale prices in power as in all commodities and consumables However that doesnt mean consumers representatives vis a vis the State have jurisdiction over the regulation of the markets that govern the rules for those markets It is impossible for any California consumer to request of the ISO any of the ISOs services Consumers must make those requests through certified FERCregulated agents called Scheduling Coordinators FERC should take note that singlestate RTOs are an anathema to FERCs policy interes ts and the promotion of competitive markets as directed in FERCs Orders and Fifth the proposed soft price cap is an inferior solution compared to mandating prescheduling of load and supply in forward markets Caps distort markets and discourage both new supply and demand responses Forward agreements can settle jittery nerves by locking in firm prices during volatile price periods The remaining volume left to spotmarket purchase would be less damaging to consumers even if prices reach extremely high levels The weighted average price of forward and spot purchases would be easily more digestible to the public relative to gobbling down the spot price every day Both the PX block forward and overthecounter markets amply provide evidence to that effect With sufficient forward contracting no price caps are necessary If there is a price cap as proposed by FERC then FERC should reduce the time under which the bids over or whatever the cap happens to be are subject to refund Sixth robust retail competition is the key to solving the States woes The State should separate the default customer provision by the UDCs and FERC should encourage the State to take that step Mr Hoecker asked at the San Diego hearing for parties to comment on how more ESPs could enter the California market Consumers want rate stability of that there is little argument It boils down to the choice of either saddling the UDCs with the procurement responsibility or putting large vs small core vs noncore consumers in charge of their own energy procurement Today the TRA balances of the UDCs are bursting with liabilities because the UDCs are unable to raise their rates to collect the different between the frozen generation component and the wholesale rate The State regulatory system will never move quick enough to balance these procurement accounts within a reasonable time As a result we have the UDCs playing the begging game for rate relief It would make far more sense to reduce or eliminate the UDCs responsibility to be the default provider Things in the Peoples Republic of California ISO

inches thick in two separate volumes Although thick the filing does not include the budget numbers for Year I have heard and read in independent reports that the GMC budget will escalate or so to cover the ISOs operating costs Is it true the ISO ties the escalation of the GMC to the earnings of the UDCs I just wonder how that mechanism works Hence the unbundling of the GMC into cost components is the essence of the filing The ISO develops billing determinants for ISO services into three buckets controlarea and scheduling interzonal scheduling and market operations billing and settlements The reason WPTF will intervene in this matter is that also at stake is the refund we have sought for the different GMC rates applied at the start of the market for some of the public power and municipal loads in PGEs service territory Our petition on this issue dates back almost two years and the refunds may reach back almost as long So I thought it would be a good idea to alert you to the fact that three big things are coming down the road One the ISO has filed for an unbundled GMC rate that is split into three buckets of costs Two WPTF will be seeking to collect the refund for the difference in GMC application to different types of load And three very soon most likely in December the ISO will file its budget estimates for and I expect you all to go berserk when you see that Just a little preparation thats all Things in the Peoples Republic of California Data Subpoena for WPTF No Joke Last week I received a telephone call from the local branch of the State Attorneys

General office would ask me what I was thinking on any given day I cant wait for them to see copies of the Burritos That will tie them up for a good long time I find the data subpoena both offensive and a badge of honor Why should we be left out when all of you folks have had to put up with the same I play the martyr well It is a sad state of affairs and I guess the best thing for us to do is answer all the questions to the best of our ability On the other hand it will cost us more than a handful of dollars to prepare the data Phew What an odor Things in the Peoples Republic of California Some responses to last weeks Burrito questions Last week I wrote about the likelihood of a ballot initiative in California to eliminate competition in the electric industry I mentioned that Environmentalists will be stuck between a rock and a hard place They want conservation and demand management which you dont get without market prices Environmentalists may be iffy Our resident environmentalist Dan DKNY Kirshner gave us his opinion on the matter Iffy is the right word Some of us consider the late searly s the good old days when there were significant utility energy efficiency programs absent one may note market prices And we are reluctant to fight the tide whether the tide is going with or against a market But I think reality dictates that the grander schemes reregulation new state energy utilities etc are unlikely at best and that markets can help us imagine that charging customers the marginal cost of resource use This is all of course a topic of active discussion Think default provider I think this is the most productive area to work on there may be room for agreement across a wide range of parties Odds Ends Blessed events are all over the place First our congratulations to Rob Lamkin Chair of WPTF as well as VP at Southern Energy Rob is the proud father of a new baby girl Jessa Nicole who was born last Monday Everyone in the family is doing well we are happy to report The WPTF family is growing too At last weeks Board meeting Constellation Power Source became our th Board member Constellation is a subsidiary of Baltimore Gas Electric and headquartered in the same location Their California based office is in Newport Beach and headed by Nam Nguyen Manager of Strategic Planning We are very pleased to have the Constellation people on our Board A new general member is also in our rank Los Angeles Department of Water and Power LADWP No doubt their membership will limit some of my more colorful editorials but we are pleased to have LADWP with us It reinforces the fact that we are a broadbased membership with many different points of view And while we are speaking of births new members and things family let me share with you a story about mine I took my parents to lunch after I was done speaking in Irvine last week Each time I play the goodson role I reflect very early on during the experience that I should have known better My parents are retired living a great life spending my inheritance travelling around the globe and doing what retired people should be doing The early bird special is a big part of their life After my presentation in Irvine I called the rents in Laguna Hills at pm and asked Do you want me to take you to lunch I should have known better Well my Mom answered we were just sitting down to lunch Nothing special Really it was only some left over bread I wouldnt give it to a stranger but we can put it away and have lunch with you When are you coming I said Ill be there in fifteen minutes When I arrive at their Leisure World retirementvillage condo their residence since moving from Cleveland years ago a dialogue ensues that my brain has suppressed I should know better There is a secret part of ones memory reserved for conversations with ones parents All the dizzying and confusing parts of talking with ones parents are conveniently stored in that secret part of the brain and you are reminded of these conversations only after it is too late Where do you want to go she asks knowing that my Father will defer to her judgement the secret of a year marriage I suggest Mimis Cafe a local chain eatery with reasonably good food What are you going to order I say I dont know but I remember I once had lamb shanks at Mimis I state without pretense that Ill order lamb shanks Oh you cant get lamb shanks at Mimis You have to go to the Greek restaur ant for lamb shanks Or you know who else has lamb shanks is Ten minutes later I have explained at least three times that I really dont need to have lamb shanks We can go anywhere they want Well go to Mimis even if I cant order lamb shanks At this point in the conversation if you were to put a heat recovery system and a glass of water on my head then you could generate enough waste heat to spin a handheld steam turbine We drive into the parking lot at the local strip mall where Mimis is located Now we start Act II We have to drive all over the parking lot looking for a space that is located not more than twelve seconds by foot from the door of the restaurant Why I dont know because both of my parents are in good health I think the reason is they like to argue and parking space selection is an Olympic event for the retired Park over there says my Mother to which my Father says who would want to park there We can get closer he insists Why would you want to park closer asks my Mother This is close enough she insists Not wanting to take a side thats a laugh I keep driving around the parking lot I glimpse a parking spot within the goldenager perimeter and nab it See says my Father We would have had to walk all that way This spot isnt much closer my Mom warns him Now Im synche d to the grid and selling spinning reserve We are seated in the restaurant and my Mother recalls each and every time they have eaten at Mimis over the last ten years who was with them and what each person ordered Your Mother never forgets a meal says my Dad a line that I have heard over million times since I was a kid The debate rages about what to order and will it be too much food I know with certainty that whatever they order it will be too much food I havent been with them once when they didnt ask for th e boxes or Styrofoam containers to bring home the excess the booty the loot and the leftovers These are the meals that will last a Depressionera couple at least a week Sure enough they ask for the instruments of portage Everything goes in The hot sauce for the quesadillas the bread rolls and dont forget the butter pats for the bread I numbly ask Dont you have butter at home No says my Mom we have margarine With after dinner mints in mouth and the excess inventory in youknowwhos purse we head back to the car Next time you come to visit we can have lamb shanks at the ItalianGreek restaurant says my Dad No my Mom reminds him that place is out of business Well have to go into LA to get lamb shanks Now Im receiving EMS signals every seconds from the grid Come to think of it I really dont like lamb shanks all that much I should have known better Maybe if I write this down Ill be reminded for future reference On the other hand the lack of memory is mightier than the pen DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD This weeks cookie comes from Paul Gribik A little humor to usher in the holiday season These are the nominees for the Chevy Nova

back Were live Were living Actually we are still in limbo land As of yet no prez elect The week was typical by California standards The utilities filed their plans to raise rates over the next fi ve years the consumer advocates held a press conference to kick off their hol y war against electric restructuring a class action suit was filed for billion against the generators and the utilities gas prices hovered betwee n and mmcf on day trading the Secretary of Energy spat on FERC regarding the remedies proposed to fix the alleged dysfunctional California market and the Governor announced his options for curing what ails us I think that pretty well covers it It was just another week in paradise I was on KRON TV last week for a couple of second sound bites Chomp chomp That is what was distilled from fifty minutes of taping It was a learning experience for me more so than it was for the general viewing public The station did an investigative report on Californias restructur ed power industry and the slant was fairly predictable although it could hav e been far worse Two moms on my sons hockey team told me they saw the clip s on TV and I used these ladies as my unbiased sample to gather some opinions There are about twenty families on my sons team so that means using testimonial math that about ten percent of the Bay Area watched the news piece One mom said she saw me really didnt listen to what the news was covering but that she recognized me Im sure that her experience les s the recognition applies easily to half or more of the viewing public The second mom who I have known for many years asked me So who is doing th e gouging This from a person who is well educated very involved with the community and is part of a routine family he says of husband wife thre e kids and a dog Alas I realized the battle for Californias power market will not rest no r be resolved in chaotic meetings at the ISO or AB working groups The w ar will be won or lost based on public opinion Will Californians support the continuation of electric restructuring I dont know if they will but I a m not at all surprised that the vast majority of people do not understand the issues As an industry we have a long long way to go in educating the public And I have tremendous doubt that we are going to cough up the necessary money to publicly demonstrate a positive image on power restructuring Nancy Day wrote me last week You and your associates must prove to the policymakers and the public that in the long run competitive markets are always better than command and control regulation How do you do that You hire a PR firm and you get them to help you s hape your messages to a variety of audiences Shape a message I know that some of you folks think you are doing that now I disagree Individually or collectively we have not made even a sma ll dent in the public image for our cause There is some name recognition to be sure The paid TV ads for Enron and Southern have made those company names more familiar Green Mountain Energy has done a good job of getting its name out too But that is hardly the point As an industry of privat e interests we are kaput on the PR side Imagine this Imagine Joe Montana fourtime Superbowl wining quarterback for the San Francisco ers standing next to the Lombardi Trophy talking into the camera He smiles and says Hi Im Joe Montana I believe in competition A few side clips some simple explanations how competition i s going to more quickly bring prices into line with expectations and back to Joe We can also do some follow on ads with Jerry Rice and Jim Plunket twotime Superbowl QB for the Oakland Raiders thereby making a connectio n with different factions of Californias ethnic and racial makeup That is what I call PR Touching the soul of the public with simple messages from credible wellknown likeable people Id be interested in hearing your thoughts Here is what is on this weeks leftover turkey menu Things in the Peoples Republic of California Oh when the comments come marching in ISO Super Peak Market books first transaction Consumers Rattle the Saber for a Ballot Initiative All Injured Parties form a line to the left The Governors Plan Odds Ends Things in the Peoples Republic of California Oh when the comments come marching in My mailman is becoming increasingly ticked off at me because the tonnage of FERC comments coming to my address weighing four or five pounds per delivery Hes a mailman not a pediatrician He is leaving small hints o f his displeasure such as dropping my mail in the middle of the driveway or delivering the goodies to my neighbors house Most of the copies received I confess go into the trash bin without a second thought I dont even bre ak the gummy seal on most I check the senders name and decide if the fortu ne inside the envelope might be worth a read I always open the envelopes fro m the CPUC the Electric Oversight Board and Steptoe Johnson SCEs counse l for really important filings These filings are the most entertaining of the lot The holiday weekend gave me some time to read a selection of comments submitted to FERC regarding the Commissions November Order I dont know whether I should laugh or cry at some of these pleadings The comments I read from some of my favorite sectors of Californias power industry are so childish that I wonder if it is a joke Or is the joke on us Take for example the CPUCs comments The first pages are more or less what you would expect refund our money change this hearing from a paper hearing to a fullblown evidentiary hearing request a rehearing the CPUC should get copies of everything the MSC and DMA publish at the same ti me FERC gets them FERC got the soft pricecap issues and just about everythin g else wrong the State has jurisdiction etc The CPUC claims that there is insufficient evidence to support the FERCs conclusions Since the CPUC als o lacks sufficient evidence because the generators and power marketers will not comply with the CPUCs data requests then well what the heck we ne ed a lengthy hearing with evidence and crossexamination of witnesses This line of reasoning sounds very much like the Florida vote recount litigation but I dont want to go there Here is the real kicker If you go to page of the CPUCs comments ther e is the signature block of the CPUC attorneys dated November The next page begins with the Separate Statement of Commissioners Duque Neeper an d Bilas I did a double take on the title not understanding at first tha t the first pages were never adopted by the CPUC by vote Our politically hypercorrect couple Ms Lynch and Mr Wood forced it in What do the three Republican Commissioners say We find much to support i n FERCs Market Order and are filing this statement to insure that FERC has access to our full thinking concerning the technical aspects of the wholesa le market which are not the principal focus of the Commissions filing I remain astounded that in essence the CPUC has two replies One that lambastes the FERC Order and another that encourages the Order with some modifications For example the evil part of the CPUC commentary shakes a finger at FERC for ordering elimination of the requirement for the UDCs to buy all power through the PX That says the attorneys is a violation of jurisdiction and you federal people should stay off of our lawn The trio of Duque Neeper and Bilas DNB say While the state maintains jurisdiction we are willing to cede to FERC temporary jurisdiction over th is matter Which of the two responses sounds more cooperative to you I wonder he asks why the CPUC comments never came to a vote Sounds to me like the CPUC comments a la DNB would have passed quite nicely thank you But those days are long gone The CPUC expert witness testimony appended to the CPUC comments includes th e direct testimony of Michael Scheible a supervisor of the California Air Resources Board staff responsible for energy issues including electricity This is a person who was part of the development of the RECLAIM program of tradable emission credits utilized in the South Coast Air Quality Managemen t District SCAQMD Here is what Mr Scheible testifies The average pric e paid for a NOx RTC went from a pound in January to in June to in October What is he talking about He took the yeartodate expenditures on NOx credits and divided the total by the number of traded RECLAIM Trading Credits RTC He used the average value not the marginal or incremental price NOx credits are today trading in the to per pound range But he doesnt stop there He takes another leap at the impact of the RTC prices on electricity prices RECLAIM affects only thermal power generating units in the SCAQMD These units account for about percent o f the power generating capacity in the State Thus the market price of RT Cs was a factor for only a relatively small percentage of the States generati on capacity in Markets What are markets This is the basis upon whic h the State hopes to persuade FERC that the markets are not working because o ne cost factor only affects of the States capacity Okay it is your turn Do you want to laugh or cry I reviewed one of the UDC proposals PGE PGEs comments included three expert witness affidavits that in total were about one inch thick PGE as ks the FERC to replace the MWh soft cap with a costbased load differentiated cap pay as bid for bids accepted over the load differentiat ed cap force instate generators to bid into the California PX before seeking to participate in other markets penalize both load and generation if eithe r does not sufficiently participate in forward markets and return to costofservice ratemaking in California for an interim period In their proposed relief for electricity prices realized after October PGE requests a waiver of the payment provisions of the ISO and PX Tariffs requests that the utility only be required to pay based on levels and that after refund claims are adjudicated PGE will pay the extra amounts that may be ordered Shakespeare couldnt have said it any better To sleep To sleep perchan ce to dream Things in the Peoples Republic of California ISO Super Peak Market books first transaction Ziad Alaywan of the ISO talked with me today during my attendance at the IS O Governing Board meeting He had a sad face as he told me We made our fir st transaction using the Super Peak Market instead of issuing an outofmarket OOM order It was for MW Grand says I Why the long face He w as disheartened because the accepted bid was higher than the price cap of I said to my man Ziad that bids either above or below the price cap are not a reason to be upset What do you want the bidders to do I asked He confessed that it troubles him when all the offers are above the cap but nevertheless he is going to maintain the request for bids every day for th e remainder of December In case you havent seen the form of the ISO request for bids it is dispatched via email and looks like this For operating day XXXXXX the CAISO will be participating in its Seasonal Super Peak Day of Market via the Automated Power Exchange APX This Market will close at Purchase may be made during this time for the peak hours of through It is the intent of the CAISO to reduc e the amount of OutOfMarket purchase for XXXXXX through this Seasona l Super Peak Day of Market I encourage marketers and generators to look closely at this market in whic h to post offers The Super Peak Market is the best hope we have to bring order to the otherwise somewhat chaotic method by which the ISO operators g o hunting for outofmarket energy I told Ziad that the more the ISO access es the Super Peak Market the more offers he is likely to see and the more competition there will be to bring prices down Markets do not develop overnight I dont think offers below the cap are either unlikely or illogical Anyone disagree Things in the Peoples Republic of California Consumers Rattle the Saber for a Ballot Initiative I told you it was going to occur Harvey Rosenfield President of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights FTCR a consumer watchdog group held a press conference last Tuesday to announce the kick off of a campaign to influence the Governor and the State Legislature to enact measures that will reverse the progress of electric competition or face o n the November ballot no butterflies an initiative to achieve the same He tried this tactic two years ago when he launched Proposition It failed but the instate utilities spent million in advertising to educate the public regarding the ills of oldtime religion The alleged purpose of the proposalballot initiative it to protect California consumers and small businesses against higher electricity bills Rosenfield submitted a concept draft of their proposal to the Governor and Legislature that you can review on the web site utilitiesprprphp FTCRs Key Points of Reform requires refunds to San Diego customers of excessive electricity charges through a windfall profits tax on profiteering power generators requires oversight of electricity rates by the Public Utilities Commission PUC institutes an integrated resource planning process to address future energy needs creates a state power authority to ensure the fulfillment Californias ener gy needs promote conservation and construct and operate power plants transmission and distribution facilities facilitates the authority of local and state government to exercise the pow er of eminent domain if necessary and creates strong accountability mechanisms for state agencies The advocates expressed doubt concerning whether state officials were willi ng to defy the powerful energy lobbies And they warned elected officials against another bailout of the utility companies at the expense of taxpayer s and consumers If there is any part of the proposal I like then it is the organization asked the Governor and legislators to refuse any campaign contributions fro m utility or power companies during the consideration of legislative proposals According to Rosenfield history shows that whenever elec ted officials must choose between the interests of the private utilitypower companies and protecting the public interest they will choose to protect t he utility and energy companies That is how we got into this mess Whether th e public officials currently in office are willing to do so especially in the midst of a ratepayer revolt remains an open question You know windfall profit tax aside the more I read the proposal the more I am intrigued The proposal boxes in the utilities and you can easily expe ct that the utilities will come slugging back in two directions simultaneously First the utilities will slug back with the bankruptcy argument if they are stuck with the undercollection risk Second the utilities will step up their accusations against the generators for gouging The opportunities for schizophrenic behavior will be legion because the utilities are less and less the largest sources of earnings for their corporate holding companies Stay tuned It promises to be interesting Things in the Peoples Republic of California All Injured Parties form a line to the left In the Chinese calendar it is the Year of the Lawyer When I first heard about the billion class action suit against the generators and utilities in California I wanted to make a public statement to express my outrage However I was too busy handing out free cigarette samples to school age children Between endless squabbles over presidential vote counting and pot shots at the restructured electric system in California it always seems the lawyers come out ahead You know what I am saying Our litigation bills for WPTF in October almost hit a new monthly high So what is this class action suit all about You can read the suit as fil ed on the web site of the filing attorneys at relianthtm However here is a summary In the Superior court of the State of California for the county of San Diego a suit has been filed on behalf of Pamela R Gordon in a class acti on complaint for violations of California business and professions code and antitrust and unfair business practices The defendants are Reliant Energ y Inc Southern Company NRG Energy Dynegy Inc AES Corporation Williams Energy Duke Energy North America And Does Through Inclusive FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION Violation of Sections and of the California Business and Professions Code Trust In Restraint of Trade or Commerce in Violation of the Antitrust Act SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION For Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act Based Upon Violations of the Antitrust Act THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION For Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act Bas ed Upon Defendants Unfair Business Acts and Practices FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION Violations of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION Unconscionability It is that fifth cause of action that has me wondering Were we not conscious during this whole episode with the possible exception of SDGE when they didnt hedge their summer energy procurement This is what the suit claims That Defendants charged rates for wholesale electricity that were unconscionable given their cost of production the newly emergent markets for that product and the consumers need for electrical power Defendants rates were inherently excessive invalid and unconscionable particularly in light of the deceptive and manipulative practices they used to inflate the market prices and the vital need consumers and businesses ha ve for electrical power Defendants unconscionable prices were passed through to Plaintiff and the majority of the Class in the retail electricity rates charged by SDGE and thereby directly damaged Plaintiff and the Class Things in the Peoples Republic of California The Governors Plan Well we have had quite a week havent we Top it off with this Today Governor Davis of California will float his proposals for fixing the California electricity market It is reassuring to know that so many peopl e are rushing in to fix our problems Here is what Jason Leopold of the Dow Jones Newswire reported about the Gov s draft plan It will include options to Develop a state power authority to build power plants and own and operate transmission systems Eliminate the California Independent System Operator Extend the freeze on retail electricity rates Require utilities to retain existing generation and to build new power plan ts Consider reasserting state authority over the operation maintenance and safety practices of all instate generating facilities for public health an d safety purposes Authorize utilities to purchase the majority of their power in forward mark ets Pressure the FERC to implement a regional price cap on wholesale energy tha t varies by time of day and year Lobby for refunds for unjust and unreasonable rates We will have a more detailed report on the proposals next week assuming we survive that long Odds Ends Jim Kritikson sent me an email that has different thoughtprovoking sayings such as the byline header at the top of todays Burrito The one I selected is among my favorites Every week I will rotate a new byline fro m the list Jim provided me thereby lengthening the pure joy these morsels bring rather than blowing the whole wad in one Burrito Speaking of learning new things I mentioned in the introduction that my experience being interviewed on TV gave me a world of insight into the phrases and words that get through the media filter I am becoming a stude nt of the sound bite as any reader of these Burritos will attest I am compiling a list of key words that either work or dont work when talking with the media or the press For example if you are talking to a reporter and you say The dayahead ancillary service markets are too illiquid and the price is highly variable then you will not only strike out with the media people but you will go to the back of the soundbite class On the other hand if you say something like Of course they are gouging then I can assure you they will take your bite to print or video I have developed a simple chart of words and phrases either to embrace or to avoid when addressing members of the press the public or when mingling wi th people at holiday cocktail parties with whom your spouse works but you can t stand There are Inwords they are good and Outwords to be avoided lik e the plague Feel free to add to the list as you learn new terms Inwords generator manipulate gouging market power demand response consumer rights undercollection excess profits abuse utilities competition withholding Outwords default provider markets high price ancillary services penny loafers Eric scarcity interruptible customer stakeholder outages investments Burrito Now here is how you utilize the system I have invented You pick three numbers randomly Lets take todays hourly electric price say MWH So the numbers are and You can select any three numbers it real ly doesnt matter So for example if you want to create a quotable quote then you take the words Manipulate Market Power and Abuse an d put them in a sentence eg The abuse of market power is an attempt to manipulate price See how easy that was The press will eat it up Try it the Outwordily way Using the same three numbers select the words Markets Ancillary Service and Stakeholder You might get T he Ancillary Service markets are designed by stakeholders Dry as bone and essentially useless Suitable for ISO Governing Board public comment but youll never be a press maven Keep a copy of these words in your wallet o r purse It could save your life or the life of an innocent consumer see I did it again As the political rhetoric heats up we being soldiers of fortune must be prepared at any moment to whip out the handy quote sheet necessary to calm the jittery nerves of the masses lest there be a ratepay er revolt As if we didnt have enough problems in California the rest of the nation is in something of a fix This week Dan Douglass sent us a classic piece to humor our weary bones This makes the phrase Turning

talk at the WPTF General Meeting in Phoenix a few weeks ago The story takes place in the good ol days of the Soviet Union when Brezhnev was Premier Brezhnev and the rest of the Politburo one fine May Day were watching the tanks and missiles pass by the Kremlin Wall when Leonid noticed in the middle of the parade a truck carrying a group of civilians He turned to Dmitri Ustinov the Defense Minister and asked Who are they Ustinov replied Those a re our economists You just wouldnt believe their destructive potential This is appropriate for our time and our situation The economists descend ed upon us when the California market was designed but we know not from where Aliens Since weaving conspiracy theories is a popular past time in Sacramento We just know they are gouging us them bullies I believe th at one must do the same by following the money Im not talking about the campaign contributions in Gray Davis pocket The most money has gone from power sales in California to the Canadian Province of British Columbia It was a plot the Canadians hatched I mean look at Governor Davis He looks kind of BCish Skinny and lanky wimpy hair and a hesitation in his speech He talks their language a mix of misspelled French meet me at th e centre English and Eh One night in the BC government secretl y sent us some economists by the truckload to destroy California The utilities probably paid for the bus tickets I happen to know that Frank Wolak Chair of the ISO Market Surveillance Committee once lectured at a University in Vancouver BC What more evidence do you need The BC Government sent us cheap hydro power sold at inflated market prices so tha t they could do what the citizens of California wanted to do with their budge t largess build roads schools and hospitals They didnt think we coul d figure out their plot but we did Now is the time for California to counterattack Well send them some of our politicians a bipartisan grou p including a few who can add and some of our select energy thugs from the CPUC and the Blind Oversight Board Speaking of times and situations there was a time when discussing the ISO words such as communist and Nazi were only uttered by my pal Carl Imparato We would shake our heads and chuckle at Carls extremism We arent laughing now The descriptors seem to arise again and again in poli te conversation by a wider circle of people I watch with utter amusement because the alternative is retching breakfast at the demagoguery of the I SO Governing Board the Market Despair Team the Governors office and some members of the California Legislature Like an audience watching a tragedy from hell we scream aloud These people are crazy And indeed they are Mr President is not helping us at all by continuing to wrangle over who ge ts the musical Chair at FERC Bubba Curt or Bubba Patrick Listen to us Mr President Let Bubba Curt keep the reigns for a year or two and let Bubba Patrick take a seat at the table We need someone with a shockproof BS detector Someone who can honestly field a motion to dismiss the Californi a ISO The time is long overdue to shoot this horse in the head Not all is evil This week in Houston the resource capital of California I visited the trading floor folks at Dynegy before attending the WTPF Board meeting The coolest thing I saw besides all the neat gadgets on each traders desk was the coffee machine Brother Jolly Hayden showed me how to use it You pick the type of coffee you want The contents of the coffee are in a shotglass sized plastic tub with a foil top I picked Venezuelan Decaffeinated Waxy Crude The tub is placed inside the brewing machine and the start button is pushed Presto coffee drips from the spout into a waiting cup I asked Jolly How did the hot water get mixed into the grou nd beans He removed the tub from the machine and showed me a pin prick hole made in the foil top and another that was made at the bottom Is that nea t or what I would like to buy a brewing machine just like the Dynegy coffee machine but a little larger I would set up a booth in Sacramento on the corner o f th and L and bark out to passing members of the Legislature Free spa ce shuttle Come and see life on other planets They would jump at the chanc e to visit other planets I would seat them in the machine push the start button and voila Dripping out would be the essence of democracy Dont worry about the holes needed at the top and the bottom They are already there and quite enlarged Back to my day at Dynegy Trade floors might seem similar across companies but the small differences speak to the management style embraced by the cre w and its leaders Each electric trading desk for various parts of the country is set up a little bit differently For example some desks have a person doing assetbacked trading but some dont When I arrived at am Houston time the Eastern desk was busy in its trade day The Western folk s hadnt arrived yet Later I sat with Randy LeForce of the Western desk Captain LeForce to you he told me He could talk big because Dave Francis who sits next to Randy and hangs witty quotes from the ceiling above his head Even a blind pig could make money in this market was on vacation As the pace of the trading gathered steam Randy kept an eye on all the different people working the Western trading desk The Captain worked it like a maestro During my visit some Dynegy folks came up to me introduced themselves an d said how much they enjoyed the Friday Burrito Ill tell you what There are few things in life that give me as much satisfaction Complete strange rs who tell you that something you do makes them feel good well it doesnt g et any better than that Garrison Keillor the wellknown author of Lake Woebegone Days and NPR radio entertainer once said a writer should have an audience Not everyone in the world should be in the audience but an audience nonetheless of some people I now know what he means And the people I met on the trading floor felt like they knew me and shared with m e their thoughts and opinions on a lot of things Often they asked me Are those California people really that crazy Since last week you might have noticed the pace at the FERC has picked up somewhat Last Friday the FERC issued an Order on possible refunds for alleged overcharges by parties selling to the ISO last January That was news worthy Then on Wednesday the FERC issued an Order to remove barrie rs to additional electric generation in the West The Order admits that it wont change the dire situation in the West but these are steps in the rig ht direction The FERC also issued on Wednesday a showcause order to AES and Williams regarding the maintenance of RMR units that were called by the ISO in April and May of That is a serious case that we must watch closely Also this week the California Senate kicked off its own investigation this will be the tenth such investigation of the California markets to uncover alleged price manipulation The Senate Committee will have subpoena rights and if I understand it correctly they plan to subpoe na individuals Sounds like a Kangaroo Court and a ThreeRing Circus to me Thursday Secretary Abraham stated in a congressional hearing that the West would certainly experience power outages this summer Finally an LA Times reporter asked me if I had heard that a small QF company had filed for seizure of SCE property to satisfy an outstanding debt That would be step one of the bankruptcy chacha All in all a typical week among crazy people Lets see what else we can talk about Things in the Peoples Republic of California PUC Updates Utility Liabilities Be a Source for Energy Price Update BPA Misquoted in the WSJ Things FERC Market Monitoring Proposal Letters Jobs and People Odds Ends DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDD Things in the Peoples Republic of California PUC Updates Utility Liabilities My favorite regulator the California PUC issued an Order in the Utilities Rate Stabilization case to reopen the record on utility audits Although the text of the order is unremarkable the data tables bring up to date as of March the outstanding liabilities of PGE and SCE The PGE commercial paper obligation due as of March increased by million since January for a total default amount of million QF purchases increased by million for the same fiveweek period now totaling million The ISO payments increased million now totali ng billion and the direct access charge backs for negative PX credits increased million now totaling million PGEs total default amount is now billion excluding amounts yet to be collected from PGE customers for DWR purchases The SCE balance is as follows The commercial paper obligation that is due as of March increased by million since January for a total default amount of million SCE defaulted on a significant amount of longterm debt principal and interest roughly million QF purchase defaults increased by million for the same fiveweek period now totaling million The ISO obligations decreased million and the direct access charge backs for negative PX credits increased million now totaling million SCEs total default amount is now billion excluding amounts yet to be collected from SCE customers for DWR purchases There is little question that the QFs are taking it on the chin big time In the last five weeks between January and March the defaulted payments to the QF owners from both utilities has increased million The total QF default for both utilities as of March stands at billion Does anyone wonder why MW of QF capacity has shut down in California Without these payments being made very soon I would expect th e amount of shut down QF capacity to easily double or more Why would these projects produce without the promise of being paid Things in the Peoples Republic of California Be a Source for Energy Price Update Art ODonnell editor and associate publisher of the wellknown and widely read California Energy Market CEM is looking for traders willing to participate in his survey in exchange for receiving an advanced copy The Survey is a regular feature in CEM The information collected by Art is matched against the responses of the other people he interviews and some posted sources Pricewaterhouse Coopers BPAs daily offerings for instance It is written up in narrative form The report goes out twice weekly once on Wednesday afternoonevening via email as a courtesy to the respondents because the week is pretty much done by then and a rewrite o n Friday that is emailed around am posted on the newsdatacom Web site and published in the newsletter for general consumption The Friday report also features a brief story about natural gas markets in the West The WPTF Board of Directors has allowed me to publicize this offering and to explain that if your company is interested in participating the informatio n you provide to Art would be protected as confidential In Arts words Th e price survey is unlike some attempts at creating a tradable index numb er eg McGrawHills Power Markets Week index or the Dow Jones indices is more of a narrative about the state of the market d a pulse reading as opposed to a blood pressure number or an EKG As such I do not ask traders and schedulers for precise dollar figures or volumes associated with specif ic trades but rather questions like Whats MidColumbia going for today What about offpeak How has that changed since this morning Oh yeah why is that Anything else I should know The WPTF Board asked Art to explain how the information he collects would b e protected since so many marketers and generators are under State data subpoenas Art replied The Constitution of the State of California provides for a blanket immunity against government intrusions for news gathering from confidential sources and unpublished information something which we believe in strongly at Energy NewsData Corporation and which we ar e willing to go to jail to protect So if for instance the Attorney General tried to subpoena me or anyone from my staff about power price information we would refuse to divulge anything other than the already published accounts send back a copy of the Constitution contact the attorneys for the Society of Professional Journalists and start preparing a benef it party to raise legal fees If you would like to participate in Arts survey please email him at Things in the Peoples Republic of California BPA Misquoted in the WSJ In last weeks Burrito I referred to a Wall Street Journal article that portrayed a BPA trader as admonishing the DWR for accepting bids over marke t prices I was surprised when I received the following email from BPAs David Mills His message to me copied a letter he sent to DWRs Ray Hart explaining what he meant as opposed to what he was quoted as saying Dear Ray As per our telephone discussion I just wanted to reiterate a few things rethe Wall Street Journal article and the quotes attributed to me At no time during the interview with Ms Smith did I state that I thought that CDWRs offers were out of line with the prevailing market price in Californ ia or that your traders should check that price before entering the market T he reporter was quite interested in the price difference between California an d the MidC price here in the Northwest and when I asked I told her that currently that price delta was roughly MWhr with MidC being lower than the CA prices I did not indicate to the reporter that I thought that CDWR was paying more than the California market price and was simply trying to make a comparison of price relativity between California and the Northwest Lastly BPA has on occasion charged extraregional entities less than the prevailing market price but has only done so to remain consistent with our own pricing strategies I apologize for any misconceptions or miscommunications that may have resulted from this and look forward to a continuing working relationship between CDWR and BPA Things FERC Market Monitoring Proposal FERC Staff issued a report with Recommendations on Prospective Market Monitoring and Mitigation for the California Wholesale Electric Power Market WPTF members are taking this proposal very seriously and we inte nd to provide comments on March If you are interested in a copy of the report go to bulkpowerbulkpowerhtm General members are able to participate along with the Board members and other general members working on our response We have retained the servic es of Dr Ben Zycher of the RAND Corporation to help us draft the policy issues He will be working with our counsel Dan Douglass of Arter Hadde n to craft our reply In short our submission will point out the flaws in FERCs proposed methodology and demonstrate the shortcomings of narrowly limiting the definition of producer marginal cost to operating variable cost Further excluding measures of credit worthiness are an important missing variable i n the FERC analysis Next week I will include a short summary of our respon se in the Burrito Letters I received a note from one of our legal beagles that drop me a line every n ow and then I dont have the facts of the case to which this person refers but I hope the sender provides us with an update if a judgement should occu r Universal Studios wants FERC to find that Universal owes no penalty to SCE for not interrupting its interruptible load under a CPUC rate schedule because SCE did not adhere to the FERC requirement in the Dec order to schedule of its load in the day ahead market according to Universal if SCE had done so then it would have had to provide Universal power at below its cost SCE didnt and Universal got interrupted and now Universal owes Does anyone else know about this filing Lind Guerry veteran of the PX halcyon days wrote Hi Gary Hope youre having a nice day Just wanted to let you know that Im really enjoying th e Burrito and am so glad youre sending it to my home email I really got a kick out of the Ten Reasons Its hard to believe that our wonderful state is in such incompetent hands isnt it And not only are they incompetent they continue to remain so with such regularity you could probably make a killing marketing their incompetence as a laxative Do you think if we tried to do that wed get accused of exercising market power Think of the power wed wield as the holder of the largest amount of incompetence Lind we need a product name for the laxative idea Any ideas How about Sane Away Jobs and People The folks at Dynegy sent me a couple of job postings If your company has similar posting or job openings or if you are reader looking for a new gig drop me a line After all its free Position Description Dynegys position has responsibility for the development of transmission an d power markets in a geographic region of the US Duties are driven primari ly by federal regional and state activities to restructure and deregulate th e electric power industry and the need for industry participants to develop and implement market structures policies and regulations that promote liquid and competitive transmission and power markets Significant activit y within a region to reshape the structure and operation of the transmission grid is resulting from FERC Order which directs the establishment of Regional Transmission Organizations Extensive travel and higher at times is highly probable Primary goals of this position are to Create more liquid and competitive transmission and power markets Maximize th e value of Dynegys positions and assets by working closely with the trading and power groups to develop and implement commercial strategies that crea te and capture significant business opportunities and Provide timely and accurate information market intelligence and recommendations to clients Maximize the value of Dynegys positions and assets by working closely with the trading and power groups to develop and implement commercial strategies that create and capture significant business opportunities and recommendations to clients Interested parties should contact Jolly Hayden at Odds Ends First I would like to welcome WPTFs newest general member Wellhead Electric Hal Dittmer is the founder and president of Wellhead I have known Hal for a couple of years first as a client for my over priced consulting services and later as a friend and source of all kinds of usefu l information Wellhead is one of those QF owners who are owed a boatload of money However Hals company is developing some new projects and he is looking for prospective power buyers Hence his interest in WPTF is obvious Wellhead is WPTFs st member Well the Dynegy gang has been a source of comfort and joy to me this week They couldnt let me leave their abode without stuffing a song in my pocket that is a tribute to their creative skills Timely too Sing it to the tu ne of California Dreaming by the Mamas and the Papas ISO California to the tune of Hotel California On a dark Western highway No wind in my hair No rain for the hydro No NOX in the air Up ahead in the distance I saw a flickering sight The load grew heavy and the lights grew dim No relief in the night So we stood in the darkness Down at the Taco Bell And I was thinking to myself This could be Heaven or this could be Hell We lit up a candle No power in the Bay There were voices down the corridor I thought I heard them say Welcome to the ISO California Such a lovely place Such a lovely place Such a lovely face Powering up for the ISO California What a nice surprise What a nice

you enjoy this week Unlike default electric service when it comes to California disasters you have a wide range of choices among competing options For example there was the Governor our Governor preaching the gospel among the Democratic Governors in Washington DC and the financial analysts in New York City In Sacramento there was Senate Energy Committee hearings And from the poiso n tipped pens of the Department of Market Analysis at the ISO there was a report that I can assure you will stir the pot Which event was your favorite This was a Holy Week of sorts for Catholics Tuesday was Fat Tuesday an d Wednesday was Ash Wednesday I saw a married couple in Starbucks on Wednesday night that had ashen smudges on their forehead At a distance I wasnt sure about the marking At first I only saw the woman waiting for h er coffee order I assumed she was marked as an Untouchable you know the Indian type although she looked more Eastern European than Indian You never know I couldnt figure out how her marking was so indistinct becaus e the Untouchable tattoo is a very bright color It wasnt until I saw her husband also marked on his forehead in the same way that I realized the meaning of the symbol the day and its significance When I lived in Chicago a long time ago and worked downtown in the Loop I would see thre e out of four adults either at work or on the street with the Ash Wednesday indicia on their forehead I havent seen the same interest in religious practice for all the years I have lived in California Amazing the thing s one can learn while sipping a Grande Nonfat Chai Tea at Starbucks Do you think there could be one day a year where people would wear the following insignia on their forehaead IMAGE I dont often go to Starbucks at night A caffeine beverage keeps me awake However when my son is at his icehockey practice in Belmont visiting the local coffeehouse in order to kill time is just too tempting I watch people sip coffee and hunt for a used newspaper to read For some reason last Wednesday evening I checked my voice mail just in case someone left me a message about a mistake in my favor on my bank account Instead a reporter from the Orange County Register called me at pm and asked me to return his call Having nothing better to do than watch people take communion at the coffee bar and contemplate how Untouchable tattoos can tur n gray I called the reporter He answered the phone He wanted to know my meaning your reaction to the ISOs study to be filed at FERC explaining h ow generators have overcharged the ISO relative to their likely operating cost s for real time energy The amounts of the overcharges for December and Janua ry are alleged in the study to be hundreds of millions of dollars As always I was equipped with sufficient ignorance to provide a meaningful quote I said Huh He went on Did I think the study was politically motivated by the Governo r Davis handpicked ISO Governing Board This time I nailed the answer I said What Actually I backed away from entangling myself in the finger pointing game It was tempting to indulge I might add but I didnt do it I said No the politics wouldnt change this outcome The ISO has a righ t to ask for an audit of the bids and they did Simple Maybe Im right or maybe Im wrong Who knows Last week I received an email from ISO Governing Board member Michael Pet er Florio a cat I long ago nicknamed Old Deuteronomy for reasons I can no longer remember Deut responded to a comment I made to him that Mr Florio is the most senior and knowledgeable member of the ISO Governing Board Th at isnt surprising I told Deut but it does speak volumes about the current Boards composition Deut wrote back Thats comforting I think I trie d to make the point after Kent Palmerton Williams Energy spoke at the last public comment period that I want to hear what people think about issues coming up at the ISO even if requires use of personal email to bypass the ISO Despite all the anguished rhetoric we all have to live together wor k together and understand each other going forward Deut asked me to put that in the Burrito so I did But as Governors go it gives me a heartache to listen to our State Governor This man is a oneact disaster I suppose we Californians get what we deserve The Govs comment this week to a group in Washington DC floored me He said and I am not making this up that California is on th e backside of the electricity crisis problem I thought that comment deserve d some special attention When a San Francisco Chronicle reporter asked for m y opinion I couldnt shut up I exclaimed Backside of the problem No I think we are on the dark side of the moon If we dont turn this thing around there wont be any light Huff and puff Bankruptcy or not to bankrupt that is the question Here is my take on th e issue this week By next week I should have an entirely different answer If PGE folds that is accepts a deal with the State to sell its transmissi on assets then it would appear as if the utilities are serious about remainin g financial whole and working out their payments with creditors Clearly there is many a slip tween the cup and the lip Creditors could demand mo re than the utilities have received from the sale of the assets My crude analysis suggests that after the utilities pay off the bonds and obligation s secured by the transmission assets there might not be enough money to cove r the outstanding balances with the unsecured creditors The remaining open question then is will the PUC allow as a cost the pass through of additional revenue requirements to fully cover the amounts owed It seems these days the PUC can do and does anything it wants with or without leg al procedure Of course most of what they do make things worse but hey th at is why we have a PUC I noticed that the PUC informed the world that any power purchases made by DWR will be deemed just and reasonable Now why couldnt they say the same thing to the utilities for their longterm power purchase deals Lets put some hot coffee on the burner and see what we can brew Things in the Peoples Republic of California Community Choice may be a Savior of Direct Access And the Award for the Silliest Bill Goes to ABX Creditors Committee for Power Marketers Out of State Generators and Public Power Entities Jobs and People Odds Ends DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD Things in the Peoples Republic of California Community Choice may be a Savior of Direct Access ABx suspended all new direct access customers in California until the DW R no longer purchases energy This will occur when our grandchildren graduat e from college Although clean up legislation has been suggested to reverse this crippling effect of ABx I am not hopeful Alas our friend from Local Power Paul Fenn located in Oakland has found at long last a sponso r for his proposed bill to allow communities to select energy providers other than the incumbent utilities Here are the details Assemblywoman Carole Migden DSan Francisco announced her sponsorship of the California Community Choice bill drafted by Local Power last year on February A hearing will be announced shortly and could be as early as next week Local Power has also submitted an amendment to ABx to facilitate distributed generation in urban areas such as solar wind small hydro fuel cells etc This amendment will be heard at the same time This bill would allow a city for example to assign power on a real time basis from a solar cell or other local generation at one location in a city to load points elsewhere in the city on the same distribution system The languag e would enable many forms of distributed generation to develop but would be particularly valuable for Community Choice cities to jumpstart large scale urban solar wind fuel cell small hydro and other local power projects Community Choice is the solution to Californias failure to implement retai l access in any meaningful way Local governments are authorized to aggregate all market nonparticipants in their jurisdictions into citynegotiated contracts much like cable television or garbage services have been negotiated for decades but with an optout clause for consumers who are ab le to participate directly in the market Groups of contiguous municipalities may join together and county governments may coordinate consenting municipalities in regional power contracts Things in the Peoples Republic of California And the Award for the Silliest Bill Goes to ABX Each week our State Legislators try to outdo each other I think they meet at a local watering hole in Sacramento and dare each other to see who can come up with the most absurd emergencysession energy bill We have a new winner Assembly Member La Suer and it is called ABx Here is what th is odious piece of legislation is all about ABX attempts to criminalize acts of unregulated generators if they perform maintenance at times other than the California Public Utilities Commission requires Further the commission is required to allow scheduled maintenance of only one generator at a time I can hear you outofstate Burrito readers howling with laughter slapping your thighs and shaking your heads Hey Joe listen to this A guy name d La Sewer is forcing generators to be out on maintenance only one at a time I admit there is a certain amount of disbelief that anyone who can read write and run for the California Assembly could actually craft this bill If you want to have some fun then in the above paragraph replace the word maintenance with the word sex and the word generator with utility executives We might call MiltonBradley to see if they want a piece of the action on our new game Well call it Legendary Shall we analyze the impacts Lets see there are about major generators in the state That means if you own one of those puppies you c an go down for maintenance once every ten years That works for me It reminds me of a story about the communist government that once ruled the USSR A Russian asks a plumber when he can come to this house to fix a leak The plumber opens his appointment book and says The soonest I can fit you in Comrade is in February What day asks the Russian The plumber rubs his chin and contemplates an answer February he answers Morning or afternoon asks the Russian Afternoon answers t he plumber Good says the Russian with a sigh of relief the electrician is coming in the morning The bill if enacted will allow generators to be out for maintenance durin g the peak season which is rapidly becoming all year long in California Well I would like you people to do me a favor Lets play the same game that the Legislators like to play in Sacramento Think of the most outrageous legislation you can imagine and write it down on a piece of paper Wait a few weeks and I bet you will see legislation proposed in California that makes your suggestion look pale in comparison Stick aroun d here long enough and either you are nuts or you will be Things in the Peoples Republic of California Creditors Committee for Power Marketers Out of State Generators and Public Power Entities Several goodnews points to tell you regarding the formation of a creditor s committee for those among you who are feeling disenfranchised Worry not You are in good company The WPTF Board this week provided guidelines for your favorite executive director to apply his organizational skills to facilitate the development o f a creditors committee I have targeted WPTF members who either have expressed an interest in joining a committee or those who might be among unsecured creditors that want to protect their ability to recover amounts owed to them by PGE and SCE through the ISO and the PX Any creditors committee so developed will be independent and unaffiliated with WPTF Tha t is understandable and necessary so that WPTFs status as a taxexempt trade association is not effected with credit issues of individual members I have talked to many outofstate generators power marketers and instat e public power agencies about the formation of a committee and the interest is very high Here is why If SCE and PGE both strike deals with the state to sell their transmission assets to raise some or all of the cash to pay back due amounts there is an increasing likelihood that the debtors the utilities will try to stave off bankruptcy A creditors committee is ver y valuable in that instance A committee of likeminded creditors with similar objectives will give participants a window and a voice into the disbursement of payments the debtors will make to all creditors Saybrook Capital will represent the interests of the committee once formed Saybrook will seek recognition of the committee from the debtors and becom e a pipeline of information between the creditors and the debtors and vice versa If there is any member among our group who I have not talked to an d thinks your interests would be aligned with the targeted participants eith er give me a call or send me an email I will be happy to provide you with t he information you need to participate An organizational meeting of the committee is scheduled for the middle of next week If your company or organization is unable to join a creditors committee now but might be abl e to in the future then there should be no problem Being involved with the committee at the front end provides participants with an opportunity to cra ft the objectives and goals of the group Participation at a later date shoul d be open For information

editio n I should do more drinking and less worrying But I do worry For example my wife wants to buy a new car and this makes me think about one of my favorite lines Get a new car for your spouse itll be a great trade But I havent told her that because she has a fairly decent left jab typically to my head I drive a Ford Taurus that has k miles It looks like hell and gets me to where I want to go My wife wants a new Jaguar top of the line faster than a bullet I was telling this story to our WPTF counsel Dan Douglass who asked I dont get it You are drivin g a beat up old Ford and your wife is getting a new Jaguar How does that work Its not too hard to explain You see my wife works in Palo Alto about miles from our house whereas I operate the world headquarters of this pirate trade association from my home office Each work morning we like to arrive at our respective offices at the same time in about seconds Now if that makes sense to you then maybe you can explain how an d why the State of California thinks it can grow MWs of peaker generatio n from seed to flower in five months None of the above has much to do with the electricity crisis but it is a f ar more enjoyable conversation In fact this week needs a good slug of humor Therefore I have expanded the Odds Ends section to include more stories and jokes We deserve it I get about six calls a day from newspaper reporters and they always ask m e at the outset a tough question How are you Im never sure All the other questions are easy but the HowAreYou question usually trips me up One of our members called me and asked if I had heard about Steve Peaces quote placing the Texas State Flag on top of the California State Capital I had but I discouraged the caller from sending Peace a Texas Flag as a prank I suggested instead sending the Senator a pair of boxer briefs wi th the emblem of Texas as the pattern We could put a note in the box Dont put your ass in Texas Does anyone have a connection on where we can get the goods Our Governor and his staff are actively negotiating the purchase of the transmission systems from the states three utilities Today the LA Times reported that PGE is being obdurate whereas SCE and SDGE are being helpf ul in the negotiations Why does this sound familiar to me Most people say the negotiations are stalled The Governor says he will announce a deal today this Friday The Governor and the rest of the world never seem to b e on the same page In the meantime I am learning all about prepetition credit committees an d how they operate My hopes are modest for a clean solution to the financia l woes of the California market On the other hand consider all the new things I am learning For example the difference between a secured and unsecured creditor has become quite clear If you hold a mortgage bond th en you are a secured creditor If you are an electric generator or marketer w ho sold to the ISO or to the PX then you are unsecured If you have a pictur e of a utility executive think male coming out of a motel room with women other than his spouse then you are a secured creditor If you are a consumer taxpayer and a voter then you are screwed As one financial advisor told me there are only two sources of revenue to make up the shortage of money rate increases and the sale of assets Then the advisor said think of the money from those funding sources like water at the top o f Yosemite Falls As the money cascades down like falling water secured creditors are near the top and get very wet Unsecured creditors are near the bottom and might only get some mist in their face It all depends how much water is running over the precipice If the state doesnt offer enough money for the assets then I expect the unsecured creditors will be like Yosemite tourists at the bottom of the Fal ls after a dry summer The mist spray will be a figment of ones imagination If the state condemns the transmission assets then there will be a long an d protracted court settlement regarding the fair market value of the assets Not a good outcome if you were expecting to get paid soon Alternatively i f the state said to all the generators How about on the dollar for each dollar we owe you I doubt there would be many takers The secured creditors by the way are going to be patient so it seems T he bond underwriters place billions of dollars of bond issues and they are no t too excited about upsetting the State of California Could get in the way of future business because the state does issue quite a lot of bonds and the underwriting fees are good So I dont expect the bondholders to pull th e trigger anytime soon If you thought I was drawing a conclusion based on the discussion above th en think again A conclusion is the place where you rest because you got tired of thinking Here is this weeks menu Things in the Peoples Republic of California LA Times Poll Shows We Have Met the Enemy and It Is Us APX Opens Discussions on a New Transmission Market Some Nasty Legislation Responses to Last Weeks Burrito Jobs and People Odds Ends DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD Things in the Peoples Republic of California LA Times Poll Shows We Have Met the Enemy and It Is Us Last Sunday the LA Times published the results of a poll they conducted on Californians all over the state I encourage you to read the survey Its available at newsstatethtm l The bottom line is that Californians are mixed up about the electricity crisis in ways that I could have not predicted For example the Governor gets the highest marks relative to all other players His approval rating has gone up from January approval rating to in February However the approval rating of the PUC is the lowest among the Gov the legislature the utilities and even President Bush The PUC is a tool of the Governor but apparently that is a secret on ly known to the several thousands of us in the regulated power business There there Ms Lynch They really love you but they just dont understand you No telling where merchant generators and power marketers might have placed had our names been on the list although I am sure it would be at the low e nd of the curve More than half of those surveyed do not believe there is an actual shortage of electricity in California The response to that issue was the same last month and has changed very little Can someone explain this attitude to me I dont get it What do you have to do to convince Californians th at we are short on capacity Thirty days in a row of Stage alerts doesnt do it I do not believe that anyone reading the LA Times say on a regular basis for the last month would conclude that there is no electricity shortage That means few people are reading newspapers for their information The rest of the folks get their information from TV word of mouth comic books or Stunning result Oddly enough the public doesnt think too highly of longterm power contracts very little about nuclear power but they do favor by a margin of three out of four more thermal power plants They would be willing to see such facilities built and operating in their own communities In summary the Gov is up the Legislature down the shortage is nonexistent we need more power plants there is a bailout of the utilitie s but that is okay and people are conserving more than ever Is it any wonder then that the legislation we see emanating from the State Capital is so mixed up We are mixed up What are you going to do about us Things in the Peoples Republic of California APX Opens Discussions on a New Transmission Market Automated Power Exchange APX now under the helm of new CEO John Yurkanin held a oneday seminar on the development of a new market to replace the no w defunct PX adjustment bid market Adjustment bids for those of you that d o not trade or schedule in California are economic signals to the ISO about ones willingness to adjust your schedule to satisfy transmission constrain ts at various transmission bottlenecks on the ISOs grid APX has provided us with a thoughtful instrument for managing transmission congestion I attended the meeting and my take away was that APX is proposing an energy market that allows different parties to be matched for the purpose of adjusting energy deliveries on either side of a transmission constraint I t looks very much like the InterSC Adjustment Bid market that market participants so desperately wanted but never received from the ISO The beauty here however is that all the InterSC adjustment bids fall under o ne portfolio APXs that allows the ISO to maintain the market separation constraint Another benefit provided by APXs new market is the scheduling of RMR units John Stremel of APX told us that the CAISO can contribute to the APX market if there is a feature to instruct the RMR units The ISO could place their orders through the APX market if the RMR units are willing to submit adjustment bids in the same So doing would give much needed and now lost price transparency Nothing is free except grief and heartache and we all have enough of that APX needs funders to get their market off the ground I have heard several people grumble about the sales pitch but lets face it We have been complaining for years that the PX was forced on us the ISOs CONG model wa s forced on us and the RMR dispatch was forced on us Now that for the firs t time we have an opportunity to exercise choice I find it ironic that peopl e are fumbling over the dollars The way the ISO is currently handling congestion management with no or few adjustment bids wreaks havoc on the energy markets APX is at least giving us a chance to fix that and do mor e If you support the APX market in concept then call John Stremel and tell h im If money is a problem then call him and tell him that too Lets get creative and demonstrate to those who doubt o ur ability to pull ourselves up by the bootstrap that we are able and willing to do so Things in the Peoples Republic of California Some Nasty Legislation On the heels of the major pieces of legislation enacted in the last few weeks we have the me too bills that are absolutely nauseating Here are short summaries of two legislative turds that simply demonstrate what can occur when you have too many law makers taking on too few crises SB x Speier D This bill would make facilities that have been deemed exempt wholesale generators by FERC become public utilities subject to CPUC jurisdiction It would authorize the CPUC to ensure that generators located in California are operated in a manner that assures their availability to maintain reliability It would allow the CPUC to issue orders and directiv es as it deems necessary to accomplish this It would authorize the CPUC to prevent the exercise of market power by prohibiting economic or physical withholding The bill would also authorize the CPUC to prescribe inspectio n maintenance and operating practices and procedures for any generator to ensure the public health and safety reliability and adequacy of the syste m AB x Herztberg D This bill would require as a condition of receivi ng a CEC certification for new or repower the applicant to offer to sell to California IOUs Municipal utilities or DWR at just and reasonable cost based price electrical power generated from the facility It would also prohibit the operation of the facility until a maintenance and outage schedule has been approved by the CEC A violation of this would be a criminal act Responses to Last Weeks Burrito Always helpful and friendly Ms Sheryl Lambertson from PPL Montana Butte wrote to me about my idea to send Californias teen population to Montana She said I personally invite your son to spend the summer with me However million teenagers in a state with a population of less than a million I think we could potentially have power shortages though Im sure Montana would do a great job of managing them I think we can take on e more teenager but well leave it at that Phil Muller of SCD Solutions offered the following in response to Dr Davis Cure for What Ails Us Now that our distinguished governor has finally announced his plan to save the utilities by taking over their transmission systems in exchange for paying some of their operating expenses I can see the long term plan First continue to stall resolution of the credit situation while generators continue to sell to the ISO with no immediate prospect of getting paid Second cap QF payments at the just and reasonable price of MWh Third offer to bail out all the generator s by having the state pay a portion of what theyre owed in exchange for turning their power plants over to the state It looks like Gray learned business from John D Rockefeller Force your competitors prices below cos t until theyre forced to sell out to you Once you own everything you can s et your own just and reasonable prices depending on whether youre running for election or not This shouldnt be a problem since the state is not subjec t to antitrust laws Longtime friend Bill Metcalfe in Salt Lake City offered the following response to the WPTF sevenpoint solution He wrote Price is always a factor for the individual consumer and some commercial establishments who c an exercise discretionary conservation but may only discourageencourage industrial expansion Price must reflect the pure mechanics of supply and demand Therefore the health of the California economy is closely linked to the ability to build capacity that will yield a price reflective of our desires for industrial competitiveness and growth The more we move to State control and the Governors plan the more difficult this all becomes and the costs well The Dedicated Rate Component DRC should provide the necessary incentive for consumer conservation Industry may just close up shop when seeing thi s and considering the future As you said this is like a hungry monster that chews up politicians an d spits them out after sucking the political marrow from their bones Watch out for quick and seemingly painless fixes the damage of the past ills do es cost Finally I received a very thoughtful note from Nancy Day my personal advisor although she doesnt know that but I listen very closely to everything she tells me You should too Here is what she wrote I want to offer my thoughts on the Governors plan and make a few suggestions When Mike Peevey Note Peevey was Nancys former business partner in the firm New Energy Ventures was named advisor I sent him th e following words of encouragement do no harm Now I ask you will the Governors plan do no harm If the answer is yes work with your members and the utilities to fix the gigantic holes in the cost recovery portion of the plan Although I agree with you that the simplest way to fix what ails us is to allow the utilities to recover their electricity purchase costs evidently that approach carries with it too much political baggage So ho w can we make the Governors plan work Be prepared with talking points that all of your members can use in their discussions with the press with other lobbyists and with the leadership in the legislature Burton Hertzberg et al Here are my suggestions on points you may want to cover How much does the State really believe the utilities are owed for past electricity purchases is the number billion If so what amortizati on period is being assumed in the calculation of the rate increase How much of a rate increase will be required just to cover that past debt Is there enough headroom in the utilities rates to cover the ongoing cost of electricity both the utilities own generation and the DWR purchases that have to be passed on to consumers Since existing rates are predicated on the authorized return on the underlying book value is this number billion of the Transmission assets will the rates have to increase to cover the States capital costs I am assuming that the State will have to pay market value for the purchase of Transmission plus invest another billion to eliminate congestion a nd add transmission where it is needed and the new administrative bureaucracy to oversee their new assets Even with the States lower cost of capital wont rates have to go up to pay off the bonds and pay salaries to the new bureaucrats I am also assuming that the Democrats will not eliminate the existing Union employee infrastructure of the utilities who will maintain t he system under contract to the State and will therefore not save any money on OM The State believes that purchase of the Transmission grid will remove FE RC interference and they can leverage their asset ownership to bring generators to their knees Is this a valid assumption Wont the State have to comply with FERCs Order requiring open accessnondiscrimination I assume the only relief from FERC oversight will come in the form of no rate cases Who will oversee the economics of the new Bureaucracy the CPUC not a chance The EOB The ISO The n ew CUBA Will this new bureaucracy look and feel just like the ISO whose ongoing costs of operation continue to spiral skyward Are there some potential benefits to State ownership of the Transmission grid Will the State be capable of acting more quickly than the utilities that would be forced to litigate potential transmission expansion before on e or more regulatory bodies before any project can go forward Is the State in a better position to work with Transmission builders in Canada and Mexico t o coordinate the expansion of systems there Or like Cal Trans is the Stat e likely to be just as crippled as the utilities because they have their own set of bureaucratic handcuffs that keep progress stifled and slowed If we are going to buy into the Governors plan should we hold out fo r reforms that will be needed to create viable retail competition I am told that the reason the no more direct access provision was added to AB X w as at the insistence of the Department of Finance Finance was afraid that DW R would contract to buy firm energy for Californians and they would abandon the State in favor of a retail competitor One way to resolve this problem is to require very large customers could we define the criteria to stay with their retail competitor for a least months so that DWR will have ample opportunity to adjust their purchases to track the changes Without viable retail competition the utilities must continue to suffer under hindsight reasonableness reviews I believe if customers all customers including residential had viable retail alternatives we could let the utilities buy whatever they wanted and pass those costs through to their customers with no regulatory oversight no profit on generation sales If the utilities retail generation costs get out of line with competitors offers the customers will have the unfettered ability to switch Gary the only way we will be able to survive this next legislative onslaught will be to fix what is wrong It will be impossible to derail th e train Jobs and People I guess one of the low points this week was the letter a number of us received from Green Mountains Julie Blunden In her letter she says Mos t of you aware of the profound changes that have occurred in Californias electricity markets and political stage over the past nine months Those changes have touched our customers our partners and our team I am writing to tell you of my very difficult decision to leave Green Mountain Energy As a result of the state of the market in California our team out here wi ll need to reflect the lower level of market activity At this time its appropriate for me to move on to the next set of challenges It has been my privilege to work with my teammates in California and a pleasure watching o ur company grow and attract a large set of talented people I feel fortunate to be able to hand the baton to Rick Counihan I will be working on the transition with Rick through March th After that you can continue to reach me at or Julie you will be missed I first met you at a PUC all parties meeting wit h Commissioner Conlon way back in or so I cant remember the topic At that meeting you where so soft spoken but nevertheless forceful First impressions being misleading as always I thought you were some kind of tr ee hugger if you know what I mean But over time I found your comments to be truly insightful meaningful interesting and relevant You are a leader and one of the few females besides Avistas Linda Hamilton who likes to tour power plants I hope our professional paths cross again soon Good luck to you in all your endeavors Rob Lamkin of Mirant used to be Southern Energy but now you must learn ho w to pronounce Mirant It sounds like mirror with an ant is searching talented people Rob writes As you know I am looking to hire a few regulatory people Any suggestions Please post in the next Burrito Done buddy Robs phone number is and his email address is Seth Wilson formerly of the Cal PX is looking for employment He is an excellent analyst he has over years experience in electricity and gas market negotiating energy contracts and energy risk management He has bo th municipal and investorowned utility experience in resource planning asset evaluation load forecasting and demandside management He is very effective communicating at all management levels and to present informatio n and recommendations to corporate officers board members and regulators I would encourage anyone interested in talking to Seth to call him at Cell Odds Ends Paul Gribik formerly of Perot Systems and now a consultant with PA Consulting handed me a great compliment He said the Friday Burrito was li ke a breath of fresh air each week He also said the Burrito was like driving on Highway between the Grapevine and Stockton where the only relief from the bleak landscape is the Harris Ranch The Burrito is the Harris Ranch I asked Paul if he wasnt confusing the Harris Ranch with the mountain of cow crap talk about a breath of fresh air miles north of the Harris Ranch in Coalinga He said no The sight and smell of the cow station only remind ed him of things going on in Sacramento Fair enough Sister Camden Collins clipped a good one from USA Today Check it out It was reported in the USA Today that Governor Davis secret weapon in the design of these innovative solutions is Jerry Springer There will be a Jer ry Springer show on the negotiations and resolutions later this month entitled Politicians That Love Mud Wrestling with Themselves Finally my bud from Modesto Ken Weisel sent me this gem with which we wil l close out the week What is electricity Todays scientific question is What in the world is electricity And where does it go after it leaves the toaster Here is a simple experiment that will teach you an important electrical lesson On a cool dry day scuff your feet along a carpet then reach your hand in to a friends mouth and touch one of his dental fillings Did you notice how your friend twitched violently and cried out in pain This teaches us that electricity can be a very powerful force but we must never use it to hurt others unless we need to learn an important electrical lesson It also teaches us how an electrical circuit works When you scuff ed your feet you picked up batches of electrons which are very small objec ts that carpet manufacturers weave into carpet so that they will attract dirt The electrons travel through your bloodstream and collect in your finger where they form a spark that leaps to your friends filling then travels down to his feet and back into the carpet thus completing the circuit AMAZING ELECTRIC FACT If you scuffed your feet long enough without touchin g anything you would build up so many electrons that your finger would explode But this is nothing to worry about unless you have carpeting Although we modern persons tend to take our electric lights radios mixers etc for granted hundreds of years ago people did not have any of these things which is just as well because there was no place to plug them in Then along came the first Electrical Pioneer Benjamin Franklin who flew a kite in a lightning storm and received a serious electrical shock This proved that lightning was powered by the same force as carpets but it also damaged Franklins brain so severely that he started speaking only in incomprehensible maxims such as A penny saved is a penny earned Eventually he had to be given a job running the post office After Franklin came a herd of Electrical Pioneers whose names have become part of our electrical terminology Myron Volt Mary Louise Amp James Wat t Bob Transformer etc These pioneers conducted many important electrical experiments Among them Galvani discovered this is the truth that when he attached two different kinds of metal to the leg of a frog an electrical current developed and the frogs leg kicked even though it was no longer attached to the frog which was dead anyway Galvanis discovery led to enormous advances in the field of amphibian medicine Today skilled veterinary surgeons can take a frog that has been seriously injured or killed implant pieces of metal in its muscles and watch it hop back into the pond just like a normal frog except for the fact that it sinks like a stone But the greatest Electrical Pioneer of them all was Thomas Edison who was a brilliant inventor despite the fact that he had little formal education and lived in New Jersey Edisons first major invention in was the phonograph which could soon be found in thousand of American homes where it basically sat until when the record was invented But Edisons greate st achievement came in when he invented the electric company Edisons design was a brilliant adoption of the simple electrical circuit The electric company sends electricity through a wire to a customer then immediately gets the electricity back through another wire then this is t he brilliant part sends it right back to the customer again This means that an electric company can sell a customer the same batch of electricity thousands of times a day and never get caught since very few customers take the time to examine their electricity closely In fact the last year any new electricity was generated was the electric companie s have been merely reselling it ever since which is why they have so much time to apply for rate increases Today thanks to men like Edison and Franklin and frogs like Galvanis we receive almost unlimited benefits from electricity For example in the pas t decade scientists have developed the laser an electronic appliance so powerful that it can vaporize a bulldozer yards away yet so precise that doctors can use it to perform delicate operations to the human eyeball provided they remember to change the power setting from Vaporize Bulldozer to Delicate DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD Okay Ive got my TV set tuned to vaporize killer tomatoes Have a great weekend gba

the abyss of the dreaded B word The State Legislature and our illustrious Governor Emperor of the Dark Side are showing a trait that heretofore I never noticed They are impotent in tackling complex issues that involve big bucks They are simply unable to manage the task I used to hold these institutions in relatively high regard Forget the bellyaching in which all taxpayers and voters engage I mean there was an element of something bigger than the PUC the ISO and the utilities when reference was made to the boys and girls working in the State Capital I a m no longer impressed I suppose there are things the Gov and the Legislature do well Let me think Well law enforcement environment transportation water agriculture education parks and recreation and health I suppose they d o all right managing those things But as for electricity it seems this top ic is like a hungry monster that chews up politicians and spits them out after sucking the political marrow from their bones The mix of money and electrons is too rich for their appetites Yet hope springs eternal Today the Governor will announce his package for curing Californias energy crisis There is one part of his plan that is good news He will announce a new component of electric rates that will increase revenue to cover the undercollected wholesale power costs of PGE and SCE The smelly parts include purchase of the transmission grid by the State thereby transferring revenue collection for the grid to the Californ ia Department of Water Resources We discuss the whole package below Howeve r it is mind boggling to me how deep the State is willing to sink to avoid a straight up rate increase I understand based on recent emails you folks have sent to me that DWR will reorganize and take on a new name Californ ia Utility Buyers Agency CUBA The head of CUBA will be S Fidel Freeman a wellknown advocate of public systems Helping Fidel fiddle at the helm wil l be Che Budraja a jungle revolutionary who steals from the rich and invest s the money in Tbills We look for great things from CUBA not the least of which will be cigars that have printed on the label The Attorney General Has Determined that Retail Competition May Be Hazardous to Our Health As the state struggles to punch its way out of the mess I have discovered a solution to our energy woes whilst in the comfort of my own home My propos al is that we ship all our teenage children to Montana for the summer This will conserve thousands of megawatts of instate electric generating capacity bring down the price of alcohol and make our roads safe The other day I entered the bedroom of my year old boy and noticed that everything electrical was humming His computer was the main focus of his attention at that moment but at the same time his TV was on the electricguitar amplifier was on standby ready all the lights were on and a CD player was filling the air with the sounds of screeching voices One megawatt may light homes so they say but it only energizes teenagers Send our teenagers to Montana I have a name for this program Energy Conserpation We Dont Give a about Saving Energy and put them on the right side of the Western grid Plenty of coal power out there and the program will lessen the need for burning natural gas to produce electricity When Montana gets tired of our million California teenagers because they emptied the state of Snicker Bars Pepsi and cellophane wrapp ed junk food well send them by bus to Mexico Our Governor and even Preside nt Bush believe that all the power we be needin is south of the border Anyway the dollar is strong relative to the peso and we can feed our beloved children snacks from Source Taco Bell with enough gorditas and chalupas until the cows come home which is soon When school restarts in the Fall the summer rolling blackout threat The ISO is in Day of a Stage Alert will be over and we can welcome home our new heroes Its a plan ISO Governing Board Chairman Ghengis Kahn is reported to be constantly reminding the ISO staff at Governing Board meetings that reality is an important element of their new strategy I wonder how he would know And PUC President Loretta Lets Do Lynch the Darth Vaderess to Davis DarkSide Emperor is reported to be loving her job at the PUC Im not making this up She actually told the San Francisco Chronicle how much she loves getting things back to the way they were before I hear that wh en she is done with electricity reform she will be assigned to work on Civil Rights Return that system back to circa The way I see it the State will enter into relatively costly longterm contracts The effect will nail consumers to default utility service by suspending direct access and in just a few years we will be back to where we were in high cost electricity against which businesses want an out because spot wholesale prices will be below the longterm price benchmark But this time we can take advantage of our hindsight to craft a bette r solution I have a suggestion Lets gather together in advance representatives of all segments of our business and develop a memorandum o f understanding The MOU will spell out a new competitive market that allows utilities by then financially upright to collect their new stranded costs Consumers will be given the Province of British Columbia soon to b e purchased by Governor Davis as a peace offering to Harvey Rosenfield All the nuclear plants will be purchased by the state and operational control will be turned over to the consumer advocates Everyone will be happy Al l we need is a Republican Governor for California in we can rely upon to enact the necessary legislation I am delighted to be back in Burritoville Phoenix was nice the crowd wa s great our speakers were terrific but I need my weekly slab of salty meat and salsa Things in the Peoples Republic of California Dr Davis Miracle Cure Phoenix Principles are on the Table Is there a Credit Committee in your future APX Announces Special Workshop on Feb Things National FERC Kicks ISO Tariff Amendment in the Chops Ohio Ushers in Retail Competition Odds Ends DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD Things in the Peoples Republic of California Dr Davis Miracle Cure As I write this weeks Burrito the Governor and his aides are trying to convince the Democratic Caucus in the state legislature that his plan has legs If it had legs then I wish it would run away Here are the major points of Dr Davis plan as I heard it yesterday afternoon Authorize DWR to acquire the high voltage transmission grid andor other assets enter into related agreements with utilities and contract for operation of transmission with utilities Direct the PUC to amend and transfer the appropriate portion of retail rates applicable to transmission from utilities to DWR Authorize revenue bond financing for acquisition and required improvement s of the transmission grid The states purchase of the transmission system is conditional upon PGEs and SCEs parent companies returning their Year tax refunds back to th e affected utility about billion extending costbased rates on native generation for additional years banning the sale of generating assets a nd dismissing the pending rate litigation against the state in federal Distric t Court If the utilities are willing to accept the deal then the state will direct the PUC to establish a Dedicated Rate Component DRC to allow recovery of portions of the utilities unrecovered costs pursuant to negotiations with the administration The state will authorize the utilities to sell revenue bonds secured by the DRC Shoot me for saying this but bankruptcy is beginning to look like an attractive alternative Sure we might not get all the money owed to the power marketers and generators but there is no guarantee of getting all th e money in the Govs plan There are loopholes big enough through which you can drive a wheeler Further shouldnt we do something to help the sta te from swallowing itself The right thing to do is say Mr Governor thank you so much You have tried mighty hard to wipe your hands clean of this mess but your plan just isnt enough Well take our chances I cant believe the Wall Street investors and bondholders will encourage the utilities to accept the offer although they might The plan has too many bureaucratic traps Too much that can go wrong and incur potentially long delays It smells bad What do you folks think Things in the Peoples Republic of California Phoenix Principles are on the Table While the Governor is busy peddling his plan last week in Phoenix our gro up also got involved with longterm and shortrun solutions to Californias electricity market About WPTF members had a discussion with a wide ran ge of ideas and options WPTF Chair Rob Lamkin and I facilitated the discussion and took notes of peoples comments Over the weekend Phil Muller helped me draft the shortterm principles in a summary document that is three pages The meaning of shortterm is recommendations that can be implemented in time for Summer of We are still working on the details and as many of you know we will teleconference next week to discuss the recommendations and hear your comments However below is a thumbnail synopsis of the seven shortterm recommendations that we are currently considering Electric price must be an incentive for energy conservation Pleas for voluntary conservation are not taken seriously unless accompanied by meaningful price signals Rely on positive incentives to achieve demand reductions Positive incentives align the interests of consumers with the need to reduce consumption and give consumers the ability to choose for themselves how to participate Market participants in the Western states should agree to a selfimposed damage control circuitbreaker mechanism for wholesale prices Market participants should individually establish for a limited time a voluntary circuitbreaker wholesale price above which their company will not charge a ny load serving entity Suppliers must be paid Suppliers who are still owed for deliveries made last October can not continue to sell power to California if they are not confident that they will be paid Temporarily ease airquality requirements to allow older power plants to operate more hours during the year Retain consumer choice options in selection of electricity suppliers A preferred alternative to the state becoming the only creditworthy party is for consumers themselves to take on the credit responsibility by purchasing directly from a third party supplier Suppliers bid data should be released on a timedelayed basis to an authorized monitor In order to satisfy the needs of both the public and the desires of the sellers a repository of suppliers bid data should be kept by an authorized market monitor that is independent of both buyer and seller influence There are major policy changes for WPTF in a few of the bullet items above Therefore the WPTF Board will need to hear from you either via email or a t next weeks teleconference We are anticipating that a Board vote will tak e place next Thursday at the earliest Things in the Peoples Republic of California Is there a Credit Committee in your future Get organized now and avoid the rush It may come to pass that we will learn a whole new facet of business That is the rules and procedures of bankruptcy I was introduced to Mr Jonathon Rosenthal of Saybrook Capital earlier this week Saybrook is an investmentbanking firm in LA that specializes in purchasing defaulted bonds from issuers going through difficult workouts and bankruptcies They represented many creditors in th e Orange County bailout in Remember that one Well currently Saybroo k is representing MBIA the largest bond insurance company in the world and a major creditor against the utilities if the utilities do not pay their bondholders MBIA is interested in discussing with other potential credito rs the role of an informal credit committee prior to a petition for bankruptcy WPTF is playing a role by introducing Saybrook and MBIA to our membership Towards that end a teleconference call has been scheduled next Tuesday for WPTF members and Saybrook Capital Because it is a members only call an d limited to potential creditors interested parties must contact me for the callin number and time If you want to learn more about Saybrook Capital their website address is wwwsaybrooknet Things in the Peoples Republic of California APX Announces Special Workshop on Feb The PX markets are gone and the ISO transmission market is a mess There are no adjustment bids to provide economic signals regarding SCs willingnes s to alter their schedules at various congested intertie points John Streme l of APX made a presentation in Phoenix last week at the WPTF general meeti ng on a proposal that APX may undertake to fill the adjustmentbid gap The folks at APX wanted me to alert you regarding the special meeting on Februa ry and encourage you to attend the workshop at their offices in Santa Clar a California Without a congestion market all SCs stand to loose millions of dollars by having schedules cut by the CAISO because there are no other short term alternatives to congestion management The investment APX will require fro m participants to develop an interim solution will be minor compared to the financial impact without it APX is asking you to attend this meeting and to confirm your desire to help fund a solution to be provided by APX Ultimately they will seek financial commitments prior to developing a solution but they believe it is feasible to have a system in place well before the summer season Due to its interi m nature APX will seek a flat fixed fee such that its planned abandonment wi ll not

is Things National FERC Kicks ISO Tariff Amendment in the Chops On Wednesday FERC issued an order that you can download at bulkpowerbulkpowerhtm The order is in response to several petitions not the least of which is the ISOs proposed Tariff Amendment The Amendment requested a relaxation of the credit requireme nt of PGE and SCE so that the ISO could continue ordering realtime generatio n to meet the load of the two major loadserving entities FERC stated that the credit requirement may be relaxed for the utilities scheduling of thei r own generation to meet their own load However for all net short purchases the ISO can not relax the credit limit The FERC wisely counsel ed the ISO to have a third party creditworthy buyer sleeve the net short schedules such as DWR A credit worthy backer said FERC would encourage more supply into the realtime market eg supplemental energy and reduc e the need for out of market calls It would be tempting to conclude that generators with ISO PGAs given the FERC Order do not have to respond to ISO calls if a credit worthy buyer is not available to back the ISO payments But I dont think that is what FER C was saying FERC was careful to avoid stepping on the toes of the US District Court that is addressing that very petition made by the ISO and under which a temporary restraining order is in effect mandating that all generators with ISO PGAs comply with ISO orders That case continues toda y in federal court in Sacramento However the FERC Order did do two things One if removed the risk that generators had the burden to sell to the ISO even if the buyers were not credit worthy Two it affirmed that reasonable price is in FERCs authority not the power buyer ie DWR Although not stated directly DWR had been chanting in word and deed that i t wouldnt pay prices that in their sole discretion were unreasonable That is the type of uncertainty that can stop a market stone cold Maybe in next weeks Burrito we will have a matrix of legal suits filed on behalf of or against our members and the state It would make things so much easier to understand You cant tell the players without a program Things National Ohio Ushers in Retail Competition Green Mountains Rick Counihan is excited about a news release regarding a community aggregation deal that his company is entering in Ohio even as California is moving to end such possibilities Green

celebration We took to the beautiful Napa Valley and enjoyed a threehour lunch on the Napa Valley Wine Train I highly recommend the journey The food is superb the train is a classic and watching the valley of wineries unfold to the rocking motion of the train is incredibly relaxing Nothing in the world not even our state energy crisis meant a thing during todays adventure The train speaks to another era a world that we might vaguely remember fr om our childhood Nothing like it exists in our daily lives today Iron steel brass and wood paneling are everywhere The girth of the train car s and engines are unlike the plastic moldings that coat our automobiles computers and modern day tools Dining in a dome car with heavy sterling silverware starched white linen attentive waiters and waitresses and classic cuisine lifts you from the humdrum of fast food to another time and place In short it was a thankful break from a stressfilled reality that is taking all of us down Dont forget to let go every now and then Okay Jobs jobs jobs It seems that many of you folks are changing jobs and others of you are eagerly trying to find people The demise of the PX certainly provides the rest

Phoenix with the other WPTF geeks enjoyin g perfect weather a little golf and party time Those of you not attending our general meeting in Old Town Scottsdale shame on you please hold down the fort in California while we are gone Be sure to turn out all the ligh ts before you go to bed At pm every night check to see that legislators are still in session debating another mindnumbing emergency session bill Pray for our Governor and our StateAppointed ISO Governing Board for they know not what they do Give an amen to direct access customers all snug and safe in the utilities bosom as default customers We really have done a bang up job here in California Who do we get to ba il out next It is the favorite topic of the day A utility bailout that is what todays newly approved legislation ABX is being called Society makes choices the utilities do what they are told at a reasonable rate of return and investments that might have been made in new electric generatio n facilities were deferred and deferred Its not a utility bailout that we are witnessing but rather a California bailout We are bailing out our own dirty mess for not providing sufficient generating capacity Have you wondered in these last few weeks why everything went south at the same time I have thought about this a lot and have determined there are no good explanations What are the odds that a capacity shortage a draught and ultrahigh natural gas prices would occur at the same time Well just as the utilities like to say with each missed payment these are forces beyond our control Let the waves hit the beach and what survives the storm survives Everything else must perish There is no electric tooth fairy to bring back the California PX or the tensofthousands of direct access customers returned to default service this week The Western Governors the US Congress and the Presidents cabinet have al l taken photo op shots at the issues I dont think those meetings will add much to the pile of solutions to our thorny problems Who knows maybe the WSCC will get a mandated price cap Would we endorse a price cap even at I dont know Some of you might support that whereas others would stay the course No price caps Of course I dont understand how a price cap of say the same cap used in other regions of the country can help us in the West The economic impact we have witnessed has come about from prices well below MWH Here is this weeks line up The Peoples Republic of California Stop the Bleeding Bill They Wrote to Me Things National California seeks to be a party in our DC Circuit Court Case against FE RC Letters A Few Thoughts by George Sladoje More Tributes to Kent Wheatland Odds Ends DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD The Peoples Republic of California Stop the Bleeding Bill ABX was signed into law today It is the most curious piece of legislation Legislate in haste and repent in leisure The Governor claimed in his press release This measure offers our best hope of avoidin g electricity rate increases in future years We will now put together a portfolio of lowcost contracts With new contracts for alternative and renewable energy sources it is my hope and expectation that we can live within the existing rate structure I have read the bill several times a nd I dont see how it is even remotely possible to avoid electricity rate increases Someday I want to be Governor Then I will have the freedom to make up the truth as I go along and voters in the State will blindly belie ve me Thats the job I want Here is the gist of the bill First that DWR will enter into long term contracts to cover PGEs and SCEs net short position The first round of bids yielded less than MW of power Hardly enough by a factor of four I reckon to cover the net short positions of both utilities Next the power delivered by those contracts will be delivered to Californias en d use customers utilizing the poles and wires of the utility distribution companies UDC Each utilitys cost for the delivered power own generation QFs bilateral deals DWR purchases and ancillary services in excess of the generation component of the UDCs rate will be called the California Procurement Adjustment The PUC has the authority to pass on so me or all of the California Procurement Adjustment to customers for the energy consumed in excess of of customers baseline quantity That sounds to me like a rate increase The first block of monthly consumption and above that will not be charged for the new Adjustment All monthly consumption above that level will get a pro rata share of the Adjustment The DWR purchases will be backed by stateissued bonds the maximum of which can not be an aggregate amount greater than the amount calculated by multiplying by a factor of four the annual revenues generated by the California Procurement Adjustment as determined by the PUC pursua nt to Section The media was reporting a billion bond bailout for the utilities but I dont see how they derived that number Currently PGE and SCE are accumulating a bill for their net short positio n of billion per month The average system load is to MWs and the average purchase price for the spot energy being purchased is aroun d kWh Assuming that longterm contracts would price the power at say kWh and at least half the net short position could be covered utilizing longterm contracts the monthly cost for the net short position would be around million and the annual figure would be billion Lets allocate the annual cost of billion over the energy consumed above the baseline quantity I have heard that of the energy consumed by customers of the three IOUs is above the baseline quantity Well assume that or of the energy consumed is above of the baseline consumption level The annual energy delivered by the ISO is roughly TWh and therefore of that is TWh The average cost per applicable kWh of uplift in a customers bill would be kWh thereby roughly doubling the current generation component of the current frozen rates Of course the additional revenue collection isnt expected to keep up with the cost of the net short position Electricity costs will fall off as gas prices ease and more supply comes on line However it is breathtaking to observe that for the kWh that are bearing the uplift the kWh rate increa se for residential customers is about and blended with the of baseli ne energy the rate increase is about Thats a lot of math to get to the same percent increase the utilities were claiming they needed to satisfy th e revenue shortfall A thirty percent increase in my PGE electric bill wou ld add between to to the monthly tab I am beginning to wonder why we Californians are making such a fuss Falling interest rates on my variablerate home mortgage will probably boost my aftertax income to per month Hell I gladly would pay a higher electric bill plus an additional to per month to assist those consumers on fixed income or otherwise unable to absorb the cost increase Are we properly focused on the right problem Another flea on this legislation is the suspension of new direct access customers during the time that DWR is procuring energy The bill states the right of retail end use customers to acquire service from other providers shall be suspended until the department no longer supplies power hereunder Voila Not only do we get a rate increase but our ability to choose an alternative energy supplier is hereby waived I would think the average Californian would be outraged by that dictate Of course most Californians didnt know that they had a choice Therefore the legislatio n made a grand leap forward by lowering our opportunity set to be in line wit h expectations I wonder what the Legislature will do next week The Peoples Republic of California They Wrote to Me On Monday the LA Times published my first Op Ed I attempted in that piec e to compare our role as electricity marketers and producers to lending institutions that offer homeloan mortgages in various riskadjusted instruments variablerate loans fixed rate loans etc The comparison i s less accurate than apt However I think we as an industry get too focus ed on things about which the public cares little Does the public need to understand how banks arbitrage loans in order for a consumer to obtain a ho me loan Does the public need to understand the workings of the internal combustion engine to drive a car So I tried my level best to describe how the consumer should view our side of the demandsupply interaction I included in the article my email address I wanted to get a feel for th e thoughts of people who would make the effort to write Even though there were only a handful of responses I was pretty much taken aback by the tone of the letters The edge in their language was sharp They generally distrust our industry sometimes confusing us with utilities I would characterize their thinking as first assume you suppliers and marketers ar e crooks and everything else flows from there Here are some excerpts I read your article in todays LA Times in which you make out that yo ur members the electrical power generators are completely innocent of any ha rm and were only trying to help Oh yeah Where did that billion dollars go It did not go to the utility companies they are on the verge of bankruptcy It went to your members who are laughing all the way to the ba nk at our predicament As a consumer in the SCE service area I was disappointed with your analog y or comparison of variablerate home loans with the current high cost of energy Variablerate home loans offer more disclosure to consumers than t he information that was provided to residential consumers and possibly the legislature that weighed in on AB exactly how stupid do you think we are you assholes buy the politicians rig the bidding process and then say we should quit calling you names after you have stolen billions from people who work for a living Ed This response won the Miller Brewing CoWriters Guide Award for Keen Articulati on Under Dim Light I dont mind paying for a service that I use and makes my life comfortable but BIG BUSINESS is playing with us once again and this is NOT RIGHT The State of California has grown in the last decade and no new power plants They were warned about their lack of future vision for not allowin g new power plants to be built and now were paying the price as usual This boom to bust cycle in oil natural gas and now electric energy is we ll chronicled and almost always precipitated by gaming on the supply side of the equation namely OPEC Personally I think it is high time the Fed eral Government or the State of California started investing in and buildin g nuclear power plants with a vengeance again Things National California seeks to be a party in our DC Circuit Court Case against FE RC I attended the Electric Power Supply Association EPSA annual meeting in Palm Desert this week It was a really nice event and the speakers were excellent Among the guests was former FERC Chairman Jim Hoecker I chatted with him about our dilemma in California regarding the Stateappointed ISO Governing Board and he admitted that we must do all we can to give the FERC Staff more spine I was thinking about a steel rod a nd the FERC staff in a compromising position but more on that later I asked Citizen Jim what he was going to do for a living now that he is ri d of his Commission robe He said he was thinking about hanging a sign aroun d his neck Will Regulate for Food but he wasnt quite sure Mr Lockyer Californias Attorney General who did not attend the EPSA conference filed in our case against FERC to appear as Amicus Curiae I am not a Latin scholar but that means Strange Friend before the DC Circuit Court of Appeals For cases involving highvoltage electricity I think the re should be an AC Circuit Court But more on that later The petition state s In the event that the Court concludes that the new California legislation ABX does not moot this appeal we respectfully request the opportunit y to submit a brief on the preemption issues inherent in this litigation within a reasonable period of time as determined by the Court Yeah come on in I want this case to get a little wider Last Friday ou r attorney Bracewell Patterson and FERCs counsel made oral arguments before the Court The ordeal took minutes and the judges asked pretty tough questions The new StateAppointed Governing Board is doing its best to gum up the works Yesterday they met for a second time had a completely revised agenda and proposed to meet in executive session to discuss how the transmission system works Further in executive session individual membe rs of the ISO executive team were called in one by one to appear before the Board My guess is that each had to take a secret oath swearing allegianc e to the Governor Chairman Kahn and the Dark Side But more on that later Letters A Few Thoughts by George Sladoje I asked California PX CEO George Sladoje to write a letter to the Burrito expressing his thoughts at this difficult time Here is what George wrote Dear Gary As you know the California Power Exchange has begun to wind up its affairs with the intention of closing its doors soon In fact our last DayAhead auction will probably take place in the coming week Note it closed last Wednesday While I believe that our leaving the power scene will ultimately hurt the consumers and businesses of this state I am most disappointed that the outstanding efforts of nearly dedicated hard working and innovative employees and contractors ultimately could not withstand the environment we find ourselves in today In my working career of nearly years it can t be I have never witnessed an effort of the magnitude that our group has given CalPX began with much opposition and really no passionate support In the end we still had no real advocates though everyone claimed to support the concept of a transparent fair and honest price under rules that did not discriminate and that everyone could follow The final indignity was our attempt to fight the arbitrary discriminatory and unconstitutional aspects of the December FERC order as it pertained to CalPX The Governors office the EOB and the CPUC declined to support us even though the order was in effect directed largely at those bodies They were content to let CalPX be the scapegoat for high prices in the West Only the WPTF stepped forward and your group is to be commended f or taking a stand Our major operational setback was our inability to persuade users to participate in our forward market which would have spared California much o f the current chaos we are now experiencing In January at our first meeting to develop these contracts I told our management group that these forward contracts would establish us as a major financial institution and that they would become the springboard to a successful deregulated market Instead when we introduced them in the summer they were greeted with a ya wn and only grudgingly utilized Suddenly in June of every expert from Washington D C to Berkeley began proclaiming the value of forward contracting Today the IOUs continue to obscure their reluctance to participate in this market claiming they were victims of a forced spot market Generators on the other hand have apparently never supported exchange based forwards for their own reasons Our goal of developing the first real futures products i n this business will not be achieved I find it ironic that today we are in court over guess what d forward contracts that the IOUs didnt really em brace anyway Just imagine if they saved billion in seven months without really trying Anyway the Burrito has consistently been one of the few of hundreds of emails that I receive each week that I look forward to Keep up the good work To all of your readers d good luck and keep plugging away There are tremendous possibilities ahead Finally the concept of exchange based power products is a good one and is the right way to go It has worked in other countries and will work in othe r areas of this country Unfortunately it cant be done in California at this time Thanks and good luck Letters More Tributes to Kent Wheatland This Sunday at pm the family of our friend and colleague Kent Wheatland who passed away on January will hold a memorial service Information about the service is posted on a web site managed by Kents brother The address is kent If you are in the B ay Area on Sunday afternoon please consider attending Here are some more notes I received from fellow WPTF members about Kent Jimmy Thomas who is recently retired from Dynegy Although I did not work with Kent closely the few personal encounters were memorable His zest for life is what sticks with me No matter the conversation his smile was infectious You could feel the joy he had in a ll he did When we discussed business he smiled as though he was ahead of yo u with your thoughts When we discussed pleasure he smiled as though to say Ive done that and would like you to join me next time It was my pleasure to know Kent We should all learn the lesson of his attitude and how it impacts everyone who comes into contact I pray in earnest for his family I pray that they will find peace and ca lm and reconciliation in the loss of Kent at such a young age I pray that hi s family will find the meaning and reasons for God wanting Kent to come home I pray that God will reveal His truths to Kents family so they will experience comfort through their sorrow Kent will be missed but I know his smile is still infecting all around himin an eternal way now From SCUG buddy and Dynegy friend Jolly Hayden I have so many good memories of Kent his sense of humor his wit and his unbelievable intelligence I learned so much from him He kept me on my toes he was a blast to argue with we could go for days on a single topic and often did via phone calls and email His passion was phenomenal he loved this stuff It was a privilege and honor to have know n Kent these last few years From Max Bulk of the California PX I was shocked to read about Kent While I didnt know him as well as yo u I highly respected him and thoroughly enjoyed his company His ability to inject humor into dry and often confrontation situations was wonderful Hi s passing is truly our loss One memory to share It was one of the CMR meetings towards the end of th e process I think where the ISO was introducing subjects willynilly with almost no forethought Kent had been particularly vocal in his condemnatio n of the more ridiculous proposals and when he took the mike ISO staff visibl y winced Kent never losing his smile tore into Kellan about the rapid timeline and apparent disorganization As he neared his crescendo he said Ive got one more question for you Whats up with the ISO logo Is that a drowning dolphin or what From Dynegys Dave Francis I have often commented that this business is still about people While our coworkers may come and go the bonds of friendship carry over time and distance It warms me to know that my feelings about Kent are shared acros s our industry Everytime I am at the Sacramento Sheraton I distinctly remember Dennis Flaherty and I speaking with Kent about the market while standing in the courtyard I believe that was the beginning of getting him here where he belonged Man he was a good guy So to the extent Im abl e to express it thank all of you Greg Blue former Chair of WPTF wrote the following One of the most cherished moment I had with Kent was in one of his first weeks of employment at Dynegy he was able to join us at a Dynegy sponsored golf tournament Coming from the CPUC they did not get to participate in many corporate golf outings Kent was all smiles as he came in with a scor e of He was then told that in order to work at Dynegy he had to take go lf lessons Kent also had one thing that you cannot teachenthusiasm Written by Jeff Roarke of Mirant formerly Southern Energy You know given everything that has been going on in the power markets this just seems to be part of it all One more thing Kent was always a huge presence at the meetings that I went to But as we know those stakeholder meetings are gone forever too Combine it with the death of the PX and it is a very sobering set of circumstances Finally Dennis Flaherty formerly of Dynegy and now with Cynergy wrote a long letter of which a part I have included here Over a couple of beers in the Sacramento Hyatt bar one evening Kent a nd I philosophized on life His conclusion was that we should not be sadden ed by our departure from this world but instead we should embrace the departure thinking that the person isnt gone but instead the person s spirit now fills the earth wind water and fire So now that you Kent have departed us I ask all whom you left in this world to remember you our dear friend colleague and loved one not for the person you were but for the spirit you share with us all So when we feel that brisk breeze dancing on our necks or when we see that rare beautiful flower let us remember to embrace your philosophy and to strive to replicate and share the feeling yo u provided to all of us We all should consider ourselves the most fortunate people in the world for having the opportunity to see all the beautiful aspects of the world rolled into one very special human spirit we knew as Kent Wheatland A final note for Burrito readers I will be asking the WPTF Board of Directors to honor Kent by naming an award in his name The Kent Wheatland Award will be given to special people in our industry who share the passion Kent had for doing the right thing and persisting under any set of circumstances both favorable or unfavorable I hope that Gregg Wheatland Kents surviving brother will help us select suitable candidates and in s o doing keep our departed friends name alive We wont give up that easily Odds Ends Responses for the WPTF General Meeting on February

The bigger the missed payment the more they care And how we Californians care about the potentially biggest missed payment of the Century Hey I ca n say that now and be telling the truth John Yurkanin COO of the PX was telling me at the end of our phone conversation yesterday You know Gary you might be the only friend I have left anymore I informed John that if my friendship was so prized then he was in big trouble A situation like that rates TPCs Totally Pathetic Circumstance But hey John stick with me dont worry about a thing Were going to get through this Now lets take an inventory of this weeks crises There is the electric shortage crisis We entered the Stage Alert zone Thursday afternoon and early this morning There is the natural gas payasyouburn crisis Most of you natural gas sellers have determined that PGE might not be the secured buyer they once were There is the cash crisis Our two major utilities ha ve no liquid funds to pay their energy bills Mush all three crises together and you get a new word Egash Like our State Motto Eureka which me ans I have found it we can exclaim Egash Im Screwed And everyone is starting to feel some of the pain The ESPs or what remai ns of that class of market participants were informed by PGE that the paymen t of the PX credit for the directaccess customer bills the ESPs are due unde r consolidated billing are henceforth suspended The rate freeze ended last August so the logic goes PGE doesnt need to acknowledge the PX credit That puts a serious breach of contract kink in the ESPUtility relationship Of course who is going to write about hundreds of millions of dollars of short payments when you can write about billions of dollars of short payments I mean who cares about the financial well being of the remainin g competitors to the UDCs Let them fold their tent California customers dont want a choice of energy provider do they I dont know Its gettin g too easy to be cynical Commissioner Carl Wood also handed out a couple of late Christmas gifts H e ruled that QFs under Standard Offer Contracts could at most be paid MWH regardless of the SO formula for energy payment The QFs have to buy wintertime natural gas at market prices and their production costs ar e easily in the range of MWH What a great idea Force MW or so of remaining SOQF capacity to voluntarily shut down at a time when that capacity is so desperately needed I know I have been picking on Mr Wood a lot This week we served on the same FM radio talk show KQEDs Forum I hate to admit this but Carl is really a nice person I dont like disagreeing with people who are basical ly decent Thats is why I would rather gently tease people like Mike Florio rather than outandout disagree with him I figure that deep inside thes e misguided souls there is a crossed wire that gives them the wrong answer to every major policy question Carl and I started talking about good places to get corned beef sandwiches as we were leaving the studio and he was positively effusive about some delicatessens he has frequented in Orange County I asked Carl are you Jewish He said yes that he grew up in a Jewish section of Baltimore Carl I confessed you dont look Jewish and you talk like a Communist Whats your story So we laughed about th at and chatted away as he walked to his car at the radio station parking lot and I walked to mine I asked him Carl what did you think of that Mark Twain quote I used to dance on your Deregulation is Dead statement when I said that rumors of deregulations death have been greatly exaggerated H e replied From the moment I uttered those words on the dais of the PUC hearing room I feared someone was going to tag me with that Twain quote And it was I Nettie Hogue was the other panelist on the FM show She spoke of the desir e for a corenoncore split of the default customers whereby the small customers would be core and the large customers would be noncore The UDC s would be required to procure for the core but not for the noncore The larger customers who have the ability and the resources could negotiate longterm contracts with suppliers other than the UDC If you take her platform and tweak it a little you get something that looks very much lik e our Morro Bay principle for releasing the greater than kW connected load customers from UDC default service There is wrinkle in TURNs plan however They want to keep all the retain ed generating assets eg PGEs hydro plants for the core procurement portfolio I dont think the customers in the noncore group are going to like that They contributed revenue requirement to those retained plants too They will want a credit for their contributions On the other hand if PGE and SCE were to transition to the corenoncore split you can be assured the Utility Companys will charge both core and noncore classes fo r the carried stranded costs the undercollection of revenue from todays frozen rate debacle The saw cuts both ways Speaking of saws our Governor simply did one bang up job on the State of t he State message last Monday night Now that I am a semiprofessional talking head Give Us Quote I was lined up by four news reporters prior to the address to standby with my opinion on the Governors speech I was diplomatic sort of to the press Let me tell you what I really thought He stunk up the joint I couldnt believe how nervous he was during the delivery I can understand a few slurred words or a mispronunciation or two But Gray was grim As he rockandrolled into the guts of his comments he sounded more and more like Mr Rogers Can you say Eminent Domain He said at the outset that he wasnt going to assign blame or poin t fingers I was just a little hopeful that he would be conciliatory in tone Not He ranted and raved for forty minutes half of which was bashing you folks for being well you folks You are selling his power out of State What is wrong with you people Portland based Avistas Linda Hamilton wrot e me a note and as an aside asked quite entertainingyour governor Somehow I have yet to put together how he intends to solve the problem We dont get it either Linda It is a mystery Okay Egash heads Lets get it on Things in the Peoples Republic of California PX has Writ all over it What are they doing in DC We have a Winner Letters Odds Ends General Meeting on February and Tell Us If Your Company will be Represented at the FERC Jan Meeting WPTF accepts th Member Things in the Peoples Republic of California PX has Writ all over it The California PX did something that SCE couldnt do last week That is they got a federal court to take notice on a Writ for a stay on aspects of FERCs December Order The Writ asked the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal s to Stay the FERC Orders prohibition against the IOUs selling into the PX Make such sales voluntary rather than mandatory Stay the April termination of the PXs CTS rate schedule because a termination halts forward longterm trading in the PXs block forward marke t for contract deliveries that extend beyond April and Stay the requirement that the PX implement the breakpoint The WPTF Board deliberated on whether or not the group should support the P X in their petition The discussion was lengthy and the vote took several days of email correspondence between Directors Yesterday the Board approved its support and filed such with the Court all parties and FERC At the same time the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals acted to set the question of whether it should grant a writ of mandamus to the PX and a stay of the December th order The Ninth Circuit set the matter for oral argument on Wednesday February at pm in Pasadena Each side will be allowed minutes to present their argument The three issues to b e argued are the issues raised by the PX in its motion for rehearing and stay Good luck gang Things in the Peoples Republic of California What are they doing in DC This segment of the Burrito should be hilarious I will attempt to describ e what I think is happening at the negotiations in Washington DC between th e utilities our generator and power marketing members and the State The reason this will be laughable is that I dont have a clue what those people are doing nor does the press Some press people have called me to see if I know That is a sure sign they are raking the bottom of the barrel Plus when you folks in DC read this you will mutter It didnt happen that way at all But without hard evidence the best thing to do is make it up as you go along Hey it works for the PUC There are several issues on the table In the general area of deferred payments and the like I think there is general agreement that something c an be worked out I bet that was concluded early on in the discussions However I believe the sticking point in the negotiations is the longterm forward contract prices The State wants to look tough and get a to kWh price The sellers need a lot of backend revenue recovery and securi ty to provide such Contract length of a decade or more may be required But more difficult than contract term are the payment safeguards required on th e part of the buyers to secure a lengthy contract How will the sellers hold the buyers feet to the fire forcing the buyers to pay the contract price when future spot prices are well below the contract price Will the State guarantee no regulatory out No State agency much less the Governors office could make assurances that bind future administrations So how can the sellers be sure they will be paid during the out years when the contrac ts are attractive to the sellers and less attractive to the buyers Banks will not finance deals especially multibillion dollar undertakings if there is a regulatory out clause in the contracts That clause alone could make the contracts worthless The clock is ticking too The Bush team is set to move into the White Hou se in ten days and in preparation for the new FERC Chairman Hoecker announce d his resignation effective January The Chairman despite the faults we may assign to him did one hell of a stand up job during his tenure I thi nk his greatest failure led to his greatest success He failed when he negotiated with the ISO and the State of California to allow the State some role in the governance of the ISO and the PX vis a vis SB That was a regrettable slip for which we are still paying the consequences Hoeckers greatest moment was his fierce opposition to the barrage of political pressure from California politicians to solve Californias problems with a regional price cap I never thought he would stand up to that kind of pressure Back to our folks in DC If I were one of them I would let the utilities talk their hearts out about the need for reasonable longterm contract prices I would then show them the security I would need to provide those reasonable prices without me taking on any incremental risk The utiliti es would tell me they are unable to provide the necessary assurances and I would sit back and say to them Okay lets talk about a higher average price And around and around it would go Time is on our side The new federal administration will be more sympathetic to my goals of competition and deregulation So why not wait If the contract talks fail then whose fault would that be Here is my advice to you folks freezing in the Nations Capital SIGN NOTHING Help the utilities with deferred payment schedules but hold the line on the longterm forward price until the buyers and the buyers regulatory agencies get realistic Things in the Peoples Republic of California We have a Winner Just when you thought you have seen it all along comes the superduper winner of the Longest Petitioners Title in a Regulatory Filing category We also issue a companion award for the longest coffee order at Starbucks Okay Im not making this one up The Chief Legal Counsel for the Californ ia State Auditor filed at FERC the following motion OPPOSITION OF CALIFONRIA BUREAU OF AUDIT TO EMERGENCY MOTION OF MARKET PARTICIPANTS TO REQUIRE THAT THE CALIFORNIAINDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR CORPORATION AND CALIFORNIA POWER EXCHANGE MAKE NO DISCLOSURES OF CONFIDENTI AL INFORMATION IN OTHER PROCEEDINGS UNLESS THERE IS IN PLACE A PROTECTIVE ORDE R OR CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT THAT IS SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSIONS MODEL PROTECTIVE ORDER AND MOTION TO SHORTEN TIME FOR ANSWERS OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE TO STAY AND DISCLOSURE PENDING COMMISSION CONSIDERATION OF THE EMERGENCY MOTION What the hell does that mean I would hate to get an email from the Auditors Counsel The subject heading may be longer than the mbyte on my download size limit Letters A letter from APXs Jack Ellis who is based in London and soon to return t o the Bay Area for more than just a weeks visit sent me the following Theres so much being written about this whole situation that it is impossible for a mere mortal to read it all every day California has turn ed from a mess into a disaster which raises an interesting question The Governor and Commissioner Wood among others have made very strong statements against the while idea of a deregulated really a competitive electricity market However I think we have to ask ourselves if deregulating an electricity market is such a terrible idea given the experience in other countries Scandinavia for example has an extremely successful market that has been operating for ten years without the problem s that have become endemic in California Same for Germany the UK and several other European countries Prices are reasonable customers have choice and the market works well by any account Could it be that competitive markets are actually a pretty good idea done right but Californ ia went about it the wrong way Thank you Jack We look forward to seeing you back here where things are a little less static You might miss Western Europe On the other hand giv en some of the actors in our local California power play it may become more obvious to you why the Dark Ages lasted years The next letter is from BPAs Don Wolfe who asks the philosophers stone question Why He says Concerning the CPUC proposed criteria for forward procurement you specula te that they are confusing physical hedging with physical delivery Although I dont claim to have mastered the nuances of hedging versus delivery my impression was that their goal was less technical that is to eliminate th e traders and any intermediate transactions likely based on the belief that prices are marked up as power changes hands The result is de facto reregulation with suppliers and loads bound to one another in longterm forward contracts with prices subject to close scrutiny and approval leaving only a residual nearterm and realtime markets When thats done what sort of competitive market is there From an anonymous friend I received this critique of my style The author said Im sorry Gary but your Gou Jing and Speedy Bailout analogy is just too damn onesided The generators are gouging in a very imabalanced market a nd youre pretty much saying that the utilities should bear the brunt of the failure of the market What viable business ever made a deal to absorb the cost when prices got out of whack Why shouldnt the consumers pay the fair market price for the electricity theyre consuming If the price isnt fair and they dont want to pay it why not use less energy It is a commodity for chrissakes I just turn off the lights when I think my bi ll is going to be too high My hackles go up thinking that the generators can just raise the price as they see fit As difficult for you as it is to accept the State of California actually needs the utilities to transmit and distribute electricitydo you know any other entity with the means to keeps your lights on Well yes and no Any transmission operator can do the same job regardless of the location and type of physical assets One can buy that kind of expertise in the labor market As to market failures and such I suppose this letter demonstrates that there is a deep hurt or emotional wrench fr om being on the wrong side of an unhedged bet I know I would feel the same w ay if the decision were mine to hedge against the downside If I didnt and prices moved against me then I would pay the consequences I would also fe el angry and foolish Here we have millions of people who are feeling not on ly the economic pain of someone elses stupid decision but adding insult to injury the decision was not in the consumers hands It was definitely outside the reach of the people who will one way or another pay the bill I remain unmoved that the fault is the generators and power marketers They are and have been doing what they have always been trained to do manage risk pick positions and relentlessly pursue opportunities Sorry I thin k the anger directed toward the generators and power marketers is totally misplaced Finally Phil Muller of SDC Energy responded to last weeks anonymous ruminations about those greedy power marketers Here is what Phil said As I look back on this weeks burrito and in particular the anonymous critique of high prices I cant help but working on these analogies a bit to add in some forgotten reality Lets start with the cattle business analogy This is exactly the way cattl e producers run their businesses Lets say the rancher actually grazes his cattle on government range land at low cost which allows him to raise many head of cheap cattle that is sold to McDonalds to make Big Macs The price that McDonalds is willing to pay for his beef has not gone up he doesnt g et to set the price for his product remember in fact it is at a low level because people are eating fewer big macs The reason that hay is worth per bale is that theres a shortage of hay and ranchers who are raising pri me beef for Mortons or breeding stock or thoroughbred race horses are willing to pay that much because of the value of their livestock By selling his h ay for Old McDonald is making it possible for more valuable animals to be fed rather than wasting hay to feed scrawny cattle that no one wants to buy The fact that hes idling his land and equipment means that he might have the time and money to invest some of his excess profits in upgrading his ranch to maybe allow him to grow more beeves more efficiently in the future This is a damned good way to run a business The gas station example is another good one In this case a monopoly sell er uses his market power to achieve the maximum possible return Just suppose this actually happened What would you do if you pulled into a gas station and were told that youd be charged gallon for gas because your tank w as empty If it were a matter of life or death you might buy as little as possible to get you to the next gas station Otherwise you might call AAA or someone to come to your rescue and deliver enough gas to get you out of there Or you might just leave your car there and hitch a ride to the next gas station If this gas station owner were able to pull this off with any frequency however you might decide to get into the gas business yourself and open a station nearby to provide gas at slightly lower prices We all know what happens then competition Finally moving to the airline analogy going from the bottom and working up is exactly what happens in the electricity market If you have demand responsiveness the first consumers to stop using are those unwilling to pa y the lowest high price When youre getting MWh prices it means that everyone is willing to pay that price the price is not being passed through to the consumer or the consumer is not aware of the price level Unfortunately in our overregulated deregulated market the second and thi rd results are what happen most of the time There are only ways to ration electricity during a shortage by price o r by prescribed rolling blackout I never would have thought that several anonymous analogies would inspire s o much Egash Odds Ends General Meeting on February and Have you made your hotel reservations at the Old Scottsdale Marriott for th e evening of February The cut off date for the cheaper hotel rate is January next Tuesday The phone number

week there was a discussion regarding the upcoming FERC technical conference on market monitoring to be held on Janua ry at the FERC headquarters building in DC It was understood by several of the WPTF Board members that days before the meeting the ISO staff will release a policy or position paper on market monitoring A suggestion was made that any and all WPTF members who might attend that meeting should wor k together on a joint position paper that would collect our opinions and idea s in response to the ISO position and promote any new concepts that we might develop Therefore could you please email to me the attendees from your company to the FERC meeting We will set up a future conference call to assemble a group and discuss the merits of different market monitoring ideas The purpose of the group effort is that a joint response to the ISO position ma y be more efficient and timely Any discussion WPTF conducts on market monitoring will be an advocacy response to anticipated policies that may emanate from the ISO and FERC Odds Ends WPTF accepts th Member We are still growing WPTFs th member and seventeenth general member i s Xcel Energy Marketing Xcel is located in

principles This is the last Burrito for the Year I like you need some time of f although I doubt that will happen Just take a quick look at the events of the last three weeks Can you believe what we have been through From FER C Orders to emergency filings to onagain suspended and then onagain rat e stabilization filings data subpoenas credit crunch and dont forget some wickedly high price spikes I have been unhappy with the public image our industry portrays I feel there needs to be a stronger more effective group public relations media blitz that has yet to materialize I asked one journalist with whom I have had several interviews When you write a column who is your audience S he said she writes as if she was explaining the matter to her mother Its an old journalists trick Amazed at the answer I decided to call my mother and ask her what she thought about the whole electric situation After all she qualifies as a typical fixedincome California resident living in a retirement community i n Laguna Hills Mom I asked what do you make of the whole situation Oh I am disgusted she chirped with that Supreme Court ruling Thats no democracy No not that situation Mom I said to calm her down bu t the electricity restructuring thing Well she sighed everyone is worried about their electric bills How much are they going up And why havent you called me more often I could have died and my children would be the last to know Every tag line has a message So there it is If you want a simple view that people understand then the re it is People are worried about their electric bill The reasons for the increase are of less concern than how much their bills may go up All the blather about forward contracts alleged gouging Stage emergencies governance jurisdiction and FERC Orders is not on the minds of ordinary California citizens They want to know how much more they are going to hav e to pay And they are worried Focus then on how we as an industry will help We want to hold down consumer electric bills in three different ways by adding new generation by giving people more choice as to their energy provider and by assuring ther e is always a provider of last resort to keep the

Ever DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDD Things in the Peoples Republic of California Fellow Travelers on the Peace Train I want you folks throughout the Western Region to know that you have a protector Someone is watching out for your interests and concerns His name amigos is Senator Steve Peace Our Herr Peace wrote to FERC Commissioner Hoecker on December a letter that is suitable for plastic covered place mats at your dining table You can guess why He heard abou t the MWH prices quoted for MidC on Monday He wrote Today the LA Time reported that Kaiser Aluminum Corp the secondlarge st US aluminum maker said it will shut its smelter in Mead Wash for about months and lay off about employees Kaiser said it had resold the electricity it was to received this month from the BPA netting proceeds of million or nearly nine times the million that the company has earned so far this year I read this passage to the WPTF Board at our meeting in Phoenix Kent Wheatland said Thats the finest example of demand response I have ever heard Indeed Kent hit the nail on the head Why is the Peacemeister decrying the very thing that we have been begging for The socalled inelastic demand curve for electricity just got less steep But never min d that read the next paragraph of Peaces letter It is clear that neither the prospect of postOctober refunds ordered under Section will be adequate to discipline marketers behavior Marketers know full well that FERC simply doesnt have the resources to police this wholesale market and that the odds are that they can act with impunity Moreover they know they have a fellow traveler in your colleagu e Commissioner Hebert who sees the prospect of the lights going out in California as a vindication of his positions on price caps rather than as the public disaster such an event would beFellow traveler I didnt kn ow they let commies on the FERC All aboard on the Peace train I explained to the WPTF Board that every passenger on the Peace Train would receive a complimentary fellowtraveler luggage set with matching redherring leather In the luggage will be free gifts essential for any fellow traveler such a s a price cap with earflaps nose guard and blinders to cover the eyes T he hear no evil smell no evil see no evil price cap is excellent for California regulators who repeatedly request these odious price caps as the blunt instrument of choice Caps come in a choice of hard metal or soft wool Another item in the fellow traveler goodie bag will be Peaces latest best selling book How to win friends and influence

AB Restructuring Map showing by colo r code the jurisdictional boundaries of the different regulatory agencies Yellow is reserved for the State of California and it covers the entire lower the Province of British Columbia and Cleveland Ohio Things in the Peoples Republic of California SCEs Bryson Rattles the Restructuring Cage Not to be outdone by Herr Peace SCE Sufferin Chutzpah Edison issued a press release by its CEO John Bryson calling for dramatic reform of the California electricity market I know this will shock you but now that S CE has recovered most but not all of its stranded costs they want to revers e the engine of progress and reregulate Californias electric system Guess how By allowing utilities to once again be charged with the responsibility to plan for acquire and assure sufficient power to meet the states needs without the threat of interruption By charging costbased rates By protecting customers Hallelujah Lets talk about a few things here First lets discuss the credit issue that is plaguing the Pacific Northwest power producers who are increasingly unwilling to sell supplemental energy into California The last I checked most PNW producers paid their counterparties on a day basis but receive the cash from ISO about days after the trade day The PNW producers mu st cover their owed position by borrowing funds and at the prices posted in the last two weeks the credit limit has been reached Where is the securi ty for the payment It lies not with the ISO but with the utilities who are the major customers Therefore if the utilities undercollect because froz en rates are below wholesale prices then the utilities accumulate a debt If the debt continues unabated then the credit rating companies downgrade the UDC ratings That has occurred several times in the last few months If t he utilities claim bankruptcy or refuse to pay the PX then the PX cant pay the ISO the ISO cant pay the sellers and the PNW sellers are kaput This is my longwinded way of saying that two entities still hold all the cards at least for now in the region SCE and metoo PGE They have th e leverage to bring the whole system to its knees Hark recall that WPTF ha s continually called for a breakup of the UDCs default customer base for thi s very reason We argued that two dominant buyers could extract monopsony rents from sellers And here it is big time What does Bryson have to lose by rattling the cage Nothing In fact it is so delicious to watch for the umpteenth time SCE exercise brute force whe n they have an advantage You must respect that The golden rule aptly applies Those who have the gold make the rules Another aspect of Brysons gambit is that he is playing a trump card on his buddy the Governor who as of last week through the PUC suspended the requests of Edison and PGE for rate increases starting next January Davi s has painted himself into a corner and is no match for the cunning of the Sufferin Chutzpah gang I predicted that Davis would stumble and fall on electricity matters I didnt expect it to happen so soon Do you think the public will buy Brysons argument To tell you the truth Im not sure Things in the Peoples Republic of California Rate Relief Reviewed Again Well in a complete reversal the CPUC put back on the docket list the rate stabilization plans for PGE and Edison Last week President Lynch suspended both companies applications denying them the right to raise rat es subject to refund Now this week Lynch allowed for the rate stabilizatio n applications to be reopened and duly considered Next Tuesday I will be on the local San Francisco station KQED FM t o debate the merits of electric competition with the likes of Lynch and TURN s Netie Hogue I did this last September on the same onehour callin show that begins at am I didnt know it was a callin show until the calle rs started firing crazy questions at the panelists If you are in the area then listen in and better yet call in Ask Ms Lynch a few questions wi ll you I listened to a taped interview Ms Lynch did on another local station KCB S that aired last Sunday Here are some of her more memorable quotes There is plenty of power in California There is no shortage It is ju st not being managed properly on a day to day basis There are power plants th at should be available right now but are not running The State of California has MW of power available at any hour Plant unavailability is an artificial issue There is plenty of power i f they power plants run The PUC is trying to figure out what is wrong The plant owners only give the ISO oneword explanations such as boiler or fire We are sending our inspection team in to better understand the problems I wont speculate as to price manipulation but last summer we saw very suspicious bids and offers More power plants have been approved during the first two years of the Dav is administration than in all the years of the Wilson administration This week the State stepped in to save the system by turning off lights an d computers The ISO is governed by a board made up of individuals from the utilities a nd the power sellers There is one consumer representative and one environmental representative The San Diego economy couldnt stand the price volatility of last summer The former Governor Pete Wilson administration created the wholesale pow er market The market design of the PX is counterintuitive It takes the highest pri ce bid and pays it to everyone So if you offer MWH for a MW and another person offers for a MW then both parties get Things FERC and Federal Secretary Richardson Serves Smashed Salmon Pate Mr Richardson is the US Secretary of Energy Most people dont know him nor have ever heard of him Last Wednesday with only four weeks left in h is job he decided to take a bold step He did something Richardson invoked a rarely used authority in the Federal Power Act to require outofstate generators and marketers to sell into California upon demand The Section of the statute cited had not been invoked since World War II If it was good enough then then it is good enough now Richardson also ordered BPA and WAPA to ship as much power to California as possible In a way the Order worked Because of credit issues outofstate parties have been loath to violate their credit policies just to sell to California Hence the imports into California became scarce and the ISO was teetering on another Stage Alert yesterday morning Because of the Order BPA started drafting from its hydro reserves somewhere in the neighborhood of MW and PowerEx delivered another MW From where did this power emanate Clearly in the case of BPA they are selling to California at the risk of being unable to meet their own requirements later this year and next No rain and cold weather could put BPA in a world of hurt Further the increased hydro spill may effect salmon I sent by email to Mr Richardson that included some wonderful recipes for the damaged salmon I mean what do you do with tons of smashed salmon that you would otherwise love to eat Pates souffls patties chilled ground winter run smashed spring run primavera roasted mashed fall run You na me it We can whip up a mess of smashed salmon for just about any occasion And the added benefit is that California gets to continue the holiday seas on festively with lights on without interruption I was reminded of a letter written to the Burrito last year It was a phon y announcement that in retrospect wasnt far off Do you remember it Exclusive Christmas Lights Cause Crisis Due to increased evening ramps caused by heavy Christmas light loads the California Independent System Operator ISO will begin running a series of Public Service Announcements PSAs this week designed to lessen electricit y reliability concerns Because homeowners tend to turn their Christmas lights on at dusk there is a surge of electricity demand that can create havoc on the balancing act between generators and users of power The ads will request that homes with odd numbered addresses turn on their Holiday lights between pm and even numbered homes between pm According to Kellan Flukiger ISO Vice President of Operations the rationi ng is required to avert an electricity crisis Were seeing extreme ramps tha t are causing demands on the grid well use this voluntary process for now t o try and manage the problem The Author has learned however that the ISO intends to turn to a more direct approach to control the problem after December th Tariff Amendme nt g a little known document that to date has been internal to the California ISO could have a major impact on the Holiday plans of Californians The memo calls for some combination of a twopronged attack to keep Californians from all turning on their Christmas lights at the same ti me The biggest question outside of the deliveries of BPA and PowerEx is what price is being paid for the power ordered by the California ISO The Order states that power will be sold to the ISO at a level that would ensure generators receive a fair return Whats that I know that some of the Northwest power producers are sleeving their sales through creditworthy third parties But other than that I am not sure of the details Things FERC and Federal WPTF Supports PX Emergency Filing The Power Exchange filed an emergency motion on Monday to keep alive its energy markets in light of the emergency changes made by the ISO the previo us Friday The PX requested an emergency order from FERC removing the hard cap on Adjustment Bids and replacing it with an energy price equivalent th at allows forward buyers and sellers to transact ahead of the ISO realtime market Currently the ISO hard caps the Adjustment Bids at MWH whic h becomes the zonal price if congestion is present The mix of hard and soft caps pushes more people into the realtime market and wipes out much of th e supply that would otherwise show up in the forward markets The WPTF Board filed comments with FERC on Wednesday supporting the PXs motion The ISO filed against the PX motion and the ISO offered a plan of their own Copies of our filing can be found along with all our other FER C and PUC filings on our web page If you dont have a password for our website wptforg then email and request such She will be glad to assist you Mailbag I received so many great emails that I dont know where to begin Its like opening presents Julie Blunden of Greenmountain Energy wrote to me in response to the old boys club inherent in the utility industry She said Gary not only is power no longer a boys club but as I continue to meet all of our new folk s in Austin I think its hysterical that I meet so many of them in the womens room What a difference years makes Were all reading the burrito voraciously these days these are historic and painful times Julie I would like to meet as you do some of your colleagues in Austin Julies fellow traveler careful Rich Counihan also wrote to me He sai d I think your point and Commissioner Heberts on the importance of PR is crucial As a result the energy retailers have changed their name from Alliance for Retail Markets ARM to Competitive Retail Energy for Consumer s CREC and hired a PR firm in Sacramento to help get the message of consumer choice out there Our best wishes to CREC Rick We need your success Also writing to me regarding the importance of PR was Tom Allen VP of External Affairs at Southern Energy Tom wrote Gary I am new to this issue as an employee i n External Affairs Southern Energy West Region I am in transition to California and have been on the job about weeks I could not agree wi th you more regarding where this battle will be won or lost Generators cann ot and will not be able to separate themselves from the consumer pain that was felt in San Diego this past summer Consumers elect the Gov et al and thei r pulse will dictate final direction in the political arena While we all prepare for the legislative and regulatory battles lets not forget that t he idea here was to provide consumer value over time I think a blanket attack on consumer messaging is very possible The ke y will be how coalitions formal or informal decide to come together to fund such an initiative Being a transplant to the issue and somewhat of an outsider here are some messages that must articulated clearly with some sort of definitive documentation beyond our opinion meaning we need to pay for it somewhere The value of competition to the consumer Why go forward Whats i n it for me The true effects cost negative value for going back to costbased approach Lets live in lifelong subsidy The issue is bigger than energy The investment world is watching I s California a good place for business to do business I agree with the PR blitz I think there needs to be backup when challenged What California institution could provide such in a very short time frame Thank you Tom for sharing your thoughts and welcome to the club Finall y from new GM at the City of Anaheim and formerly of LADWP Marcie Edwards wrote Gary Well Monday is my last day at LA I have learned a lot fro m the Burritos well see if the company can learn

Listen my children dont dare ignore The midnight actions of Bush and Gore In early November the year oughtought Hard to believe the mess they wrought Two billion bucks of campaign bounty All came down to Palm Beach County What result could have been horrider Than the situation we found in Florider Edgar Allen Poe is his usual gloomy self Once upon a campaign dreary one which left us weak and weary Oer many a quaint and curious promise of political lore While we nodded nearly napping suddenly there came a yapping As of some votes overlapping energyzapping to the core Tis a mess here we all muttered as the network anchors stuttered Stuttered over Bush and Gore Could there be another election with such a case of misdirection One with such a weak selection yet fraught with tension to the core Quoth the ravers Nevermore Britains Edward Lears limerick is lighter There once was a US election That called for some expert detection How thousands of pollers Could become twoholers Like outhouses of recollection Ditto Ogden Nash I regret to admit that all my knowledge is What I learned at Electoral Colleges So tell me please though I hate to troubya Will the winner be Al or will it be Dubya Joyce Kilmers a media analyst I thought that I would never see The networks all so up a tree Walt Whitman is lyrical as always Oh Captain My Captain our fearful trips not done The ship has weatherd every rock but nobody knows whos won Alfred Noyes rhythmically rumbles And still of an autumn night they say with the White House on the line When the campaigns a ghostly galleon and both candidates cry Tis mine When the road is a ribbon of ballots all within easy reach A highwayman comes riding Riding Riding A highwayman comes riding and punches two holes in each Dr Seuss takes a look at election officials I cannot count them in a box I cannot count them with a fox I cannot count them by computer I will not with a RotoRooter I cannot count them cardbycard I will not cause its way too hard I cannot count them on my fingers I will not while suspicion lingers Ill leave the country in a jam I cant count ballots SamIAm Clement Moore adopts a holiday theme Twas the month before Christmas when all through the courts All the plaintiffs made stirring bad ballot reports Which leaves the problem Perhaps the best way to stop complaints raucous Is to start over again with the Iowa caucuses Odds and Ends The Toughest Interview Ever The nights I drive my son to hockey practice especially in winter are silent Its dark the weather is cold and we each drift into our own thoughts He listens to the rock station of his choice on the way to practice I get my choice of station usually jazz or classical on the w ay home We both have agreed to set the volume in either travel direction at a tolerable level four ticks on the analogue scale Last night the silence was suddenly broken Okay he said as we started the thirtyminute ride to his practice this is boring Were going to have a conversation What do you want to talk about I asked somewhat startled He said he would ask me some questions Gary he asked always addressing me in the familiar what was your favorite thing to do when you were a kid I was struck dumb I didnt kn ow how to answer the question because I was afraid that whatever I selected h e would say BORING So I drifted a bit in my answer I was very tentative I started with my high school years and what I liked and who I hung around with I then spoke about younger days when I was my sons age and then continued into my elementary school experiences He listened to every word and asked more questions What were my brothers like which on e of my brothers was I close to why did I look forward to going to high school what instrument did I play in the band and on and on We didnt stop until we reached the ice rink I had butterflies in my stomach Picture this I have suddenly found my professional life awash with newspaper interviews TV interviews microphon es stuck in my face and audiences asking me dozens of tough questions The more of that I do the more comfortable it becomes Compare that with my fear of answering these simple questions posed to me by my son about my life Would I be judged harshly Would my answers disappoint him Every Dad wants to be a superstar to his son I guess I passed and I am thankful for the experience Ill probably treasure that conversation for a lifetime not knowing why When you think about I received the most precious gift a son can give a father Well on that note I will wish each and every one of you a happy holiday season whether you celebrate Chanukah or Christmas or both as we do It has been a privilege to write these Burritos for you I cherish your kind comments to me about our weekly get togethers I look forward to serving y ou next year in good health and with less stress Im looking for a quite time maybe in April or May when we can look back at the last few weeks a nd wonder how did we ever get through it all Have a great holiday gba
