that the only legal hurdle we the funds and our traders might face is if no trader w ENA in Houston okays w the counterparty on ENAs behalf However there seem to be other solutions a netting agreement

understand it the issue w not backtobacking the trades w ENA is that the credit exposure will not be aggregated to the funds net position in Houston and therefore not monitored In other words any exposure not sitting w ENA will be invisible to credit so daily margining etc will be incorrect From the EnronOnline side as we see it there are a couple of issues EOL wants the funds to trade online an increasing number of funds also want to trade online However they do not want to be restricted to trading products that are only US based Also they would like to see more arb spread products like a WTIBrent crude oil spread online If neither desire can be easily met bc we need a separate ISDA w ECTRIC which potentially means as above more onerous and timeconsuming negotiation then it will certainly be detrimental for volume and also foresake a certain momentum that we are gaining now The point has been raised that the funds could trade European products if credit in London cleared them

<22774141.1075858814581.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,justin.boyd@enron.com,2001-09-28 10:37:45,RE Trades as ENA Cc Bill NonEOL trades can be treated substantially the same way ie each trade would be novated from ECTRIC to ENA and treated as concluded under ENA ISDA Master Youre correct ECTRIC traders cannot trade in the name of ENA from London to do so would create a regulatory and tax presence in the UK for ENA which should be avoided There are two other possibilities Conclude a separate ISDA between ECTRIC and the CP This would be based substantially on the existing ISDA Master with ENA but it would need to be adapted to accommodate the different tax status of ECTRIC And we could agree to offer the CP an Enron Corp Guarantee in support Adapt the existing ISDA Master with ENA by adding ECTRIC as a third party This would mean the addition of new provisions to accommodate the different tax status of ECTRIC And again an Enron Corp Guarantee could be offered to support ECTRICs obligations However consideration would need to be given as to the validity of the closeout netting provisions of that ISDA where a party becomes bankrupt this is a US bankruptcy question However given the time that would be involved in concluding and above as well as the sensitivity of the CPs to negotiating revised or new documents the novation route may be preferable Justin Original Message From White Bill

issues Please comment Also as a commercially efficient course of action It has always seemed to me that we should attempt to train our couterparties to accept that ECTRIC is also a Enron Corp

countries are Belgium and the Netherlands J Forwarded by Justin BoydLONECT on Enron Capital Trade Resources Corp From West Nick To cc Didizian Marly Subject Enron onlinesportscom competition Dear Justin You asked for a summary of the UK and foreign advice which we have collated on the lawfulness of the Enron onlinesportscom spread betting competition I have set out a short note below Marly and I would be happy to discuss it with you further by telephone at any time this afternoon I have assumed that the competition is based predominantly on chance I have also assumed that there is no element of indirect consideration required to enter the competition We may need to discuss these points in more detail UK There appears to be no problem The competition cannot be a lottery as the contestants do not pay to enter The competition may fall within the definition of gaming but only unlawful gaming is prohibited The competition format which you have described is unlikely be an unlawful game Germany There appears to be no problem as far as gaming laws on lotteries and the German Trading Regulations are concerned because the participants will not pay to enter the competition However it is possible that there may a breach of unfair competition laws One of Enrons customers without online trading capacity or one of Enrons competitors could argue that the competition is anticompetitive ie Enron is trying to influence the decision of its online trading customers as to whether they should trade with Enron at all We should consider this risk in greater detail If the game was held to be anticompetitive Enron would have to cease to offer it to German customers Netherlands Under the Dutch Games of Chance Act GCA games of chance are generally prohibited even if participation is free However we have been advised that to date it is not clear whether the GCA even applies to internet games We have also been advised that in any event the Dutch authorities are unlikely to consider it a high priority to try to enforce the GCA against a game offered for a limited time with only a moderate prize Finally we have been advised that if the game complies with the law in the country of its origin this would decrease the likelihood of any Dutch action Thus the key decision in the Netherlands is whether the commercial benefits of the competition outweighs the risk of a fine for contravention of the GCA maximum NLG approx USD The GCA also only applies to games of chance The provisions of the act could be avoided if a greater degree of skill was introduced in to the competition Italy You may recall that under Italian law it appears that Enron will need to get the approval of the Italian Ministry of Finance to offer the game to Italian customers as it falls within the definition of an advertising contest Having discussed this matter with our Italian colleagues it seems that Enron will be unable to avoid this requirement unless it does not offer prizes Authorisation is likely to take a minimum of days there is no fast track process Furthermore since the website will be cobranded Enron onlinesportscom we have been advised that both parties would need to seek authorisation Failure to obtain authorisation may result in a fine of up to m Lire approx USD and continuing an unauthorised game in contravention of an order of the Ministry of Finance may result in a fine of up to m Lire approx USD We have also been advised that the Italian Ministry of Finance does not undertake regular or thorough searches of the internet to identify potentially unlawful advertising contests With this is mind Enron may consider that the commercial benefits of running the competition in Italy outweighs the risk of being fined We may need to consider this issue in more detail Belgium The advice we received from our Belgian colleague is inconclusive The game does not fall foul of the new Law on Games of Chance as no entry fee is charged However we have been advised that there is a small risk that the game may be prohibited under the Law on Lotteries of since it is a game of chance This risk can be alleviated by limiting the access to the game to defined group of users as is the case here and by increasing the level of skill involved We may need to consider this risk in more detail since civil and criminal sanctions may be imposed on the organisers of a nonauthorised lottery imprisonment for up to months and a fine of up to BEF approx USD for the organiser of the competition Enron as well as a fine for the distributor sportscom of up to BEF approx USD Switzerland There appears to be no problem under Swiss law as the contestants do not need to pay to participate This message is confidential It may also be privileged or

can play the game and be awarded prizes approved countries UK because the participants do not pay to enter the game is not in public and the game is not promoting Enrons business Germany because the participants do not pay to enter and provided the game is only advertised to existing customers and is not used as a marketing tool Austria because the participants do not pay to enter and provided

and the game is run outside Portugal Poland because participants do not pay to enter and the game is not used as a promotional tool and assuming that Enron have objective means of determining who can and cannot become an online customer The Polish lawyers would like me to confirm this latter point to them I await this confirmation requested from Mark Taylor List of countries where there are risks involved if Enrons customers can play the game and be awarded prizes Belgium It is unclear whether the game is a lottery these require special authorisation in order not to be unlawful or a contest usually allowable under Belgium law The game has been submitted to the Belgium regulators who decide this classification but a response has not yet been received There seems quite a low risk that the game would be classified as a lottery because an element of skill is involved but there is still a risk that the authorities would be of the opinion that the element of skill was not adequate to move the game from a lottery classification to a contest classification It does not matter that there is no charge the scheme could still be classified as a lottery Organising an unauthorised lotteries may give rise to criminal civil and administrative sanctions including imprisonment from days to months and a fine of BEF to BEF approximately EU to EU Netherlands Under the Dutch Games of Chance games of chance are generally prohibited even if participation is free It is not clear whether or not the Dutch Games of Chance Act applies to internet games or whether the Dutch authorities would consider that they had jurisdiction over the game because the server is based in the US and the site is in English Contravention of the Dutch Games of Chance Act can have criminal sanctions maximum fine of NLG Norway The outstanding issue providing the game is not a promotional tool is tax If a Norwegian resident wins a prize Enron would need to pay social security contributions of plus an extra if the employee concerned earns more than NOK Enron will be responsible for reporting the prize to the tax authorities and to withold the tax from the payment to the winner Sweden It is possible that the game could be considered a lottery in Sweden it doesnt matter that there is no fee to enter all that is needed is for the public to be offered the chance to win prizes based on chance Authorisation to run a lottery is virtually never given unless the lottery is for a charitable purpose The Swedish lottery board consider that the target number in deciding whether a lottery is public or not is However the courts are apparantly not bound to accept this figure and case law suggests that it is the relationship between the participants that is key games that have not been found to be lotteries are those organised amongst a private circleapparent community ie a fan club Our Swedish lawyers believe that there is at least a chance that being employees of presumably various Swedish customers of Enron would not constitute an apparent community in the opinion of the court Arranging an unlawful lottery can be considered a criminal offence punishable by a fine or a maximum of months imprisonment Denmark On line competitions are subject to the Danish Marketing Practices Act and effectively require authorisation from the Danish Consumer Ombudsman to ensure that they meet the standard of good marketing practice Our Danish lawyers have contacted the Ombudsman but have not yet received a response Italy The game is more than likely an advertising contest under Italian law and therefore needs approval of the Italian Ministry of Finance Approval has not yet been requested because I do not have the complete name and address of any of the Italian subsidiaries of Enron who the application would need to be made on behalf of It is uncertain that the Italian authorities would consider themselves to have jurisdiction over the game because the server is in the US and the site is in English We are also advised that the Italian Ministry of Finance does not routinely undertake regular or thorough searches of the internet to identify potentially unlawful advertising contests There is a fine of approx USD for failure to obtain authorisation and continuing an unauthorised game can result in a fine of up to USD Spain The preliminary opinion of our Spanish lawyers was that the game may raise issues under consumer protection law in Spain I have not yet received a more substantive opinion from them France The game more than likely contravenes French lottery law because spending additional time on the internet can constitute a charge this has been confirmed by the appropriate authority There was a possibility that the game could run if ISP costs were reimbursed to the participants but Leslie Hansen has already indicated to me that this is not feasible List of countries where employees of Enrons customers can play the game provided they are excluded from being awarded a prizes Belgium please note the comments given in the context of the Euro game that there is an evidential risk that internet disclaimers may not be effective because they do not constitute written proof of the terms of a contract Netherlands Norway Sweden Italy I have still not received conclusive advice as to whether it is just residents of these jurisdictions that need to be excluded from winning prizes or whether anyone playing the game from terminals in these jurisdictions who isnt necessarily resident in that country for example whilst they are at work at the site of an Enron customer needs to be excluded as well For safety I would suggest that it is a condition of the game that participants who reside in a country where prizes can be awarded are told that they need to access the game only from that jurisdiction or from another of the approved jurisdictions It should be made clear that participants forfeit their right to a prize if they do not abide by this rule In all these countries the fact that residents etc of these countries cannot be awarded prizes should be stated clearly and specifically in the rules so as to avoid accusations that Enron is misleading participants into believing that they can win a prize List of countries where there are doubts that even excluding residents of that country from winning prizes would make the game lawful Spain we have not received advice on this point Denmark because it is consumer legislation and not lotteries legislation that is at issue preventing participants from winning prizes may well not be enough to avoid liability under Danish law France our French lawyers were particularly concerned about how people could be prevented from playing the game from France and I have not yet heard back from them that the measures I set out in paragraph above satisfy their concerns In these countries we have been advised that a disclaimer stating that residents of that country are ineligible to play the game coupled with a registration process preventing residents of those countries from participating should be enough to prevent Enron from being liable for breach of the relevant laws Miscellaneous issues Germany if employees of Enron are allowed to play the game in Germany regardless of whether or not they are able to win prizes then the works council of Enrons German subsidiary will need to be informed about the intended game and will need expressly to grant their consent This message is confidential It may also be privileged or otherwise protected by work product immunity or other legal

comments expressed by CC as well as their minor drafting changes I have not as yet sent this Sullivan Cromwellmay be you would wish to do this as you see fit Look forward to seeing you soon in a week or so Justin Forwarded by Justin BoydLONECT on Enron Capital Trade Resources Corp From To cc bcc Justin BoydLONECT Subject Internet Trading Internet Trading Access and Electronic Trading Agreements Further to our meeting yesterday please find attached a copy of the Internet Trading Access Agreement ITAA and the Electronic Trading Agreement ETA marked up with my suggested changes from an English law perspective As I mentioned to you yesterday these documents will also need to be considered by the overseas lawyers to see whether there are any overriding local laws which could impact on the use The overseas lawyers have copies of these agreements and will include this in their report I understand that it is envisaged that the ITAA will be signed off line and the ETA will be posted on the Website Each person authorised by a counterparty with a password must click through the Agreement before commencing trading This will only be done on one occasion We discussed yesterday the risks associated with this approach namely that a counterparty could claim that at the time of entering into the ITAA it was not aware of the terms of the ETA and therefore could not be bound by it It is clearly important to have certainty that the terms of the ETA are enforceable as they contain important terms such as indemnities limitations of liability etc Having said that the view might be taken that by entering into the ITAA all that has been achieved is that a counterparty receives a password which enable the counterparty to put itself in a position where it must consider the ETA before proceeding Once the counterparty accesses the Website and sees the ETA a second contract is made and the ITAA and ETA must then be read together but only at the time that the counterparty has clicked through the ETA I suspect that this is the approach that Sullivan Cromwell had in mind It is also worth bearing in mind that a counterparty may ask for the ETA at the time of entering into the ITAA or may be relunctant to click through the ETA until they have had internal legal sign off This may delay trading Nonetheless I understand that you are keen to proceed with signing the ITAA off line and the ETA on line and accordingly the attached documents are marked up with that structure in mind As agreed yesterday I have only made changes to the document produced by Sullivan Cromwell where I think it is necessary for English law purposes or clarification I have the following brief comments on the changes I have made Parties You will see that both documents are entered into by a designated Enron entity for itself and on behalf of all Enron group undertakings The reason for this is that Transactions will actually be made between the counterparty and various different Enron entities We therefore need to ensure that such Transactions with each of those Enron entities are governed by the terms of these documents I note from your email yesterday that it was suggested that we need to list the affiliates or have one entity enter into the Transactions I think there may be some confusion here This is not the case I assume that the current Enron entities which trade certain commodities with certain counterparties will continue to do so on the Website The Website will need to be set up in such a way as to achieve this but I assume that this causes no problem as each counterparty will see different pages on the Website depending on what password has been inserted The documents now contemplate this Services I have removed the references to Services as I am not sure what this means I would have thought that these agreements need to govern the counterpartys access and utilization of the Website whether or not they actually carry out any Transactions Therefore I believe that where the Agreement had previously referred to Services it can now refer to access and utilization of the Website Contract Formation I have inserted a short paragraph in Clause of the ETA which provides that a Transaction will only be executed once Enron generates a message of confirmation of the sale and purchase to a Counterparty and that any electronic records of Enron will prevail I note that Sullivan Cromwell envisage a document being attached which explains this This is also acceptable Data Protection On reflection it will be more appropriate for relevant data protection wording to be on the Website itself rather than in the ITAA or ETA This is because the data protection concerns revolve around data subjects ie living individuals rather than corporate entities such as the Counterparty Before providing appropriate wording for this could you please let me know what information will be collected by you concerning living individuals either intentionally or unintentionally For example when a password is entered will you be able to identify a living individual by this or can you intentionally or unintentionally obtain that individuals email address or other information on them once they have entered the Site You will need to check this with your technical people Once you have had a chance to review this perhaps you could let me have your comments I have simultaneously sent this email to my financial regulatory colleagues for their review They may have further comments which we will send onto you as a matter of urgency Kind regards Andrew

countries are Belgium and the Netherlands J Forwarded by Justin BoydLONECT on Enron Capital Trade Resources Corp From West Nick To cc Didizian Marly Subject Enron onlinesportscom competition Dear Justin You asked for a summary of the UK and foreign advice which we have collated on the lawfulness of the Enron onlinesportscom spread betting competition I have set out a short note below Marly and I would be happy to discuss it with you further by telephone at any time this afternoon I have assumed that the competition is based predominantly on chance I have also assumed that there is no element of indirect consideration required to enter the competition We may need to discuss these points in more detail UK There appears to be no problem The competition cannot be a lottery as the contestants do not pay to enter The competition may fall within the definition of gaming but only unlawful gaming is prohibited The competition format which you have described is unlikely be an unlawful game Germany There appears to be no problem as far as gaming laws on lotteries and the German Trading Regulations are concerned because the participants will not pay to enter the competition However it is possible that there may a breach of unfair competition laws One of Enrons customers without online trading capacity or one of Enrons competitors could argue that the competition is anticompetitive ie Enron is trying to influence the decision of its online trading customers as to whether they should trade with Enron at all We should consider this risk in greater detail If the game was held to be anticompetitive Enron would have to cease to offer it to German customers Netherlands Under the Dutch Games of Chance Act GCA games of chance are generally prohibited even if participation is free However we have been advised that to date it is not clear whether the GCA even applies to internet games We have also been advised that in any event the Dutch authorities are unlikely to consider it a high priority to try to enforce the GCA against a game offered for a limited time with only a moderate prize Finally we have been advised that if the game complies with the law in the country of its origin this would decrease the likelihood of any Dutch action Thus the key decision in the Netherlands is whether the commercial benefits of the competition outweighs the risk of a fine for contravention of the GCA maximum NLG approx USD The GCA also only applies to games of chance The provisions of the act could be avoided if a greater degree of skill was introduced in to the competition Italy You may recall that under Italian law it appears that Enron will need to get the approval of the Italian Ministry of Finance to offer the game to Italian customers as it falls within the definition of an advertising contest Having discussed this matter with our Italian colleagues it seems that Enron will be unable to avoid this requirement unless it does not offer prizes Authorisation is likely to take a minimum of days there is no fast track process Furthermore since the website will be cobranded Enron onlinesportscom we have been advised that both parties would need to seek authorisation Failure to obtain authorisation may result in a fine of up to m Lire approx USD and continuing an unauthorised game in contravention of an order of the Ministry of Finance may result in a fine of up to m Lire approx USD We have also been advised that the Italian Ministry of Finance does not undertake regular or thorough searches of the internet to identify potentially unlawful advertising contests With this is mind Enron may consider that the commercial benefits of running the competition in Italy outweighs the risk of being fined We may need to consider this issue in more detail Belgium The advice we received from our Belgian colleague is inconclusive The game does not fall foul of the new Law on Games of Chance as no entry fee is charged However we have been advised that there is a small risk that the game may be prohibited under the Law on Lotteries of since it is a game of chance This risk can be alleviated by limiting the access to the game to defined group of users as is the case here and by increasing the level of skill involved We may need to consider this risk in more detail since civil and criminal sanctions may be imposed on the organisers of a nonauthorised lottery imprisonment for up to months and a fine of up to BEF approx USD for the organiser of the competition Enron as well as a fine for the distributor sportscom of up to BEF approx USD Switzerland There appears to be no problem under Swiss law as the contestants do not need to pay to participate This message is confidential It may also be privileged or

<28992264.1075860233569.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,justin.boyd@enron.com,2000-09-01 05:55:00,Enron Online Game adviceFYI Justin Forwarded by Justin BoydLONECT on Enron Capital Trade Resources Corp From Murton Rachel To cc Subject Enron Online Game advice PLease see below for the consolidated gaming advice from the various European jurisdictions List of countries where employees of Enrons customers can play the game and be awarded prizes approved countries UK because the participants do not pay to enter the game is not in public and the game is not promoting Enrons business Germany because the participants do not pay to enter and provided the game is only advertised to existing customers and is not used as a marketing tool Austria because the participants do not pay to enter and provided the game is only advertised to existing customers and is not used as a marketing tool Switzerland because the participants do not need to pay to enter Finland because the participants do not need to pay to participate the game is not used as a promotional tool and Enron as a foreign organiser do not have tax liabilities to the Finnish government Portugal because participants do not pay to enter and the game is run outside Portugal Poland because participants do not pay to enter and the game is not used as a promotional tool and assuming that Enron have objective means of determining who can and cannot become an online customer The Polish lawyers would like me to confirm this latter point to them I await this confirmation requested from Mark Taylor List of countries where there are risks involved if Enrons customers can play the game and be awarded prizes Belgium It is unclear whether the game is a lottery these require special authorisation in order not to be unlawful or a contest usually allowable under Belgium law The game has been submitted to the Belgium regulators who decide this classification but a response has not yet been received There seems quite a low risk that the game would be classified as a lottery because an element of skill is involved but there is still a risk that the authorities would be of the opinion that the element of skill was not adequate to move the game from a lottery classification to a contest classification It does not matter that there is no charge the scheme could still be classified as a lottery Organising an unauthorised lotteries may give rise to criminal civil and administrative sanctions including imprisonment from days to months and a fine of BEF to BEF approximately EU to EU Netherlands Under the Dutch Games of Chance games of chance are generally prohibited even if participation is free It is not clear whether or not the Dutch Games of Chance Act applies to internet games or whether the Dutch authorities would consider that they had jurisdiction over the game because the server is based in the US and the site is in English Contravention of the Dutch Games of Chance Act can have criminal sanctions maximum fine of NLG Norway The outstanding issue providing the game is not a promotional tool is tax If a Norwegian resident wins a prize Enron would need to pay social security contributions of plus an extra if the employee concerned earns more than NOK Enron will be responsible for reporting the prize to the tax authorities and to withold the tax from the payment to the winner Sweden It is possible that the game could be considered a lottery in Sweden it doesnt matter that there is no fee to enter all that is needed is for the public to be offered the chance to win prizes based on chance Authorisation to run a lottery is virtually never given unless the lottery is for a charitable purpose The Swedish lottery board consider that the target number in deciding whether a lottery is public or not is However the courts are apparantly not bound to accept this figure and case law suggests that it is the relationship between the participants that is key games that have not been found to be lotteries are those organised amongst a private circleapparent community ie a fan club Our Swedish lawyers believe that there is at least a chance that being employees of presumably various Swedish customers of Enron would not constitute an apparent community in the opinion of the court Arranging an unlawful lottery can be considered a criminal offence punishable by a fine or a maximum of months imprisonment Denmark On line competitions are subject to the Danish Marketing Practices Act and effectively require authorisation from the Danish Consumer Ombudsman to ensure that they meet the standard of good marketing practice Our Danish lawyers have contacted the Ombudsman but have not yet received a response Italy The game is more than likely an advertising contest under Italian law and therefore needs approval of the Italian Ministry of Finance Approval has not yet been requested because I do not have the complete name and address of any of the Italian subsidiaries of Enron who the application would need to be made on behalf of It is uncertain that the Italian authorities would consider themselves to have jurisdiction over the game because the server is in the US and the site is in English We are also advised that the Italian Ministry of Finance does not routinely undertake regular or thorough searches of the internet to identify potentially unlawful advertising contests There is a fine of approx USD for failure to obtain authorisation and continuing an unauthorised game can result in a fine of up to USD Spain The preliminary opinion of our Spanish lawyers was that the game may raise issues under consumer protection law in Spain I have not yet received a more substantive opinion from them France The game more than likely contravenes French lottery law because spending additional time on the internet can constitute a charge this has been confirmed by the appropriate authority There was a possibility that the game could run if ISP costs were reimbursed to the participants but Leslie Hansen has already indicated to me that this is not feasible List of countries where employees of Enrons customers can play the game provided they are excluded from being awarded a prizes Belgium please note the comments given in the context of the Euro game that there is an evidential risk that internet disclaimers may not be effective because they do not constitute written proof of the terms of a contract Netherlands Norway Sweden Italy I have still not received conclusive advice as to whether it is just residents of these jurisdictions that need to be excluded from winning prizes or whether anyone playing the game from terminals in these jurisdictions who isnt necessarily resident in that country for example whilst they are at work at the site of an Enron customer needs to be excluded as well For safety I would suggest that it is a condition of the game that participants who reside in a country where prizes can be awarded are told that they need to access the game only from that jurisdiction or from another of the approved jurisdictions It should be made clear that participants forfeit their right to a prize if they do not abide by this rule In all these countries the fact that residents etc of these countries cannot be awarded prizes should be stated clearly and specifically in the rules so as to avoid accusations that Enron is misleading participants into believing that they can win a prize List of countries where there are doubts that even excluding residents of that country from winning prizes would make the game lawful Spain we have not received advice on this point Denmark because it is consumer legislation and not lotteries legislation that is at issue preventing participants from winning prizes may well not be enough to avoid liability under Danish law France our French lawyers were particularly concerned about how people could be prevented from playing the game from France and I have not yet heard back from them that the measures I set out in paragraph above satisfy their concerns In these countries we have been advised that a disclaimer stating that residents of that country are ineligible to play the game coupled with a registration process preventing residents of those countries from participating should be enough to prevent Enron from being liable for breach of the relevant laws Miscellaneous issues Germany if employees of Enron are allowed to play the game in Germany regardless of whether or not they are able to win prizes then the works council of Enrons German subsidiary will need to be informed about the intended game and will need expressly to grant their consent This message is confidential It may also be privileged or otherwise protected by work product immunity or other legal

Murton Rachel To cc Subject Enron Online Game advice PLease see below for the consolidated gaming advice from the various European jurisdictions List of countries where employees of Enrons customers can play the game and be awarded prizes approved countries UK because the participants do not pay to enter the game is not in public and the game is not promoting Enrons business Germany because the participants do not pay to enter and provided the game is only advertised to existing customers and is not used as a marketing tool Austria because the participants do not pay to enter and provided the game is only advertised to existing customers and is not used as a marketing tool Switzerland because the participants do not need to pay to enter Finland because the participants do not need to pay to participate the game is not used as a promotional tool and Enron as a foreign organiser do not have tax liabilities to the Finnish government Portugal because participants do not pay to enter and the game is run outside Portugal Poland because participants do not pay to enter and the game is not used as a promotional tool and assuming that Enron have objective means of determining who can and cannot become an online customer The Polish lawyers would like me to confirm this latter point to them I await this confirmation requested from Mark Taylor List of countries where there are risks involved if Enrons customers can play the game and be awarded prizes Belgium It is unclear whether the game is a lottery these require special authorisation in order not to be unlawful or a contest usually allowable under Belgium law The game has been submitted to the Belgium regulators who decide this classification but a response has not yet been received There seems quite a low risk that the game would be classified as a lottery because an element of skill is involved but there is still a risk that the authorities would be of the opinion that the element of skill was not adequate to move the game from a lottery classification to a contest classification It does not matter that there is no charge the scheme could still be classified as a lottery Organising an unauthorised lotteries may give rise to criminal civil and administrative sanctions including imprisonment from days to months and a fine of BEF to BEF approximately EU to EU Netherlands Under the Dutch Games of Chance games of chance are generally prohibited even if participation is free It is not clear whether or not the Dutch Games of Chance Act applies to internet games or whether the Dutch authorities would consider that they had jurisdiction over the game because the server is based in the US and the site is in English Contravention of the Dutch Games of Chance Act can have criminal sanctions maximum fine of NLG Norway The outstanding issue providing the game is not a promotional tool is tax If a Norwegian resident wins a prize Enron would need to pay social security contributions of plus an extra if the employee concerned earns more than NOK Enron will be responsible for reporting the prize to the tax authorities and to withold the tax from the payment to the winner Sweden It is possible that the game could be considered a lottery in Sweden it doesnt matter that there is no fee to enter all that is needed is for the public to be offered the chance to win prizes based on chance Authorisation to run a lottery is virtually never given unless the lottery is for a charitable purpose The Swedish lottery board consider that the target number in deciding whether a lottery is public or not is However the courts are apparantly not bound to accept this figure and case law suggests that it is the relationship between the participants that is key games that have not been found to be lotteries are those organised amongst a private circleapparent community ie a fan club Our Swedish lawyers believe that there is at least a chance that being employees of presumably various Swedish customers of Enron would not constitute an apparent community in the opinion of the court Arranging an unlawful lottery can be considered a criminal offence punishable by a fine or a maximum of months imprisonment Denmark On line competitions are subject to the Danish Marketing Practices Act and effectively require authorisation from the Danish Consumer Ombudsman to ensure that they meet the standard of good marketing practice Our Danish lawyers have contacted the Ombudsman but have not yet received a response Italy The game is more than likely an advertising contest under Italian law and therefore needs approval of the Italian Ministry of Finance Approval has not yet been requested because I do not have the complete name and address of any of the Italian subsidiaries of Enron who the application would need to be made on behalf of It is uncertain that the Italian authorities would consider themselves to have jurisdiction over the game because the server is in the US and the site is in English We are also advised that the Italian Ministry of Finance does not routinely undertake regular or thorough searches of the internet to identify potentially unlawful advertising contests There is a fine of approx USD for failure to obtain authorisation and continuing an unauthorised game can result in a fine of up to USD Spain The preliminary opinion of our Spanish lawyers was that the game may raise issues under consumer protection law in Spain I have not yet received a more substantive opinion from them France The game more than likely contravenes French lottery law because spending additional time on the internet can constitute a charge this has been confirmed by the appropriate authority There was a possibility that the game could run if ISP costs were reimbursed to the participants but Leslie Hansen has already indicated to me that this is not feasible List of countries where employees of Enrons customers can play the game provided they are excluded from being awarded a prizes Belgium please note the comments given in the context of the Euro game that there is an evidential risk that internet disclaimers may not be effective because they do not constitute written proof of the terms of a contract Netherlands Norway Sweden Italy I have still not received conclusive advice as to whether it is just residents of these jurisdictions that need to be excluded from winning prizes or whether anyone playing the game from terminals in these jurisdictions who isnt necessarily resident in that country for example whilst they are at work at the site of an Enron customer needs to be excluded as well For safety I would suggest that it is a condition of the game that participants who reside in a country where prizes can be awarded are told that they need to access the game only from that jurisdiction or from another of the approved jurisdictions It should be made clear that participants forfeit their right to a prize if they do not abide by this rule In all these countries the fact that residents etc of these countries cannot be awarded prizes should be stated clearly and specifically in the rules so as to avoid accusations that Enron is misleading participants into believing that they can win a prize List of countries where there are doubts that even excluding residents of that country from winning prizes would make the game lawful Spain we have not received advice on this point Denmark because it is consumer legislation and not lotteries legislation that is at issue preventing participants from winning prizes may well not be enough to avoid liability under Danish law France our French lawyers were particularly concerned about how people could be prevented from playing the game from France and I have not yet heard back from them that the measures I set out in paragraph above satisfy their concerns In these countries we have been advised that a disclaimer stating that residents of that country are ineligible to play the game coupled with a registration process preventing residents of those countries from participating should be enough to prevent Enron from being liable for breach of the relevant laws Miscellaneous issues Germany if employees of Enron are allowed to play the game in Germany regardless of whether or not they are able to win prizes then the works council of Enrons German subsidiary will need to be informed about the intended game and will need expressly to grant their consent This message is confidential It may also be privileged or otherwise protected by work product immunity or other legal

countries are Belgium and the Netherlands J Forwarded by Justin BoydLONECT on Enron Capital Trade Resources Corp From West Nick To cc Didizian Marly Subject Enron onlinesportscom competition Dear Justin You asked for a summary of the UK and foreign advice which we have collated on the lawfulness of the Enron onlinesportscom spread betting competition I have set out a short note below Marly and I would be happy to discuss it with you further by telephone at any time this afternoon I have assumed that the competition is based predominantly on chance I have also assumed that there is no element of indirect consideration required to enter the competition We may need to discuss these points in more detail UK There appears to be no problem The competition cannot be a lottery as the contestants do not pay to enter The competition may fall within the definition of gaming but only unlawful gaming is prohibited The competition format which you have described is unlikely be an unlawful game Germany There appears to be no problem as far as gaming laws on lotteries and the German Trading Regulations are concerned because the participants will not pay to enter the competition However it is possible that there may a breach of unfair competition laws One of Enrons customers without online trading capacity or one of Enrons competitors could argue that the competition is anticompetitive ie Enron is trying to influence the decision of its online trading customers as to whether they should trade with Enron at all We should consider this risk in greater detail If the game was held to be anticompetitive Enron would have to cease to offer it to German customers Netherlands Under the Dutch Games of Chance Act GCA games of chance are generally prohibited even if participation is free However we have been advised that to date it is not clear whether the GCA even applies to internet games We have also been advised that in any event the Dutch authorities are unlikely to consider it a high priority to try to enforce the GCA against a game offered for a limited time with only a moderate prize Finally we have been advised that if the game complies with the law in the country of its origin this would decrease the likelihood of any Dutch action Thus the key decision in the Netherlands is whether the commercial benefits of the competition outweighs the risk of a fine for contravention of the GCA maximum NLG approx USD The GCA also only applies to games of chance The provisions of the act could be avoided if a greater degree of skill was introduced in to the competition Italy You may recall that under Italian law it appears that Enron will need to get the approval of the Italian Ministry of Finance to offer the game to Italian customers as it falls within the definition of an advertising contest Having discussed this matter with our Italian colleagues it seems that Enron will be unable to avoid this requirement unless it does not offer prizes Authorisation is likely to take a minimum of days there is no fast track process Furthermore since the website will be cobranded Enron onlinesportscom we have been advised that both parties would need to seek authorisation Failure to obtain authorisation may result in a fine of up to m Lire approx USD and continuing an unauthorised game in contravention of an order of the Ministry of Finance may result in a fine of up to m Lire approx USD We have also been advised that the Italian Ministry of Finance does not undertake regular or thorough searches of the internet to identify potentially unlawful advertising contests With this is mind Enron may consider that the commercial benefits of running the competition in Italy outweighs the risk of being fined We may need to consider this issue in more detail Belgium The advice we received from our Belgian colleague is inconclusive The game does not fall foul of the new Law on Games of Chance as no entry fee is charged However we have been advised that there is a small risk that the game may be prohibited under the Law on Lotteries of since it is a game of chance This risk can be alleviated by limiting the access to the game to defined group of users as is the case here and by increasing the level of skill involved We may need to consider this risk in more detail since civil and criminal sanctions may be imposed on the organisers of a nonauthorised lottery imprisonment for up to months and a fine of up to BEF approx USD for the organiser of the competition Enron as well as a fine for the distributor sportscom of up to BEF approx USD Switzerland There appears to be no problem under Swiss law as the contestants do not need to pay to participate This message is confidential It may also be privileged or

comments expressed by CC as well as their minor drafting changes I have not as yet sent this Sullivan Cromwellmay be you would wish to do this as you see fit Look forward to seeing you soon in a week or so Justin Forwarded by Justin BoydLONECT on Enron Capital Trade Resources Corp From To cc bcc Justin BoydLONECT Subject Internet Trading Internet Trading Access and Electronic Trading Agreements Further to our meeting yesterday please find attached a copy of the Internet Trading Access Agreement ITAA and the Electronic Trading Agreement ETA marked up with my suggested changes from an English law perspective As I mentioned to you yesterday these documents will also need to be considered by the overseas lawyers to see whether there are any overriding local laws which could impact on the use The overseas lawyers have copies of these agreements and will include this in their report I understand that it is envisaged that the ITAA will be signed off line and the ETA will be posted on the Website Each person authorised by a counterparty with a password must click through the Agreement before commencing trading This will only be done on one occasion We discussed yesterday the risks associated with this approach namely that a counterparty could claim that at the time of entering into the ITAA it was not aware of the terms of the ETA and therefore could not be bound by it It is clearly important to have certainty that the terms of the ETA are enforceable as they contain important terms such as indemnities limitations of liability etc Having said that the view might be taken that by entering into the ITAA all that has been achieved is that a counterparty receives a password which enable the counterparty to put itself in a position where it must consider the ETA before proceeding Once the counterparty accesses the Website and sees the ETA a second contract is made and the ITAA and ETA must then be read together but only at the time that the counterparty has clicked through the ETA I suspect that this is the approach that Sullivan Cromwell had in mind It is also worth bearing in mind that a counterparty may ask for the ETA at the time of entering into the ITAA or may be relunctant to click through the ETA until they have had internal legal sign off This may delay trading Nonetheless I understand that you are keen to proceed with signing the ITAA off line and the ETA on line and accordingly the attached documents are marked up with that structure in mind As agreed yesterday I have only made changes to the document produced by Sullivan Cromwell where I think it is necessary for English law purposes or clarification I have the following brief comments on the changes I have made Parties You will see that both documents are entered into by a designated Enron entity for itself and on behalf of all Enron group undertakings The reason for this is that Transactions will actually be made between the counterparty and various different Enron entities We therefore need to ensure that such Transactions with each of those Enron entities are governed by the terms of these documents I note from your email yesterday that it was suggested that we need to list the affiliates or have one entity enter into the Transactions I think there may be some confusion here This is not the case I assume that the current Enron entities which trade certain commodities with certain counterparties will continue to do so on the Website The Website will need to be set up in such a way as to achieve this but I assume that this causes no problem as each counterparty will see different pages on the Website depending on what password has been inserted The documents now contemplate this Services I have removed the references to Services as I am not sure what this means I would have thought that these agreements need to govern the counterpartys access and utilization of the Website whether or not they actually carry out any Transactions Therefore I believe that where the Agreement had previously referred to Services it can now refer to access and utilization of the Website Contract Formation I have inserted a short paragraph in Clause of the ETA which provides that a Transaction will only be executed once Enron generates a message of confirmation of the sale and purchase to a Counterparty and that any electronic records of Enron will prevail I note that Sullivan Cromwell envisage a document being attached which explains this This is also acceptable Data Protection On reflection it will be more appropriate for relevant data protection wording to be on the Website itself rather than in the ITAA or ETA This is because the data protection concerns revolve around data subjects ie living individuals rather than corporate entities such as the Counterparty Before providing appropriate wording for this could you please let me know what information will be collected by you concerning living individuals either intentionally or unintentionally For example when a password is entered will you be able to identify a living individual by this or can you intentionally or unintentionally obtain that individuals email address or other information on them once they have entered the Site You will need to check this with your technical people Once you have had a chance to review this perhaps you could let me have your comments I have simultaneously sent this email to my financial regulatory colleagues for their review They may have further comments which we will send onto you as a matter of urgency Kind regards Andrew
