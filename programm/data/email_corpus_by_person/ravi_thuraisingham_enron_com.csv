Lee is very experienced in traditional traffic engineering work He comes from MCI where he was responsible for modeling traffic etc It appears that Sycamore finally got him One time they had lost him to Corvis another optical equipment company I guess Sycamore went back to him with a better deal As soon as this guy is available Ill set up an all day technical meeting to hash out what needs to be done as far as optimization algorithm development is concerned I want to produce a technical requirement document to clearly outline what needs to be done to support dynamic opticalswitchedcircuits based trading and streaming media applications etc Having such an industry expert help us will help justify internally all the the effort on the traffic analysis side that John Griebling has asked us to support Keep in mind that even though he is an expert in the field the field that we need to play in has not develop yet Even the emerging data based traffic as opposed to voice where blocking of traffic is allowed analysis is an order of magnitude more difficult due to uncertain load let alone trading such load which we are planning to do Ravi Sycamore hired a guy per Grieblings request to work with you on the designplanning piece of the business He will be contracted out to Enron for a period of months initially He lives in SF but will be traveling to whereever you need him Jim

Enron reps visit San Diego for demos and related discussions We have been talking to Stan Hanks for some time about Enrons interests in passive measurement and are in the process of implementing some of the performance features in CoralReef that he has described as relevant to Enron Examples of existing CoralReef analyses on OC links can be found at CoralReefDemoscerfnetlink realtime AIX postprocessed traces We are also working to better tune the skitter tool for reachability analysis and for use by providers an example of some existing analyses can be found at

Ravi ThuraisinghamEnron Communications Subject Material for Thu mar WG meeting Hello all Appended below youll find a summary of ideas that people have contributed since we at CAIDA began to get the metrics wg started Some of this material has already appeared on the metrics mailing list the older material comes from personal emails Im posting it again to give us all some more ideas to think about For those who are able to attend the WG meeting in San Jose this Thursday Mar Id like to spend time in the morning getting to know about attendees interests and experience in making Internet measurements I suggest that a good way to do this would be to have each group give a short minutes slides presentation of their measurement work That should allow us to make a longer list of metrics to discuss in more detail for the rest of the meeting Comments please Ill send out a revisedupdated agenda late tomorrow Cheers Nevil PS We now have about people on the mailing list Please copy all further metrics email to the list so that we can all see it We now have a websearchable list archive in place at archivesmetrics Nevil Brownlee Visiting Researcher Phone CAIDA San Diego Several people have expressed interest in passive measurements on TCP streams One simple example is keeping track of DNS response times Daniel McRobb offered the following I also believe a similar simple technique could be used to track TCP response times and this gets even more interesting you only need to be able to see traffic in one direction from client to server to get a fairly accurate roundtrip time from the client to the server irrespective of how far away the client is from your measurement host because of TCPs threeway handshake for connection establishment when you see the opening SYN you wait for the client to ACK the servers SYN ACK and you have the clientserver roundtrip time I think youve actually already done some of this We could also potentially try to correlate DNS queries and TCP connections perhaps determining some probabilities in a given environment of a host initiating a TCP connection to a host for which it just received an A record and track various applicationlevel response times Id personally love to have a lot of data on the ratio of DNS response time to TCP transfer time for HTTP connections Even if the measurement makes no attempt to discern what constitutes a Web transaction to the user a full page usually many TCP connections Anyway I think there are some fairly interesting things we can measure with simple techniques these are just some simple ones There may be some interesting things we could do by digging into payloads of a few of the other highlyutilized applications but doing it for TCP is a nightmare perfomancewise But we now have the basic infrastructure to do things with DNS over UDP We can probably cover any open UDP protocol without incurring performance penalties that would make it completely unusable SNMP for example while its application is limited network service providers would find roundtrip time information for SNMP packets from their network management stations to agents very useful I think there are some rudimentary things we can do with TCP as well and I also think some sites would be interested in having some rudimentary information For example a weighted by traffic roundtrip time distribution for TCP traffic tofrom all networks with which you communicated say at granularity This gives sites a notion of how close they are to those they talk to most frequently With a little more work we could probably make reasonable bandwidth estimates for every end network for which we see TCP data we could certainly get a reasonable number for the maximum observed bandwidth These methods also decouple the measurement from the traffic While we all know the value of that I think its significant in that active probers can be run on the same host decoupled from the actual measurement and with timestamps coming from kernel space BPF Ive been thinking about this for a long time because eventually Id like skitter and other tools to be able to do use TCP packets for probing with no need for things like IP firewall code if I can just properly time nonblocking connects and count on the passive tool to see the SYN and SYN ACK I can use any TCP port for roundtrip time measurements and not trick my kernel by sending TCP packets on a raw socket I need feedback from the passive tool for tracing like skitter it needs to know when a reply has been seen from a hop and when the destination has been reached but its not difficult simple bytestreamoriented IPC is sufficient Going further I like the idea proposed by some others maybe funded at this point Im not tracking it of instrumenting the freenix TCPIP stacks A lot of useful information could be pulled from the stack But eventually someones going to have to come up with what pieces of information are desirable enough for someone to want their stack instrumented and itll have to be somewhere between whats currently implemented and a fullblown metering system like RTFM And I think in the interim there are a lot of things we could do using libpcap on our local machines nonpromiscuous and in user space safe easy to implement and test To me the benefits here are a user is likely to have a tangible wellunderstood relationship with their workstation understood by them This is particularly true for those of us with network expertise So its at least plausible that we can find correlations of measurements with user experience in a fairly short period of time helping us hone in on whats useful Even if we only find weak correlations for whatever reason once a correlation exists more people will be interested in helping with development because itll be something theyll use personally were essentially guaranteed to see traffic in both directions Id personally be interested in trying to find some small sets of information that correlate to user experiences so that it doesnt take a terabyte of disk and processors to deal with data from say desktops Anyway just some random thoughts The hard part for me at the moment is thinking about useful generalizations and infrastructure to support them Cindy Bickerstaff responded Were just starting to capture the MSS and window size negotiations between timeit and servers to get an idea of what is typical or usual Wonder if Daniels code could do that too from the various traffic monitoring points caida has out there The data could be used to fill in some parameters for trying to model some of the passive data collected Since a typical web page has many elements between a single client and server the first or base page gives you a starting idea of what to expect and the subsequent elements are like repeat measurements of the same path over a very short time interval Since there is a strong time of dayweek effect volumes and perf the short duration of the data collection from a single web page incl elements might give some options for modeling and maybe getting a better estimate of packet loss Ive really enjoyed joining the eeinterest group for the ideas on factors and the references to past modeling attempts eg mathis etal paper ack its bulk transfer focus Paul Krumviede highlighted the difficulty of agreeing on details of how to measure common metrics like availability reliability throughput and latency an example was throughput since it was proposed that this be measured using a TCP file transfer of random data one concern was what does this do to latency and where does this get measured as many customers of this service would not be large businesses measuring this from the customer end of a or kbps circuit was almost certain to drive endtoend latency measurements beyond defined bounds measuring it from within points in the providers networks might show figures that the customers could never see themselves the compromise was to define the throughput metric as ocurring at access link loads of no more than of the bit rate but how does one measure that and so on given that this discussion was recognized as being the prelude to the imposition of minimal SLAs as part of the certification process for service providers this may be an illustration of the perils of discussing SLAs and metrics in some interchangable form but they may not be easy to separate in the minds of some Carter Bullard said Im specifically interested in bridging RTFM and IPPM work particularly to describe how an RTFM can be a generic connectivity monitor IPPM describes TypePunidirection and bidirectional connectivity and a single point RTFM can detect these conditions but standard descriptions for how this can be done would be very useful Personally one of the things that Im interested in is TCP based streaming services performance such as that seen in Internet Radio distribution and of course IP Telephony wireline performance metrics would be very good to describe Nevil Brownlee comments that hes also very interested in developing the RTFM meter as a platform for more general measurements Two areas seem interesting apart from getting more information from TCP streams QoS DifServ performance what metrics do we need to characterise this IPSEC what metrics will still be useful when we cant look at port numbers what kinds of traffic can still be identified Curtis Villamizar said Im particularly interested in the work on DoS at homessavagetracebackhtml and would like to see that on the agenda This would provide a general way of determining where packets came from not just a tool for tracing DoS attacks

Metrics WG meeting Mar Hello CAIDA Members Update on the CAIDA Working Groups A mailing list B WG Charters Meeting on Mar A mailing list Ive set up a single mailing list with this name for discussions on WG topics passive measurements etc To start with its a moderated list ie you have to be a member of the list to post to it you join by sending email to asking to be added to the metrics list with the following initial set of members Sue Moon Brett Watson HansWerner Braun Matt Mathis Ian Graham Tony McGregor John Cleary Joerg Micheel Kevin Thompson Jambi Gambar Daniel McRobb David Moore Sean

list continue to be moderated or should it be changed into an open list B Working Group developments Following the CAIDA Members meeting on Feb Ive attempted to define exactly what problem we could consider getting an IETF Working Group started on My summary of the existing IETF WGs with interests in metrics is given below Appendix B but it seems unlikely that we could get a new IETF WG started I believe that we should instead run a single CAIDA Working Group on Network Metrics rather than the two proposed earlier My draft of its charter is appended below It focuses on producing educational material about network measurement and on developing new metrics these were the two areas of greatest interest amongst the CAIDA members The WG cochairs are Sue Moon SprintLabs and Brett Watson MFNAbovenet You are invited to attend the first WG meeting The agenda is as follows Agenda for CAIDA WG meeting on Thursday Mar am pm AboveNet Downtown SJC see below for details Review WG Charter Is it reasonable as set out in the draft What should be removed or added Work through revised charter in detail Identify the work required for each part Determine whos willing to work on it Attempt to

What new services are being or are likely to be offered eg DIFFSERV Is there a need for higherlayer metrics to better monitor and manage these services c Will these new differentiated transport and applicationlayer services need new metrics d How can the service metrics be measured in a multiISP environment e How can customers verify these measurements f What requirements would service measurement introduce for equipment vendors g How relevant are specific techniques eg which flow and points of measurement to specific users ISP customer etc requirements h How do these metrics relate to network behavior as perceived by users How do they correlate with performance Appendix B Background on the IETF Working Groups RTFM WG Realtime traffic Flow Measurement RTFM is concerned with passive measurements of twoway traffic flows specified in terms of their endpoint attributes Its primary goal was To produce an improved Traffic Flow Measurement Model considering at least the following needs a Wider range of measurable quantities eg those relating to IPv and to class of service b Simpler ways to specify flows of interest c Better ways to control access to measured flow data d Strong focus on data reduction capabilities e Efficient hardware implementation IPPM WG IP Performance Measurement The IPPM WG charter is to develop a set of standard metrics that can be applied to the quality performance and reliability of Internet data delivery services These metrics will be designed such that they can be performed by network operators end users or independent

most of his relevant information is attached below Stinson Forwarded by Stinson GibnerHOUECT on AM Paulo Rocha e Oliveira ITEDU on PM To Stinson Gibner cc Subject Re Trip to Houston Stinson Thank you for your email My phone number is I graduated from Princeton University in mathematics and came straight to MIT for a PhD in Operations Management at the Sloan Schoolof Management In my first three years I took all the required coursework in mathematics optimization stochastic processes etc as well as a number of courses in psychology at MIT and Harvard I am working with Prof Gabriel Bitran and I am interested in the mathematical modeling of service operations In particular I am interested in the interaction between customers and companies hence the interest in psychology The tentative title of my PhD thesis is Pricing Substitute Products on the Internet and I am sending you the summary which I sent to Tom Gros a few weeks ago that will give you an idea of what this research is about Thanks again and Im looking forward to meeting you and your research group next week Paulo Pricing Substitute Products on the Internet Objective To develop new tools to decide pricing policies for goods and services sold on the internet Motivation This research is motivated by the fact that traditional choice and optimization models are not appropriate for internetrelated businesses The technological innovations associated with the internet brought about an overload of information which inevitably affects the ways in which consumers make choices Furthermore companies have a great deal of influence on how much information consumers can have access to The problem of pricing substitute products is an important strategic issue faced by internet companies Consumers usually search for generic products eg VCRs or computers without knowing exactly what they will buy Companies can show different products and different prices to each consumer This type of flexibility was not available until the internet came about The problem of pricing substitute products is not unique to the internet The methodology developed by this research should be transferable to a number of other settings such as pricing services Services are unique and there are many cases where customers will only buy one of many services offered by a given company Our model will help companies decide which services to offer to which customers and how much to charge for these services Research Strategy Our research strategy is to divide the pricing problem into two components which can be combined to generate optimal pricing strategies These components are choice models and optimization models Choice Models Choice models describe how customers make choices The management literature draws on two main sources for these models psychology and economics The common approach in psychology models is to use what are called heuristic elimination methods These methods consist of the elimination of options based on the sequential elimination of features until only one choice remains These methods tend to be very contextspecific and do not lend themselves very easily to mathematical analysis Economists focus on utilitymaximing models that are significantly more mathematically tractable than psychological models The most common economic model of choice is the logit model The problem with these types of models is that they are not very accurate reflections of how consumer make choices on the internet The first step in our research will be to develop choice models that capture the interactions going on between customers and companies on the internet Optimization Traditionally the optimization problem consists of maximizing revenue over a certain planning horizon On the internet the problem of maximizing revenue still exists but there is also a need to learn about customers Short term profit is based on sales but long term profit is based on how well you know your customers and are able to retain them The optimization problem must therefore include a short term component sales and a long term component learning

most of his relevant information is attached below Stinson Forwarded by Stinson GibnerHOUECT on AM Paulo Rocha e Oliveira ITEDU on PM To Stinson Gibner cc Subject Re Trip to Houston Stinson Thank you for your email My phone number is I graduated from Princeton University in mathematics and came straight to MIT for a PhD in Operations Management at the Sloan Schoolof Management In my first three years I took all the required coursework in mathematics optimization stochastic processes etc as well as a number of courses in psychology at MIT and Harvard I am working with Prof Gabriel Bitran and I am interested in the mathematical modeling of service operations In particular I am interested in the interaction between customers and companies hence the interest in psychology The tentative title of my PhD thesis is Pricing Substitute Products on the Internet and I am sending you the summary which I sent to Tom Gros a few weeks ago that will give you an idea of what this research is about Thanks again and Im looking forward to meeting you and your research group next week Paulo Pricing Substitute Products on the Internet Objective To develop new tools to decide pricing policies for goods and services sold on the internet Motivation This research is motivated by the fact that traditional choice and optimization models are not appropriate for internetrelated businesses The technological innovations associated with the internet brought about an overload of information which inevitably affects the ways in which consumers make choices Furthermore companies have a great deal of influence on how much information consumers can have access to The problem of pricing substitute products is an important strategic issue faced by internet companies Consumers usually search for generic products eg VCRs or computers without knowing exactly what they will buy Companies can show different products and different prices to each consumer This type of flexibility was not available until the internet came about The problem of pricing substitute products is not unique to the internet The methodology developed by this research should be transferable to a number of other settings such as pricing services Services are unique and there are many cases where customers will only buy one of many services offered by a given company Our model will help companies decide which services to offer to which customers and how much to charge for these services Research Strategy Our research strategy is to divide the pricing problem into two components which can be combined to generate optimal pricing strategies These components are choice models and optimization models Choice Models Choice models describe how customers make choices The management literature draws on two main sources for these models psychology and economics The common approach in psychology models is to use what are called heuristic elimination methods These methods consist of the elimination of options based on the sequential elimination of features until only one choice remains These methods tend to be very contextspecific and do not lend themselves very easily to mathematical analysis Economists focus on utilitymaximing models that are significantly more mathematically tractable than psychological models The most common economic model of choice is the logit model The problem with these types of models is that they are not very accurate reflections of how consumer make choices on the internet The first step in our research will be to develop choice models that capture the interactions going on between customers and companies on the internet Optimization Traditionally the optimization problem consists of maximizing revenue over a certain planning horizon On the internet the problem of maximizing revenue still exists but there is also a need to learn about customers Short term profit is based on sales but long term profit is based on how well you know your customers and are able to retain them The optimization problem must therefore include a short term component sales and a long term component learning

list continue to be moderated or should it be changed into an open list B Working Group developments Following the CAIDA Members meeting on Feb Ive attempted to define exactly what problem we could consider getting an IETF Working Group started on My summary of the existing IETF WGs with interests in metrics is given below Appendix B but it seems unlikely that we could get a new IETF WG started I believe that we should instead run a single CAIDA Working Group on Network Metrics rather than the two proposed earlier My draft of its charter is appended below It focuses on producing educational material about network measurement and on developing new metrics these were the two areas of greatest interest amongst the CAIDA members The WG cochairs are Sue Moon SprintLabs and Brett Watson MFNAbovenet You are invited to attend the first WG meeting The agenda is as follows Agenda for CAIDA WG meeting on Thursday Mar am pm AboveNet Downtown SJC see below for details Review WG Charter Is it reasonable as set out in the draft What should be removed or added Work through revised charter in detail Identify the work required for each part Determine whos willing to work on it Attempt to

passive measurements of twoway traffic flows specified in terms of their endpoint attributes Its primary goal was To produce an improved Traffic Flow Measurement Model considering at least the following needs a Wider range of measurable quantities eg those relating to IPv and to class of service b Simpler ways to specify flows of interest c Better ways to control access to measured flow data d Strong focus on data reduction capabilities e Efficient hardware implementation IPPM WG IP Performance Measurement The IPPM WG charter is to develop a set of standard metrics that can be applied to the quality performance and reliability of Internet data delivery services These metrics will be designed such that they can be performed by network operators end users or independent testing groups It is important that the metrics not represent a value judgement ie define good and bad but rather provide unbiased quantitative measures of performance RFCs Framework for IP Performance Metrics RFC Metrics Connectivity RFC Oneway Delay RFC Oneway Packet Loss RFC Roundtrip Delay RFC IDs Bulk Transfer Capacity x Instantaneous Packet Delay Variation Oneway Loss Patterns Other WGs The RMONMIB WG is thinking about Application Performance Measurement This is clearly a hard problem eg does this just mean responsetime measurement can it be done by passive means how should the measurements be presented etc In short RTFM provides a good distributed measuring system for traffic volumes IPPM has concentrated on transportlayer behaviour of the current besteffort Internet

Ravi ThuraisinghamEnron Communications Subject Material for Thu mar WG meeting Hello all Appended below youll find a summary of ideas that people have contributed since we at CAIDA began to get the metrics wg started Some of this material has already appeared on the metrics mailing list the older material comes from personal emails Im posting it again to give us all some more ideas to think about For those who are able to attend the WG meeting in San Jose this Thursday Mar Id like to spend time in the morning getting to know about attendees interests and experience in making Internet measurements I suggest that a good way to do this would be to have each group give a short minutes slides presentation of their measurement work That should allow us to make a longer list of metrics to discuss in more detail for the rest of the meeting Comments please Ill send out a revisedupdated agenda late tomorrow Cheers Nevil PS We now have about people on the mailing list Please copy all further metrics email to the list so that we can all see it We now have a websearchable list archive in place at archivesmetrics Nevil Brownlee Visiting Researcher Phone CAIDA San Diego Several people have expressed interest in passive measurements on TCP streams One simple example is keeping track of DNS response times Daniel McRobb offered the following I also believe a similar simple technique could be used to track TCP response times and this gets even more interesting you only need to be able to see traffic in one direction from client to server to get a fairly accurate roundtrip time from the client to the server irrespective of how far away the client is from your measurement host because of TCPs threeway handshake for connection establishment when you see the opening SYN you wait for the client to ACK the servers SYN ACK and you have the clientserver roundtrip time I think youve actually already done some of this We could also potentially try to correlate DNS queries and TCP connections perhaps determining some probabilities in a given environment of a host initiating a TCP connection to a host for which it just received an A record and track various applicationlevel response times Id personally love to have a lot of data on the ratio of DNS response time to TCP transfer time for HTTP connections Even if the measurement makes no attempt to discern what constitutes a Web transaction to the user a full page usually many TCP connections Anyway I think there are some fairly interesting things we can measure with simple techniques these are just some simple ones There may be some interesting things we could do by digging into payloads of a few of the other highlyutilized applications but doing it for TCP is a nightmare perfomancewise But we now have the basic infrastructure to do things with DNS over UDP We can probably cover any open UDP protocol without incurring performance penalties that would make it completely unusable SNMP for example while its application is limited network service providers would find roundtrip time information for SNMP packets from their network management stations to agents very useful I think there are some rudimentary things we can do with TCP as well and I also think some sites would be interested in having some rudimentary information For example a weighted by traffic roundtrip time distribution for TCP traffic tofrom all networks with which you communicated say at granularity This gives sites a notion of how close they are to those they talk to most frequently With a little more work we could probably make reasonable bandwidth estimates for every end network for which we see TCP data we could certainly get a reasonable number for the maximum observed bandwidth These methods also decouple the measurement from the traffic While we all know the value of that I think its significant in that active probers can be run on the same host decoupled from the actual measurement and with timestamps coming from kernel space BPF Ive been thinking about this for a long time because eventually Id like skitter and other tools to be able to do use TCP packets for probing with no need for things like IP firewall code if I can just properly time nonblocking connects and count on the passive tool to see the SYN and SYN ACK I can use any TCP port for roundtrip time measurements and not trick my kernel by sending TCP packets on a raw socket I need feedback from the passive tool for tracing like skitter it needs to know when a reply has been seen from a hop and when the destination has been reached but its not difficult simple bytestreamoriented IPC is sufficient Going further I like the idea proposed by some others maybe funded at this point Im not tracking it of instrumenting the freenix TCPIP stacks A lot of useful information could be pulled from the stack But eventually someones going to have to come up with what pieces of information are desirable enough for someone to want their stack instrumented and itll have to be somewhere between whats currently implemented and a fullblown metering system like RTFM And I think in the interim there are a lot of things we could do using libpcap on our local machines nonpromiscuous and in user space safe easy to implement and test To me the benefits here are a user is likely to have a tangible wellunderstood relationship with their workstation understood by them This is particularly true for those of us with network expertise So its at least plausible that we can find correlations of measurements with user experience in a fairly short period of time helping us hone in on whats useful Even if we only find weak correlations for whatever reason once a correlation exists more people will be interested in helping with development because itll be something theyll use personally were essentially guaranteed to see traffic in both directions Id personally be interested in trying to find some small sets of information that correlate to user experiences so that it doesnt take a terabyte of disk and processors to deal with data from say desktops Anyway just some random thoughts The hard part for me at the moment is thinking about useful generalizations and infrastructure to support them Cindy Bickerstaff responded Were just starting to capture the MSS and window size negotiations between timeit and servers to get an idea of what is typical or usual Wonder if Daniels code could do that too from the various traffic monitoring points caida has out there The data could be used to fill in some parameters for trying to model some of the passive data collected Since a typical web page has many elements between a single client and server the first or base page gives you a starting idea of what to expect and the subsequent elements are like repeat measurements of the same path over a very short time interval Since there is a strong time of dayweek effect volumes and perf the short duration of the data collection from a single web page incl elements might give some options for modeling and maybe getting a better estimate of packet loss Ive really enjoyed joining the eeinterest group for the ideas on factors and the references to past modeling attempts eg mathis etal paper ack its bulk transfer focus Paul Krumviede highlighted the difficulty of agreeing on details of how to measure common metrics like availability reliability throughput and latency an example was throughput since it was proposed that this be measured using a TCP file transfer of random data one concern was what does this do to latency and where does this get measured as many customers of this service would not be large businesses measuring this from the customer end of a or kbps circuit was almost certain to drive endtoend latency measurements beyond defined bounds measuring it from within points in the providers networks might show figures that the customers could never see themselves the compromise was to define the throughput metric as ocurring at access link loads of no more than of the bit rate but how does one measure that and so on given that this discussion was recognized as being the prelude to the imposition of minimal SLAs as part of the certification process for service providers this may be an illustration of the perils of discussing SLAs and metrics in some interchangable form but they may not be easy to separate in the minds of some Carter Bullard said Im specifically interested in bridging RTFM and IPPM work particularly to describe how an RTFM can be a generic connectivity monitor IPPM describes TypePunidirection and bidirectional connectivity and a single point RTFM can detect these conditions but standard descriptions for how this can be done would be very useful Personally one of the things that Im interested in is TCP based streaming services performance such as that seen in Internet Radio distribution and of course IP Telephony wireline performance metrics would be very good to describe Nevil Brownlee comments that hes also very interested in developing the RTFM meter as a platform for more general measurements Two areas seem interesting apart from getting more information from TCP streams QoS DifServ performance what metrics do we need to characterise this IPSEC what metrics will still be useful when we cant look at port numbers what kinds of traffic can still be identified Curtis Villamizar said Im particularly interested in the work on DoS at homessavagetracebackhtml and would like to see that on the agenda This would provide a general way of determining where packets came from not just a tool for tracing DoS attacks

discussions for the new working group it might not be the ideal venue for Enron to get acquainted with CAIDA Vince and Stinson may want to wait until KC Claffy or I can visit Portland or have several Enron reps visit San Diego for demos and related discussions We have been talking to Stan Hanks for some time about Enrons interests in passive measurement and are in the process of implementing some of the performance features in CoralReef that he has described as relevant to Enron Examples of existing CoralReef analyses on OC links can be found at CoralReefDemoscerfnetlink realtime AIX postprocessed traces We are also working to better tune the skitter tool for reachability analysis and for use by providers an example of some existing analyses can be found at ToolsSkitterSummarysjcskittercaidaorg For endtoend measurements including those relating to service level guarantees we are working to make skping and sktrace more useful to providers and their NOC personnel see ToolsSkitterskping Another tool of relevance to providers is our cflowd which analyzes flow export data from Cisco routers see Toolscflowd We would appreciate the opportunity to talk with Enron personnel about how to make these tools more relevant and useful to your needs however it is doubtful that we will have time to discuss specific tools on Thursday We look forward to meeting you soon Take care Tracie Monk Director CAIDA Forwarded message To cc Date Thu Feb Subject Re CAIDA Metrics WG meeting Mar fwd Hi Amy Jim Irvine EBS head of Network Planning and I Team Lead EBS

meeting Mar fwd Hi Ravi I wanted to follow up directly with you and see if you or anyone at Enron had any interest in participating in the proposed CAIDA Metrics working group meeting Please let me know Amy E Blanchard CAIDA email phone fax B WG Charters Meeting on Mar I believe that we should instead run a single CAIDA Working Group on Network Metrics rather than the two proposed earlier My draft of its charter is appended below It focuses on producing educational material about network measurement and on developing new metrics these were the two areas of greatest interest amongst the CAIDA members The WG cochairs are Sue Moon SprintLabs and Brett Watson MFNAbovenet You are invited to attend the first WG meeting The agenda is as follows Agenda for CAIDA WG meeting on Thursday Mar am pm AboveNet Downtown SJC see below for details Review WG Charter Is it reasonable as set out in the draft What should be removed or added Work through revised charter in detail Identify the work required for each part Determine whos willing to work on it Attempt to determine delivery times Discussion of new metrics First attempt at making a list of metrics to be considered Anything else Location AboveNet is located in the KnightRidder Building attached to the Fairmont Hotel complex The address is W San Fernando St San Jose CA RSVP To help us with organising the meeting please send email to telling us how many will attend from your organisation Cheers Nevil Nevil Brownlee Visiting Researcher Phone CAIDA San Diego CAIDA Network Metrics Working Group Draft Charter Tue Feb Goals Education FAQ on What does measuring the Internet actually mean Why measure anyway What can be measured How Where By whom Active vs passive endtoend vs provider network only application vs transport layer Rating schemes provider net performance pages Internet Weather Maps Keynote etc Publish as CAIDA web pages or maybe as an Info RFC Survey paper on metrics and Internet Measurement Current measurement efforts Surveyor RIPE Test Traffic AMP IPERF ATT Keynoteskitter Current tools Publish as CAIDA web pages Service Metrics Define new metrics Taxonomy of current metrics IPPM RTFM ITU Summary of metrics used for current services Gather informationideas about newemerging services especially DiffServbased ones Make list of new metrics either to improve measurement of existing services or to support new ones list of metrics questions Appendix A goes here Organise experimental implementationtesting of tools for new metrics Make recommendations on implementation Define core set of really useful metrics recommend that CAIDA implement these as a Service Measurement Toolkit Publish new metric definitions through IPPM or RTFM Produce document measurement requirements for hardwaresoftware vendors Publish on CAIDA web pages Appendix A Questions from the earlier draft CAIDA WG charters a What types of network and transportlayer metrics are being used by ISPs in engineering and operating their networks By Customers for verifying service guarantees b What new services are being or are likely to be offered eg DIFFSERV Is there a need for higherlayer metrics to better monitor and manage these services c Will these new differentiated transport and applicationlayer services need new metrics d How can the service metrics be measured in a multiISP environment e How can customers verify these measurements f What requirements would service measurement introduce for equipment vendors g How relevant are specific techniques eg which flow and points of measurement to specific users ISP customer etc requirements h How do these metrics relate to network behavior as perceived by users How do they correlate with performance Appendix B Background on the IETF Working Groups RTFM WG Realtime traffic Flow Measurement RTFM is concerned with passive measurements of twoway traffic flows specified in terms of their endpoint attributes Its primary goal was To produce an improved Traffic Flow Measurement Model considering at least the following needs a Wider range of measurable quantities eg those relating to IPv and to class of service b Simpler ways to specify flows of interest c Better ways to control access to measured flow data d Strong focus on data reduction capabilities e Efficient hardware implementation IPPM WG IP Performance Measurement The IPPM WG charter is to develop a set of standard metrics that can be applied to the quality performance and reliability of Internet data delivery services These metrics will be designed such that they can be performed by network operators end users or independent testing groups It is important that the metrics not represent a value judgement ie define good and bad but rather provide unbiased quantitative measures of performance RFCs Framework for IP Performance Metrics RFC Metrics Connectivity RFC Oneway Delay RFC Oneway Packet Loss RFC Roundtrip Delay RFC IDs Bulk Transfer Capacity x Instantaneous Packet Delay Variation Oneway Loss Patterns Other WGs The RMONMIB WG is thinking about Application Performance Measurement This is clearly a hard problem eg does this just mean responsetime measurement can it be done by passive means how should the measurements be presented etc In short RTFM provides a good distributed measuring system for traffic volumes IPPM has concentrated on transportlayer behaviour of the current besteffort Internet RMONMIB is beginning to consider applicationlayer measurement End of forwarded message

Lee is very experienced in traditional traffic engineering work He comes from MCI where he was responsible for modeling traffic etc It appears that Sycamore finally got him One time they had lost him to Corvis another optical equipment company I guess Sycamore went back to him with a better deal As soon as this guy is available Ill set up an all day technical meeting to hash out what needs to be done as far as optimization algorithm development is concerned I want to produce a technical requirement document to clearly outline what needs to be done to support dynamic opticalswitchedcircuits based trading and streaming media applications etc Having such an industry expert help us will help justify internally all the the effort on the traffic analysis side that John Griebling has asked us to support Keep in mind that even though he is an expert in the field the field that we need to play in has not develop yet Even the emerging data based traffic as opposed to voice where blocking of traffic is allowed analysis is an order of magnitude more difficult due to uncertain load let alone trading such load which we are planning to do Ravi Sycamore hired a guy per Grieblings request to work with you on the designplanning piece of the business He will be contracted out to Enron for a period of months initially He lives in SF but will be traveling to whereever you need him Jim

know Amy E Blanchard CAIDA email phone fax B WG Charters Meeting on Mar I believe that we should instead run a single CAIDA Working Group on Network Metrics rather than the two proposed earlier My draft of its charter is appended below It focuses on producing educational material about network measurement and on developing new metrics these were the two areas of greatest interest amongst the CAIDA members The WG cochairs are Sue Moon SprintLabs and Brett Watson MFNAbovenet You are invited to attend the first WG meeting The agenda is as follows Agenda for CAIDA WG meeting on Thursday Mar am pm AboveNet Downtown SJC see below for details Review WG Charter Is it reasonable as set out in the draft What should be removed or added Work through revised charter in detail Identify the work required for each part Determine whos willing to work on it Attempt to determine delivery times Discussion of new metrics First attempt at making a list of metrics to be considered Anything else

better monitor and manage these services c Will these new differentiated transport and applicationlayer services need new metrics d How can the service metrics be measured in a multiISP environment e How can customers verify these measurements f What requirements would service measurement introduce for equipment vendors g How relevant are specific techniques eg which flow and points of measurement to specific users ISP customer etc requirements h How do these metrics relate to network behavior as perceived by users How do they correlate with performance Appendix B Background on the IETF Working Groups RTFM WG Realtime traffic Flow Measurement RTFM is concerned with passive measurements of twoway traffic flows specified in terms of their endpoint attributes Its primary goal was To produce an improved Traffic Flow Measurement Model considering at least the following needs a Wider range of measurable quantities eg those relating to IPv and to class of service b Simpler ways to specify flows of interest c Better ways to control access to measured flow data d Strong focus on data reduction capabilities e Efficient hardware implementation IPPM WG IP Performance Measurement The IPPM WG charter is to develop a set of standard metrics that can be applied to the quality performance and reliability of Internet data delivery services These metrics will be designed such that they can be performed by network operators end users or independent testing groups It is important that the metrics not represent a value judgement ie define good and bad but rather provide unbiased quantitative measures of performance RFCs Framework for IP Performance Metrics RFC Metrics Connectivity RFC Oneway Delay RFC Oneway Packet Loss RFC Roundtrip Delay RFC IDs Bulk Transfer Capacity x Instantaneous Packet Delay Variation Oneway Loss Patterns Other WGs The RMONMIB WG is thinking about Application Performance Measurement This is clearly a hard problem eg does this just mean responsetime measurement can it be done by passive means how should the measurements be presented etc In short RTFM provides a good distributed measuring system for traffic volumes IPPM has concentrated on transportlayer behaviour of the current besteffort Internet RMONMIB is beginning to consider applicationlayer measurement End of forwarded message

Ravi ThuraisinghamEnron Communications Subject Material for Thu mar WG meeting Hello all Appended below youll find a summary of ideas that people have contributed since we at CAIDA began to get the metrics wg started Some of this material has already appeared on the metrics mailing list the older material comes from personal emails Im posting it again to give us all some more ideas to think about For those who are able to attend the WG meeting in San Jose this Thursday Mar Id like to spend time in the morning getting to know about attendees interests and experience in making Internet measurements I suggest that a good way to do this would be to have each group give a short minutes slides presentation of their measurement work That should allow us to make a longer list of metrics to discuss in more detail for the rest of the meeting Comments please Ill send out a revisedupdated agenda late tomorrow Cheers Nevil PS We now have about people on the mailing list Please copy all further metrics email to the list so that we can all see it We now have a websearchable list archive in place at archivesmetrics Nevil Brownlee Visiting Researcher Phone CAIDA San Diego Several people have expressed interest in passive measurements on TCP streams One simple example is keeping track of DNS response times Daniel McRobb offered the following I also believe a similar simple technique could be used to track TCP response times and this gets even more interesting you only need to be able to see traffic in one direction from client to server to get a fairly accurate roundtrip time from the client to the server irrespective of how far away the client is from your measurement host because of TCPs threeway handshake for connection establishment when you see the opening SYN you wait for the client to ACK the servers SYN ACK and you have the clientserver roundtrip time I think youve actually already done some of this We could also potentially try to correlate DNS queries and TCP connections perhaps determining some probabilities in a given environment of a host initiating a TCP connection to a host for which it just received an A record and track various applicationlevel response times Id personally love to have a lot of data on the ratio of DNS response time to TCP transfer time for HTTP connections Even if the measurement makes no attempt to discern what constitutes a Web transaction to the user a full page usually many TCP connections Anyway I think there are some fairly interesting things we can measure with simple techniques these are just some simple ones There may be some interesting things we could do by digging into payloads of a few of the other highlyutilized applications but doing it for TCP is a nightmare perfomancewise But we now have the basic infrastructure to do things with DNS over UDP We can probably cover any open UDP protocol without incurring performance penalties that would make it completely unusable SNMP for example while its application is limited network service providers would find roundtrip time information for SNMP packets from their network management stations to agents very useful I think there are some rudimentary things we can do with TCP as well and I also think some sites would be interested in having some rudimentary information For example a weighted by traffic roundtrip time distribution for TCP traffic tofrom all networks with which you communicated say at granularity This gives sites a notion of how close they are to those they talk to most frequently With a little more work we could probably make reasonable bandwidth estimates for every end network for which we see TCP data we could certainly get a reasonable number for the maximum observed bandwidth These methods also decouple the measurement from the traffic While we all know the value of that I think its significant in that active probers can be run on the same host decoupled from the actual measurement and with timestamps coming from kernel space BPF Ive been thinking about this for a long time because eventually Id like skitter and other tools to be able to do use TCP packets for probing with no need for things like IP firewall code if I can just properly time nonblocking connects and count on the passive tool to see the SYN and SYN ACK I can use any TCP port for roundtrip time measurements and not trick my kernel by sending TCP packets on a raw socket I need feedback from the passive tool for tracing like skitter it needs to know when a reply has been seen from a hop and when the destination has been reached but its not difficult simple bytestreamoriented IPC is sufficient Going further I like the idea proposed by some others maybe funded at this point Im not tracking it of instrumenting the freenix TCPIP stacks A lot of useful information could be pulled from the stack But eventually someones going to have to come up with what pieces of information are desirable enough for someone to want their stack instrumented and itll have to be somewhere between whats currently implemented and a fullblown metering system like RTFM And I think in the interim there are a lot of things we could do using libpcap on our local machines nonpromiscuous and in user space safe easy to implement and test To me the benefits here are a user is likely to have a tangible wellunderstood relationship with their workstation understood by them This is particularly true for those of us with network expertise So its at least plausible that we can find correlations of measurements with user experience in a fairly short period of time helping us hone in on whats useful Even if we only find weak correlations for whatever reason once a correlation exists more people will be interested in helping with development because itll be something theyll use personally were essentially guaranteed to see traffic in both directions Id personally be interested in trying to find some small sets of information that correlate to user experiences so that it doesnt take a terabyte of disk and processors to deal with data from say desktops Anyway just some random thoughts The hard part for me at the moment is thinking about useful generalizations and infrastructure to support them Cindy Bickerstaff responded Were just starting to capture the MSS and window size negotiations between timeit and servers to get an idea of what is typical or usual Wonder if Daniels code could do that too from the various traffic monitoring points caida has out there The data could be used to fill in some parameters for trying to model some of the passive data collected Since a typical web page has many elements between a single client and server the first or base page gives you a starting idea of what to expect and the subsequent elements are like repeat measurements of the same path over a very short time interval Since there is a strong time of dayweek effect volumes and perf the short duration of the data collection from a single web page incl elements might give some options for modeling and maybe getting a better estimate of packet loss Ive really enjoyed joining the eeinterest group for the ideas on factors and the references to past modeling attempts eg mathis etal paper ack its bulk transfer focus Paul Krumviede highlighted the difficulty of agreeing on details of how to measure common metrics like availability reliability throughput and latency an example was throughput since it was proposed that this be measured using a TCP file transfer of random data one concern was what does this do to latency and where does this get measured as many customers of this service would not be large businesses measuring this from the customer end of a or kbps circuit was almost certain to drive endtoend latency measurements beyond defined bounds measuring it from within points in the providers networks might show figures that the customers could never see themselves the compromise was to define the throughput metric as ocurring at access link loads of no more than of the bit rate but how does one measure that and so on given that this discussion was recognized as being the prelude to the imposition of minimal SLAs as part of the certification process for service providers this may be an illustration of the perils of discussing SLAs and metrics in some interchangable form but they may not be easy to separate in the minds of some Carter Bullard said Im specifically interested in bridging RTFM and IPPM work particularly to describe how an RTFM can be a generic connectivity monitor IPPM describes TypePunidirection and bidirectional connectivity and a single point RTFM can detect these conditions but standard descriptions for how this can be done would be very useful Personally one of the things that Im interested in is TCP based streaming services performance such as that seen in Internet Radio distribution and of course IP Telephony wireline performance metrics would be very good to describe Nevil Brownlee comments that hes also very interested in developing the RTFM meter as a platform for more general measurements Two areas seem interesting apart from getting more information from TCP streams QoS DifServ performance what metrics do we need to characterise this IPSEC what metrics will still be useful when we cant look at port numbers what kinds of traffic can still be identified Curtis Villamizar said Im particularly interested in the work on DoS at homessavagetracebackhtml and would like to see that on the agenda This would provide a general way of determining where packets came from not just a tool for tracing DoS attacks

most of his relevant information is attached below Stinson Forwarded by Stinson GibnerHOUECT on AM Paulo Rocha e Oliveira ITEDU on PM To Stinson Gibner cc Subject Re Trip to Houston Stinson Thank you for your email My phone number is I graduated from Princeton University in mathematics and came straight to MIT for a PhD in Operations Management at the Sloan Schoolof Management In my first three years I took all the required coursework in mathematics optimization stochastic processes etc as well as a number of courses in psychology at MIT and Harvard I am working with Prof Gabriel Bitran and I am interested in the mathematical modeling of service operations In particular I am interested in the interaction between customers and companies hence the interest in psychology The tentative title of my PhD thesis is Pricing Substitute Products on the Internet and I am sending you the summary which I sent to Tom Gros a few weeks ago that will give you an idea of what this research is about Thanks again and Im looking forward to meeting you and your research group next week Paulo Pricing Substitute Products on the Internet Objective To develop new tools to decide pricing policies for goods and services sold on the internet Motivation This research is motivated by the fact that traditional choice and optimization models are not appropriate for internetrelated businesses The technological innovations associated with the internet brought about an overload of information which inevitably affects the ways in which consumers make choices Furthermore companies have a great deal of influence on how much information consumers can have access to The problem of pricing substitute products is an important strategic issue faced by internet companies Consumers usually search for generic products eg VCRs or computers without knowing exactly what they will buy Companies can show different products and different prices to each consumer This type of flexibility was not available until the internet came about The problem of pricing substitute products is not unique to the internet The methodology developed by this research should be transferable to a number of other settings such as pricing services Services are unique and there are many cases where customers will only buy one of many services offered by a given company Our model will help companies decide which services to offer to which customers and how much to charge for these services Research Strategy Our research strategy is to divide the pricing problem into two components which can be combined to generate optimal pricing strategies These components are choice models and optimization models Choice Models Choice models describe how customers make choices The management literature draws on two main sources for these models psychology and economics The common approach in psychology models is to use what are called heuristic elimination methods These methods consist of the elimination of options based on the sequential elimination of features until only one choice remains These methods tend to be very contextspecific and do not lend themselves very easily to mathematical analysis Economists focus on utilitymaximing models that are significantly more mathematically tractable than psychological models The most common economic model of choice is the logit model The problem with these types of models is that they are not very accurate reflections of how consumer make choices on the internet The first step in our research will be to develop choice models that capture the interactions going on between customers and companies on the internet Optimization Traditionally the optimization problem consists of maximizing revenue over a certain planning horizon On the internet the problem of maximizing revenue still exists but there is also a need to learn about customers Short term profit is based on sales but long term profit is based on how well you know your customers and are able to retain them The optimization problem must therefore include a short term component sales and a long term component learning
