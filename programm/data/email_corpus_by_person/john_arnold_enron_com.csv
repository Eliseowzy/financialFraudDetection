<5054621.1075857601973.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,john.arnold@enron.com,2000-04-16 06:50:00,Re optionsThe problem if we limit the size on options to being what size is offered on the swap hedge we will not be able to offer adequate size on the options Optimally I think we want to offer a minimum size of across all strikes If the swap is one a day up and someone buys half a day making the market one a day by half a day the size offered on a cent out of the money call might be as low as contracts a much smaller size than most people want to trade If we restrict to strikes with a lower delta we face the problem of not offering enough strikes and not making a market in options that have open EOL interest that have moved closer to the money Maybe the answer is to assume the swap hedge to be a penny wide two way wrapped around the EOL swap mid market Thus if the front swap on EOL is one a day by half a day the input into the option calculator is up In this case I think is necessary because once a strike has open interest we must continue to support it Thus I anticipate having to make markets in deep itm options as the market moves In terms of straddle strikes I think the edge received from buying straddles struck on the EOL offer and viceversa is not big enough to compensate for what I think the industry will view as a scam and another way Enron is trying to rip people off Although striking on the midmarket is probably easier for the trader I actually think striking in five cent increments makes more sense It allows people to trade out of the position on EOL Whereas if someone buys the straddle and the market moves to they have to call ENE to close the trade If the trade is struck at we will have a market on both the call and put at all times Secondly I would anticipate nonvolatility driven option traders may elect to sell either just the put or call in this scenario depending on their view of market direction

cc Subject Here is the Articleno picture though Warming Up To Green BY ERIC ROSTON Breathe in Hold it Hold it OK now breathe out Unless youre outdoors in the midst of a cold snap chances are you cant see your breath And no one would ever ask you to drop a quarter in a tin box for the right to free this invisible spirit from your lungs Yet last November Murphy Oil Corp based in El Dorado Ark voluntarily shelled out several hundred thousand dollars for the right to cough out carbon dioxide the same stuff you exhaled three sentences ago The reason it did so is closely related to events that occurred that same autumn day half a world away at the Hague Thousands of policymakers and scientists from all over the world had gathered hoping to dot the is cross the zeds and umlaut the os on the Kyoto Protocol to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change The protocol was devised to curb the industrial emission of six gases CO among them that are slowlyactually quickly in geological termsturning the earth into a hothouse But no final accord was reached In this context Murphys purchase of options on metric tons of carbon the equivalent of annual exhaust from approximately cars from a Canadian company that was itself trying to help meet a national target seems a bit odd The market for this kind of trade hasnt been established and there isnt even a global agreement on how carbon dioxide should be valued Indeed there isnt even unanimity on global warming itself Yet the transaction is emblematic of industry on the verge of an environmental transition Congress may have snubbed the Kyoto accord and global bureaucrats may be stumbling over the details of a carbonemissions trading system But corporations against the run of play are beginning to confront the climate conundrum the best way they know howas a business opportunity John Browne CEO of BP Amoco and Mark MoodyStuart chairman of Royal DutchShell Group have both responded to the globalwarming threat and set up internal systems that exceed goals put forth in Kyoto Shell and BP have vowed to cut their greenhousegas emissions eachnearly twice the Kyoto targetShell by BP by This isnt an act of altruism says Aidan Murphy of Shell Its a fundamental strategic issue for our business And not theirs alone A growing number of corporations from IBM to your neighborhood Kinkos are reducing their greenhouse footprints DuPont is pledging to knock its emissions below levels by Theres been a shift in the center of gravity in the US corporate community since Kyoto says Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists Now the view is that climate change is serious and we ought to do something about it There are a few ways of doing that invest in renewable energy sources and cap and trade emissions That is set ceilings for worldwide greenhousegas emission and let nations either sell emission credits if they emit below their allowance or buy credits if they exceed permitted levels The theory is that the pursuit of greenbacks will fuel greener business Whenever you turn a pollution cut into a financial asset says Joseph Goffman an attorney at Environmental Defense people go out and make lots of pollution cuts Even where green fervor is of a paler shade corporations are viewing the potential for global regulation as a business risk they need to consider Witness Claiborne Deming Murphys CEO who doesnt see the science of global warming as solid enough yet to cry havoc But Deming hears shareholders clamoring and the bureaucrats buzzing Someone may ask his company to put more than a quarter in that box when it wants to exhale more than its allotted amount of CO Breathe in Hold it You know the drill How much CO did you just exhale Tricky question Yet thats analogous to the one businesses are struggling with on a massive scale Until they figure it out companies interested in trading will be on their own to determine how you buy the right to emit a gas that has no standard of measurement and how to do so when no nation currently assigns a CO property right Its risky as hell says Deming Many groups are working to mitigate that risk The World Resources Institute and others are roadtesting a system that would make trading less risky by creating universal carbonaccounting practices And four companiesArthur Andersen Credit Lyonnais Natsource and Swiss Reare developing an exchange where companies can trade even in an embryonic market devoid of legislative standards Theyre trying to nail down something that will be useful under laws that are not yet defined says Garth Edward a broker at Natsource an energytrading firm The US struggled to introduce a capandtrade system into the Kyoto Protocol and achieved it by agreeing to a tough many say impossible target bringing emissions below levels from to The irony of the current situation is that the Europeans reluctant to accept trading at first have become its champion Britain next month will become the first country to embark on a national trading system Another practice still hotly debated is to assign credits for sequestering carbon in growing forests Trees soak up limited amounts of CO release oxygen into the air and turn carbon into wood The Kyoto mechanisms will evaporate without global ratification thus setting up an early environmental test for President Bush who campaigned against the document But Secretary of State Colin Powell has already heard preliminary briefings on the matter as the US preps for the next round of talks to be held in Bonn in midJuly Bush the First helped pioneer credit trading in when he signed legislation that capped power plants sulfur dioxide emissionsthe main ingredient in acid rainbut allowed the plants to swap credits And Houstonbased Enron an energy trader whose chairman Ken Lay was a prominent W campaign adviser stands to be a huge player in any such market So if its good for business Bush the exbusinessman wont need that big a push With him or without him the monetization of carbon emissionsgreen for greeds sake if nothing elseis gaining momentum So breathe easy For you its still free But for many companies the carbon meter will be running soon In the very near future pollution is going to be either a cost to them or an opportunity

Lemuel Green a flour mill owner took the excess power from the waterturn ed generator at his mill in and sold it between dusk and midnight to anybody in Alton Kan who knew what to do with it Soon he quit the millin g business and started stringing transmission lines across the western part o f the state Before his death in he had built a utility that lit Kans as communities Kansas Citys UtiliCorp United is perhaps the only fourthgeneration familycontrolled electric utility in the country Today the outfit once called Missouri Public Service is headed by Lemuel Greens two greatgrandsons Richard Green took over as chief executive in three years after his fathers death At the time Missouri Public Service served customers in two states and had million in revenues Richards brother Robert now joined him three years later Standing pat was not an option Deregulation was in the air and the rules were changing The brothers remade the company They spent billion buyin g utilities in other parts of the US Canada Australia and New Zealand UtiliCorp now serves million customers in seven states and four countries More important they veered off into other parts of the energy business In they acquired gas properties from Peoples Natural Gas of Omaha and got a twoperson gastrading operation as part of the deal That little trading operation now a subsidiary called Aquila turned into something almost as valuable as all the rest of the company with its megawatts of power generated in some power plants around the country My brother and I received strong advice that we would never be able to be competitive in this business says Bob Green Oh yeah Aquila has employees and competes with the likes of Duke Dynegy and Enron According to Natural Gas Week Aquila was the fourthlargest powerandgas marketer in t he country last year Aquila trades a host of other products as welleverythin g from weathercondition hedges to bandwidth Problem Trading operations require capital just as power plants do The solution until now has been what brother Bob calls our asset lite strategy We want to control the capacity not own it So Aquila may provi de the gas to power a socalled merchant plant one that produces electricity to sell in the market in return for a claim on its production But so far Aquila has not been a big player in the most profitable parts of the businesstaking on big risk in larger transactions the way Enron and Dyneg y do What to do In midDecember UtiliCorp announced that it would offer o f Aquila to the public raising capital while creating a market value for its trading operation just as competitors Constellation Energy and Southern Company are doing The hope is that the new entity will garner a multiple o f to times earnings Then if all were to go as planned UtiliCorp woul d spin off the rest of the operation in a taxfree distribution The timing looks good Aquila has no material exposure in the California market Furthermore the volatility in that market has been a bonanza for many firms that trade power including Aquila Its trading subsidiary is th e reason UtiliCorps earnings were up last year to million on billion in sales UtiliCorps shares doubled in the past year to But will the California crisis nonetheless poison the market for an Aquila stock offering It might And UtiliCorp cannot afford to hold its breath in the capital markets forever Even with its assetlite strategy the compa ny is far more leveraged than most utilities with debt at of capital versus the norm for electric utilities The offering is supposed to rai se million or so that could be used to pay down a bit of the parents billion in debt If Bob Green is walking a financial tightrope you could never tell it by talking to him We see this company as our heritage he says confidently This despite the fact that after seven equity offerings the familys share of UtiliCorp is now down from when Richard took over Might the Greens lose their heirloom in a takeover battle They might but they might come out ahead anyway Look at the family history Lemuel sold some of his utility assets for million in and diversified into California orange groves The assets were resold to Samuel Insull the midwestern electricity magnate who came to a bad end when his pyramid of holding companies collapsed during the Depression Years later after Congress reacted with a law that busted up multistate electric utilities B ob and Ricks grandfather bought back Lemuel Greens utility properties for a song Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved The New Forecast For Meteorologists Its Raining Job Offers Energy Trading Firms Snap Up Grads of an Inexact Science No BlowDryer No Proble m By Chip Cummins Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Two years ago Bradley Hoggatt was heading for an academic career in meteorology intent on discovering more about how hurricanes form But just before he started working on a doctorate a very different opportunity blew in Now Mr Hoggatt forecasts weather for a floor full of MBAs who trade billions of dollars in weathersensitive energy commodities such as natural gas and electricity for Aquila Inc the trading subsidiary of a big Midwes t utility With no business background himself Mr Hoggatt is also trading complex financial contracts based on his predictions Im putting my money where m y mouth is says the tall squareshouldered yearold Weathermen and women have become a hot commodity in the exploding energytrading business While offtarget forecasts on television may frustrate parents and schools and embarrass politicians as they did this week on the East Coast they can lose bundles for electricity and naturalg as traders So as trading has boomed so has demand for trained meteorologists a profession that traditionally hasnt paid all that well and is often the butt of jokes From Wall Street to Houstons Louisiana Street where many energy companies have set up shop recent graduates are earning twice what they would earn a t the National Weather Service or in academia The appetite for weather is insatiable says James L Gooding director of meteorology at Duke Energy Corp A former NASA scientist Dr Gooding will be adding a fourth forecast er to his Houston team in the next year Enron Corp an energytrading giant based in Houston has more than double d its staff of weather forecasters to nine in the past three years plucking talent from places like the Weather Channel Williams Cos a Tulsa Okla competitor is endowing university fellowships to lure meteorology students And since Aquila which is owned by UtiliCorp United Inc of Kansas City Mo has hired two other meteorologists from Mr Hoggatts alma mater the University of Wisconsin plus another scientist with a PhD in climatology That hiring paid off a bit during this weeks winter storm in the Northeast While many on the East Coast were getting miscues from TV weathermen on a pending possibly historic blizzard that fizzled in New York and other cities traders at Aquila simply looked to Mr Hoggatt Last Friday Scott Macrorie an electricity trader for the MidAtlantic region at Aquila stopped by to see how the storm was progressing Mr Hoggatts team told him temperatures in his region of interest would be low er because of the storm though the snowfall forecast on TV seemed a little high Sure enough temperatures fell and snowfall in many cities was less than predicted lifting electricity prices and making Mr Macrorie a profit that he says was in the tens of thousands of dollars About university students in the US graduate each year with bachelor s degrees in meteorology according to the American Meteorological Society A n additional or so graduate with masters degrees or doctorates Until jus t a few years ago those graduates didnt typically have many options TV for those who had the blowdried look backoffice jobs with the government or a handful of private consultants for those who didnt Research was an option And some airlines and utilities kept a few meteorologists on staff to help position airplanes or powerline repair trucks during storms Now deeppocketed trading companies are offering many meteorologists with graduate degrees salaries ranging from to Performance and trading bonuses can double or even triple the figure That compares with th e roughly the National Weather Service pays a junior forecaster with a graduate degree Its a bit unusual for meteorologists to have the prospect of lucrative employment after graduation says John NielsenGammon a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas AM University This is a bit of a switch So far there has been no dearth of meteorological talent available partly because the National Weather Service wrapped up a big expansion project in the mids and slowed hiring It hires only to replace people who leave about to meteorologists a year And the highpressure world of billiondollar commodity bets isnt for everyone When Carl Altoe graduated from Penn State one of the nations to p meteorology programs he got a heavy sales pitch from Enron Its quite an impressive place he says of Enrons trading floor but he wasnt sure forecasting skills alone would be enough to make the grade I would be afraid that if money wasnt made in a hurry Id be tossed says Mr Altoe who accepted a position with the National Weather Service in Marquette Mic h For others having forecasts count puts a new thrill in the old art After two years as a manager at the Weather Channels Latin American division in Atlanta Jose Marquez posted his resume on an Internet job site run by the American Meteorological Society Enron called Have you heard about Enron Mr Marquez remembers being asked And I sai d honestly No During a visit Mr Marquez a yearold Navytrained meteorologist foun d Enrons trading floor exhilarating Enron courted Mr Marquez heavily tracking him down

volatile energy prices have raised the stakes for forecasters who are able to gauge airconditioning use in the summer or naturalgas demand duri ng the winter heating season Meanwhile all sorts of companies are turning to energy traders and Wall Street for weather derivatives complex contracts used to hedge financial risks associated with the weather With every passing year you do more energy and more energy Mr Davis says Despite big advances in data collection and modeling betting millions of dollars on weather forecasts can still be tricky business Shortterm forecasts are pretty good Predicting weather two weeks from now is chancy Most meteorologists get their data from the government particularly the National Weather Service Many then tweak it with their own interpretations or forecasting models Disappointed last year by poor longterm forecasts from private consultants Aquila has a contest offering to the meteorologist or team that can best predict temperatures in major US

reformatted version of a press release issued by Enron and received via electronic mail The release was not confirmed by the sender ENRON AND MANX ELECTRICITY ANNOUNCE POWER TRADING AGREEMENT London March Enron announced today that it has concluded a longterm power trading agreement with the Manx Electricity Authority MEA representing one of the first deals with an embedded generator specifically designed for the New Electricity Trading Arrangements NETA Under the agreement Enron will provide hour trading services to MEA under NETA in an innovative deal structured to maximise the value of the electricity interconnector between the Isle of Man and UK mainland The A million interconnector runs between Bispham in Lancashire and Douglas on the Isle of Man and is capable of carrying MW in each direction At km it is the longest AC interconnector cable in the world The development costs of the interconnector to the UK placed us under pressure to put the link to the highest and best economic use and we feel our relationship with Enron has accomplished this said Mike Proffitt Chief Executive of MEA Our commitment to reducing the price of electricity on the Isle of Man is firmly embedded in MEAs five year plan and our trading partnership with Enron will greatly assist us in achieving this goal Richard Lewis Managing Director of UK gas and power at Enron commented This is a great transaction for both parties and fits well into Enrons trading portfolio MEA will benefit from Enrons expertise as one of the UKs leading energy traders and will provide us with their skills as operators of their generation plant and the interconnector It is significant in that we believe it is one of the first embedded generation transactions specially tailored for the new trading

English News Service C Reuters Limited SINGAPORE March Reuters PetroChina has mapped out plans for a massiv e pipeline gridwork to be in place by and to ship huge hydrocarbon reserves in Chinas west to its thriving east government and industry officials said on Thursday A total of five pipelines are planned in the th fiveyear plan four gas and one for refined oil products a senior industry official told Reuters by telephone from Beijing Officials estimated total cost of the projects at billion yuan billion at least Topping the agenda and the largest of the five projects is the km gas trunk line winding eastwards from Chinas central Asian region Xinjiang to the Yangtze River Delta Construction of the billion project is set to start later this year Officials said construction would begin with the km eastern section from Jinbian in northwest Shaanxi province to Shanghai where initial gas supply is expected to land in The longer western section connecting Tarim to Jinbian is slated for completion by officials said PetroChina aims to move between and billion cubic metres bcm of gas through the trunkline in HUGE UNTAPPED RESERVES Officials estimated about bcm of recoverable gas reserves remain in the ShanGanNing and Tarim basins PetroChinas most recent big discovery in t he Sulige field in the northern Ordos basin has proven reserves of bcm PetroChina is hoping to lure foreign firms to invest in the project including top three oil majors ExxonMobil RoyalDutch Shell Group and BP Amoco Also under planning is a three bcmperyear gas pipeline from Jinbian to Beijing Hebei and Shandong Sources said Shell and PetroChina were jointly studying the project A third gas line is planned from Zhongxian in the gasrich southwest Sichua n to Wuhan and Hunan provinces in central China officials said US gas and electricity firm Enron Corp is a joint developer in the Sichan gas block which will send supplies via the proposed km line Sichuan which produced bcm of gas in is presently Chinas top gas producer according to official data The fourth gas pipe stretching km eastwards from Qaidam basin to Lanzh ou in the northwest is expected to be operational in May with an annual capacity of two bcm according to Beijingbased industry newsletter China OGP The project which targets PetroChinas subsidiary refineries in Lanzhou will cost billion yuan China OGP said LONGEST PRODUCTS LINE TO MOVE OIL SOUTH PetroChina also is set to build a km refined products pipeline from Lanzhou to oilthirsty Sichuan to move surplus products out of the remote northwest region A feasibility study for the line which would be the longest products pipeline in China was approved recently a senior official with the State Development Planning Commission told Reuters from Beijing Officials said the project would replace rail transport and eventually cut PetroChinas oil distribution cost The railway system has a bottleneck which only allows a limited oil flow a t one time and its much more expensive than pipeline said a Beijingbas ed PetroChina official When built in PetroChina would be supplying five million tonnes a yea r of mostly gasoline and diesel to Sichuan one of

Enrons Chief Denies Role as Energy Villain Critics regard Kenneth Lay as deregulation opportunist The San Francisco Chronicle Enron boss says hes not to blame for profits in energy crisis Associated Press Newswires The Stadium Curse Some stocks swoon after arena deals The San Francisco Chronicle Money and BusinessFinancial Desk Section ECONOMIC VIEW Utility Deregulation Square Peg Round Hole By JOSEPH KAHN The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company WASHINGTON IN the forensic pursuit of what caused Californias power failure the Bush administration the energy industry and many analysts have granted immunity to deregulation Robert Shapiro a managing director of Enron the giant electricity marketer says the California mess should in no way affect deregulation in other states because California didnt really deregulate Spencer Abraham the new energy secretary said Californians simply goofed setting up a dysfunctional system It is the way California deregulated not deregulation itself that should take the blame they say Yet some economists argue that Californias troubles should inform the debate about whether not just how to deregulate Among them is Alfred E Kahn the Cornell University economist who helped oversee the creation of free markets in the rail trucking and airline industries I am worried about the uniqueness of electricity markets Mr Kahn said He is still studying whether the design flaws in Californias market explain the whole problem But he is sounding a note of skepticism Ive always been uncertain about eliminating vertical integration he said referring to the old ways of allowing a single heavily regulated power company to produce transmit and distribute electricity It may be one industry in which it works reasonably well Mr Kahns comments might sound a little heretical When this former Carter administration official was pushing deregulation it was still a novel and politically risky concept Today getting government out of most businesses is part of the Washington economic canon Moreover few people believe that California the first state to overhaul its electricity sector from top to bottom has proved a good laboratory To satisfy interest groups the markets were designed in an awkward way which soured some deregulation experts on California before the first electron went on the auction block Among the quirks The state required utilities to buy nearly all their power on daily spot markets rather than arranging longterm contracts that might have allowed them to hedge risk Consumer prices were also fixed making it impossible for utilities to pass on higher wholesale costs Paul L Joskow an expert on electricity markets at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a former student of Mr Kahns remains hopeful that the kinks can be ironed out In New England and the the Middle Atlantic states as well in as Britain Chile and Argentina all places that have restructured electricity markets regulators have had to adjust market rules to correct flaws They have found ways to check the tendency of power sellers to exploit infant markets and charge high prices Mr Joskow said Regulators have also had to establish new markets that through price signals encourage power companies to build enough generating capacity so that they have reserves for peak hours During peak hours shortages and price spikes can substantially raise average prices If they can do it in Britain Chile and Argentina then I think we can do it here Mr Joskow said Still he warns that proper regulation requires tough political choices Allowing high prices to pass through to consumers is one Making sure Nimbyism does not prevent the construction of power plants is another The political system must rise to the task Mr Joskow said or the old way might be the best we can do Mr Kahn knows a bit about the old way In the mids he headed the New York Public Service Commission which oversaw electricity and other regulated industries The drawbacks were legendary Local utilities had an endemic tendency to overestimate demand to justify new power plants for which consumers paid through steady rate increases Nearly everyone assumed that competition would slash prices But though free markets do a better job managing rail phone and airline prices they have yet to match regulators ability to juggle the complexities of electricity Mr Kahn said Regulators tended to apply heavy political pressure on utilities to keep prices as low as possible and profit margins steady but thin The vertical integration of electricity monopolies may have also had advantages Mr Kahn said Engineers coordinated power plants and transmission lines in ideal ways Planners who saw the need for new plants helped find a place for them to be built The players all depended on one another he said California has probably not derailed deregulation efforts But it has made people wonder anew whether market forces work for kilowatts as they do for widgets Photo Alfred E Kahn Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved National Desk Executives Considered to Head Military From Associated Press Los Angeles Times

wants to be seen And he certainly doesnt like taking knocks from Gov Gray Davis for having contributed to Californias energy mess Its very unfair Lay said his brown eyes taking on a puppy dog quality Hes trying to vilify us But we didnt make the rules in California We had nothing to do with creating the problem He gazed out from his plush thfloor office Houstons downtown skyscrapers jutted like sharp teeth against the overcast sky Everyone played by the rules Lay said Now our reputations are being maligned In a sense hes right The ultimate blame does rest with California policymakers for deregulating the states electricity market in such a hamfisted way that power giants like Enron cleaned up by exploiting loopholes in the system But Enron was no innocent bystander during the restructuring process Enron and Ken Lay were one of the major players behind the push for deregulation in California said Janee Briesemeister senior policy analyst in the Austin office of Consumers Union A lot of whats happening in California was their idea Those familiar with the states deregulation efforts said Enron was especially eager to ensure that a newly created Power Exchange where wholesale power would be bought and sold was separate from the Independent System Operator which would oversee the electricity grid This fragmented the wholesale market making it harder to monitor said John Rozsa an aide to state Sen Steve Peace DEl Cajon widely regarded as the godfather of Californias bungled deregulation measures Enron isnt in the business of making markets work Rozsa said Theyre in the business of making a buck In an ironic twist however Enron now could play a pivotal role in helping the state remedy past errors and find its energy footing The company has that much clout SEEKING LAYS BLESSING Thus as the governor pushes ahead with a scheme to purchase the transmission lines of Californias cashstrapped utilities he didnt hesitate to call recently seeking Lays personal blessing for the plan This must have been a sweet moment for the man who just weeks earlier had been castigated by Davis in the governors State of the State speech I told him we couldnt support it Lay said a hint of a smile playing across his lips It will lead to an even less efficient transmission grid and longer term it could make things worse Why would Davis swallow his pride and court favor with Enrons big cheese Simple Davis will need the Bush administrations backing to make the powerline sale fly and many believe theres no faster way to reach the new president than via the Houston office of his leading corporate patron Lay and his company have donated more than to Bushs various political campaigns in recent years and he placed Enrons private jet at Bushs disposal during the presidential race So great is Lays influence with the president that some insist he is now serving effectively as shadow energy secretary shaping US energy policy as he sees fit Theres a long history of Enron pulling the levers of its political relationships to get what it wants said Craig McDonald director of Texans for Public Justice a watchdog group What Ken Lay thinks energy policy should be isnt very different from what George Bush and Dick Cheney think it should be ANOTHER VIEWPOINT Lay of course sees things differently At the mere mention of his close rapport with the president his eyes glazed over and he mechanically recited the words he has repeated numerous times in recent months I have known the president and his family for many years Lay said Ive been a strong supporter of his I believe in him and I believe in his policies He insisted that reports of his having sway over Bush on energy matters are grossly exaggerated Still it is striking that Bushs quick decision after taking office to limit federal assistance in solving Californias energy woes virtually mirrored Lays own thoughts on the situation So too with the administrations handsoff approach to resolving the crisis Whatever else Californias power woes have been very kind to Enrons bottom line The companys revenues more than doubled to billion last year They havent hurt Lay either According to company records his pay package more than tripled last year to million Lay and other Enron officials steadfastly refuse to break out the companys California earnings from other worldwide business activities But Lay conceded that Enrons profit from California energy deals last year was not inconsequential We benefit from the volatility he said CAPTIVE MARKETPLACE Thats putting it mildly It could be said that Californias energy mess was tailormade for Enron which is almost uniquely positioned to prosper from a captive marketplace in which electricity and natural gas prices are simultaneously soaring skyward To understand why that is one must look closely at Enrons complex business model The company is much more than just a middleman in brokering energy deals Lay with a doctorate in economics and a background as a federal energy regulator set about completely reinventing Enron in after taking over what was then an unexceptional naturalgas pipeline operator As he saw it the real action was not in distribution or generation of energy but in transacting lightningfast deals wherever electricity or gas is needed treating energy like a tradable commodity for the first time Enron is now the leader in this fastgrowing field and uses that advantage to consolidate its position as the marketmaker of choice for energy buyers and sellers throughout the country It also exploits its size and trading sophistication to structure unusually creative deals For example if electricity prices are down but natural gas prices up Enron might cut a deal to meet a utilitys power needs in return for taking possession of the gas required to run the utilitys plants Enron could then turn around and sell that gas elsewhere using part of the proceeds to purchase lowpriced electricity from another provider which it ships back to the original utility We do best in competitive markets Lay said These are sustainable markets TRADING FRENZY Enrons trading floors buzz all day long with frantic activity as mostly young mostly male employees scan banks of flatpanel displays in search of the best deals Rock music blares from speakers giving the scene an almost fratparty atmosphere The companys trading volume skyrocketed last year with the advent of an Internetbased bidding system which logged trades valued at billion making Enron by far the worlds single biggest ecommerce entity Kevin Presto who oversees Enrons East Coast power trades called up the California electricity market on his computer With a few quick mouse clicks he showed that Enron at that moment was buying power in the Golden State at per megawatt hour and selling it at Some days were at some days and some days Presto said over the steady thumpthump of the trading floors rock n roll soundtrack Theres truly a problem out there This is a recurring theme among Enron officials Californias electricity market is broken and Enron would prefer it if things just settled down As Lay himself put it The worst thing for us is a dysfunctional marketplace In reality Californias dysfunctional marketplace means Enron isnt just making piles of money its seeing profits both coming and going LOTS OF BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA The companys energy services division which handles the complete energy needs of large institutions counts among its clients the University of California and California State school systems Oaklands Clorox Co and even the San Francisco Giants and Pac Bell Park Enron purchases electricity on behalf of these clients from Pacific Gas and Electric Co which by law must keep its rates frozen below current market values At the same time Enron sells power to PGE at skyhigh wholesale levels In other words Enron is buying back its own electricity from PGE for just a fraction of the price it charges the utility These guys are the pariahs of the power system said Nettie Hoge executive director of The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco Why do we need middlemen They dont do anything except mark up the cost To be fair energy marketers such as Enron can help stabilize an efficient marketplace by promoting increased competition between buyers and sellers This has proven the case in Pennsylvania where Enron actively trades among about market participants But in an inefficient market such as California a company like Enron can easily exacerbate things by exploiting loopholes in the states illconceived regulatory framework Sylvester Turner a Houston lawmaker who serves as vice chairman of the state committee that oversees Texas utilities said he cant blame Enron and other power companies for pursuing profits in California California set up some bad rules and these companies played by the rules California set up he said At the end of the day they will behave to enhance their bottom lines But as Texas proceeds toward deregulation of its own electricity market next year Turner said he has learned from Californias experience and is taking steps to prevent Texas power giants from shaking down local consumers LESSONS FROM GOLDEN STATE He has written a bill intended to give the Texas Public Utility Commission more authority in cracking down on market abuses The power companies are fighting the legislation as hard as they can Not least among Turners worries is that Texas will see what California officials believe happened in their state A deliberate withholding of power by leading providers until surging demand had pushed prices higher I have that concern he said I dont necessarily take these companies at their word For his part Lay insists that Enron has never deliberately manipulated electricity prices I dont know of any of that he said Its so easy to conjure up conspiracy theories As a sign of Enrons commitment to solving Californias energy troubles Lay said he supported Davis when the state began negotiating longterm power contracts on behalf of utilities So how many contracts has Enron signed Suddenly the hurt puppyish expression vanished from Lays face and a harder more steely look glinted from his eyes None he said We wont be signing until were certain about recovering our costs Consider this a shot across Californias bow PHOTO Caption Chairman Kenneth Lay said Enron had nothing to do with creating the energy problem Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved Enron boss says hes not to blame for profits in energy crisis Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved SAN FRANCISCO AP Yes his business has profited handsomely from Californias energy crisis but Enron Corp Chairman Kenneth Lay says he shouldnt be a scapegoat in Californias energy crisis That hasnt swayed Gov Gray Davis who has skewered energy companies such as Houstonbased Enron for selling expensive power to California Never again can we allow outofstate profiteers to hold Californians hostage Davis warned in his State of the State address More recently however Davis called Lay to discuss negotiations as the state looks to buy power transmission lines from troubled utilities I told him we couldnt support it Lay told the San Francisco Chronicle in an interview at his Houston office It will lead to an even less efficient transmission grid and longer term it could make things worse Lay is not just any privatesector energy czar Enron Corp is the worlds largest energy trader and Lay is a close friend of President George Bush Lay and his corporation have donated more than to Bushs various political campaigns in recent years and he offered Bush use of Enrons private jet during the presidential race But Lay said its economics not politics that matter in Californias energy crisis And he thinks it unfair that Davis has blamed outofstate energy brokers for the protracted problems We didnt make the rules in California Lay said We had nothing to do with creating the problem The problem many analysts agree began with the states deregulation of the power industry in Enron encouraged deregulation and the states ensuing power crisis has been lucrative for the corporation Enrons stock jumped percent in and its revenues more than doubled to billion Lay was compensated accordingly he received nearly million in stock and cash beyond his million salary last year compared with less than million in bonuses in Lay refused to say how much Enron has made off Californias crisis though he conceded the profit was not inconsequential We benefit from the volatility said Lay who took over Enron in and has helped turn the corporation into a major player in the trading of electricity as a commodity But Lay rejected suggestions that Enron has manipulated prices upward by insisting California pay dearly for lastminute power that has helped keep the lights on in recent months I dont know of any of that he said Its so easy to conjure up conspiracy theories Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved BUSINESS NET WORTH The Stadium Curse Some stocks swoon after arena deals Kathleen Pender The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL B Copyright Is buying the name of a bigleague stadium the kiss of death for a company or does it only seem that way From Network Associates Coliseum in Oakland to the unfinished CMGI Field outside Boston the nation is dotted with sports venues named after companies whose stocks have been sacked The Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens play in a stadium named after PSINet whose stock has fallen percent to a share since it bought naming rights The problem names are not all tech The owners of the TWA Dome in St Louis and Pro Player Stadium in Miami are looking for new corporate sponsors because their current ones are bankrupt TWA is an airline Pro Player was part of underwearmaker Fruit of the Loom The home of the Anaheim Angels could be in the market for a new name if Edison International parent of electric utility Southern California Edison runs out of juice Of course these companies were not in trouble when they promised to pay tens or hundreds of millions of dollars to have their names plastered on a ballpark or arena In fact many were at their peak Which begs the question Should investors get worried when a company in which they own stock puts its name up among the floodlights Brian Pears head of equity trading with Wells Capital Management wonders if companies are susceptible to some weird strain of the Sports Illustrated curse It seems as if any athlete who is pictured on the cover of SI magazine invariably loses his next game or pulls a groin muscle Business celebrities suffer from a similar phenomenon Amazoncom Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos was named Time magazines person of the year just before his companys stock price tanked Don Hinchey who advises buyers and sellers in namingrights deals doesnt think the curse holds true in stadium and arena deals You can make a case that a company is doing well when it acquires a naming rights sponsorship but you cant necessarily say it corresponds with a peak in its business says Hinchey director of creative services for the Bonham Group in Denver TRACKING NAMING FIRMS To find out if Hinchey is right I tracked the stock market performance of publicly held companies since they bought naming rights to bigleague sports venues in North America I excluded facilities named after subsidiaries of larger companies including Miller Park in Milwaukee Miller Brewing is part of Philip Morris and Pac Bell Park in San Francisco Pacific Bell is owned by SBC Communications which is putting its own name on an arena in San Antonio I used the announcement date as a starting point because stadium naming deals are after all marketing endeavors The announcement of a deal generates tons of publicity which is considered positive even if the publicity is negative and even if the stadium wont open for several years Then I compared each companys stock market performance with the Standard Poors index during the same period The bottom line of the companies that bought stadium or arena names are trading at a higher stock price today than when the deals were announced according to data from FactSet Research Systems Two companies each bought two names and were counted twice But and this is a big but only of them beat the SP during the period since their respective deals were announced So buying a stadium name might not be a curse but its no guarantee the company will beat the market WINNERS LOSERS The companies that have done best since buying a name come from a wide variety of industries The biggest winner is Qualcomm a wireless telecommunications company Although its stock is down percent from its peak its still up percent since it agreed to slap its name on a San Diego stadium The nextbiggest winners include Target discount stores Ericsson telecom equipment Coors beer Fleet Financial banking Pepsi soft drinks and Enron energy The biggest losers are TWA PSINet Internet service provider CMGI Internet incubator Savvis Communications telecom services and Network Associates network security software Network Associates stock peaked about three months after it bought naming rights to the Oakland Coliseum in September Since then it has suffered a string of setbacks After the Securities and Exchange Commission questioned its accounting practices it restated its financial results for and Its CEO resigned in December Network Associates is paying slightly more than million per year for the coliseum name It can get out of its year deal after five years The company has been paying us says Deena McClain general counsel with the OaklandAlameda County Coliseum Authority We havent had any discussions with them about changing the contract Most namingrights contracts have out clauses that allow the parties to extricate themselves if they want can or need to in the event of financial difficulties or if a team moves says Hinchey Although nobody likes to be associated with a loser stadium owners may benefit if a troubled company cuts out of a deal early Thats because stadium name prices have skyrocketed since the mid s when million a year give or take was average In FedEx agreed to pay million over years to be named home of the Washington Redskins In CMGI agreed to pay million over years to have its name on the new home of the New England Patriots Its questionable what kind of shape CMGI will be in when the stadium opens next year The gallon hat of naming rights deals says Hinchey is in Houston where Reliant Energy will pay million over years to name the Astrodome and a new football stadium after itself Some customers of Reliants utility subsidiary were outraged when the deal was announced because the company was also raising electricity rates Some shareholders also get perturbed when their company spends money on a stadium instead of a new plant or stock dividends But Jim Grinstead editor of Revenues from Sports Venues says you have to look at the stadium purchase in light of total marketing budget It sounds like big money but frequently its over to years If you take out things the company might buy anyway like tickets and luxury suites its small potatoes WHAT A DEAL IS WORTH The main benefit of a stadium deal is the exposure a company gets when a game is broadcast on TV or radio or mentioned in print This is the biggest bang for your buck in terms of branding says Jennifer Keavney a Network Associates vice president who negotiated the stadium deal She says the cost of her deal about million a year wont even buy you a Super Bowl ad It will buy five commercials on a nationally televised football game maybe The Coliseum perched beside Interstate also acts like a giant billboard for the company which frequently gets mentioned in traffic reports Hinchey says most naming deals also include tickets and luxury boxes onsite exposure through signage and kiosks premium nights when the sponsor might offer samples at the park and inclusion in programs tickets and flyers Most companies that strike stadium deals want to become a household name because they sell consumer products or services But not always Com sold nothing but corporate networking gear when it bought the name to Candlestick Park in San Francisco in It was a good move for them says Jim Grinstead editor of Revenues from Sports Venues They got the employees they were looking for the visibility they were looking for At the time they were a player in a crowded field and they wanted to look like a fun place to work Last April Com extended its original year contract for two more years The biggest risk companies run is that the team that plays in their facility will be a loser Companies invest in an entity that can enhance their brand their sales and hospitality efforts Certainly that loses its luster if the team is not performing well Hinchey says But corporations realize the teams success on the field fluctuates It could be a champion one year next year in the dumps The same can be said about the corporate sponsors which is something stadium owners be they taxpayers or business tycoons must realize when they sell a name PHOTO Caption Rich Gannon of the

had the highest AGA number of recorded history for this week last week or next week by bcf seems a little far fetched to me Our analysis is saying gas at we would have had bcf a day more demand that includes commercial residential industrial switching processing as far as bcfd power gen demand that counts the fact that last year was extremely mild versus expectation of normal summer this year west will be running every gas unit virtually all hours as power demand is growing maybe still and hydro way down every molecule that can will flow west from waha this summer versus little last year east power prices really havent reached point of priceing out demand and heat rates healthy enough to where gas can go up without raising power prices to cut demand some concern of more efficient replacing less but hard to quantify were trying to build the stack now to estimate frac margins now positive for all but most inefficient processors will continue coming back a little concerned about oil prices bordering right there now for places like florida and actually saw fl demand rise last week as gas got to parity let me look into inj capability definitely bigger when field is empty from engineering standpoint so any problems really wont arise until fall when gen demand low and inj capacity lowermy initial thoughts bo seems as neutral as everyone else in the market right now really inactive to clarify not raging bull i like everybody want to see what the inj numbers in april look like nobody putting a position on until that starts to clarify just think that hedging demand is making market a little short right now making next move up more likely would be scale up seller though not really sure why cash trades at back doesnt make any sense however as more fields start turning around throughout month the stg arb to great in my opinion to keep spread there must close one way or the other notice that spread tightened to towards end of trading friday in general think that gas is reaching the elasticity stage right here cents lower and no switching no processing and gain back some demand market needs to see some big stg numbers first i think the best play right now is to start buying longer term put spreads Jan look great to me if we get back to and dont match last years early weather bombs away on AM To cc Subject friday this doesnt allow for new generation demandwhich is unclear cuz it requires power px also doesnt accrue for more eficient gen replacing inneficient weather of course but bcfd sounds hiesp shudnt happen until loads peak in julyshud be marginal in aprjun if you notice im not alot diff than your guys demand destruction is implied but im including a factor for RC energy conservationie poor guys like me turning lites off and thermostat downits making a difference that will be less factor in shoulder demand monthsreason why i think y on y sd swing will be closer to bcf aprjun if px doesnt fall and electricity spikes i think well see conservation return cuz i wont turn on my air cnditioner now rember the is vs gas at sub ie february which is approx where we are today all that being said yes some demand has come backbut it is as i consider extraordinary demand destructionthose things which never really have occured beforelike the level for fuel switching in jan and fractionation marginsie liquids which were all non existent a year ago save for residual fuel some ammoniafert prod has come back as well but when you get down to bcfd industrial in the more i think of itmay not be destruction anymore as mucha unction of an economic slowdown anyway i think i only know two guys that are bearishme and one of your big fund customersospraie well see is collins bullish as wellhe seems quieter in the mkt lately heres another onewhat you guys think the industry capacity for injection is on a weekly basis we sud test itin other words if the max is say then means the basis will uttery colpase on daily cuz mkt will keep futs

Plants Shut Down and Sell the Energy Subject Plants Shut Down and Sell the Energy Plants Shut Down and Sell the Energy By Peter Behr Washington Post Staff Writer Thursday December Page E Kaiser Aluminum Corp had planned to spend December making aluminum at its giant smelters in the Pacific Northwest run by electricity from the Bonneville Power Administrations Columbia River dams Then it saw a better deal With California desperate for power and electricity prices hitting unheardof peaks Kaiser shut down its two US smelters last week It is selling the electricity it no longer needs for about times what it pays Bonneville under longstanding contracts It is a measure of this winters fuel crunch Some big industrial firms in energyintensive sectors such as paper fertilizers metals and even oilfield operations can make more money by selling their electricity or natural gas than manufacturing their products The shifts by such large industrial consumers of energy described as unprecedented by analysts will free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter But they also are sowing seeds of potential problems next year Shortages of aluminum and fertilizer for example are likely to give another upward jolt to consumer prices and further weaken the economy analysts said The fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we dont know what theyre going to use to grow crops with said David Wyss chief economist at Standard Poors Some economists have recently increased their warnings about the damaging impact of this winters heating bills on an already weakening economy Goldman Sachs analysts last week estimated that gas heating bills will double this winter to more than for a typical US household That and higher electricity prices will cost consumers billion in higher energy costs compared with a year ago they estimated cutting the expected growth in the nations economic output by one percentage point on an annual rate in the first three months of next year Overall the recent energy price developments have thus added to the risk of a sharp economic slowdown the Goldman Sachs report concluded Terra Industries Inc in Sioux City Iowa has closed three of its six US ammonia plants which use natural gas as a main ingredient for fertilizer production Like Kaiser the company realized it would be much more profitable to stop production in December and sell the natural gas back to the market at current prices which are much higher than the price Terra was obligated to pay under its existing December supply contract said Mark Rosenbury chief administrative officer We looked at these current prices and said This is crazy he said Terra hasnt disclosed the profit it will make selling its gas but Rosenbury said it would be substantial In coming months Terras good fortune could be reversed It usually buys gas a month at a time and the prices for January delivery most likely will be well above its breakeven point That would keep Terras plants closed Rosenbury said but eliminate the opportunity to sell the natural gas at a profit If this persists Rosenbury said its going to be a real problem He estimates that out of a total annual US production capacity of million tons of ammonia about million tons of production isnt operating now Could we be short of fertilizer next spring Its possible that farmers will not have as much as they want Rosenbury said RoysterClark Inc a Norfolk and New York Citybased fertilizer manufacturer and distributor has shut down its one plant in East Dubuque Ill indefinitely and production workers will be laid off beginning next month The story is the same natural gas prices are too high to justify continued production We believe its likely this is a speculative bubble in natural gas prices that will burst and in a few weeks well be able to buy gas at a more reasonable price but that remains to be seen said Paul M Murphy the companys managing director for financial planning A continuation of high natural gas prices would likely shrink production and raise fertilizer prices to a point that could affect farmers decisions to plant feed corn he said Its sticker shock According to Wyss if this winter remains unusually cold and natural gas remains above per million cubic feet double the level a year ago farm products could rise significantly a year from now and into In the aluminum industry several smaller producers have joined Kaiser the industrys No manufacturer in closing down noted Lloyd OCarroll an analyst with BBT Capital Markets in Richmond Aluminum production in November was percent below that of November and Decembers production will be lower still he said Well get more production cut announcements I think he said A slowing in the US and world economies next year could ease the impact of reduced aluminum supplies But if the world economy doesnt fall completely apart then aluminum prices are going to rise and they could rise significantly more than the current forecast he said In Kaisers case its an open question how much of its electric windfall it will keep Kaiser is contractually entitled to buy electricity from Bonneville at a megawatt per hour says spokesman Scott Lamb That is the power it has sold back to Bonneville for a megawatt hour for December But the Bonneville Authority is pressuring Kaiser to use these and future profits from power resales to compensate employees at the shutdown plants to invest in new electric generating capacity or even to refund to Bonnevilles other customers said Bonneville spokesman Ed Mosey Kaiser and Bonneville have negotiated a new power purchase deal to take effect after next October but the power authority says it intends to reduce deliveries to Kaiser if the company tries to pocket the electricity sale profits Out here a deal is a deal but it has to be a moral deal There has to be an ethical dimension to this and were not shy in trying to make sure they live up their advantage in having access to this publiclyowned power Mosey said The Washington Post Company

ease the impact of reduced aluminum supplies But if the world economy doesnt fall completely apart then aluminum prices are going to rise and they could rise significantly more than the current forecast he said In Kaisers case its an open question how much of its electric windfall it will keep Kaiser is contractually entitled to buy electricity from Bonneville at a megawatt per hour says spokesman Scott Lamb That is the power it has sold back to Bonneville for a megawatt hour for December But the Bonneville Authority is pressuring Kaiser to use these and future profits from power resales to compensate employees at the shutdown plants to invest in new electric generating capacity or even to refund to Bonnevilles other customers said Bonneville spokesman Ed Mosey Kaiser and Bonneville have negotiated a new power purchase deal to take effect after next October but the power authority says it intends to reduce deliveries to Kaiser if the company tries to pocket the electricity sale profits Out here a deal is a deal but it has to be a moral deal There has to be an ethical dimension to this and were not shy in trying to make sure they live up their advantage in having access to this publiclyowned power Mosey said The Washington Post Company

Plants Shut Down and Sell the Energy Subject Plants Shut Down and Sell the Energy Plants Shut Down and Sell the Energy By Peter Behr Washington Post Staff Writer Thursday December Page E Kaiser Aluminum Corp had planned to spend December making aluminum at its giant smelters in the Pacific Northwest run by electricity from the Bonneville Power Administrations Columbia River dams Then it saw a better deal With California desperate for power and electricity prices hitting unheardof peaks Kaiser shut down its two US smelters last week It is selling the electricity it no longer needs for about times what it pays Bonneville under longstanding contracts It is a measure of this winters fuel crunch Some big industrial firms in energyintensive sectors such as paper fertilizers metals and even oilfield operations can make more money by selling their electricity or natural gas than manufacturing their products The shifts by such large industrial consumers of energy described as unprecedented by analysts will free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter But they also are sowing seeds of potential problems next year Shortages of aluminum and fertilizer for example are likely to give another upward jolt to consumer prices and further weaken the economy analysts said The fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we dont know what theyre going to use to grow crops with said David Wyss chief economist at Standard Poors Some economists have recently increased their warnings about the damaging impact of this winters heating bills on an already weakening economy Goldman Sachs analysts last week estimated that gas heating bills will double this winter to more than for a typical US household That and higher electricity prices will cost consumers billion in higher energy costs compared with a year ago they estimated cutting the expected growth in the nations economic output by one percentage point on an annual rate in the first three months of next year Overall the recent energy price developments have thus added to the risk of a sharp economic slowdown the Goldman Sachs report concluded Terra Industries Inc in Sioux City Iowa has closed three of its six US ammonia plants which use natural gas as a main ingredient for fertilizer production Like Kaiser the company realized it would be much more profitable to stop production in December and sell the natural gas back to the market at current prices which are much higher than the price Terra was obligated to pay under its existing December supply contract said Mark Rosenbury chief administrative officer We looked at these current prices and said This is crazy he said Terra hasnt disclosed the profit it will make selling its gas but Rosenbury said it would be substantial In coming months Terras good fortune could be reversed It usually buys gas a month at a time and the prices for January delivery most likely will be well above its breakeven point That would keep Terras plants closed Rosenbury said but eliminate the opportunity to sell the natural gas at a profit If this persists Rosenbury said its going to be a real problem He estimates that out of a total annual US production capacity of million tons of ammonia about million tons of production isnt operating now Could we be short of fertilizer next spring Its possible that farmers will not have as much as they want Rosenbury said RoysterClark Inc a Norfolk and New York Citybased fertilizer manufacturer and distributor has shut down its one plant in East Dubuque Ill indefinitely and production workers will be laid off beginning next month The story is the same natural gas prices are too high to justify continued production We believe its likely this is a speculative bubble in natural gas

and Sell the Energy Subject Plants Shut Down and Sell the Energy Plants Shut Down and Sell the Energy By Peter Behr Washington Post Staff Writer Thursday December Page E Kaiser Aluminum Corp had planned to spend December making aluminum at its giant smelters in the Pacific Northwest run by electricity from the Bonneville Power Administrations Columbia River dams Then it saw a better deal With California desperate for power and electricity prices hitting unheardof peaks Kaiser shut down its two US smelters last week It is selling the electricity it no longer needs for about times what it pays Bonneville under longstanding contracts It is a measure of this winters fuel crunch Some big industrial firms in energyintensive sectors such as paper fertilizers metals and even oilfield operations can make more money by selling their electricity or natural gas than manufacturing their products The shifts by such large industrial consumers of energy described as unprecedented by analysts will free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter But they also are sowing seeds of potential problems next year Shortages of aluminum and fertilizer for example are likely to give another upward jolt to consumer prices and further weaken the economy analysts said The fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we dont know what theyre going to use to grow crops with said David Wyss chief economist at Standard Poors Some economists have recently increased their warnings about the damaging impact of this winters heating bills on an already weakening economy Goldman Sachs analysts last week estimated that gas heating bills will double this winter to more than for a typical US household That and higher electricity prices will cost consumers billion in higher energy costs compared with a year ago they estimated cutting the expected growth in the nations economic output by one percentage point on an annual rate in the first three months of next year Overall the recent energy price developments have thus added to the risk of a sharp economic slowdown the Goldman Sachs report concluded Terra Industries Inc in Sioux City Iowa has closed three of its six US ammonia plants which use natural gas as a main ingredient for fertilizer production Like Kaiser the company realized it would be much more profitable to stop production in December and sell the natural gas back to the market at current prices which are much higher than the price Terra was obligated to pay under its existing December supply contract said Mark Rosenbury chief administrative officer We looked at these current prices and said This is crazy he said Terra hasnt disclosed the profit it will make selling its gas but Rosenbury said it would be substantial In coming months Terras good fortune could be reversed It usually buys gas a month at a time and the prices for January delivery most likely will be well above its breakeven point That would keep Terras plants closed Rosenbury said but eliminate the opportunity to sell the natural gas at a profit If this persists Rosenbury said its going to be a real problem He estimates that out of a total annual US production capacity of million tons of ammonia about million tons of production isnt operating now Could we be short of fertilizer next spring Its possible that farmers will not have as much as they want Rosenbury said RoysterClark Inc a Norfolk and New York Citybased fertilizer manufacturer and distributor has shut down its one plant in East Dubuque Ill indefinitely and production workers will be laid off beginning next month The story is the same natural gas prices are too high to justify continued production We believe its likely this is a speculative bubble in natural gas prices that will burst and in a few weeks well be able to buy gas at a more reasonable price but that remains to be seen said Paul M Murphy the companys managing director for financial planning A continuation of high natural gas prices would likely shrink production and raise fertilizer prices to a point that could affect farmers decisions to plant feed corn he said Its sticker shock According to Wyss if this

move the two way so i can try simulating actual market cicumstances From David nronXgate on AM To John CT cc Savita nronXgate Subject John You might recall we spoke a few weeks ago about a system with more intelligence for outofhours trading than just leaving the products on Last Trade is Mid Attached is a suggestion for how such a system might work It builds on Offset to Last Trade functionality The simplified description is It tracks two variables IntensitySpeed and Bias Buy or Sell emphasis As Intensity increases the Spread increases As Bias increases the Offset increases Ill call later to see what you think of the idea Dave Program Criteria The formula which defines the trading decisionmaking program will need to work with several criteriainputsdefinitions These might be Intensity Speed The average time between transaction attempts regardless of whether they are buys or sells Measured as a moving average over the last Intensity Factor transactions by comparing the timestamp of the transaction Tibco messages for the Product Obviously the lower the Intensity calculation the higher the transaction flow Therefore a high Intensity number indicates low transaction flow Intensity Factor The number of transactions to be included in the moving average Intensity calculation A possible value for this might be Buys The number of Buys which have occurred Sells The number of Sells which have occured Transaction Count Could be either Buys or Sells whichever last occured Buy Offset The Offset value which will be applied if a Buy occurs Sell Offset The Offset value which will be applied if a Sell occurs Offset Reversion Ratio ORR The amount by which the Buy Offset should be reduced if a Sell occurs or amount Sell Offset should be reduced if a Buy occurs A possible value for this might be If the application of the ORR results in a reduction of less than then the reduction shall be Transaction Reversion Ratio TRR The amount by which Buys should be reduced if a Sell occurs or amount Sells should be reduced if a Buy occurs A possible value for this might be If the application of the TRR results in a reduction of less than then the reduction shall be equal to Spread Minimum The minimum Spread value allowed A possible value for this might be Spread Maximum The maximum Spread value allowed A possible value for this might be Offset Minimum The minimum Offset allowed for both Buys and Sells A possible value for this might be Offset Maximum The maximum offset allowed for both Buys and Sells A possible value for this might be Initial Offset The Buy and Sell Offset used when the program is started Initial Spread The Spread used when the program is started SpreadOffset Minimum The minimum amount by which Spread must exceed Offset Prevents a possible arbitrage opportunity for the customer A possible value for this might be Dead Interval The period of time which must pass before the program will recalculate the above Criteria if no transactions have taken place during the Dead Interval A possible value for this might be seconds Program Outputs The program should output the following variables as a result of combining the above Criteria in a userdefined Formula Spread integer as per current Stack Manager Offset integer as per current Stack Manager Suspension boolean Whether or not the Product should be suspended Normally False Program Interface and Operation Principles The user should be provided with a GUI which will allow them to define a relationship among the above Criteria which will produce and apply the Outputs to a particular Product This relationship would be defined with Intensity Formulas and Transaction Formulas Every time a Transaction occurs or a Dead Interval passes the Criteria will be recalculated and the userdefined formulas will be reviewed by the program If a Dead Interval passes without any transactions taking place then Intensity Intensity and BuysBuysTRR and SellsSellsTRR and Buy Offset Buy Offset ORR and Sell Offset Sell Offset ORR If the userdefined Formulas see following indicate that a change in spread should occur then if the Offset is zero in the case of a trade occurring or if no trade has occured during the passing of a Dead Interval the system shall perform a Last Trade is Mid calculation around the last transaction adjusting the buy and sell prices according to the new Spread value Any adjustment to the Spread shall respect the SpreadOffset Minimum If a reduction in the Spread should violate the SpreadOffset Minimum then the Buy Offset or Sell Offset or both as appropriate shall be reduced accordingly Similarly if the Offset is increased by a Transaction Formula to a level greater than the Spread the Spread shall be increased to maintain the SpreadOffset Minimum GUIFormulas Example Constants Intensity Factor Dead Interval Offset Reversion Ratio ORR Transaction Reversion Ratio TRR Spread Minimum Spread Maximum Offset Minimum Offset Maximum SpreadOffset Minimum INPUTS OUTPUTS Intensity Formula Formula Intensity Spread Offset Suspension S na F S na F S na F Transaction Formula Formula Transactions Spread Offset Suspension V na F V na F V F V F V F V na na T Note that Transactions would be Buys or Sells as appropriate Note also that Buys and Sells are not intended to be an absolute count but rather are a moving measure of the number of buys or sells which have recently occured In this example all Constants and Formulae are editable by the user through the GUI Simulation Obviously if we want to proceed we will want to conduct several simulations to prove concepts and evaluate responsiveness However to give some idea of how the above might work when a market starts to run in a particular direction please see the attached Additional Features System Notifications There should be two kinds of notifications for the Robotrader which will be similar to Stack Manager Garbage Checks Warning and Failure levels for both Offset and Price The warning levels will trigger a pager message The Failure levels will trigger a pager message and the product will be automatically suspended The Price checks will be against prices input by the trader not relative price movements but actual price There should be both maximum and minimum price checks eg gas is trading at The notification levels could be at the top end and at the bottom end Offset checks will only be against a maximum value Dave

cc Subject Here is the Articleno picture though Warming Up To Green BY ERIC ROSTON Breathe in Hold it Hold it OK now breathe out Unless youre outdoors in the midst of a cold snap chances are you cant see your breath And no one would ever ask you to drop a quarter in a tin box for the right to free this invisible spirit from your lungs Yet last November Murphy Oil Corp based in El Dorado Ark voluntarily shelled out several hundred thousand dollars for the right to cough out carbon dioxide the same stuff you exhaled three sentences ago The reason it did so is closely related to events that occurred that same autumn day half a world away at the Hague Thousands of policymakers and scientists from all over the world had gathered hoping to dot the is cross the zeds and umlaut the os on the Kyoto Protocol to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change The protocol was devised to curb the industrial emission of six gases CO among them that are slowlyactually quickly in geological termsturning the earth into a hothouse But no final accord was reached In this context Murphys purchase of options on metric tons of carbon the equivalent of annual exhaust from approximately cars from a Canadian company that was itself trying to help meet a national target seems a bit odd The market for this kind of trade hasnt been established and there isnt even a global agreement on how carbon dioxide should be valued Indeed there isnt even unanimity on global warming itself Yet the transaction is emblematic of industry on the verge of an environmental transition Congress may have snubbed the Kyoto accord and global bureaucrats may be stumbling over the details of a carbonemissions trading system But corporations against the run of play are beginning to confront the climate conundrum the best way they know howas a business opportunity John Browne CEO of BP Amoco and Mark MoodyStuart chairman of Royal DutchShell Group have both responded to the globalwarming threat and set up internal systems that exceed goals put forth in Kyoto Shell and BP have vowed to cut their greenhousegas emissions eachnearly twice the Kyoto targetShell by BP by This isnt an act of altruism says Aidan Murphy of Shell Its a fundamental strategic issue for our business And not theirs alone A growing number of corporations from IBM to your neighborhood Kinkos are reducing their greenhouse footprints DuPont is pledging to knock its emissions below levels by Theres been a shift in the center of gravity in the US corporate community since Kyoto says Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists Now the view is that climate change is serious and we ought to do something about it There are a few ways of doing that invest in renewable energy sources and cap and trade emissions That is set ceilings for worldwide greenhousegas emission and let nations either sell emission credits if they emit below their allowance or buy credits if they exceed permitted levels The theory is that the pursuit of greenbacks will fuel greener business Whenever you turn a pollution cut into a financial asset says Joseph Goffman an attorney at Environmental Defense people go out and make lots of pollution cuts Even where green fervor is of a paler shade corporations are viewing the potential for global regulation as a business risk they need to consider Witness Claiborne Deming Murphys CEO who doesnt see the science of global warming as solid enough yet to cry havoc But Deming hears shareholders clamoring and the bureaucrats buzzing Someone may ask his company to put more than a quarter in that box when it wants to exhale more than its allotted amount of CO Breathe in Hold it You know the drill How much CO did you just exhale Tricky question Yet thats analogous to the one businesses are struggling with on a massive scale Until they figure it out companies interested in trading will be on their own to determine how you buy the right to emit a gas that has no standard of measurement and how to do so when no nation currently assigns a CO property right Its risky as hell says Deming Many groups are working to mitigate that risk The World Resources Institute and others are roadtesting a system that would make trading less risky by creating universal carbonaccounting practices And four companiesArthur Andersen Credit Lyonnais Natsource and Swiss Reare developing an exchange where companies can trade even in an embryonic market devoid of legislative standards Theyre trying to nail down something that will be useful under laws that are not yet defined says Garth Edward a broker at Natsource an energytrading firm The US struggled to introduce a capandtrade system into the Kyoto Protocol and achieved it by agreeing to a tough many say impossible target bringing emissions below levels from to The irony of the current situation is that the Europeans reluctant to accept trading at first have become its champion Britain next month will become the first country to embark on a national trading system Another practice still hotly debated is to assign credits for sequestering carbon in growing forests Trees soak up limited amounts of CO release oxygen into the air and turn carbon into wood The Kyoto mechanisms will evaporate without global ratification thus setting up an early environmental test for President Bush who campaigned against the document But Secretary of State Colin Powell has already heard preliminary briefings on the matter as the US preps for the next round of talks to be held in Bonn in midJuly Bush the First helped pioneer credit trading in when he signed legislation that capped power plants sulfur dioxide emissionsthe main ingredient in acid rainbut allowed the plants to swap credits And Houstonbased Enron an energy trader whose chairman Ken Lay was a prominent W campaign adviser stands to be a huge player in any such market So if its good for business Bush the exbusinessman wont need that big a push With him or without him the monetization of carbon emissionsgreen for greeds sake if nothing elseis gaining momentum So breathe easy For you its still free But for many companies the carbon meter will be running soon In the very near future pollution is going to be either a cost to them or an opportunity

Lemuel Green a flour mill owner took the excess power from the waterturn ed generator at his mill in and sold it between dusk and midnight to anybody in Alton Kan who knew what to do with it Soon he quit the millin g business and started stringing transmission lines across the western part o f the state Before his death in he had built a utility that lit Kans as communities Kansas Citys UtiliCorp United is perhaps the only fourthgeneration familycontrolled electric utility in the country Today the outfit once called Missouri Public Service is headed by Lemuel Greens two greatgrandsons Richard Green took over as chief executive in three years after his fathers death At the time Missouri Public Service served customers in two states and had million in revenues Richards brother Robert now joined him three years later Standing pat was not an option Deregulation was in the air and the rules were changing The brothers remade the company They spent billion buyin g utilities in other parts of the US Canada Australia and New Zealand UtiliCorp now serves million customers in seven states and four countries More important they veered off into other parts of the energy business In they acquired gas properties from Peoples Natural Gas of Omaha and got a twoperson gastrading operation as part of the deal That little trading operation now a subsidiary called Aquila turned into something almost as valuable as all the rest of the company with its megawatts of power generated in some power plants around the country My brother and I received strong advice that we would never be able to be competitive in this business says Bob Green Oh yeah Aquila has employees and competes with the likes of Duke Dynegy and Enron According to Natural Gas Week Aquila was the fourthlargest powerandgas marketer in t he country last year Aquila trades a host of other products as welleverythin g from weathercondition hedges to bandwidth Problem Trading operations require capital just as power plants do The solution until now has been what brother Bob calls our asset lite strategy We want to control the capacity not own it So Aquila may provi de the gas to power a socalled merchant plant one that produces electricity to sell in the market in return for a claim on its production But so far Aquila has not been a big player in the most profitable parts of the businesstaking on big risk in larger transactions the way Enron and Dyneg y do What to do In midDecember UtiliCorp announced that it would offer o f Aquila to the public raising capital while creating a market value for its trading operation just as competitors Constellation Energy and Southern Company are doing The hope is that the new entity will garner a multiple o f to times earnings Then if all were to go as planned UtiliCorp woul d spin off the rest of the operation in a taxfree distribution The timing looks good Aquila has no material exposure in the California market Furthermore the volatility in that market has been a bonanza for many firms that trade power including Aquila Its trading subsidiary is th e reason UtiliCorps earnings were up last year to million on billion in sales UtiliCorps shares doubled in the past year to But will the California crisis nonetheless poison the market for an Aquila stock offering It might And UtiliCorp cannot afford to hold its breath in the capital markets forever Even with its assetlite strategy the compa ny is far more leveraged than most utilities with debt at of capital versus the norm for electric utilities The offering is supposed to rai se million or so that could be used to pay down a bit of the parents billion in debt If Bob Green is walking a financial tightrope you could never tell it by talking to him We see this company as our heritage he says confidently This despite the fact that after seven equity offerings the familys share of UtiliCorp is now down from when Richard took over Might the Greens lose their heirloom in a takeover battle They might but they might come out ahead anyway Look at the family history Lemuel sold some of his utility assets for million in and diversified into California orange groves The assets were resold to Samuel Insull the midwestern electricity magnate who came to a bad end when his pyramid of holding companies collapsed during the Depression Years later after Congress reacted with a law that busted up multistate electric utilities B ob and Ricks grandfather bought back Lemuel Greens utility properties for a song Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved The New Forecast For Meteorologists Its Raining Job Offers Energy Trading Firms Snap Up Grads of an Inexact Science No BlowDryer No Proble m By Chip Cummins Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Two years ago Bradley Hoggatt was heading for an academic career in meteorology intent on discovering more about how hurricanes form But just before he started working on a doctorate a very different opportunity blew in Now Mr Hoggatt forecasts weather for a floor full of MBAs who trade billions of dollars in weathersensitive energy commodities such as natural gas and electricity for Aquila Inc the trading subsidiary of a big Midwes t utility With no business background himself Mr Hoggatt is also trading complex financial contracts based on his predictions Im putting my money where m y mouth is says the tall squareshouldered yearold Weathermen and women have become a hot commodity in the exploding energytrading business While offtarget forecasts on television may frustrate parents and schools and embarrass politicians as they did this week on the East Coast they can lose bundles for electricity and naturalg as traders So as trading has boomed so has demand for trained meteorologists a profession that traditionally hasnt paid all that well and is often the butt of jokes From Wall Street to Houstons Louisiana Street where many energy companies have set up shop recent graduates are earning twice what they would earn a t the National Weather Service or in academia The appetite for weather is insatiable says James L Gooding director of meteorology at Duke Energy Corp A former NASA scientist Dr Gooding will be adding a fourth forecast er to his Houston team in the next year Enron Corp an energytrading giant based in Houston has more than double d its staff of weather forecasters to nine in the past three years plucking talent from places like the Weather Channel Williams Cos a Tulsa Okla competitor is endowing university fellowships to lure meteorology students And since Aquila which is owned by UtiliCorp United Inc of Kansas City Mo has hired two other meteorologists from Mr Hoggatts alma mater the University of Wisconsin plus another scientist with a PhD in climatology That hiring paid off a bit during this weeks winter storm in the Northeast While many on the East Coast were getting miscues from TV weathermen on a pending possibly historic blizzard that fizzled in New York and other cities traders at Aquila simply looked to Mr Hoggatt Last Friday Scott Macrorie an electricity trader for the MidAtlantic region at Aquila stopped by to see how the storm was progressing Mr Hoggatts team told him temperatures in his region of interest would be low er because of the storm though the snowfall forecast on TV seemed a little high Sure enough temperatures fell and snowfall in many cities was less than predicted lifting electricity prices and making Mr Macrorie a profit that he says was in the tens of thousands of dollars About university students in the US graduate each year with bachelor s degrees in meteorology according to the American Meteorological Society A n additional or so graduate with masters degrees or doctorates Until jus t a few years ago those graduates didnt typically have many options TV for those who had the blowdried look backoffice jobs with the government or a handful of private consultants for those who didnt Research was an option And some airlines and utilities kept a few meteorologists on staff to help position airplanes or powerline repair trucks during storms Now deeppocketed trading companies are offering many meteorologists with graduate degrees salaries ranging from to Performance and trading bonuses can double or even triple the figure That compares with th e roughly the National Weather Service pays a junior forecaster with a graduate degree Its a bit unusual for meteorologists to have the prospect of lucrative employment after graduation says John NielsenGammon a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas AM University This is a bit of a switch So far there has been no dearth of meteorological talent available partly because the National Weather Service wrapped up a big expansion project in the mids and slowed hiring It hires only to replace people who leave about to meteorologists a year And the highpressure world of billiondollar commodity bets isnt for everyone When Carl Altoe graduated from Penn State one of the nations to p meteorology programs he got a heavy sales pitch from Enron Its quite an impressive place he says of Enrons trading floor but he wasnt sure forecasting skills alone would be enough to make the grade I would be afraid that if money wasnt made in a hurry Id be tossed says Mr Altoe who accepted a position with the National Weather Service in Marquette Mic h For others having forecasts count puts a new thrill in the old art After two years as a manager at the Weather Channels Latin American division in Atlanta Jose Marquez posted his resume on an Internet job site run by the American Meteorological Society Enron called Have you heard about Enron Mr Marquez remembers being asked And I sai d honestly No During a visit Mr Marquez a yearold Navytrained meteorologist foun d Enrons trading floor exhilarating Enron courted Mr Marquez heavily tracking him down three times during his Christmas vacation in Puerto Rico Mr Marquez decided the sprawling trading floor was just the sort of active work place he was looking for Also hed be getting a to boost ove r his Weather Channel salary before potential bonuses from Enron Im getting more money than I would anywhere else he says Weather has long affected prices of everything from grain at Chicagos earl y commodity markets to the stocks of retail companies on Wall Street Jon Davis a meteorologist for Salomon Smith Barney in Chicago started forecasting the weather for agriculture traders back in But volatile energy prices have raised the stakes for forecasters who are able to gauge airconditioning use in the summer or naturalgas demand duri ng the winter heating season Meanwhile all sorts of companies are turning to energy traders and Wall Street for weather derivatives complex contracts used to hedge financial risks associated with the weather With every passing year you do more energy and more energy Mr Davis says Despite big advances in data collection and modeling betting millions of dollars on weather forecasts can still be tricky business Shortterm forecasts are pretty good Predicting weather two weeks from now is chancy Most meteorologists get their data from the government particularly the National Weather Service Many then tweak it with their own interpretations or forecasting models Disappointed last year by poor longterm forecasts from private consultants Aquila has a contest offering to the meteorologist or team that can best predict temperatures in major US cities over the course of a year I call it the forecast bakeoff says Mr Hoggatt The high stakes also mean more pressure on forecasters WSI Corp a Billerica Mass weatherforecasting firm started an energy service last year and Jeffrey A Shorter a WSI vice president says energy clients can be less forgiving than his other clients in TV and aviation especially whe n the forecasts are wrong But he

March Enron announced today that it has concluded a longterm power trading agreement with the Manx Electricity Authority MEA representing one of the first deals with an embedded generator specifically designed for the New Electricity Trading Arrangements NETA Under the agreement Enron will provide hour trading services to MEA under NETA in an innovative deal structured to maximise the value of the electricity interconnector between the Isle of Man and UK mainland The A million interconnector runs between Bispham in Lancashire and Douglas on the Isle of Man and is capable of carrying MW in each direction At km it is the longest AC interconnector cable in the world The development costs of the interconnector to the UK placed us under pressure to put the link to the highest and best economic use and we feel our relationship with Enron has accomplished this said Mike Proffitt Chief Executive of MEA Our commitment to reducing the price of electricity on the Isle of Man is firmly embedded in MEAs five year plan and our trading partnership with Enron will greatly assist us in achieving this goal Richard Lewis Managing Director of UK gas and power at Enron commented This is a great transaction for both parties and fits well into Enrons trading portfolio MEA will benefit from Enrons expertise as one of the UKs leading energy traders and will provide us with their skills as operators of their generation plant and the interconnector It is significant in that we believe it is one of the first embedded generation transactions specially tailored for the new trading

English News Service C Reuters Limited SINGAPORE March Reuters PetroChina has mapped out plans for a massiv e pipeline gridwork to be in place by and to ship huge hydrocarbon reserves in Chinas west to its thriving east government and industry officials said on Thursday A total of five pipelines are planned in the th fiveyear plan four gas and one for refined oil products a senior industry official told Reuters by telephone from Beijing Officials estimated total cost of the projects at billion yuan billion at least Topping the agenda and the largest of the five projects is the km gas trunk line winding eastwards from Chinas central Asian region Xinjiang to the Yangtze River Delta Construction of the billion project is set to start later this year Officials said construction would begin with the km eastern section from Jinbian in northwest Shaanxi province to Shanghai where initial gas supply is expected to land in The longer western section connecting Tarim to Jinbian is slated for completion by officials said PetroChina aims to move between and billion cubic metres bcm of gas through the trunkline in HUGE UNTAPPED RESERVES Officials estimated about bcm of recoverable gas reserves remain in the ShanGanNing and Tarim basins PetroChinas most recent big discovery in t he Sulige field in the northern Ordos basin has proven reserves of bcm PetroChina is hoping to lure foreign firms to invest in the project including top three oil majors ExxonMobil RoyalDutch Shell Group and BP Amoco Also under planning is a three bcmperyear gas pipeline from Jinbian to Beijing Hebei and Shandong Sources said Shell and PetroChina were jointly studying the project A third gas line is planned from Zhongxian in the gasrich southwest Sichua n to Wuhan and Hunan provinces in central China officials said US gas and electricity firm Enron Corp is a joint developer in the Sichan gas block which will send supplies via the proposed km line Sichuan which produced bcm of gas in is presently Chinas top gas producer according to official data The fourth gas pipe stretching km eastwards from Qaidam basin to Lanzh ou in the northwest is expected to be operational in May with an annual capacity of two bcm according to Beijingbased industry newsletter China OGP The project which targets PetroChinas subsidiary refineries in Lanzhou will cost billion yuan China OGP said LONGEST PRODUCTS LINE TO MOVE OIL SOUTH PetroChina also is set to build a km refined products pipeline from Lanzhou to oilthirsty Sichuan to move surplus products out of the remote northwest region A feasibility study for the line which would be the longest products pipeline in China was approved recently a senior official with the State Development Planning Commission told Reuters from Beijing Officials said the project would replace rail transport and eventually cut PetroChinas oil distribution cost The railway system has a bottleneck which only allows a limited oil flow a t one time and its much more expensive than pipeline said a Beijingbas ed PetroChina official When built in PetroChina would be supplying five million tonnes a yea r of mostly gasoline and diesel to Sichuan one of

Enrons Chief Denies Role as Energy Villain Critics regard Kenneth Lay as deregulation opportunist The San Francisco Chronicle Enron boss says hes not to blame for profits in energy crisis Associated Press Newswires The Stadium Curse Some stocks swoon after arena deals The San Francisco Chronicle Money and BusinessFinancial Desk Section ECONOMIC VIEW Utility Deregulation Square Peg Round Hole By JOSEPH KAHN The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company WASHINGTON IN the forensic pursuit of what caused Californias power failure the Bush administration the energy industry and many analysts have granted immunity to deregulation Robert Shapiro a managing director of Enron the giant electricity marketer says the California mess should in no way affect deregulation in other states because California didnt really deregulate Spencer Abraham the new energy secretary said Californians simply goofed setting up a dysfunctional system It is the way California deregulated not deregulation itself that should take the blame they say Yet some economists argue that Californias troubles should inform the debate about whether not just how to deregulate Among them is Alfred E Kahn the Cornell University economist who helped oversee the creation of free markets in the rail trucking and airline industries I am worried about the uniqueness of electricity markets Mr Kahn said He is still studying whether the design flaws in Californias market explain the whole problem But he is sounding a note of skepticism Ive always been uncertain about eliminating vertical integration he said referring to the old ways of allowing a single heavily regulated power company to produce transmit and distribute electricity It may be one industry in which it works reasonably well Mr Kahns comments might sound a little heretical When this former Carter administration official was pushing deregulation it was still a novel and politically risky concept Today getting government out of most businesses is part of the Washington economic canon Moreover few people believe that California the first state to overhaul its electricity sector from top to bottom has proved a good laboratory To satisfy interest groups the markets were designed in an awkward way which soured some deregulation experts on California before the first electron went on the auction block Among the quirks The state required utilities to buy nearly all their power on daily spot markets rather than arranging longterm contracts that might have allowed them to hedge risk Consumer prices were also fixed making it impossible for utilities to pass on higher wholesale costs Paul L Joskow an expert on electricity markets at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a former student of Mr Kahns remains hopeful that the kinks can be ironed out In New England and the the Middle Atlantic states as well in as Britain Chile and Argentina all places that have restructured electricity markets regulators have had to adjust market rules to correct flaws They have found ways to check the tendency of power sellers to exploit infant markets and charge high prices Mr Joskow said Regulators have also had to establish new markets that through price signals encourage power companies to build enough generating capacity so that they have reserves for peak hours During peak hours shortages and price spikes can substantially raise average prices If they can do it in Britain Chile and Argentina then I think we can do it here Mr Joskow said Still he warns that proper regulation requires tough political choices Allowing high prices to pass through to consumers is one Making sure Nimbyism does not prevent the construction of power plants is another The political system must rise to the task Mr Joskow said or the old way might be the best we can do Mr Kahn knows a bit about the old way In the mids he headed the New York Public Service Commission which oversaw electricity and other regulated industries The drawbacks were legendary Local utilities had an endemic tendency to overestimate demand to justify new power plants for which consumers paid through steady rate increases Nearly everyone assumed that competition would slash prices But though free markets do a better job managing rail phone and airline prices they have yet to match regulators ability to juggle the complexities of electricity Mr Kahn said Regulators tended to apply heavy political pressure on utilities to keep prices as low as possible and profit margins steady but thin The vertical integration of electricity monopolies may have also had advantages Mr Kahn said Engineers coordinated power plants and transmission lines in ideal ways Planners who saw the need for new plants helped find a place for them to be built The players all depended on one another he said California has probably not derailed deregulation efforts But it has made people wonder anew whether market forces work for kilowatts as they do for widgets Photo Alfred E Kahn Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved National Desk Executives Considered to Head Military From Associated Press Los Angeles Times

company White was executive assistant to Secretary of State Colin Powell when Powell was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved NEWS Enrons Chief Denies Role as Energy Villain Critics regard Kenneth Lay as deregulation opportunist David Lazarus Chronicle Staff Writer The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL A Copyright Kenneth Lay is one of the energy pirates accused by Californias governor of fleecing consumers As chairman of Enron Corp the worlds largest energy trader Lay is arguably the biggest baddest buccaneer of them all But thats not how he wants to be seen And he certainly doesnt like taking knocks from Gov Gray Davis for having contributed to Californias energy mess Its very unfair Lay said his brown eyes taking on a puppy dog quality Hes trying to vilify us But we didnt make the rules in California We had nothing to do with creating the problem He gazed out from his plush thfloor office Houstons downtown skyscrapers jutted like sharp teeth against the overcast sky Everyone played by the rules Lay said Now our reputations are being maligned In a sense hes right The ultimate blame does rest with California policymakers for deregulating the states electricity market in such a hamfisted way that power giants like Enron cleaned up by exploiting loopholes in the system But Enron was no innocent bystander during the restructuring process Enron and Ken Lay were one of the major players behind the push for deregulation in California said Janee Briesemeister senior policy analyst in the Austin office of Consumers Union A lot of whats happening in California was their idea Those familiar with the states deregulation efforts said Enron was especially eager to ensure that a newly created Power Exchange where wholesale power would be bought and sold was separate from the Independent System Operator which would oversee the electricity grid This fragmented the wholesale market making it harder to monitor said John Rozsa an aide to state Sen Steve Peace DEl Cajon widely regarded as the godfather of Californias bungled deregulation measures Enron isnt in the business of making markets work Rozsa said Theyre in the business of making a buck In an ironic twist however Enron now could play a pivotal role in helping the state remedy past errors and find its energy footing The company has that much clout SEEKING LAYS BLESSING Thus as the governor pushes ahead with a scheme to purchase the transmission lines of Californias cashstrapped utilities he didnt hesitate to call recently seeking Lays personal blessing for the plan This must have been a sweet moment for the man who just weeks earlier had been castigated by Davis in the governors State of the State speech I told him we couldnt support it Lay said a hint of a smile playing across his lips It will lead to an even less efficient transmission grid and longer term it could make things worse Why would Davis swallow his pride and court favor with Enrons big cheese Simple Davis will need the Bush administrations backing to make the powerline sale fly and many believe theres no faster way to reach the new president than via the Houston office of his leading corporate patron Lay and his company have donated more than to Bushs various political campaigns in recent years and he placed Enrons private jet at Bushs disposal during the presidential race So great is Lays influence with the president that some insist he is now serving effectively as shadow energy secretary shaping US energy policy as he sees fit Theres a long history of Enron pulling the levers of its political relationships to get what it wants said Craig McDonald director of Texans for Public Justice a watchdog group What Ken Lay thinks energy policy should be isnt very different from what George Bush and Dick Cheney think it should be ANOTHER VIEWPOINT Lay of course sees things differently At the mere mention of his close rapport with the president his eyes glazed over and he mechanically recited the words he has repeated numerous times in recent months I have known the president and his family for many years Lay said Ive been a strong supporter of his I believe in him and I believe in his policies He insisted that reports of his having sway over Bush on energy matters are grossly exaggerated Still it is striking that Bushs quick decision after taking office to limit federal assistance in solving Californias energy woes virtually mirrored Lays own thoughts on the situation So too with the administrations handsoff approach to resolving the crisis Whatever else Californias power woes have been very kind to Enrons bottom line The companys revenues more than doubled to billion last year They havent hurt Lay either According to company records his pay package more than tripled last year to million Lay and other Enron officials steadfastly refuse to break out the companys California earnings from other worldwide business activities But Lay conceded that Enrons profit from California energy deals last year was not inconsequential We benefit from the volatility he said CAPTIVE MARKETPLACE Thats putting it mildly It could be said that Californias energy mess was tailormade for Enron which is almost uniquely positioned to prosper from a captive marketplace in which electricity and natural gas prices are simultaneously soaring skyward To understand why that is one must look closely at Enrons complex business model The company is much more than just a middleman in brokering energy deals Lay with a doctorate in economics and a background as a federal energy regulator set about completely reinventing Enron in after taking over what was then an unexceptional naturalgas pipeline operator As he saw it the real action was not in distribution or generation of energy but in transacting lightningfast deals wherever electricity or gas is needed treating energy like a tradable commodity for the first time Enron is now the leader in this fastgrowing field and uses that advantage to consolidate its position as the marketmaker of choice for energy buyers and sellers throughout the country It also exploits its size and trading sophistication to structure unusually creative deals For example if electricity prices are down but natural gas prices up Enron might cut a deal to meet a utilitys power needs in return for taking possession of the gas required to run the utilitys plants Enron could then turn around and sell that gas elsewhere using part of the proceeds to purchase lowpriced electricity from another provider which it ships back to the original utility We do best in competitive markets Lay said These are sustainable markets TRADING FRENZY Enrons trading floors buzz all day long with frantic activity as mostly young mostly male employees scan banks of flatpanel displays in search of the best deals Rock music blares from speakers giving the scene an almost fratparty atmosphere The companys trading volume skyrocketed last year with the advent of an Internetbased bidding system which logged trades valued at billion making Enron by far the worlds single biggest ecommerce entity Kevin Presto who oversees Enrons East Coast power trades called up the California electricity market on his computer With a few quick mouse clicks he showed that Enron at that moment was buying power in the Golden State at per megawatt hour and selling it at Some days were at some days and some days Presto said over the steady thumpthump of the trading floors rock n roll soundtrack Theres truly a problem out there This is a recurring theme among Enron officials Californias electricity market is broken and Enron would prefer it if things just settled down As Lay himself put it The worst thing for us is a dysfunctional marketplace In reality Californias dysfunctional marketplace means Enron isnt just making piles of money its seeing profits both coming and going LOTS OF BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA The companys energy services division which handles the complete energy needs of large institutions counts among its clients the University of California and California State school systems Oaklands Clorox Co and even the San Francisco Giants and Pac Bell Park Enron purchases electricity on behalf of these clients from Pacific Gas and Electric Co which by law must keep its rates frozen below current market values At the same time Enron sells power to PGE at skyhigh wholesale levels In other words Enron is buying back its own electricity from PGE for just a fraction of the price it charges the utility These guys are the pariahs of the power system said Nettie Hoge executive director of The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco Why do we need middlemen They dont do anything except mark up the cost To be fair energy marketers such as Enron can help stabilize an efficient marketplace by promoting increased competition between buyers and sellers This has proven the case in Pennsylvania where Enron actively trades among about market participants But in an inefficient market such as California a company like Enron can easily exacerbate things by exploiting loopholes in the states illconceived regulatory framework Sylvester Turner a Houston lawmaker who serves as vice chairman of the state committee that oversees Texas utilities said he cant blame Enron and other power companies for pursuing profits in California California set up some bad rules and these companies played by the rules California set up he said At the end of the day they will behave to enhance their bottom lines But as Texas proceeds toward deregulation of its own electricity market next year Turner said he has learned from Californias experience and is taking steps to prevent Texas power giants from shaking down local consumers LESSONS FROM GOLDEN STATE He has written a bill intended to give the Texas Public Utility Commission more authority in cracking down on market abuses The power companies are fighting the legislation as hard as they can Not least among Turners worries is that Texas will see what California officials believe happened in their state A deliberate withholding of power by leading providers until surging demand had pushed prices higher I have that concern he said I dont necessarily take these companies at their word For his part Lay insists that Enron has never deliberately manipulated electricity prices I dont know of any of that he said Its so easy to conjure up conspiracy theories As a sign of Enrons commitment to solving Californias energy troubles Lay said he supported Davis when the state began negotiating longterm power contracts on behalf of utilities So how many contracts has Enron signed Suddenly the hurt puppyish expression vanished from Lays face and a harder more steely look glinted from his eyes None he said We wont be signing until were certain about recovering our costs Consider this a shot across Californias bow PHOTO Caption Chairman Kenneth Lay said Enron had nothing to do with creating the energy problem Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved Enron boss says hes not to blame for profits in energy crisis Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved SAN FRANCISCO AP Yes his business has profited handsomely from Californias energy crisis but Enron Corp Chairman Kenneth Lay says he shouldnt be a scapegoat in Californias energy crisis That hasnt swayed Gov Gray Davis who has skewered energy companies such as Houstonbased Enron for selling expensive power to California Never again can we allow outofstate profiteers to hold Californians hostage Davis warned in his State of the State address More recently however Davis called Lay to discuss negotiations as the state looks to buy power transmission lines from troubled utilities I told him we couldnt support it Lay told the San Francisco Chronicle in an interview at his Houston office It will lead to an even less efficient transmission grid and longer term it could make things worse Lay is not just any privatesector energy czar Enron Corp is the worlds largest energy trader and Lay is a close friend of President George Bush Lay and his corporation have donated more than to Bushs various political campaigns in recent years and he offered Bush use of Enrons private jet during the presidential race But Lay said its economics not politics that matter in Californias energy crisis And he thinks it unfair that Davis has blamed outofstate energy brokers for the protracted problems We didnt make the rules in California Lay said We had nothing to do with creating the problem The problem many analysts agree began with the states deregulation of the power industry in Enron encouraged deregulation and the states ensuing power crisis has been lucrative for the corporation Enrons stock jumped percent in and its revenues more than doubled to billion Lay was compensated accordingly he received nearly million in stock and cash beyond his million salary last year compared with less than million in bonuses in Lay refused to say how much Enron has made off Californias crisis though he conceded the profit was not inconsequential We benefit from the volatility said Lay who took over Enron in and has helped turn the corporation into a major player in the trading of electricity as a commodity But Lay rejected suggestions that Enron has manipulated prices upward by insisting California pay dearly for lastminute power that has helped keep the lights on in recent months I dont know of any of that he said Its so easy to conjure up conspiracy theories Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved BUSINESS NET WORTH The Stadium Curse Some stocks swoon after arena deals Kathleen Pender The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL B Copyright Is buying the name of a bigleague stadium the kiss of death for a company or does it only seem that way From Network Associates Coliseum in Oakland to the unfinished CMGI Field outside Boston the nation is dotted with sports venues named after companies whose stocks have been sacked The Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens play in a stadium named after PSINet whose stock has fallen percent to a share since it bought naming rights The problem names are not all tech The owners of the TWA Dome in St Louis and Pro Player Stadium in Miami are looking for new corporate sponsors because their current ones are bankrupt TWA is an airline Pro Player was part of underwearmaker Fruit of the Loom The home of the Anaheim Angels could be in the market for a new name if Edison International parent of electric utility Southern California Edison runs out of juice Of course these companies were not in trouble when they promised to pay tens or hundreds of millions of dollars to have their names plastered on a ballpark or arena In fact many were at their peak Which begs the question Should investors get worried when a company in which they own stock puts its name up among the floodlights Brian Pears head of equity trading with Wells Capital Management wonders if companies are susceptible to some weird strain of the Sports Illustrated curse It seems as if any athlete who is pictured on the cover of SI magazine invariably loses his next game or pulls a groin muscle Business celebrities suffer from a similar phenomenon Amazoncom Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos was named Time magazines person of the year just before his companys stock price tanked Don Hinchey who advises buyers and sellers in namingrights deals doesnt think the curse holds true in stadium and arena deals You can make a case that a company is doing well when it acquires a naming rights sponsorship but you cant necessarily say it corresponds with a peak in its business says Hinchey director of creative services for the Bonham Group in Denver TRACKING NAMING FIRMS To find out if Hinchey is right I tracked the stock market performance of publicly held companies since they bought naming rights to bigleague sports venues in North America I excluded facilities named after subsidiaries of larger companies including Miller Park in Milwaukee Miller Brewing is part of Philip Morris and Pac Bell Park in San Francisco Pacific Bell is owned by SBC Communications which is putting its own name on an arena in San Antonio I used the announcement date as a starting point because stadium naming deals are after all marketing endeavors The announcement of a deal generates tons of publicity which is considered positive even if the publicity is negative and even if the stadium wont open for several years Then I compared each companys stock market performance with the Standard Poors index during the same period The bottom line of the companies that bought stadium or arena names are trading at a higher stock price today than when the deals were announced according to data from FactSet Research Systems Two companies each bought two names and were counted twice But and this is a big but only of them beat the SP during the period since their respective deals were announced So buying a stadium name might not be a curse but its no guarantee the company will beat the market WINNERS LOSERS The companies that have done best since buying a name come from a wide variety of industries The biggest winner is Qualcomm a wireless telecommunications company Although its stock is down percent from its peak its still up percent since it agreed to slap its name on a San Diego stadium The nextbiggest winners include Target discount stores Ericsson telecom equipment Coors beer Fleet Financial banking Pepsi soft drinks and Enron energy The biggest losers are TWA PSINet Internet service provider CMGI Internet incubator Savvis Communications telecom services and Network Associates network security software Network Associates stock peaked about three months after it bought naming rights to the Oakland Coliseum in September Since then it has suffered a string of setbacks After the Securities and Exchange Commission questioned its accounting practices it restated its financial results for and Its CEO resigned in December Network Associates is paying slightly more than million per year for the coliseum name It can get out of its year deal after five years The company has been paying us says Deena McClain general counsel with the OaklandAlameda County Coliseum Authority We havent had any discussions with them about changing the contract Most namingrights contracts have out clauses that allow the parties to extricate themselves if they want can or need to in the event of financial difficulties or if a team moves says Hinchey Although nobody likes to be associated with a loser stadium owners may benefit if a troubled company cuts out of a deal early Thats because stadium name prices have skyrocketed since the mid s when million a year give or take was average In FedEx agreed to pay million over years to be named home of the Washington Redskins In CMGI agreed to pay million over years to have its name on the new home of the New England Patriots Its questionable what kind of shape CMGI will be in when the stadium opens next year The gallon hat of naming rights deals says Hinchey is in Houston where Reliant Energy will pay million over years to name the Astrodome and a new football stadium after itself Some customers of Reliants utility subsidiary were outraged when the deal was announced because the company was also raising electricity rates Some shareholders also get perturbed when their company spends money on a stadium instead of a new plant or stock dividends But Jim Grinstead editor of Revenues from Sports Venues says you have to look at the stadium purchase in light of total marketing budget It sounds like big money but frequently its over to years If you take out things the company might buy anyway like tickets and luxury suites its small potatoes WHAT A DEAL IS WORTH The main benefit of a stadium deal is the exposure a company gets when a game is broadcast on TV or radio or mentioned in print This is the biggest bang for your buck in terms of branding says Jennifer Keavney a Network Associates vice president who negotiated the stadium deal She says the cost of her deal about million a year wont even buy you a Super Bowl ad It will buy five commercials on a nationally televised football game maybe The Coliseum perched beside Interstate also acts like a giant billboard for the company which frequently gets mentioned in traffic reports Hinchey says most naming deals also include tickets and luxury boxes onsite exposure through signage and kiosks premium nights when the sponsor might offer samples at the park and inclusion in programs tickets and flyers Most companies that strike stadium deals want to become a household name because they sell consumer products or services But not always Com sold nothing but corporate networking gear when it bought the name to Candlestick Park in San Francisco in It was a good move for them says Jim Grinstead editor of Revenues from Sports Venues They got the employees they were looking for the visibility they were looking for At the time they were a player in a crowded field and they wanted to look like a fun place to work Last April Com extended its original year contract for two more years The biggest risk companies run is that the team that plays in their facility will be a loser Companies invest in an entity that can enhance their brand their sales and hospitality efforts Certainly that loses its luster if the team is not performing well Hinchey says But corporations realize the teams success on the field fluctuates It could be a champion one year next year in the dumps The same can be said about the corporate sponsors which is something stadium owners be they taxpayers or business tycoons must realize when they sell a name PHOTO Caption Rich Gannon of the

had the highest AGA number of recorded history for this week last week or next week by bcf seems a little far fetched to me Our analysis is saying gas at we would have had bcf a day more demand that includes commercial residential industrial switching processing as far as bcfd power gen demand that counts the fact that last year was extremely mild versus expectation of normal summer this year west will be running every gas unit virtually all hours as power demand is growing maybe still and hydro way down every molecule that can will flow west from waha this summer versus little last year east power prices really havent reached point of priceing out demand and heat rates healthy enough to where gas can go up without raising power prices to cut demand some concern of more efficient replacing less but hard to quantify were trying to build the stack now to estimate frac margins now positive for all but most inefficient processors will continue coming back a little concerned about oil prices bordering right there now for places like florida and actually saw fl demand rise last week as gas got to parity let me look into inj capability definitely bigger when field is empty from engineering standpoint so any problems really wont arise until fall when gen demand low and inj capacity lowermy initial thoughts bo seems as neutral as everyone else in the market right now really inactive to clarify not raging bull i like everybody want to see what the inj numbers in april look like nobody putting a position on until that starts to clarify just think that hedging demand is making market a little short right now making next move up more likely would be scale up seller though not really sure why cash trades at back doesnt make any sense however as more fields start turning around throughout month the stg arb to great in my opinion to keep spread there must close one way or the other notice that spread tightened to towards end of trading friday in general think that gas is reaching the elasticity stage right here cents lower and no switching no processing and gain back some demand market needs to see some big stg numbers first i think the best play right now is to start buying longer term put spreads Jan look great to me if we get back to and dont match last years early weather bombs away on AM To cc Subject friday this doesnt allow for new generation demandwhich is unclear cuz it requires power px also doesnt accrue for more eficient gen replacing inneficient weather of course but bcfd sounds hiesp shudnt happen until loads peak in julyshud be marginal in aprjun if you notice im not alot diff than your guys demand destruction is implied but im including a factor for RC energy conservationie poor guys like me turning lites off and thermostat downits making a difference that will be less factor in shoulder demand monthsreason why i think y on y sd swing will be closer to bcf aprjun if px doesnt fall and electricity spikes i think well see conservation return cuz i wont turn on my air cnditioner now rember the is vs gas at sub ie february which is approx where we are today all that being said yes some demand has come backbut it is as i consider extraordinary demand destructionthose things which never really have occured beforelike the level for fuel switching in jan and fractionation marginsie liquids which were all non existent a year ago save for residual fuel some ammoniafert prod has come back as well but when you get down to bcfd industrial in the more i think of itmay not be destruction anymore as mucha unction of an economic slowdown anyway i think i only know two guys that are bearishme and one of your big fund customersospraie well see is collins bullish as wellhe seems quieter in the mkt lately heres another

and Sell the Energy Subject Plants Shut Down and Sell the Energy Plants Shut Down and Sell the Energy By Peter Behr Washington Post Staff Writer Thursday December Page E Kaiser Aluminum Corp had planned to spend December making aluminum at its giant smelters in the Pacific Northwest run by electricity from the Bonneville Power Administrations Columbia River dams Then it saw a better deal With California desperate for power and electricity prices hitting unheardof peaks Kaiser shut down its two US smelters last week It is selling the electricity it no longer needs for about times what it pays Bonneville under longstanding contracts It is a measure of this winters fuel crunch Some big industrial firms in energyintensive sectors such as paper fertilizers metals and even oilfield operations can make more money by selling their electricity or natural gas than manufacturing their products The shifts by such large industrial consumers of energy described as unprecedented by analysts will free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter But they also are sowing seeds of potential problems next year Shortages of aluminum and fertilizer for example are likely to give another upward jolt to consumer prices and further weaken the economy analysts said The fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we dont know what theyre going to use to grow crops with said David Wyss chief economist at Standard Poors Some economists have recently increased their warnings about the damaging impact of this winters heating bills on an already weakening economy Goldman Sachs analysts last week estimated that gas heating bills will double this winter to more than for a typical US household That and higher electricity prices will cost consumers billion in higher energy costs compared with a year ago they estimated cutting the expected growth in the nations economic output by one percentage point on an annual rate in the first three months of next year Overall the recent energy price developments have thus added to the risk of a sharp economic slowdown the Goldman Sachs report concluded Terra Industries Inc in Sioux City Iowa has closed three of its six US ammonia plants which use natural gas as a main ingredient for fertilizer production Like Kaiser the company realized it would be much more profitable to stop production in December and sell the natural gas back to the market at current prices which are much higher than the price Terra was obligated to pay under its existing December supply contract said Mark Rosenbury chief administrative officer We looked at these current prices and said This is crazy he said Terra hasnt disclosed the profit it will make selling its gas but Rosenbury said it would be substantial In coming months Terras good fortune could be reversed It usually buys gas a month at a time and the prices for January delivery most likely will be well above its breakeven point That would keep Terras plants closed Rosenbury said but eliminate the opportunity to sell the natural gas at a profit If this persists Rosenbury said its going to be a real problem He estimates that out of a total annual US production capacity of million tons of ammonia about million tons of production isnt operating now Could we be short of fertilizer next spring Its possible that farmers will not have as much as they want Rosenbury said RoysterClark Inc a Norfolk and New York Citybased fertilizer manufacturer and distributor has shut down its one plant in East Dubuque Ill indefinitely and production workers will be laid off beginning next month The story is the same natural gas prices are too high to justify continued production We believe its likely this is a speculative bubble in natural gas prices that will burst and in a few weeks well be able to buy gas at a more reasonable price but that remains to be seen said Paul M Murphy the companys managing director for financial planning A continuation of high natural gas prices would likely shrink production and raise fertilizer prices to a point that could affect farmers decisions to plant feed corn he said Its sticker shock According to Wyss if this winter remains unusually cold and natural gas remains above per million cubic feet double the level a year ago farm products could rise significantly a year from now and into In the aluminum industry several smaller producers have joined Kaiser the industrys No manufacturer in closing down noted Lloyd OCarroll an analyst with BBT Capital Markets in Richmond Aluminum production in November was percent below that of November and Decembers production will be lower still he said Well get more production cut announcements I think he said A slowing in the US and world economies next year could ease the impact of reduced aluminum supplies But if the world economy doesnt fall completely apart then aluminum prices are going to rise and they could rise significantly more than the current forecast he said In Kaisers case its an open question how much of its electric windfall it will keep Kaiser is contractually entitled to buy electricity from Bonneville at a megawatt per hour says spokesman Scott Lamb That is the power it has sold back to Bonneville for a megawatt hour for December But the Bonneville Authority is pressuring Kaiser to use these and future profits from power resales to compensate employees at the shutdown plants to invest in new electric generating capacity or even to refund to Bonnevilles other customers said Bonneville spokesman Ed Mosey Kaiser and Bonneville have negotiated a new power purchase deal to take effect after next October but the power authority says it intends to reduce deliveries to Kaiser if the company tries to pocket the electricity sale profits Out here a deal is a deal but it has to be a moral deal There has to be an ethical dimension to this and were not shy in trying to make sure they live up their advantage in having access to this publiclyowned power Mosey said The Washington Post Company

Subject Enron Mentions Utility Deregulation Square Peg Round Hole The New York Times Executives Considered to Head Military Los Angeles Times Bush leaning toward execs for military The Seattle Times Enrons Chief Denies Role as Energy Villain Critics regard Kenneth Lay as deregulation opportunist The San Francisco Chronicle Enron boss says hes not to blame for profits in energy crisis Associated Press Newswires The Stadium Curse Some stocks swoon after arena deals The San Francisco Chronicle Money and BusinessFinancial Desk Section ECONOMIC VIEW Utility Deregulation Square Peg Round Hole By JOSEPH KAHN The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company WASHINGTON IN the forensic pursuit of what caused Californias power failure the Bush administration the energy industry and many analysts have granted immunity to deregulation Robert Shapiro a managing director of Enron the giant electricity marketer says the California mess should in no way affect deregulation in other states because California didnt really deregulate Spencer Abraham the new energy secretary said Californians simply goofed setting up a dysfunctional system It is the way California deregulated not deregulation itself that should take the blame they say Yet some economists argue that Californias troubles should inform the debate about whether not just how to deregulate Among them is Alfred E Kahn the Cornell University economist who helped oversee the creation of free markets in the rail trucking and airline industries I am worried about the uniqueness of electricity markets Mr Kahn said He is still studying whether the design flaws in Californias market explain the whole problem But he is sounding a note of skepticism Ive always been uncertain about eliminating vertical integration he said referring to the old ways of allowing a single heavily regulated power company to produce transmit and distribute electricity It may be one industry in which it works reasonably well Mr Kahns comments might sound a little heretical When this former Carter administration official was pushing deregulation it was still a novel and politically risky concept Today getting government out of most businesses is part of the Washington economic canon Moreover few people believe that California the first state to overhaul its electricity sector from top to bottom has proved a good laboratory To satisfy interest groups the markets were designed in an awkward way which soured some deregulation experts on California before the first electron went on the auction block Among the quirks The state required utilities to buy nearly all their power on daily spot markets rather than arranging longterm contracts that might have allowed them to hedge risk Consumer prices were also fixed making it impossible for utilities to pass on higher wholesale costs Paul L Joskow an expert on electricity markets at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a former student of Mr Kahns remains hopeful that the kinks can be ironed out In New England and the the Middle Atlantic states as well in as Britain Chile and Argentina all places that have restructured electricity markets regulators have had to adjust market rules to correct flaws They have found ways to check the tendency of power sellers to exploit infant markets and charge high prices Mr Joskow said Regulators have also had to establish new markets that through price signals encourage power companies to build enough generating capacity so that they have reserves for peak hours During peak hours shortages and price spikes can substantially raise average prices If they can do it in Britain Chile and Argentina then I think we can do it here Mr Joskow said Still he warns that proper regulation requires tough political choices Allowing high prices to pass through to consumers is one Making sure Nimbyism does not prevent the construction of power plants is another The political system must rise to the task Mr Joskow said or the old way might be the best we can do Mr Kahn knows a bit about the old way In the mids he headed the New York Public Service Commission which oversaw electricity and other regulated industries The drawbacks were legendary Local utilities had an endemic tendency to overestimate demand to justify new power plants for which consumers paid through steady rate increases Nearly everyone assumed that competition would slash prices But though free markets do a better job managing rail phone and airline prices they have yet to match regulators ability to juggle the complexities of electricity Mr Kahn said Regulators tended to apply heavy political pressure on utilities to keep prices as low as possible and profit margins steady but thin The vertical integration of electricity monopolies may have also had advantages Mr Kahn said Engineers coordinated power plants and transmission lines in ideal ways Planners who saw the need for new plants helped find a place for them to be built The players all depended on one another he said California has probably not derailed deregulation efforts But it has made people wonder anew whether market forces work for kilowatts as they do for widgets Photo Alfred E Kahn Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved National Desk Executives Considered to Head Military From Associated Press Los Angeles Times

Democratic staff director for the Senate Armed Services Committee The nominee for Army secretary was said to be Thomas White a retired Army general and an executive with Enron a Houstonbased energy company White was executive assistant to Secretary of State Colin Powell when Powell was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved NEWS Enrons Chief Denies Role as Energy Villain Critics regard Kenneth Lay as deregulation opportunist David Lazarus Chronicle Staff Writer The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL A Copyright Kenneth Lay is one of the energy pirates accused by Californias governor of fleecing consumers As chairman of Enron Corp the worlds largest energy trader Lay is arguably the biggest baddest buccaneer of them all But thats not how he wants to be seen And he certainly doesnt like taking knocks from Gov Gray Davis for having contributed to Californias energy mess Its very unfair Lay said his brown eyes taking on a puppy dog quality Hes trying to vilify us But we didnt make the rules in California We had nothing to do with creating the problem He gazed out from his plush thfloor office Houstons downtown skyscrapers jutted like sharp teeth against the overcast sky Everyone played by the rules Lay said Now our reputations are being maligned In a sense hes right The ultimate blame does rest with California policymakers for deregulating the states electricity market in such a hamfisted way that power giants like Enron cleaned up by exploiting loopholes in the system But Enron was no innocent bystander during the restructuring process Enron and Ken Lay were one of the major players behind the push for deregulation in California said Janee Briesemeister senior policy analyst in the Austin office of Consumers Union A lot of whats happening in California was their idea Those familiar with the states deregulation efforts said Enron was especially eager to ensure that a newly created Power Exchange where wholesale power would be bought and sold was separate from the Independent System Operator which would oversee the electricity grid This fragmented the wholesale market making it harder to monitor said John Rozsa an aide to state Sen Steve Peace DEl Cajon widely regarded as the godfather of Californias bungled deregulation measures Enron isnt in the business of making markets work Rozsa said Theyre in the business of making a buck In an ironic twist however Enron now could play a pivotal role in helping the state remedy past errors and find its energy footing The company has that much clout SEEKING LAYS BLESSING Thus as the governor pushes ahead with a scheme to purchase the transmission lines of Californias cashstrapped utilities he didnt hesitate to call recently seeking Lays personal blessing for the plan This must have been a sweet moment for the man who just weeks earlier had been castigated by Davis in the governors State of the State speech I told him we couldnt support it Lay said a hint of a smile playing across his lips It will lead to an even less efficient transmission grid and longer term it could make things worse Why would Davis swallow his pride and court favor with Enrons big cheese Simple Davis will need the Bush administrations backing to make the powerline sale fly and many believe theres no faster way to reach the new president than via the Houston office of his leading corporate patron Lay and his company have donated more than to Bushs various political campaigns in recent years and he placed Enrons private jet at Bushs disposal during the presidential race So great is Lays influence with the president that some insist he is now serving effectively as shadow energy secretary shaping US energy policy as he sees fit Theres a long history of Enron pulling the levers of its political relationships to get what it wants said Craig McDonald director of Texans for Public Justice a watchdog group What Ken Lay thinks energy policy should be isnt very different from what George Bush and Dick Cheney think it should be ANOTHER VIEWPOINT Lay of course sees things differently At the mere mention of his close rapport with the president his eyes glazed over and he mechanically recited the words he has repeated numerous times in recent months I have known the president and his family for many years Lay said Ive been a strong supporter of his I believe in him and I believe in his policies He insisted that reports of his having sway over Bush on energy matters are grossly exaggerated Still it is striking that Bushs quick decision after taking office to limit federal assistance in solving Californias energy woes virtually mirrored Lays own thoughts on the situation So too with the administrations handsoff approach to resolving the crisis Whatever else Californias power woes have been very kind to Enrons bottom line The companys revenues more than doubled to billion last year They havent hurt Lay either According to company records his pay package more than tripled last year to million Lay and other Enron officials steadfastly refuse to break out the companys California earnings from other worldwide business activities But Lay conceded that Enrons profit from California energy deals last year was not inconsequential We benefit from the volatility he said CAPTIVE MARKETPLACE Thats putting it mildly It could be said that Californias energy mess was tailormade for Enron which is almost uniquely positioned to prosper from a captive marketplace in which electricity and natural gas prices are simultaneously soaring skyward To understand why that is one must look closely at Enrons complex business model The company is much more than just a middleman in brokering energy deals Lay with a doctorate in economics and a background as a federal energy regulator set about completely reinventing Enron in after taking over what was then an unexceptional naturalgas pipeline operator As he saw it the real action was not in distribution or generation of energy but in transacting lightningfast deals wherever electricity or gas is needed treating energy like a tradable commodity for the first time Enron is now the leader in this fastgrowing field and uses that advantage to consolidate its position as the marketmaker of choice for energy buyers and sellers throughout the country It also exploits its size and trading sophistication to structure unusually creative deals For example if electricity prices are down but natural gas prices up Enron might cut a deal to meet a utilitys power needs in return for taking possession of the gas required to run the utilitys plants Enron could then turn around and sell that gas elsewhere using part of the proceeds to purchase lowpriced electricity from another provider which it ships back to the original utility We do best in competitive markets Lay said These are sustainable markets TRADING FRENZY Enrons trading floors buzz all day long with frantic activity as mostly young mostly male employees scan banks of flatpanel displays in search of the best deals Rock music blares from speakers giving the scene an almost fratparty atmosphere The companys trading volume skyrocketed last year with the advent of an Internetbased bidding system which logged trades valued at billion making Enron by far the worlds single biggest ecommerce entity Kevin Presto who oversees Enrons East Coast power trades called up the California electricity market on his computer With a few quick mouse clicks he showed that Enron at that moment was buying power in the Golden State at per megawatt hour and selling it at Some days were at some days and some days Presto said over the steady thumpthump of the trading floors rock n roll soundtrack Theres truly a problem out there This is a recurring theme among Enron officials Californias electricity market is broken and Enron would prefer it if things just settled down As Lay himself put it The worst thing for us is a dysfunctional marketplace In reality Californias dysfunctional marketplace means Enron isnt just making piles of money its seeing profits both coming and going LOTS OF BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA The companys energy services division which handles the complete energy needs of large institutions counts among its clients the University of California and California State school systems Oaklands Clorox Co and even the San Francisco Giants and Pac Bell Park Enron purchases electricity on behalf of these clients from Pacific Gas and Electric Co which by law must keep its rates frozen below current market values At the same time Enron sells power to PGE at skyhigh wholesale levels In other words Enron is buying back its own electricity from PGE for just a fraction of the price it charges the utility These guys are the pariahs of the power system said Nettie Hoge executive director of The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco Why do we need middlemen They dont do anything except mark up the cost To be fair energy marketers such as Enron can help stabilize an efficient marketplace by promoting increased competition between buyers and sellers This has proven the case in Pennsylvania where Enron actively trades among about market participants But in an inefficient market such as California a company like Enron can easily exacerbate things by exploiting loopholes in the states illconceived regulatory framework Sylvester Turner a Houston lawmaker who serves as vice chairman of the state committee that oversees Texas utilities said he cant blame Enron and other power companies for pursuing profits in California California set up some bad rules and these companies played by the rules California set up he said At the end of the day they will behave to enhance their bottom lines But as Texas proceeds toward deregulation of its own electricity market next year Turner said he has learned from Californias experience and is taking steps to prevent Texas power giants from shaking down local consumers LESSONS FROM GOLDEN STATE He has written a bill intended to give the Texas Public Utility Commission more authority in cracking down on market abuses The power companies are fighting the legislation as hard as they can Not least among Turners worries is that Texas will see what California officials believe happened in their state A deliberate withholding of power by leading providers until surging demand had pushed prices higher I have that concern he said I dont necessarily take these companies at their word For his part Lay insists that Enron has never deliberately manipulated electricity prices I dont know of any of that he said Its so easy to conjure up conspiracy theories As a sign of Enrons commitment to solving Californias energy troubles Lay said he supported Davis when the state began negotiating longterm power contracts on behalf of utilities So how many contracts has Enron signed Suddenly the hurt puppyish expression vanished from Lays face and a harder more steely look glinted from his eyes None he said We wont be signing until were certain about recovering our costs Consider this a shot across Californias bow PHOTO Caption Chairman Kenneth Lay said Enron had nothing to do with creating the energy problem Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved Enron boss says hes not to blame for profits in energy crisis Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved SAN FRANCISCO AP Yes his business has profited handsomely from Californias energy crisis but Enron Corp Chairman Kenneth Lay says he shouldnt be a scapegoat in Californias energy crisis That hasnt swayed Gov Gray Davis who has skewered energy companies such as Houstonbased Enron for selling expensive power to California Never again can we allow outofstate profiteers to hold Californians hostage Davis warned in his State of the State address More recently however Davis called Lay to discuss negotiations as the state looks to buy power transmission lines from troubled utilities I told him we couldnt support it Lay told the San Francisco Chronicle in an interview at his Houston office It will lead to an even less efficient transmission grid and longer term it could make things worse Lay is not just any privatesector energy czar Enron Corp is the worlds largest energy trader and Lay is a close friend of President George Bush Lay and his corporation have donated more than to Bushs various political campaigns in recent years and he offered Bush use of Enrons private jet during the presidential race But Lay said its economics not politics that matter in Californias energy crisis And he thinks it unfair that Davis has blamed outofstate energy brokers for the protracted problems We didnt make the rules in California Lay said We had nothing to do with creating the problem The problem many analysts agree began with the states deregulation of the power industry in Enron encouraged deregulation and the states ensuing power crisis has been lucrative for the corporation Enrons stock jumped percent in and its revenues more than doubled to billion Lay was compensated accordingly he received nearly million in stock and cash beyond his million salary last year compared with less than million in bonuses in Lay refused to say how much Enron has made off Californias crisis though he conceded the profit was not inconsequential We benefit from the volatility said Lay who took over Enron in and has helped turn the corporation into a major player in the trading of electricity as a commodity But Lay rejected suggestions that Enron has manipulated prices upward by insisting California pay dearly for lastminute power that has helped keep the lights on in recent months I dont know of any of that he said Its so easy to conjure up conspiracy theories Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved BUSINESS NET WORTH The Stadium Curse Some

St Louis and Pro Player Stadium in Miami are looking for new corporate sponsors because their current ones are bankrupt TWA is an airline Pro Player was part of underwearmaker Fruit of the Loom The home of the Anaheim Angels could be in the market for a new name if Edison International parent of electric utility Southern California Edison runs out of juice Of course these companies were not in trouble when they promised to pay tens or hundreds of millions of dollars to have their names plastered on a ballpark or arena In fact many were at their peak Which begs the question Should investors get worried when a company in which they own stock puts its name up among the floodlights Brian Pears head of equity trading with Wells Capital Management wonders if companies are susceptible to some weird strain of the Sports Illustrated curse It seems as if any athlete who is pictured on the cover of SI magazine invariably loses his next game or pulls a groin muscle Business celebrities suffer from a similar phenomenon Amazoncom Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos was named Time magazines person of the year just before his companys stock price tanked Don Hinchey who advises buyers and sellers in namingrights deals doesnt think the curse holds true in stadium and arena deals You can make a case that a company is doing well when it acquires a naming rights sponsorship but you cant necessarily say it corresponds with a peak in its business says Hinchey director of creative services for the Bonham Group in Denver TRACKING NAMING FIRMS To find out if Hinchey is right I tracked the stock market performance of publicly held companies since they bought naming rights to bigleague sports venues in North America I excluded facilities named after subsidiaries of larger companies including Miller Park in Milwaukee Miller Brewing is part of Philip Morris and Pac Bell Park in San Francisco Pacific Bell is owned by SBC Communications which is putting its own name on an arena in San Antonio I used the announcement date as a starting point because stadium naming deals are after all marketing endeavors The announcement of a deal generates tons of publicity which is considered positive even if the publicity is negative and even if the stadium wont open for several years Then I compared each companys stock market performance with the Standard Poors index during the same period The bottom line of the companies that bought stadium or arena names are trading at a higher stock price today than when the deals were announced according to data from FactSet Research Systems Two companies each bought two names and were counted twice But and this is a big but only of them beat the SP during the period since their respective deals were announced So buying a stadium name might not be a curse but its no guarantee the company will beat the market WINNERS LOSERS The companies that have done best since buying a name come from a wide variety of industries The biggest winner is Qualcomm a wireless telecommunications company Although its stock is down percent from its peak its still up percent since it agreed to slap its name on a San Diego stadium The nextbiggest winners include Target discount stores Ericsson telecom equipment Coors beer Fleet Financial banking Pepsi soft drinks and Enron energy The biggest losers are TWA PSINet Internet service provider CMGI Internet incubator Savvis Communications telecom services and Network Associates network security software Network Associates stock peaked about three months after it bought naming rights to the Oakland Coliseum in September Since then it has suffered a string of setbacks After the Securities and Exchange Commission questioned its accounting practices it restated its financial results for and Its CEO resigned in December Network Associates is paying slightly more than million per year for the coliseum name It can get out of its year deal after five years The company has been paying us says Deena McClain general counsel with the OaklandAlameda County Coliseum Authority We havent had any discussions with them about changing the contract Most namingrights contracts have out clauses that allow the parties to extricate themselves if they want can or need to in the event of financial difficulties or if a team moves says Hinchey Although nobody likes to be associated with a loser stadium owners may benefit if a troubled company cuts out of a deal early Thats because stadium name prices have skyrocketed since the mid s when million a year give or take was average In FedEx agreed to pay million over years to be named home of the Washington Redskins In CMGI agreed to pay million over years to have its name on the new home of the New England Patriots Its questionable what kind of shape CMGI will be in when the stadium opens next year The gallon hat of naming rights deals says Hinchey is in Houston where Reliant Energy will pay million over years to name the Astrodome and a new football stadium after itself Some customers of Reliants utility subsidiary were outraged when the deal was announced because the company was also raising electricity rates Some shareholders also get perturbed when their company spends money on a stadium instead of a new plant or stock dividends But Jim Grinstead editor of Revenues from Sports Venues says you have to look at the stadium purchase in light of total marketing budget It sounds like big money but frequently its over to years If you take out things the company might buy anyway like tickets and luxury suites its small potatoes WHAT A DEAL IS WORTH The main benefit of a stadium deal is the exposure a company gets when a game is broadcast on TV or radio or mentioned in print This is the biggest bang for your buck in terms of branding says Jennifer Keavney a Network Associates vice president who negotiated the stadium deal She says the cost of her deal about million a year wont even buy you a Super Bowl ad It will buy five commercials on a nationally televised football game maybe The Coliseum perched beside Interstate also acts like a giant billboard for the company which frequently gets mentioned in traffic reports Hinchey says most naming deals also include tickets and luxury boxes onsite exposure through signage and kiosks premium nights when the sponsor might offer samples at the park and inclusion in programs tickets and flyers Most companies that strike stadium deals want to become a household name because they sell consumer products or services But not always Com sold nothing but corporate networking gear when it bought the name to Candlestick Park in San Francisco in It was a good move for them says Jim Grinstead editor of Revenues from Sports Venues They got the employees they were looking for the visibility they were looking for At the time they were a player in a crowded field and they wanted to look like a fun place to work Last April Com extended its original year contract for two more years The biggest risk companies run is that the team that plays in their facility will be a loser Companies invest in an entity that can enhance their brand their sales and hospitality efforts Certainly that loses its luster if the team is not performing well Hinchey says But corporations realize the teams success on the field fluctuates It could be a champion one year next year in the dumps The same can be said about the corporate sponsors which is something stadium owners be they taxpayers or business tycoons must realize when they sell a name PHOTO Caption Rich Gannon of the

Lemuel Green a flour mill owner took the excess power from the waterturn ed generator at his mill in and sold it between dusk and midnight to anybody in Alton Kan who knew what to do with it Soon he quit the millin g business and started stringing transmission lines across the western part o f the state Before his death in he had built a utility that lit Kans as communities Kansas Citys UtiliCorp United is perhaps the only fourthgeneration familycontrolled electric utility in the country Today the outfit once called Missouri Public Service is headed by Lemuel Greens two greatgrandsons Richard Green took over as chief executive in three years after his fathers death At the time Missouri Public Service served customers in two states and had million in revenues Richards brother Robert now joined him three years later Standing pat was not an option Deregulation was in the air and the rules were changing The brothers remade the company They spent billion buyin g utilities in other parts of the US Canada Australia and New Zealand UtiliCorp now serves million customers in seven states and four countries More important they veered off into other parts of the energy business In they acquired gas properties from Peoples Natural Gas of Omaha and got a twoperson gastrading operation as part of the deal That little trading operation now a subsidiary called Aquila turned into something almost as valuable as all the rest of the company with its megawatts of power generated in some power plants around the country My brother and I received strong advice that we would never be able to be competitive in this business says Bob Green Oh yeah Aquila has employees and competes with the likes of Duke Dynegy and Enron According to Natural Gas Week Aquila was the fourthlargest powerandgas marketer in t he country last year Aquila trades a host of other products as welleverythin g from weathercondition hedges to bandwidth Problem Trading operations require capital just as power plants do The solution until now has been what brother Bob calls our asset lite strategy We want to control the capacity not own it So Aquila may provi de the gas to power a socalled merchant plant one that produces electricity to sell in the market in return for a claim on its production But so far Aquila has not been a big player in the most profitable parts of the businesstaking on big risk in larger transactions the way Enron and Dyneg y do What to do In midDecember UtiliCorp announced that it would offer o f Aquila to the public raising capital while creating a market value for its trading operation just as competitors Constellation Energy and Southern Company are doing The hope is that the new entity will garner a multiple o f to times earnings Then if all were to go as planned UtiliCorp woul d spin off the rest of the operation in a taxfree distribution The timing looks good Aquila has no material exposure in the California market Furthermore the volatility in that market has been a bonanza for many firms that trade power including Aquila Its trading subsidiary is th e reason UtiliCorps earnings were up last year to million on billion in sales UtiliCorps shares doubled in the past year to But will the California crisis nonetheless poison the market for an Aquila stock offering It might And UtiliCorp cannot afford to hold its breath in the capital markets forever Even with its assetlite strategy the compa ny is far more leveraged than most utilities with debt at of capital versus the norm for electric utilities The offering is supposed to rai se million or so that could be used to pay down a bit of the parents billion in debt If Bob Green is walking a financial tightrope you could never tell it by talking to him We see this company as our heritage he says confidently This despite the fact that after seven equity offerings the familys share of UtiliCorp is now down from when Richard took over Might the Greens lose their heirloom in a takeover battle They might but they might come out ahead anyway Look at the family history Lemuel sold some of his utility assets for million in and diversified into California orange groves The assets were resold to Samuel Insull the midwestern electricity magnate who came to a bad end when his pyramid of holding companies collapsed during the Depression Years later after Congress reacted

Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Two years ago Bradley Hoggatt was heading for an academic career in meteorology intent on discovering more about how hurricanes form But just before he started working on a doctorate a very different opportunity blew in Now Mr Hoggatt forecasts weather for a floor full of MBAs who trade billions of dollars in weathersensitive energy commodities such as natural gas and electricity for Aquila Inc the trading subsidiary of a big Midwes t utility With no business background himself Mr Hoggatt is also trading complex financial contracts based on his predictions Im putting my money where m y mouth is says the tall squareshouldered yearold Weathermen and women have become a hot commodity in the exploding energytrading business While offtarget forecasts on television may frustrate parents and schools and embarrass politicians as they did this week on the East Coast they can lose bundles for electricity and naturalg as traders So as trading has boomed so has demand for trained meteorologists a profession that traditionally hasnt paid all that well and is often the butt of jokes From Wall Street to Houstons Louisiana Street where many energy companies have set up shop recent graduates are earning twice what they would earn a t the National Weather Service or in academia The appetite for weather is insatiable says James L Gooding director of meteorology at Duke Energy Corp A former NASA scientist Dr Gooding will be adding a fourth forecast er to his Houston team in the next year Enron Corp an energytrading giant based in Houston has more than double d its staff of weather forecasters to nine in the past three years plucking talent from places like the Weather Channel Williams Cos a Tulsa Okla competitor is endowing university fellowships to lure meteorology students And since Aquila which is owned by UtiliCorp United Inc of Kansas City Mo has hired two other meteorologists from Mr Hoggatts alma mater the University of Wisconsin plus another scientist with a PhD in climatology That hiring paid off a bit during this weeks winter storm in the Northeast While many on the East Coast were getting miscues from TV weathermen on a pending possibly historic blizzard that fizzled in New York and other cities traders at Aquila simply looked to Mr Hoggatt Last Friday Scott Macrorie an electricity trader for the MidAtlantic region at Aquila stopped by to see how the storm was progressing Mr Hoggatts team told him temperatures in his region of interest would be low er because of the storm though the snowfall forecast on TV seemed a little high Sure enough temperatures fell and snowfall in many cities was less than predicted lifting electricity prices and making Mr Macrorie a profit that he says was in the tens of thousands of dollars About university students in the US graduate each year with bachelor s degrees in meteorology according to the American Meteorological Society A n additional or so graduate with masters degrees or doctorates Until jus t a few years ago those graduates didnt typically have many options TV for those who had the blowdried look backoffice jobs with the government or a handful of private consultants for those who didnt Research was an option And some airlines and utilities kept a few meteorologists on staff to help position airplanes or powerline repair trucks during storms Now deeppocketed trading companies are offering many meteorologists with graduate degrees salaries ranging from to Performance and trading bonuses can double or even triple the figure That compares with th e roughly the National Weather Service pays a junior forecaster with a graduate degree Its a bit unusual for meteorologists to have the prospect of lucrative employment after graduation says John NielsenGammon a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas AM University This is a bit of a switch So far there has been no dearth of meteorological talent available partly because the National Weather Service wrapped up a big expansion project in the mids and slowed hiring It hires only to replace people who leave about to meteorologists a year And the highpressure world of billiondollar commodity bets isnt for everyone When Carl Altoe graduated from Penn State one of the nations to p meteorology programs he got a heavy sales pitch from Enron Its quite an impressive place he says of Enrons trading floor but he wasnt sure forecasting skills alone would be enough to make the grade I would be afraid that if money wasnt made in a hurry Id be tossed says Mr Altoe who accepted a position with the National Weather Service in Marquette Mic h For others having forecasts count puts a new thrill in the old art After two years as a manager at the Weather

commodity markets to the stocks of retail companies on Wall Street Jon Davis a meteorologist for Salomon Smith Barney in Chicago started forecasting the weather for agriculture traders back in But volatile energy prices have raised the stakes for forecasters who are able to gauge airconditioning use in the summer or naturalgas demand duri ng the winter heating season Meanwhile all sorts of companies are turning to energy traders and Wall Street for weather derivatives complex contracts used to hedge financial risks associated with the weather With every passing year you do more energy and more energy Mr Davis says Despite big advances in data collection and modeling betting millions of dollars on weather forecasts can still be tricky business Shortterm forecasts are pretty good Predicting weather two weeks from now is chancy Most meteorologists get their data from the government particularly the National Weather Service Many then tweak it with their own interpretations or forecasting models Disappointed last year by poor longterm forecasts from private consultants Aquila has a contest offering to the meteorologist or team that can best predict temperatures in major US cities over the course of a year I call it the forecast bakeoff says Mr Hoggatt The high stakes also mean more pressure on forecasters WSI Corp a Billerica Mass weatherforecasting firm started an

MEAs five year plan and our trading partnership with Enron will greatly assist us in achieving this goal Richard Lewis Managing Director of UK gas and power at Enron commented This is a great transaction for both parties and fits well into Enrons trading portfolio MEA will benefit from Enrons expertise as one of the UKs leading energy traders and will provide us with their skills as

cc Subject Here is the Articleno picture though Warming Up To Green BY ERIC ROSTON Breathe in Hold it Hold it OK now breathe out Unless youre outdoors in the midst of a cold snap chances are you cant see your breath And no one would ever ask you to drop a quarter in a tin box for the right to free this invisible spirit from your lungs Yet last November Murphy Oil Corp based in El Dorado Ark voluntarily shelled out several hundred thousand dollars for the right to cough out carbon dioxide the same stuff you exhaled three sentences ago The reason it did so is closely related to events that occurred that same autumn day half a world away at the Hague Thousands of policymakers and scientists from all over the world had gathered hoping to dot the is cross the zeds and umlaut the os on the Kyoto Protocol to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change The protocol was devised to curb the industrial emission of six gases CO among them that are slowlyactually quickly in geological termsturning the earth into a hothouse But no final accord was reached In this context Murphys purchase of options on metric tons of carbon the equivalent of annual exhaust from approximately cars from a Canadian company that was itself trying to help meet a national target seems a bit odd The market for this kind of trade hasnt been established and there isnt even a global agreement on how carbon dioxide should be valued Indeed there isnt even unanimity on global warming itself Yet the transaction is emblematic of industry on the verge of an environmental transition Congress may have snubbed the Kyoto accord and global bureaucrats may be stumbling over the details of a carbonemissions trading system But corporations against the run of play are beginning to confront the climate conundrum the best way they know howas a business opportunity John Browne CEO of BP Amoco and Mark MoodyStuart chairman of Royal DutchShell Group have both responded to the globalwarming threat and set up internal systems that exceed goals put forth in Kyoto Shell and BP have vowed to cut their greenhousegas emissions eachnearly twice the Kyoto targetShell by BP by This isnt an act of altruism says Aidan Murphy of Shell Its a fundamental strategic issue for our business And not theirs alone A growing number of corporations from IBM to your neighborhood Kinkos are reducing their greenhouse footprints DuPont is pledging to knock its emissions below levels by Theres been a shift in the center of gravity in the US corporate community since Kyoto says Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists Now the view is that climate change is serious and we ought to do something about it There are a few ways of doing that invest in renewable energy sources and cap and trade emissions That is set ceilings for worldwide greenhousegas emission and let nations either sell emission credits if they emit below their allowance or buy credits if they exceed permitted levels The theory is that the pursuit of greenbacks will fuel greener business Whenever you turn a pollution cut into a financial asset says Joseph Goffman an attorney at Environmental Defense people go out and make lots of pollution cuts Even where green fervor is of a paler shade corporations are viewing the potential for global regulation as a business risk they need to consider Witness Claiborne Deming Murphys CEO who doesnt see the science of global warming as solid enough yet to cry havoc But Deming hears shareholders clamoring and the bureaucrats buzzing Someone may ask his company to put more than a quarter in that box when it wants to exhale more than its allotted amount of CO Breathe in Hold it You know the drill How much CO did you just exhale Tricky question Yet thats analogous to the one businesses are struggling with on a massive scale Until they figure it out companies interested in trading will be on their own to determine how you buy the right to emit a gas that has no standard of measurement and how to do so when no nation currently assigns a CO property right Its risky as hell says Deming Many groups are working to mitigate that risk The World Resources Institute and others are roadtesting a system that would make trading less risky by creating universal carbonaccounting practices And four companiesArthur Andersen Credit Lyonnais Natsource and Swiss Reare developing an exchange where companies can trade even in an embryonic market devoid of legislative standards Theyre trying to nail down something that will be useful under laws that are not yet defined says Garth Edward a broker at Natsource an energytrading firm The US struggled to introduce a capandtrade system into the Kyoto Protocol and achieved it by agreeing to a tough many say impossible target bringing emissions below levels from to The irony of the current situation is that the Europeans reluctant to accept trading at first have become its champion Britain next month will become the first country to embark on a national trading system Another practice still hotly debated is to assign credits for sequestering carbon in growing forests Trees soak up limited amounts of CO release oxygen into the air and turn carbon into wood The Kyoto mechanisms will evaporate without global ratification thus setting up an early environmental test for President Bush who campaigned against the document But Secretary of State Colin Powell has already heard preliminary briefings on the matter as the US preps for the next round of talks to be held in Bonn in midJuly Bush the First helped pioneer credit trading in when he signed legislation that capped power plants sulfur dioxide emissionsthe main ingredient in acid rainbut allowed the plants to swap credits And Houstonbased Enron an energy trader whose chairman Ken Lay was a prominent W campaign adviser stands to be a huge player in any such market So if its good for business Bush the exbusinessman wont need that big a push With him or without him the monetization of carbon emissionsgreen for greeds sake if nothing elseis gaining momentum So breathe easy For you its still free But for many companies the carbon meter will be running soon In the very near future pollution is going to be either a cost to them or an opportunity

move the two way so i can try simulating actual market cicumstances From David nronXgate on AM To John CT cc Savita nronXgate Subject John You might recall we spoke a few weeks ago about a system with more intelligence for outofhours trading than just leaving the products on Last Trade is Mid Attached is a suggestion for how such a system might work It builds on Offset to Last Trade functionality The simplified description is It tracks two variables IntensitySpeed and Bias Buy or Sell emphasis As Intensity increases the Spread increases As Bias increases the Offset increases Ill call later to see what you think of the idea Dave Program Criteria The formula which defines the trading decisionmaking program will need to work with several criteriainputsdefinitions These might be Intensity Speed The average time between transaction attempts regardless of whether they are buys or sells Measured as a moving average over the last Intensity Factor transactions by comparing the timestamp of the transaction Tibco messages for the Product Obviously the lower the Intensity calculation the higher the transaction flow Therefore a high Intensity number indicates low transaction flow Intensity Factor The number of transactions to be included in the moving average Intensity calculation A possible value for this might be Buys The number of Buys which have occurred Sells The number of Sells which have occured Transaction Count Could be either Buys or Sells whichever last occured Buy Offset The Offset value which will be applied if a Buy occurs Sell Offset The Offset value which will be applied if a Sell occurs Offset Reversion Ratio ORR The amount by which the Buy Offset should be reduced if a Sell occurs or amount Sell Offset should be reduced if a Buy occurs A possible value for this might be If the application of the ORR results in a reduction of less than then the reduction shall be Transaction Reversion Ratio TRR The amount by which Buys should be reduced if a Sell occurs or amount Sells should be reduced if a Buy occurs A possible value for this might be If the application of the TRR results in a reduction of less than then the reduction shall be equal to Spread Minimum The minimum Spread value allowed A possible value for this might be Spread Maximum The maximum Spread value allowed A possible value for this might be Offset Minimum The minimum Offset allowed for both Buys and Sells A possible value for this might be Offset Maximum The maximum offset allowed for both Buys and Sells A possible value for this might be Initial Offset The Buy and Sell Offset used when the program is started Initial Spread The Spread used when the program is started SpreadOffset Minimum The minimum amount by which Spread must exceed Offset Prevents a possible arbitrage opportunity for the customer A possible value for this might be Dead Interval The period of time which must pass before the program will recalculate the above Criteria if no transactions have taken place during the Dead Interval A possible value for this might be seconds Program Outputs The program should output the following variables as a result of combining the above Criteria in a userdefined Formula Spread integer as per current Stack Manager Offset integer as per current Stack Manager Suspension boolean Whether or not the Product should be suspended Normally False Program Interface and Operation Principles The user should be provided with a GUI which will allow them to define a relationship among the above Criteria which will produce and apply the Outputs to a particular Product This relationship would be defined with Intensity Formulas and Transaction Formulas Every time a Transaction occurs or a Dead Interval passes the Criteria will be recalculated and the userdefined formulas will be reviewed by the program If a Dead Interval passes without any transactions taking place then Intensity Intensity and BuysBuysTRR and SellsSellsTRR and Buy Offset Buy Offset ORR and Sell Offset Sell Offset ORR If the userdefined Formulas see following indicate that a change in spread should occur then if the Offset is zero in the case of a trade occurring or if no trade has occured during the passing of a Dead Interval the system shall perform a Last Trade is Mid calculation around the last transaction adjusting the buy and sell prices according to the new Spread value Any adjustment to the Spread shall respect the SpreadOffset Minimum If a reduction in the Spread should violate the SpreadOffset Minimum then the Buy Offset or Sell Offset or both as appropriate shall be reduced accordingly Similarly if the Offset is increased by a Transaction Formula to a level greater than the Spread the Spread shall be increased to maintain the SpreadOffset Minimum GUIFormulas Example Constants Intensity Factor Dead Interval Offset Reversion Ratio ORR Transaction Reversion Ratio TRR Spread Minimum Spread Maximum Offset Minimum Offset Maximum SpreadOffset Minimum INPUTS OUTPUTS Intensity Formula Formula Intensity Spread Offset Suspension S na F S na F S na F Transaction Formula Formula Transactions Spread Offset Suspension V na F V na F V F V F V F V na na T Note that Transactions would be Buys or Sells as appropriate Note also that Buys and Sells are not intended to be an absolute count but rather are a moving measure of the number of buys or sells which have recently occured In this example all Constants and Formulae are editable by the user through the GUI Simulation Obviously if we want to proceed we will want to conduct several simulations to prove concepts and evaluate responsiveness However to give some idea of how the above might work when a market starts to run in a particular direction please see the attached Additional Features System Notifications There should be two kinds of notifications for the Robotrader which will be similar to Stack Manager Garbage Checks Warning and Failure levels for both Offset and Price The warning levels will trigger a pager message The Failure levels will trigger a pager message and the product will be automatically suspended The Price checks will be against prices input by the trader not relative price movements but actual price There should be both maximum and minimum price checks eg gas is trading at The notification levels could be at the top end and at the bottom end Offset checks will only be against a maximum value Dave

an investment banker is someone in private equity Investment bankers pride themselves on making vast amounts of money but a successful private equity professional takes devilish pride and supports an even bigger ego for working fewer hours while making even more money than his rarely her investment banking brethren Unfortunately some members of the private equity community mistakenly believe that their growing wealth is the result of their own talent and charming personality rather than a simple profiting from the hoarding of capital as Karl Marx so astutely described Consider the plight of Peter Chung see attached email a recent hire at the Carlyle Group After completing his twoyear stint as an Analyst at Merrill Lynch Chung was persuaded to seek out new opportunities in Korea working as part of Carlyles vast Asian investment team Working at a private equity firm allows Chung to check out Korean night clubs which would be legally classified as brothels in the United States times a week though Chung made it clear that he needs only two months to learn a little bit of the buyside business so he can begin nightly visits Already a selfdescribed stud on the New York City dating scene Chung looked to the emerging island of Korea where the standard of living for young foreign men is bolstered by the low per capita income of native residents roughly per person By making in excess of ten times the average national wage Chung quickly found himself to be quite the ladies man as the locals were attracted to his fat wallet and US citizenship Thus bolstered by an initial rendezvous or two Chung decided to cement his legacy by setting out on the quixotic mission to sleep with all of the fine women of Korea As of May Chung alludes to having had sexual relations with five hot chicks According to Chungs own calculations there are roughly one billion hot chicks remaining in Korea Clearly there is a break in Chungs sexual predator model as he apparently believes that not only is the global female population of billion comprised of hot Korean chicks but he will be able to sleep with that many before his finest member falls off or he dies of exhaustion Sadly Chung cannot complete his mission alone The quality of prophylactics in Korea are not quite up to US standards Chung would probably claim Korean condoms are too small and he needs your help to continue his quest for infamy If you would like to contribute to this valiant mission please direct your gift of a FDAapproved domes to the address below Peter Chung The Carlyle Group Suite CCMM Bldg Yoidodong

lavish lifestyle in an email message to buddies at Merrill Lynch in New York where he used to work Unfortunately for Mr Chung a yearold Princeton graduate who had moved to Seoul three days earlier to start his job the message was forwarded or passed on to thousands of people on Wall Street and wound up being sent to his bosses at Carlyle the private equity firm Mr Chung was given the option of resigning or being dismissed a Carlyle executive said The message which was retitled Amazing Cautionary Tale by a banking analyst meandered in and out of email boxes around the world I know I was a stud in NYC but I pretty much get about on average phone numbers a night and at least hot chicks that say that they want to go home with me every night I go out I love the buy side Mr Chung wrote in the message using the companys network He bragged about his spanking brand new sq foot three bedroom apt with a sq foot terrace He bragged that he used one bedroom for his harem and another for other sexual exploits Mr Chung also boasted about his job I have bankers calling me every day with opportunities he wrote and they pretty much cater to my every whim you know golfing events lavish dinners a night out clubbing Reached by telephone in Seoul Mr Chung said Its devastating I really cant comment Sorry Mr Chung is the latest in a string of employees to lose their jobs or be publicly embarrassed by a sexually explicit email message that was forwarded to others In a much publicized email message last year that made its way to hundreds of thousands of inboxes an employee of a British Internet provider wrote to her boyfriend about a sex act Employees of many different companies that passed the message along to friends were dismissed David M Rubenstein a founder and managing director of the Carlyle Group had no comment The Carlyle Group is known for its investments in military companies and its prominent list of advisers including Arthur Levitt the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and James A Baker III the former secretary of state One analyst that passed along the message to his investment banking colleagues attached this prophetic message Rule No we

THE DUST By ERICA COPULSKY NY POST May Subject The Story Gone Awry of a Private Equity Stud Another Wall Streeter apparently fell victim to the perils of the Digital Age last week when an associate from prominent Washington DC investment firm Carlyle Group reportedly was forced to resign after a risqu email he sent to friends became a chain letter among investment banks around the world The incident began innocently enough when a Peter Chung who represented himself to be a junior staffer in Carlyles Seoul office sent an email to friends boasting of the lavish lifestyle and sexual exploits he is enjoying in his new buyside position In a May email obtained by The Post Living Like A King Chung brags in lewd detail about how he gets on average phone numbers a night and how at least hot chicks that want to go home with him every time he goes out He goes on saying he loves the buyside because bankers pretty much cater to my every whim you know golfing events lavish dinners a night out clubbing He concludes the email by asking his friends to send him condoms by FedEx because he was running out of them The executive was forced to resign from Carlyle Friday less than two weeks after his hiring according to Net news service PrivateEquityCentralnet Carlyle partner David Rubenstein did not return repeated phone messages Chung could not be reached However in a May email purportedly sent by him to a friend he denied writing the email that sparked the controversy That email quickly circulated to hundreds of eager readers who in some cases added their own mocking commentaries One reader called the email kind of a pimpin aint easy version of the Uberconsumer from several years back Another marked it as a lesson of why one should never put anything in print The most biting satire entitled The True Story of a Private Equity Stud urged recipients of the email to contact former Secretary of State James Baker a senior counselor at Carlyle Carlyle Associate Resigns Following Raunchy EMail Incident By David Snow May A junior professional in The Carlyle Groups Seoul office was forced to resign Friday after a raunchy email he sent to friends was forwarded to thousands of people around the world The junior professional an associate sent the message on May to friends via his Carlyle email account In the message the associate expressed excitement about his new position with the Washington DCbased private equity giant But the associate mostly described in bawdy detail the lavish lifestyle and various sexual conquests he enjoyed as a young buyside professional The email made its way to thousands of financial professionals and others around the world and two days later made it to top partners at The Carlyle Group according to a source familiar with the situation Carlyle executives found the email totally inappropriate the source said and were particularly concerned about the mocking commentary that accompanied the message as it was sent from person to person One lengthy commentary described private equity professionals as arrogant and profiting from the hoarding of capital and satirically urged recipients of the forwarded message to contact Carlyle senior counselor James Baker The email highlighted the firm in a very negative way and it was taken very seriously the source said The associate resigned last Friday after having been employed by Carlyle for less than two weeks The Carlyle incident is similar to the Brad and Claire incident that originated in London late last year in which an employee of law firm Norton Rose forwarded to friends an explicit email from his lover The message was forwarded to an estimated million people and eventually made it to the front pages of the British tabloids The Norton Rose employee was subsequently disciplined but not fired In his email the Carlyle associate bragged about having investment bankers cater to my every whim you know golfing events lavish dinners a night out clubbing He said his goal was to sleep with every hot chick in Korea Carlyles Seoul office responsible for leading Carlyles million investment in KorAm Bank of South Korea last year its largest deal

Jim VandeHei Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc WASHINGTON President Bushs chief political strategist owns hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of stock in companies potentially affected by the presidents top legislative priorities newly released federal records show Karl Rove one of the presidents most trusted advisers on almost every major legislative initiative owns between and of stock in Enron Corp Pfizer Inc General Electric Co Boeing Co and Johnson Johnson among other holdings Federal law requires public officials to report their assets income and debts in broad ranges only All of these companies could be affected by one or more of the policies or legislative initiatives on which the president consults Mr Rove tax cuts increased defense spending an industryoriented energy policy and healthcare reform Mr Rove said yesterday that he has been waiting for several months for approval from the Office of Government Ethics to sell all of his stock holdings and roll the proceeds into a diversified account without having to pay capitalgains taxes as permitted by federal law In the meantime I have had to avoid being involved in matters that specifically and materially affect my specific holdings Mr Rove said Mr Rove said he filed his financial disclosure reports Dec and was later informed by the Office of Government Ethics that he should sell all of his stock holdings to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest But the government ethics office which couldnt be reached for comment yesterday has yet to officially grant Mr Rove a certificate of divestiture which would allow him to roll his proceeds into diversified accounts according to White House spokeswoman Anne Womack It appears that Mr Rove has lost tens of thousands of dollars as a result of the delay because most of his stocks have lost value since the beginning of the year Mr Rove insisted that he has been careful to avoid any discussions that directly affect companies he is invested in as federal conflictofinterest laws require But that cant be easy for Mr Rove widely regarded as one of the most powerful and influential figures in the White House Mr Rove serves as the presidents top political adviser and runs the administrations longterm strategy team He is also the presidents top liaison to outside groups including corporations Hes involved in virtually every decision that is made here says a White House aide It is unclear how many times if ever Mr Rove recused himself from discussion inside the White House President Bush already under fire from Democrats for his administrations close ties to industry is likely to draw more scrutiny as a result of the new disclosures of financial links between top White House officials and major US corporations especially energy firms The White House disclosed the personal finances of Mr Rove and several other top administration officials at the behest of the media It appears that as a result of an administrative backlog Mr Rove is the only member of the senior staff who hasnt been given the green light to sell his stock according to a White House aide The reports show that Mr Rove was one of several White House officials with a financial connection past or present with Enron and other energy companies Larry Lindsey the presidents top economic adviser who helped draft the energy plan received from Enron in for consulting work he did for the company the documents show Lewis Libby chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney who was chairman of the White House task force that wrote the energy plan recently sold tens of thousands of dollars of stock in Enron and other energy companies including Texaco Inc Exxon Mobil Corp and

than energy Imagine the news stories a few years from now Crisis hangover energy stocks sink as prices plunge But California consumers still stuck with high bills The energy industry is suffering its worst downturn since the supply glut of the s as dozens of big new power plants come on line and the justcompleted Alaskan gas pipeline sends natural gas prices to their lowest levels in six years The one bright spot for Texas generators is California where consumers are locked into longterm contracts for wholesale electricity that the state signed at the peak of its blackouts in the summer of Sacramento lawmakers have appealed to President Daschle to help get the state off the hook arguing that California will never claw its way out of its economic slump if businesses continue to flee to states where energy is cheap But top Enron lobbyist Gray Davis a former governor of California warned Daschle that suppliers would have little choice but to go to court to enforce the contracts the state signed Washington and Sacramento are agog with the energy crisis and bursting at the seams with plans to fix it But the one thing no one even environmentalists suggests is letting high energy prices discourage energy consumption or encourage new supplies To economists letting the price rise is the solution said Paul Portney president of Resources for the Future a Washington think tank To elected representatives having the price go up is the problem Political memories tend to be selective and short But it was the energy glut of the s that contributed to Californias blackouts gasoline and amonth heating bills Likewise high prices are now laying the seeds of their own destruction As a story in the New York Times noted an energy investment boom promises a cyclical increase in supplies that is expected to stabilize or reduce prices in coming months many industry executives and private analysts say Through much of the s there was a glut of energy Fuel of all kinds was really cheap How cheap Adjusted for inflation as cheap as in economists calculate Energy is the oxygen of the economy and rockbottom prices contributed to the long economic boom But low prices also caused energy production to slump and consumption to soar People ditched their economy cars for SUVs Houses got bigger ceilings got higher and kitchens sprouted industrial stoves with enough BTUs to melt aluminum Stores offices and homes turned into summertime refrigerators Low prices discouraged energy development Oil was so cheap for so long that people were selling their refineries Portney said You had virtually no exploration for new natural gas when prices were at a BTU As demand soared and supply fell prices rose Profits have grown so robust that green fuels such as biomass and wind are becoming economically viable The oil industry is booming Refineries are expanding The longdelayed construction of a natural gas pipeline from Alaska now looks likely So many power plants are under

last weeks decision of ratings agency Fitch to cut Indias sovereign ratings outlook to negative from stable and say there are no grounds to downgrade the country Fitch which rates Indias foreign currency obligations at BBplus a notch above Moodys Investors Service and Standard Poors cited concerns about fiscal policy privatisation and deterioration in foreign investment climate However economists speculated it could either be on account of Fitch adjusting its ratings in line with other global agencies or a fallout of US energy giant Enron Corps threat to exit an Indian power venture over payments problems Moodys and SP said on Friday they have not revised ratings or outlook but are disappointed with fiscal reform efforts Local currency and stock markets reacted nervously to the announcement but economists said most concerns were exaggerated When the direction of reforms is positive and government flows are improving the outlook should not change said Mohan Nagarajan chief

robust foreign investment the country has been receiving Enron was a bad deal made on unreasonable terms in the first place and does not reflect the ability of the government to pay its dues said an

in Singapore on Tuesday By Sriram Ramakrishnan Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited BOMBAY June Reuters Lenders to Enron Corps troubled Dabhol Power Company begin a twoday meeting in Singapore on Tuesday to try and settle differences over continued support to a controversial billion power project in India Representatives of some of the worlds largest banks like Citibank ABN AMRO and Bank of America will be at the meeting Indian lenders like the Industrial Development Bank of India State Bank of India and ICICI will also participate Market analysts speculate that the meeting will attempt to forge a joint stand on supporting the project which now produces MW of power and is slated to increase it to MW shortly in its second phase But it comes against a backdrop of rising tension between Dabhol and the Indian state utility the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB which is the sole buyer of Dabhols electricity Indian lenders who have lent the bulk of the funds to the plant want to continue supporting the project But they are being opposed by offshore lenders who want to withdraw their loans Loans of around million of the offshore lenders are covered by guarantees provided by Indian institutions The Indian lenders fearing for their profitability if the foreign banks pull the plug plan to oppose any such move But they have been forced on the backfoot by MSEBs decision last week to stop buying power from Dabhol and terminate its contract with the company under which it agreed to lift the entire output The MSEB has complained that Dabhol produces costly power while Dabhol has blamed MSEB for defaulting on payments worth million Last month Dabhol issued a preliminary notice to terminate its contract to sell power It has also filed for arbitration in London This provoked MSEB to haul Dabhol before a local regulatory body the Maharashtra State Electricity Regulatory Commission MERC which issued a temporary order staying the arbitration proceedings The dispute has already affected Indias image among foreign investors Last week global rating agency Moodys expressed concern over slippage in the Indian governments reform programme and cited the Enrons dispute as an example that the country may be losing credibility with foreign investors The dispute indicates that Indias government may not be willing to live up to its contractual obligations As a consequence this would further deter foreign direct investment from coming into the country Moodys said Indias federal Power Minister Suresh Prabhu tried to dispel those fears in an interview with Reuters on Sunday India is always in favour of making sure that international contracts are respected he said There is no need for concern Indian rupees Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved INDIA UPDATE Indias Prabhu says power reforms enter new phase By Clarence Fernandez Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited BOMBAY June Reuters Indias reforms of its sputtering power sector have entered a new phase with plans afoot to free up private supply overhaul debtridden state utilities and recraft tariffs Power Minister Suresh Prabhu told Reuters With investors fears fanned by a squabble between US energy giant Enron Corp and a local utility Prabhu said in an interview late on Sunday that India is standing behind international contracts Sanctity of contracts has to be kept Prabhu said The row began late last year when the utility in western Maharashtra state defaulted on payments of million to Dabhol Power Company percent owned by Enron The MW power project is Indias largest foreign investment at billion Prabhu has vowed to take Indian reforms in a new direction Absolutely he said in reply to a question whether Indias reforms have entered a different phase The Power Ministry will now also focus on power distribution he added besides its early preoccupation with generation needs In India unfortunately for the last yearsreforms policy was skewed in favour of generation he said We never really realised that distribution is the more important part of the process Prabhu added We have now decided we will make enough structural changes in distribution so that at the end of distribution enough investment is made CHARTERED ACCOUNTANT A chartered accountant Prabhu hails from the verdant regions of Indias western coastal strand and chaired a cooperative bank that was one of the countrys largest in terms of deposits before his foray into politics An errant lock of hair straying across his forehead Prabhu eschews the Indian politicians traditional uniform of starched white handspun cotton for the shirtsleeves and trousers preferred by the professionals who have entered government and whom local media call technocrats Prabhu said India has decided to allow private producers to sell power direct to consumers lifting curbs that have hobbled the countrys decadeold reform effort He said the question of power affordability had spurred him to ask Indias states to permit thirdparty sales of power which analysts have called a stumblingblock for foreign investment They cannot force a generator to sell power only to the SEBs and thats a major change we are trying to make Prabhu said referring to the states SEBs or state electricity boards are owned by the state governments and supply power to most of India India estimates that MW of fresh capacity will have to be installed over the next years to meet its power needs Most of the billion in funds that will be required will have to come from foreign private investment But Indias spotty reform record over the last decade has made investors wary Bureaucratic procedures legal delays and political wrangling have held up reform moves RATING REVISED TO NEGATIVE Last week global rating agency Fitch revised Indias sovereign rating outlook to negative from stable citing fiscal concerns the slow pace of privatisation and deterioration in the countrys foreign investment climate Competing agency Moodys sees signs of slippage in the reforms and Standard Poors has expressed worries over Indias budget deficit Prabhu said he wants to overhaul state power utilities by introducing standard accounting policies cutting transmission and distribution losses to percent and tackling crushing debt thus helping to lure foreign investment into the sector The poor financial health of the utilities expected to run up combined losses of about billion in the fiscal year has proved a hurdle in efforts to draw private investment Prabhu said an expert panel examining ways to restructure SEB finances looking at technical commercial and tariff issues is expected to report within a few weeks For the first time we will be preparing commercial data which is internationally accepted We will be preparing technical data which is internationally appreciable And thirdly well be creating an information base which will be created by experts and then made available to the states he said The utilities transmission and distribution losses run to up to percent of the electricity they generate compared to a figure of about eight percent internationally he said Prabhu wants to trim this to about percent within two or three years In the case of India I am willing to accept a figure of percent to percent because to bring it below that will be technically feasible but commercially unviable he added Other steps to tone up power generation include attempts to link the eastern region with the rest of India efforts to boost plant load factors through modernisation of equipment and to persuade people to use energy more efficiently Prabhu said he is building political will to support these moves through a programme to tell consumers why they can no longer get power

The Guardian web site Lagos in English Jun BBC Monitoringc BBC Text of article by Francis Obinor entitled Obasanjo chides Enron on Lagos power project published by Nigerian newspaper The Guardian web site on June For failing to live up to expectation of the Nigerian government and the people as regard its role in the Independent Power Project IPP initiated by the Lagos State government two years ago Enron the American firm got a hard knock from President Olusegun Obasanjo at the weekend June In his conclusion Obasanjo accused Enron a major player in the electricity project of poor performance and bad faith Ostensibly angry at the delay in the projects full takeoff and the MW recently connected to the national grid from the scheme the president on the American Cable News Network CNN declared Enron has played a dirty game on us Dirty game in two ways Beside putting up an exorbitant price the company according to the president also failed to comply with the terms of the contract Continuing Obasanjo said The price at which they Enron have tried to sell power to us has been very exorbitant Two what they told us they would do they have not done While refusing to disclose the firms charges Enron VicePresident of Marketing John Ambler said the primary objective of the company was to get the project on stream We have a project that is very close to coming on line he said stressing that the companys desire is to see the project work effectively in Nigeria especially in Lagos He added that Enron is committed to the IPP and assured Lagosians that they would soon begin to feel the impact The state government brought forward the June deadline it set for the commencement of the first phase of the project when it fired the first MW of electricity to the national grid two weeks ago At the Government House on May Governor Bola Tinubu said his administration and the contracting firm felt that there was no harm in bringing the date forward and assured that another MW would be added soon He noted that contrary to expectations that the project would cover the entire state at a go it would be in phases and the focus for now would be industrial consumption The concentration for now is not as private homes we would soon get there Tinubu assured The controversial IPP programme which the federal government had at one time been accused of frustrating has suffered several setbacks including Enrons initial plan to sell its shares to AES another American company Last April was originally fixed for the projects takeoff but the failure of Trevi a construction company in charge of transmitters caused a shift in the date Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved India India and Bush Administration Beyond assumptions Business Line The Hindu Copyright C Kasturi Sons Ltd KSL Source World Reporter TM Asia Intelligence Wire SOON after Mr George W Bush Jr won the US elections Indian observers proclaimed quickly that a Republican administration bodes good for India A Republican administration was expected to not pester India about human rights violations in Kashmir not force it to sign the CTBT and get tougher with China Mr George Bushs decision to drop by the External Affairs Minister Mr Jaswant Singhs meeting with the American National Security Advisor Ms Condoleezza Rice seemed to somehow confirm this false sense of euphoria This narrow thinking fails to understand the drivers of Republican ideology The reality is the Republicans care about a range of issues that will force the BJP Government to make some difficult decisions Take the first issue of human rights violations in Kashmir It is true there are many isolationists in the Republican Party who probably do not care about human rights violation in Kashmir so long as it does not affect them and is not happening in their backyard But there is another powerful force in Republican politics the religious wing This includes powerful members of the US Cabinet such as The AttorneyGeneral Mr John Ashcroft who are Christian fundamentalists Mr Bush himself claims to be a born again Christian The religious right is rarely interested in foreign policy it mostly concerns itself with moral and social issues such as abortion and teenage pregnancy But the few times it does intervene it is when it feels a country is persecuting Christians And when it does intervene no Republican administration dares cross it For instance China is periodically identified as a country that persecutes Christians Christian missionaries and ministers are routinely harassed and imprisoned because they are trying to spread their religion Because of this issue Republican members of the Christian right in Congress have all but declared a religious war on China routinely opposing any attempt to improve relations including trade relations with that country India as an emerging power is more carefully watched and frequently mentioned in the American press Stories of Christian missionaries being burnt alive and nuns raped are attributed to elements associated with the Hindu fundamentalist ruling party In its latest human rights report the US State Department noted these acts with concern The Popes mention of these issues to the Prime Minister Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee was also noted in the American press India is perhaps half a step away from being branded as a country that persecutes Christians A selfprofessed bornagain Christian like Mr George Bush would quickly take up the Christian rights cause trumping all other bilateral issues Human rights may not matter to the isolationists but Christian and to a lesser extent Jewish religious freedom matters tremendously to a Republican administration The second fallacy was that since the Republicans in Congress did not pass the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty they would not force other countries to pass the CTBT either But why are the Republicans are opposed to the CTBT The opponents of the CTBT feel that it fails to safeguard American security They frankly care little about Indian security They would love to be able to restrict Indias ability to test and use its weapons To them nuclear weapons not in American hands translates into an unsafe world Unless India manages to convince the Republicans otherwise the Republican administration is likely to tighten the antiproliferation screws on India The third fallacy relates to a tough longterm strategic realignment the Bush Administration will demand of India Mr Bushs foreign policymakers are unreconstructed Cold Warriors In the postCold War era they are desperately searching for an enemy They appear to have settled on China as the next enemy Their next step is to search for allies who rarely challenge their views Thinkers in Washington and New Delhi believe that India and the US are natural allies But such a decision has an enormous range of longterm consequences for India To discuss just a few Most of the Indian militarys equipment comes from Russia and the former Soviet Union Allying with the US will be seen by the Russians as abandoning them and this could have an enormous impact on the legacy military equipment Recent noises from the Foreign Ministry suggest India is also eager about Mr George Bushs proposed missile defence programme But this technology is far from proven and during the decade over which it may be developed if it gets past Congress China will most certainly develop many nuclear weapons These may primarily be a deterrent against the US but it will force India into an arms buildup it can barely afford The Americans are reserving their missile defence system for their closest allies India today is neither fish nor fowl not quite a threat but not quite an ally either It is unlikely that India will be able to convince the Americans to give it the defence system Even if the Americans agree to sell it to India it could never afford the sticker price So before it rejoices at the notion of antiChina hawks in the White House let India ponder over the unexamined consequences The final issue is one that may precipitate in the very near term Enron and Maharashtra find themselves in a dispute that neither wants to lose and that appears to be rapidly getting shriller Mr George Bushs background is as a Texas oilman and he is widely accused in the US of being beholden to the interests of the energy industry In fact they were among the biggest contributors to his campaign The Enron Chairman Mr Kenneth Lay is a friend of Mr Bushs and was seriously considered for a job in his Cabinet He is so well connected that he was recently accused of influencing who is appointed by the White House to regulate the energy industry In the near term Mr Bush could quite possibly lean heavily on New Delhi to make sure that Enrons interests are not neglected If New Delhi does not respond to his satisfaction his opinion of India and consequently his administrations dealings with the country are likely to be coloured far more than we think Giridhar Srinivasan Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved Enrons Indian Creditors Seek to Salvage Dabhol Project New York

will move the two way so i can try simulating actual market cicumstances From David nronXgate on AM To John CT cc Savita nronXgate Subject John You might recall we spoke a few weeks ago about a system with more intelligence for outofhours trading than just leaving the products on Last Trade is Mid Attached is a suggestion for how such a system might work It builds on Offset to Last Trade functionality The simplified description is It tracks two variables IntensitySpeed and Bias Buy or Sell emphasis As Intensity increases the Spread increases As Bias increases the Offset increases Ill call later to see what you think of the idea Dave Program Criteria The formula which defines the trading decisionmaking program will need to work with several criteriainputsdefinitions These might be Intensity Speed The average time between transaction attempts regardless of whether they are buys or sells Measured as a moving average over the last Intensity Factor transactions by comparing the timestamp of the transaction Tibco messages for the Product Obviously the lower the Intensity calculation the higher the transaction flow Therefore a high Intensity number indicates low transaction flow Intensity Factor The number of transactions to be included in the moving average Intensity calculation A possible value for this might be Buys The number of Buys which have occurred Sells The number of Sells which have occured Transaction Count Could be either Buys or Sells whichever last occured Buy Offset The Offset value which will be applied if a Buy occurs Sell Offset The Offset value which will be applied if a Sell occurs Offset Reversion Ratio ORR The amount by which the Buy Offset should be reduced if a Sell occurs or amount Sell Offset should be reduced if a Buy occurs A possible value for this might be If the application of the ORR results in a reduction of less than then the reduction shall be Transaction Reversion Ratio TRR The amount by which Buys should be reduced if a Sell occurs or amount Sells should be reduced if a Buy occurs A possible value for this might be If the application of the TRR results in a reduction of less than then the reduction shall be equal to Spread Minimum The minimum Spread value allowed A possible value for this might be Spread Maximum The maximum Spread value allowed A possible value for this might be Offset Minimum The minimum Offset allowed for both Buys and Sells A possible value for this might be Offset Maximum The maximum offset allowed for both Buys and Sells A possible value for this might be Initial Offset The Buy and Sell Offset used when the program is started Initial Spread The Spread used when the program is started SpreadOffset Minimum The minimum amount by which Spread must exceed Offset Prevents a possible arbitrage opportunity for the customer A possible value for this might be Dead Interval The period of time which must pass before the program will recalculate the above Criteria if no transactions have taken place during the Dead Interval A possible value for this might be seconds Program Outputs The program should output the following variables as a result of combining the above Criteria in a userdefined Formula Spread integer as per current Stack Manager Offset integer as per current Stack Manager Suspension boolean Whether or not the Product should be suspended Normally False Program Interface and Operation Principles The user should be provided with a GUI which will allow them to define a relationship among the above Criteria which will produce and apply the Outputs to a particular Product This relationship would be defined with Intensity Formulas and Transaction Formulas Every time a Transaction occurs or a Dead Interval passes the Criteria will be recalculated and the userdefined formulas will be reviewed by the program If a Dead Interval passes without any transactions taking place then Intensity Intensity and BuysBuysTRR and SellsSellsTRR and Buy Offset Buy Offset ORR and Sell Offset Sell Offset ORR If the userdefined Formulas see following indicate that a change in spread should occur then if the Offset is zero in the case of a trade occurring or if no trade has occured during the passing of a Dead Interval the system shall perform a Last Trade is Mid calculation around the last transaction adjusting the buy and sell prices according to the new Spread value Any adjustment to the Spread shall respect the SpreadOffset Minimum If a reduction in the Spread should violate the SpreadOffset Minimum then the Buy Offset or Sell Offset or both as appropriate shall be reduced accordingly Similarly if the Offset is increased by a Transaction Formula to a level greater than the Spread the Spread shall be increased to maintain the SpreadOffset Minimum GUIFormulas Example Constants Intensity Factor Dead Interval Offset Reversion Ratio ORR Transaction Reversion Ratio TRR Spread Minimum Spread Maximum Offset Minimum Offset Maximum SpreadOffset Minimum INPUTS OUTPUTS Intensity Formula Formula Intensity Spread Offset Suspension S na F S na F S na F Transaction Formula Formula Transactions Spread Offset Suspension V na F V na F V F V F V F V na na T Note that Transactions would be Buys or Sells as appropriate Note also that Buys and Sells are not intended to be an absolute count but rather are a moving measure of the number of buys or sells which have recently occured In this example all Constants and Formulae are editable by the user through the GUI Simulation Obviously if we want to proceed we will want to conduct several simulations to prove concepts and evaluate responsiveness However to give some idea of how the above might work when a market starts to run in a particular direction please see the attached Additional Features System Notifications There should be two kinds of notifications for the Robotrader which will be similar to Stack Manager Garbage Checks Warning and Failure levels for both Offset and Price The warning levels will trigger a pager message The Failure levels will trigger a pager message and the product will be automatically suspended The Price checks will be against prices input by the trader not relative price movements but actual price There should be both maximum and minimum price checks eg gas is trading at The notification levels could be at the top end and at the bottom end Offset checks will only be against a maximum value Dave

NRONcom Sent Friday July AM To Arnold John Subject RE first of all okay seriously you make good points on the intervention front however i do believe that the euro has suffered from public neglect from the ecb that said im unsure what form an intervention would take money flow i agree that there has been good money flow into us from Japan Japan through Europe and Europe usd is a good safe haven because if we have troubles US should outperform and the EU is untested this is why i am uninterested in shorting the dollar the euro has also suffered from a japanese overhang when the euro was first released japanese bot up the euro with the expectation that other countries would convert some of their reserves into the euro this has not been the case and japan has been puking out their position however there is a belief that the selling is over though im not sure when this played out or how to check this story havent found measure for money flow oh bloomberg how i miss thee so i guess i still like it but who knows im probably the mullet retail investor that gets run over the currency market is very efficient pookums me thinks the currency market has seen enough failed interventions that it shrugs off any intervention and may view it as a sign of weakness me also thinks that until foreigners quit plowing all their money into the US the dollar should remain fairly strong however if all the hedge funds are short which i assume they would be the turnaround will be very quick Original Message From Eva Pao ENRON mailtoIMCEANOTESEvaPaoCepaombaEhbsEeduE NRONcom Sent Thursday July AM To Arnold John Subject thanks but i took macroecon also im not a proponent of open market interventions i am merely saying that its on the ecb radar screen and that measures will be taken to remedy

Arnold John mailto Sent Thursday July AM To Subject RE okay heres what i got on the euro Im big seller of interventions they tend not to work if the gas market wants to go lower enron coming out and buying contracts is not going to stop the market from going down maybe in the short term but thats it same with currencies ECB can come out and transfer some of its foreign reserves from dollars to Euros but they are limited by their currency reserves unless they want to act in the futures market at which point they have to exit that position at some point i think it is more psychological than anything i think overall market interventions have been extremely ineffective Original Message From Eva Pao ENRON mailtoIMCEANOTESEvaPaoCepaombaEhbsEeduE NRONcom Sent Wednesday July PM To John Arnold Subject okay heres what i got on the euro Here is a bio on my Business Govt Intl Economy prof He gave a presentation on the stuff he did for the European Central Bank the other day He reviewed why historically everyone looks to germany ie Bubba as a proxy for determining monetary policy in Europe Moreover he explained why exchange rates were the focal point in determining monetary policy in Germany With the new ECB the bank heads are explicitly trying to remove public focus on exchange rates However this effort may have led to the belief by the financial community that the ECB does not care about will not defend the euro He then stated that this is not true So Im thinking that downside is limited The performance of the euro has not gone unnoticed especially given the critical EU goal of inflation pa ep Bio Huw Pill is an Assistant Professor of Business Administration at the Graduate School of Business Administration Harvard University where he teaches the first year required MBA course Business Government and the International Economy Having attended University College he received an undergraduate degree in Politics Philosophy and Economics from the University of Oxford

economist in the Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy Group of the Bank of Englands Economics Division He has also worked at the International Monetary Fund in Washington DC Professor Pills current research has two dimensions On the one hand he is investigating the formulation and conduct of monetary policy in advanced economies with a focus on the implementation of the single monetary policy in the euro area On the other hand he is studying the role of financial liberalization and innovation on macroeconomic fluctuations The latter project focuses on the interaction between international

there was zero power gen demand the easy answer is that pipes were short and everybody playing catchup from this week fine whats it going to trade next week the gas daily swap implies flat but its lagged the actual spread all month i think cash surprises by trading positive next week with no power gen this market is not trading like we run out of injection space so either the market is wrong maybe but a dangerous assumption to make or I dont see why sep is so overvalued relative to the rest of the curve you can certainly argue that the winter and cal are too high but those certainly dont seem to be going down very fast march is off cents since jun so if the market wants to say that march is worth then why is sep too high at Original Message From Lafontaine Steve ENRON

boring tired of my apartment tired of my girlfriends a few more weeks like this and Ill be tired of my job need something to juice up my life vacation was good took a few days in belize to get certified for scuba very cool then a weeklong finance class at wharton good to learn something new for a change very few views of the market here not sure that all the bearishness is not already built into the market problem is the bearish sentiment is still tremendously pervasive everybody everybody everybody is short but wants a rally to to sell more just not sure what the downside target is cash isnt behaving like were gonna run out of injection space in october if i owned a proprietary storage field and thought wed approach shutins in late oct and be at a much lower level i either would not inject now or better yet id withdraw now to have room for all that gas later but hell the cash market is trading over prompt not just because its hot its been doing so for about weeks now thus i could in fact the storage economics tell me i should withdraw gas or definitely not inject so i could have flexibility later something doesnt add up the spec market is convinced were going to shut in but the phys market is not telling the same story so lets assume were not at shutins or have trouble placing gas in october is the market overpriced dont think it necessarily is considering the winter will have a risk premium associated with it regardless of the fundamentals after last winter until we get the first weather forecast of the winter i think we could stay at this price level for a while and then have the next move down late oct early nov when people try to withdraw gas and nobody wants it i think it was in when the first weeks of nov were injection can you imagine going into dec with but if there is injection capabililty through oct and the winter is going to stay relatively high due to risk premium how far are the storage spreads going to widen biggest position right now is short jv and short a ton of u vol producers are waiting for any move up in cal to give it a spanking falling back in love with longer term gas though think and spreads are golden thoughts Original Message From Lafontaine Steve ENRON Sent Fri PM To Cc Subject HEY JOHNNY how it goes my man its all good here finally getting settled into my personal lifegot the family moved in the new house etc john paul was up this past weekend and he came over to my place to sy hi good guyhas a cool chicive been meaning to email you but as always busy as hell i had dinner with bo collins last nite and a few cocktailsfunny to see him changing roles i enjoy talking to him but hes being quite the diplomat now seems the new role fits him actually and he seems to be enjoying itstill hard for me to believe hes not gonna miss trading hows businesslife and the vaca what are your thos ont he mkt demand has come back a great deal but im not sure its gonna helpmaybe too little too late ive been trading this a little mroe actively now that the mkts been leaning mosrtly one say but fortuntely sold early in the week on the rally before the agaand afterbiggest problem for muchlower prices in the short term is it seems now the whole mkt has the same supply and demand view but if we can believe that production is up which seems to be the implication well have no problm moving about tcf basis doeeconomic growth will be at best flat to last year thru and id say that means the winter will struggle to get much bullishnessie our biggest concievable draw would be in the order of tcfleaves us around tcf end march hard to get too excited about that sprds not much of cluei tend to think inverses cont to errode like febaprbut maybe not until mkt gives up on winter prepensity for us to stay contango maybe acceleratesthat this year you think we get to shut in levels since so much prod growth appears to be from independents does that raise the avg shut in value from say to or higher anywaybe coolhope all

have told her that many times in not so many words My life is a Seinfeld episode She reminded me of an incident when energy guy met some of my friends from work and every time he started to control the conversation I would talk over him because I was embarrassed of what he might say Im seriously going to he How mean am I Anyway we share the same viewpoint on relationships I KNOW I get pickier as I get older Not only do you know more about what you want you know a hell of a lot more about what you dont want and what you are and are not able to tolerate Im so different than I was at Its hilarious how much you put up with when your really young Relationships should be easy ESPECIALLY in the first year Thats why I know I need to do something about my situation soon We have way too many issues for and a half months Are you kidding me Family One brother and goes to U of H Not graduate school Hes still working on a bachelor degree Hes a whole conversation in itself I love him to death but he still has so much growing up to do He acts like hes instead of Mom and Dad still live down in Lake Jackson Dads remarried and Mom just got her second divorce Ask me why Im scared of being in bad relationships Ha The grandparents of whom Im incredible close to live in LJ as well I usually make it down there every other Sunday as there health is fading and it breaks my heart They are touch old birds though Cute as hell and have been married years I know Amazing Well lets see Oh no way you are funnier than me Well see I will write your cell down Im kind of panicking because I cant find

do So what would he do if his girlfriend told bad jokes Yea thats a setup Okcompletely understand about you not calling last night Wasnt really expecting you to The guy that first told me that the wtc had been bombed calls me his special little guy even though hes only a couple years older You can be my special little email pal for the time being Do you want to hear my theory on relationships Tough youre going to I broke up with my last girlfriend because it just wasnt right She was and she gave me the you may not think its perfect but its as good as it gets and as you get older you will realize that it doesnt get any better than this and therefore youre stupid to break this off speech You know the one Maybe Im young and naive but Im still looking for perfect Not willing to settle just cause Im growing older If anything I think I get more picky because I know more what I want Alright enough relationship theory talk Lets talk math A fight over chex mix Thats impressive Wish I could have been a fly on the wall for that one Quit picking out all of the pretzels me youre the one eating all the wheat chex Who won It was the same pic in different formats Its my work pr pic pretty dorkyheh

would probably be doing the same I appreciate that since I havent really been smiling much the past two days Well the fact that Im smiling reassures me that its probably not a good idea that I call you yet I hope you understand Its just that I have been seeing the energy guy for three and a half months now and we are exclusive and I have to put myself in his shoes The ironic thing about this Vegas trip was it was supposed to be in my mind a test of some sort Ive been telling my friends that I would wait it out until Vegas to make a decision on whether or not to continue seeing him I guess its kind of hard to talk about this on email but I just dont think its right yet to call you I know that is probably as ridiculous as it sounds but for some reason I dont feel guilty about just having you as my email buddy As mentioned above the fact that Im smiling about your invitation to call tells me that Im probably more interested than I should be at this point considering Im seeing someone I have to tell you that I laugh more at your emails than I have in awhile and that our humor completely mindless is very similar Im enjoying getting to know you this way for now I hope you understand and who knows maybe Ill feel different about it in a few days I dont know The one thing I do know is Ive got to make some decisions about this relationship deal pretty soon because its not fair to him I dont know what my problem is with this one In the past year since my last relationship I rarely go out with anyone more than once or twice Twodatedananice nickname my wonderful friends gave me and I know somethings not right Maybe Im just too picky and maybe thats part of the reason Ive stayed in this one longer Giving it a chance so to speak I mean hes a great guy but something is just missing and I cant put my finger on it We argue I dont argue Im like the most laid back person ever and we argue over NOTHING Communication barriers mostly Yesterday we had a fight over a bag of chex mix in the midst of a national tragedy Somethings wrong with this picture I dont know Heres an even more ridiculous hang up I have Hes not as funny as me How ridiculous is that I seriously think I need to see someone I dont think his jokes are funny and how do you break up with someone over that Okay Ive probably said enough to scare you away from even being my email friend for now but Im just kind of typing what Im thinking Responding to your messagehow old is your brother No sisters Are your parents divorced I couldnt remember where Jackson Hole was so I went to the website Looks so awesome Lets

Spoke sman Review Kaiser netted more than million from the sales Other a luminum companies reselling power from BPA reached agreements during spring with Bonneville Under these agreements the companies agreed to keep smelters off line to keep power supplies ample in the region and BPA agre ed in return to give the smelters when they restarted operations a per megawatthour MWh credit for obtaining power from sources other than BPA Months of wrangling produced a contract between Kaiser and the BPA tha t negates a takeorpay clause that would require Kaiser to pay for the f ederal power whether used or not BPA said Under the agreement signed tod ay Kaiser will avoid the possibility of paying damages if it does not take all the power under the contractAnd if BPA cant resell it we are no t going to hold Kaiser liable for the difference Clearing Up reported As a concession for the elimination of the takeorpay clause Kaiser wil l receive interruptible service from the BPA on some of its MW load Ka iser received criticism from union groups who claimed that the company was using the money it had gained reselling power to pay down longterm debt rebuild a refinery in Louisiana and

Watch Negative senior unsecured debt BBB subordinated debt BBB preferred stock BBB and commercial paper F Pipeline subsidiary A rated senior unsecured debt at Northern Natural Gas Co and Transwestern Pipeline Co are also placed on Rating Watch Negative The rating action primarily relates to the negative capital market reaction to recent disclosures by the company The loss of investor and counterparty confidence if it continues would impair Enrons financial flexibility and access to capital markets therefore impacting its ability to conduct its business On Oct Enron announced a billion aftertax charge to earnings to be taken in the third quarter of and a reduction of balance sheet equity by billion relating to the unwinding of structured transactions Since that time there have been several damaging news reports on the company and its management More importantly investors have voiced concerns Enrons common stock price has plummeted and spreads on its debt have widened The company has attempted to quell rumors and has publicly stated that it has adequate liquidity to conduct its business Approximately billion of unused liquidity is available under committed bank lines An additional concern is that certain structured transactions of the company including Marlin Water Trust II and Osprey could unwind While various sources of repayment exist such as the sale or liquidation of underlying assets or an equity offering primary credit support is derived from the Enron obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock if an amount sufficient to repay the notes has not been deposited with the trustee days prior to the maturity date or upon a note trigger event In the event that the issuance of the preferred stock yields less than the amount required to redeem the senior notes in either case Enron is required to deliver additional shares If Enron cannot or does not deliver on its obligation then the amount of the deficiency becomes a payment obligation of Enron representing a general unsecured claim While trigger events include a downgrade of Enrons senior unsecured debt below investment grade by one of the major rating agencies in conjunction with specified declines in Enrons closing stock price over three consecutive trading days Enron would have a forebearance period of days as long as an attempt was being made to register the shares The total amount of Marlin and Osprey debt is approximately billion Enron has not verified that the underlying assets have adequate market value to fully pay down the associated debt While capital market uncertainties have escalated Fitch has no information to indicate that there are any fundamental problems with Enrons core wholesale retail and pipeline businesses Fitch expects to be

because Enron which accounts for about a quarter of the trade in the countrys power and gas markets has seen its share price fall by a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial structure Moodys has put Enrons credit on watch for possible downgrade and some of the companys debt is trading like junk bonds in the secondary market this week We have made no changes to our credit policy concerning Enron said John Sousa chief spokesmann for Dynegy Inc DYN Its business as usual Williams Cos WMB spokesman Jim Gipson said that his company too has made no changes and has no concerns about Enrons credit Another Top power and gas trading company Aquila ILA has also left Enron credit unchanged Other companies expressed concern though theyve taken little if any action Like everyone else in the marketplace were proceeding with caution said Lora Kinner director of credit for Tractebel Energy Marketing the North American subsidiary of the Belgian company Tractebel SA Kinner said the company is just looking for more information and doesnt expect to make any drastic changes Calif Guarantees Allow Williams To Book Power Revenues By Andrew Dowell Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc NEW YORK Dow Jones Clarifications by California as to what electricity transactions the state will back enabled Williams Cos WMB to book million in power sales from the previous period as thirdquarter revenues the company said Thursday The revenues came from power Williams sold through the California Independent System Operator which runs the states wholesale power market and clears and settles transactions The state of California has paid more than billion for power bought directly from suppliers but has yet to pay for any ISO power since it took over the job of buying power for the states ailing utilities in midJanuary Two weeks ago however the state made clear for the first time which ISO transactions it would back Its that fact that has allowed us for the first time to recognize dollars from sales to the California ISO Williams Chief Operating Officer Steven Malcolm said on a conference call Wednesday Williams reported thirdquarter net income of million on revenues of billion up from million on revenues of billion in the same period the year before Williams is now in talks with California to secure payment for its ISO sales The process is complicated by the states role as guarantor of transactions undertaken on behalf of the utilities which arent creditworthy enough to buy power for themselves The ISO didnt envision thirdparty guarantors when it set up its settlement process and state accounting rules require more detailed bills than those sent out by the ISO each month state power officials have said The state says it has set aside billion to cover ISO transactions As reported suppliers including Williams had charged the state with deliberately muddling the repayment issue to keep power flowing for free Willing To Renegotiate Separately Williams officers also said the company was willing to discuss reworking its longterm contracts with California provided the result benefited both parties California Gov Gray Davis is under heavy fire for having locked the state into contracts running as long as years at prices negotiated at the peak of a market that has since collapsed Both sides could potentially benefit from changes to the length of the term of the contracts or the specifics of powersupply obligations perhaps freeing up supply that Williams thinks it could get more money for on the spot market Malcolm said Were always willing to sit down with a customer Malcolm said Williams hasnt been approached by the state to renegotiate the contracts Malcolm said Any attempt by California to force through onesided changes is unlikely and could backfire for the state by disrupting plans for new power plants he said To the extent contracts are changed financing is going to go away he said Downplaying Enron Opportunities Williams downplayed its ability to capitalize on the recent troubles of marketleader Enron Corp ENE saying it focuses on large longterm structured deals not the highvolume physicalmarket transactions that Enron dominates Malcolm said Also TradeSpark the Internetbased energy exchange in which Williams is a partner is limited for now in its ability to expand and take volume from Enrons proprietary system EnronOnline because of the horrific losses operator Cantor Fitzgerald XCFZ suffered in the attacks on the World Trade Center Thats interrupted the rapid growth we were seeing Williams Chief Executive Keith Bailey said on the call Enron which accounts for about a quarter of the trade in the countrys power and gas markets and which makes a market for those commodities on EnronOnline has seen its share price fall by a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial structure Those concerns have raised questions about the business model of EnronOnline a platform on which Enron is the counterparty in all trades Those concerns could eventually boost volume on neutral exchanges like TradeSpark We continue to believe in the neutral platform that TradeSpark offers Malcolm said TradeSpark LP was formed by eSpeed Inc ESPD Cantor Fitzgerald XCFZ Shell RD unit Coral Energy Dominion D Koch Energy Trading Inc TXU Corps

Kernen whats going on Joe Kernen coanchor Weve got to shift gears into this Enron situation which has just beenyouve been talking about it quite a bit Davidhow could you not talk about it Seventysix million shares yesterday down fifty percent in the last two weeks This is a company withwhata hundred million in revenues James Cramer guest market commentator Maybe Kernen Yeah right Anyone who does any trading in energy apparently you know uses Enron Online so anything that destabilizes Enron to a great extent could destabilize the whole energy trading arena and Cramer Go ahead say it Say what youre thinking No one has said it yet We know the truth We believe that Enron caused a national short squeeze They knew every single number in this gas situation They wrecked the California utility system and profited from it Thats my bet My bet that thisthey hadlook they were the market maker Imagine if Instinet knew what you were going to be buying and took it ahead of you I think they cornered the market for electricity for about four months made a huge fortune and now the company is unraveling and when someonewhen the Justice Department gets in there were going to discover this Kernen Lets see what happened Haines Now wait a second David Faber coanchor Whoa whoa whoa The Justice Department Jim Now is that new Is that something Cramer No that would be if I were a prosecutor something Faber OK so they are not being investigated Cramer Well no Im actually being a little forward thinking Kernen The SEC wants documents about the limited partnership transactions of Mr Faber Which is very different from what Jim is talking about Cramer No Im saying that this is what if I were an enterprising prosecutor I would say Did we have a nationwide short squeeze in electricity caused by one company that had access to all the screens and knew exactly what was happening with the electricity market which then wrecked the California utility system cost the consumer billions of dollars and is now being hushed up Kernen Well lets talk about the actual news Heres yesterdays trading Haines Wait a minute Kernen Well I just want to say that the guy is gone now Thats the new news here Did you readdid you know that Fastow after four Faber Late yesterday Kernen Yeah after four oclock Fastow is gone Whats interesting Faber Hes the CFO Kernen But hes a new CFO Faber who benefitted personally from some of these off balance sheet partnerships Cramer Mark you know Im not on thin ice here Im not on thin ice Haines I just want to make sure we understand that this is your theory Cramer This is my theory Haines OK Cramer It is just a theory It is my opinion But I think weve got to find out more about that short squeeze that occurred Haines OK Cramer We need to find out whether it was orchestrated Kernen The new CFO might help regain some credibility for the company because he was the old treasurer who left that position a year or so ago because of some disagreements with how Mr Fastow was doing business apparently So now hes back as CFO and well whether that calms the market down Faber Well what they need to do Joe they need to come clean I mean that is what all the investors in Enron and those whove left the company as investors over this last week have wanted Lets see everything be as transparent as you possibly can be tell us exactly what we need to know And as much as they need to come clean with their investors they need to come clean with their trading counterparties because that is really what people are concerned about Kernen Why is the credit worthiness issue such a big deal Anyone who does trading with them if their credit worthiness were to goif their credit rating were to go down how would that affect energy trading Faber Well you want to know that theyre going to be there on the other side and make good on the trades Kernen I guess you would wouldnt you Faber Right Not that they arent but why would youif you can trade with seven other guysseven other companies maybe you cut back a little bit on your exposure there Kernen Now why would Faber And that would hurt their core business Kernen Why are people expecting some type of action from the credit agencies not because of the stock price right Because of something that could unravel Faber Because of something related to these liabilities they may have Kernen That they dont know about at this point Faber that they may have with regard to funding some of these off balance sheet partnerships that they backstopped in terms of borrowing that went on at the project level at the off balance sheet partnership Will it be a liability They dont know But thats one of the reasons Kernen Were talking hundreds of millions or billions Faber They dont know Kernen But there were billions of dollars in limited partners Faber Yes About three billion in financing I think is what some analysts estimated Kernen This is a pretty big number Faber Yeah they can get to most of that with the assets that they have in the partnerships themselves Kernen I use a six month chart to show whats happened over the last two weeks You got to look at here But if we went back a year youd see eighty as far as the high for Enron Now were at sixteen Faber Everybody else took a hit yesterday Dynegy got hurt Kernen Well I got Dynegy next Dont Here we go Faber Im sorry Im getting a little excited Kernen You are Faber Enthusiastic about your charts Kernen Theres a weekly chart of Dynegy and you know whats coming next dont you Now Im worried about the utility average Ive worried about the transportation average a lot in my career Mark now the utilities have replaced my worries Im angstridden Did you see this chart Were breaking below the Cramer Thats a positive not a negative Joe Kernen Whats wrong with Cramer today What happened Cramer Im all fired up Faber He really is My God hes got the DOJ getting all crazy the FBI the CIA You going down to Enyou going down to Houston yourself Cramer I may just have to I may have to clean up that whole city Kernen Jim why would thethats thenow getting down to the lows I mean the other averages have come back quite a bit from the postattack lows the utilities are retesting those Thats not something to worry about Cramer No because I think theres a lot of money going into more cyclical issues I think the economy is showing signs of getting better The consumer is certainly much stronger than we thought The base book didnt say the corporate was strong but the consumer is strong Much stronger than before Kernen All right In the past people have worried about the utility averages being a leading indicator though I dontwere talking about four hundred to twoninety at this point Thats a long way Cramer This average has got a lot of problems to it but I still think that Kernen Its no longer the Cramer you sell this as safety We dont want safety as much as we want a little bit more reciprocality

York The following is a transcript of a report aired Wednesday by CNBC reporte r David Faber Enron is in discussions with Dynegy about a range of options that include a merger of the two companies While such an outcome is only one of a number of options being discussed sources close to the talks tell me such an outcome is being considered Enron is trying to raise equity capital and restore confidence amid the complete collapse of its stock price Today the Houstonbased energy trading concerns shares have fallen anot her while its bonds perhaps a better barometer of the markets concerns a bout credit quality have shed roughly ten points Enron will not comment But sources close to the situation tell me the company continues to speak with a handful of private equity firms about an investment Those talks are still in the early stages Talks with Dynegy a crosstown rival of Enrons that also markets and tr ades energy have progressed at a faster pace Dynegy is unlike Enron in that it owns more hard assets many of which ca me along with the acquisition of Illnova completed in While many potential acquirers have shied away from Enron due to continue d concern about unknown liabilities the company may have Dynegy is very fami liar with its energy trading business Dynegy is the number two player in the US energy trading market and wou ld clearly become the dominant player were it to merge with or acquire Enron A Dynegy spokesman declined comment While Dynegy has offbalance sheet financings that are similar to Enrons those financings are not guaranteed by the parent It is such guarantees that have concerned Enron investors along with a se ries of questionable investments Given the massive decline in Enrons stock price Dynegy now has a market value that is twice that of Enron That decline in Enrons stock price would make any equity infusion heavil y dilutive if private equity firms were to choose to invest in Enron they wo uld likely do so in the form of a security that converted to equity and paid a dividend Still because Enron now has a market value of only billion the rou ghly billion it may want represents an enormous percentage of its overall equ ity value Hence discussion with Dynegy may have taken on the form of a merger rat her than a strategic investment Enron in Talks With Dynegy That May Include Merger CNBC Says New York Houston Nov

Proceeds from the notes were to be used to acquire the Trusts initial investments and buyers are to be paid interest from the proceeds of those certain assets according to an offering memorandum The Trusts can invest in securities with shortterm ratings of at least A from SP and P from Moodys Investors Service as long as they mature before the maturity dates of the notes There are four notes each divided into two offerings some offered publicly and some privately sold All the notes are scheduled to mature in August or May and were sold by a group of banks led by Salomon Smith Barney a unit of Citigroup In the event of an Enron credit event Citibank which acted as a swap counterparty to the trusts can take the trusts investments in return for Enron debt obligations The Enron debt is then liquidated by the trust with the proceeds paid to the investors Neither Enron nor Citibank have direct obligations to the holders of the notes according to an offering memorandum Enrons creditlinked notes utilize a creditdefault swap that the trusts have with Citibank that references Enrons senior unsecured debt so the rating on the creditlinked notes will reflect the senior unsecured rating SP said in a report Liz Goldenberg and Terence Flanagan in the New York Former SEC Chairman Levitt Transcript of Interview New York THE FOLLOWING IS AN UNOFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT BLOOMBERG LP DOES NOT GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY OF THIS TRANSCRIPT New York Nov Bloomberg The following is a transcript of a Bloomberg interview with Former Securities and Exchange Commission SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt The reporter is Dylan Ratigan RATIGAN As youve probably heard Enron under investigation by the SEC the SEC looking into partnerships run by their former CFO If you come into the Bloomberg with me I want to show you what its done to the stock price here over the course of the past month month and a half Youre talking about a move from a price in the mid s which was not that long ago mind you early mid October to a price that is now a share This has absolutely decimated the companys stock price Arthur Levitt the former chairman of the SEC with us looking first of all at whats going on with this company But before I do that let me say good morning to you LEVITT Good morning Dylan RATIGAN Talk to me LEVITT You know there are certain warning signs here that investors have to be careful of related party transactions Anytime you see a related party transaction an investor should be very careful What they were doing was they were simply setting up these partnerships to move off the balance sheet acquisitions and borrowings that would really have hurt the balance sheet and I think given investors a very different picture RATIGAN Well lets just make it real clear to people because they can easily get confused Im a company LEVITT Yes RATIGAN and I create and Im an executive of that company and I create a partnership that has nothing to do with that company legally on paper LEVITT But all the risks and rewards still belong to the parent company The affect of this is the subsidiary borrows the money to make the acquisition from another partnership set up by the parent This stays totally off the balance sheet of the parent company Why does this happen RATIGAN So in other words Company ABC exists they set up Subsidiary LEVITT Yes RATIGAN Subsidiary company borrows money from LEVITT To make an acquisition RATIGAN A bank LEVITT No RATIGAN They borrow money from who LEVITT They issue bonds RATIGAN OK They borrow money from the world LEVITT Yes RATIGAN whoever wants to lend them money LEVITT Yes RATIGAN they borrow money they make an acquisition Now Subsidiary down here has big debts that dont reflect upstairs on Company ABC LEVITT Precisely RATIGAN But ABC still gets to use the asset that was bought by LEVITT Yes RATIGAN OK LEVITT Exactly Now how does it happen The accounting firm that handled this transaction Arthur Andersen received million for an audit of the company thats a huge amount and million for consulting services another danger sign A lot of dough Those consulting services were to validate these transactions million dollars went to the accountants The problem here is an audit committee was not doing its work If you look at Enrons statements and how many times have we heard they were confusing Its the job of the auditing firm to see to it that it is not confusing Thats the real problem Now what can you do about it RATIGAN Tell me LEVITT I think actually the FASB the independent standards setter could put through a rule which says RATIGAN And FASB is the Federal Accounting Standards Board They set the rules LEVITT Yes Located in Norwalk Connecticut They could say if a company sets up another legal entity and the company retains all the risks and rewards of that entity then the public company that public company that set up these entities must consolidate in the PL in the balance sheet all of these transactions Now how does that come about I think the SEC could urge the FASB to do this In the present chief accountant of the SEC called for that action to be taken place but at that point the thenchief accountant didnt support the move RATIGAN And this creates in your mind a rallying call to reiterate that request with more venom and more passion than before LEVITT I dont know about venom but I RATIGAN But with passion LEVITT I certainly think that passion I think this is clearly a call for better disclosure RATIGAN Fair enough I will see you next week OK LEVITT Good Nice to see you RATIGAN You too END

move the two way so i can try simulating actual market cicumstances From David nronXgate on AM To John CT cc Savita nronXgate Subject John You might recall we spoke a few weeks ago about a system with more intelligence for outofhours trading than just leaving the products on Last Trade is Mid Attached is a suggestion for how such a system might work It builds on Offset to Last Trade functionality The simplified description is It tracks two variables IntensitySpeed and Bias Buy or Sell emphasis As Intensity increases the Spread increases As Bias increases the Offset increases Ill call later to see what you think of the idea Dave Program Criteria The formula which defines the trading decisionmaking program will need to work with several criteriainputsdefinitions These might be Intensity Speed The average time between transaction attempts regardless of whether they are buys or sells Measured as a moving average over the last Intensity Factor transactions by comparing the timestamp of the transaction Tibco messages for the Product Obviously the lower the Intensity calculation the higher the transaction flow Therefore a high Intensity number indicates low transaction flow Intensity Factor The number of transactions to be included in the moving average Intensity calculation A possible value for this might be Buys The number of Buys which have occurred Sells The number of Sells which have occured Transaction Count Could be either Buys or Sells whichever last occured Buy Offset The Offset value which will be applied if a Buy occurs Sell Offset The Offset value which will be applied if a Sell occurs Offset Reversion Ratio ORR The amount by which the Buy Offset should be reduced if a Sell occurs or amount Sell Offset should be reduced if a Buy occurs A possible value for this might be If the application of the ORR results in a reduction of less than then the reduction shall be Transaction Reversion Ratio TRR The amount by which Buys should be reduced if a Sell occurs or amount Sells should be reduced if a Buy occurs A possible value for this might be If the application of the TRR results in a reduction of less than then the reduction shall be equal to Spread Minimum The minimum Spread value allowed A possible value for this might be Spread Maximum The maximum Spread value allowed A possible value for this might be Offset Minimum The minimum Offset allowed for both Buys and Sells A possible value for this might be Offset Maximum The maximum offset allowed for both Buys and Sells A possible value for this might be Initial Offset The Buy and Sell Offset used when the program is started Initial Spread The Spread used when the program is started SpreadOffset Minimum The minimum amount by which Spread must exceed Offset Prevents a possible arbitrage opportunity for the customer A possible value for this might be Dead Interval The period of time which must pass before the program will recalculate the above Criteria if no transactions have taken place during the Dead Interval A possible value for this might be seconds Program Outputs The program should output the following variables as a result of combining the above Criteria in a userdefined Formula Spread integer as per current Stack Manager Offset integer as per current Stack Manager Suspension boolean Whether or not the Product should be suspended Normally False Program Interface and Operation Principles The user should be provided with a GUI which will allow them to define a relationship among the above Criteria which will produce and apply the Outputs to a particular Product This relationship would be defined with Intensity Formulas and Transaction Formulas Every time a Transaction occurs or a Dead Interval passes the Criteria will be recalculated and the userdefined formulas will be reviewed by the program If a Dead Interval passes without any transactions taking place then Intensity Intensity and BuysBuysTRR and SellsSellsTRR and Buy Offset Buy Offset ORR and Sell Offset Sell Offset ORR If the userdefined Formulas see following indicate that a change in spread should occur then if the Offset is zero in the case of a trade occurring or if no trade has occured during the passing of a Dead Interval the system shall perform a Last Trade is Mid calculation around the last transaction adjusting the buy and sell prices according to the new Spread value Any adjustment to the Spread shall respect the SpreadOffset Minimum If a reduction in the Spread should violate the SpreadOffset Minimum then the Buy Offset or Sell Offset or both as appropriate shall be reduced accordingly Similarly if the Offset is increased by a Transaction Formula to a level greater than the Spread the Spread shall be increased to maintain the SpreadOffset Minimum GUIFormulas Example Constants Intensity Factor Dead Interval Offset Reversion Ratio ORR Transaction Reversion Ratio TRR Spread Minimum Spread Maximum Offset Minimum Offset Maximum SpreadOffset Minimum INPUTS OUTPUTS Intensity Formula Formula Intensity Spread Offset Suspension S na F S na F S na F Transaction Formula Formula Transactions Spread Offset Suspension V na F V na F V F V F V F V na na T Note that Transactions would be Buys or Sells as appropriate Note also that Buys and Sells are not intended to be an absolute count but rather are a moving measure of the number of buys or sells which have recently occured In this example all Constants and Formulae are editable by the user through the GUI Simulation Obviously if we want to proceed we will want to conduct several simulations to prove concepts and evaluate responsiveness However to give some idea of how the above might work when a market starts to run in a particular direction please see the attached Additional Features System Notifications There should be two kinds of notifications for the Robotrader which will be similar to Stack Manager Garbage Checks Warning and Failure levels for both Offset and Price The warning levels will trigger a pager message The Failure levels will trigger a pager message and the product will be automatically suspended The Price checks will be against prices input by the trader not relative price movements but actual price There should be both maximum and minimum price checks eg gas is trading at The notification levels could be at the top end and at the bottom end Offset checks will only be against a maximum value Dave

<16640950.1075857593495.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,john.arnold@enron.com,2000-04-16 06:50:00,Re optionsThe problem if we limit the size on options to being what size is offered on the swap hedge we will not be able to offer adequate size on the options Optimally I think we want to offer a minimum size of across all strikes If the swap is one a day up and someone buys half a day making the market one a day by half a day the size offered on a cent out of the money call might be as low as contracts a much smaller size than most people want to trade If we restrict to strikes with a lower delta we face the problem of not offering enough strikes and not making a market in options that have open EOL interest that have moved closer to the money Maybe the answer is to assume the swap hedge to be a penny wide two way wrapped around the EOL swap mid market Thus if the front swap on EOL is one a day by half a day the input into the option calculator is up In this case I think is necessary because once a strike has open interest we must continue to support it Thus I anticipate having to make markets in deep itm options as the market moves In terms of straddle strikes I think the edge received from buying straddles struck on the EOL offer and viceversa is not big enough to compensate for what I think the industry will view as a scam and another way Enron is trying to rip people off Although striking on the midmarket is probably easier for the trader I actually think striking in five cent increments makes more sense It allows people to trade out of the position on EOL Whereas if someone buys the straddle and the market moves to they have to call ENE to close the trade If the trade is struck at we will have a market on both the call and put at all times Secondly I would anticipate nonvolatility driven option traders may elect to sell either just the put or call in this scenario depending on their view of market direction

voluntarily shelled out several hundred thousand dollars for the right to cough out carbon dioxide the same stuff you exhaled three sentences ago The reason it did so is closely related to events that occurred that same autumn day half a world away at the Hague Thousands of policymakers and scientists from all over the world had gathered hoping to dot the is cross the zeds and umlaut the os on the Kyoto Protocol to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change The protocol was devised to curb the industrial emission of six gases CO among them that are slowlyactually quickly in geological termsturning the earth into a hothouse But no final accord was reached In this context Murphys purchase of options on metric tons of carbon the equivalent of annual exhaust from approximately cars from a Canadian company that was itself trying to help meet a national target seems a bit odd The market for this kind of trade hasnt been established and there isnt even a global agreement on how carbon dioxide should be valued Indeed there isnt even unanimity on global warming itself Yet the transaction is emblematic of industry on the verge of an environmental transition Congress may have snubbed the Kyoto accord and global bureaucrats may be stumbling over the details of a carbonemissions trading system But corporations against the run of play are beginning to confront the climate conundrum the best way they know howas a business opportunity John Browne CEO of BP Amoco and Mark MoodyStuart chairman of Royal DutchShell Group have both responded to the globalwarming threat and set up internal systems that exceed goals put forth in Kyoto Shell and BP have vowed to cut their greenhousegas emissions eachnearly twice the Kyoto targetShell by BP by This isnt an act of altruism says Aidan Murphy of Shell Its a fundamental strategic issue for our business And not theirs alone A growing number of corporations from IBM to your neighborhood Kinkos are reducing their greenhouse footprints DuPont is pledging to knock its emissions below levels by Theres been a shift in the center of gravity in the US corporate community since Kyoto says Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists Now the view is that climate change is serious and we ought to do something about it There are a few ways of doing that invest in renewable energy sources and cap and trade emissions That is set ceilings for worldwide greenhousegas emission and let nations either sell emission credits if they emit below their allowance or buy credits if they exceed permitted levels The theory is that the pursuit of greenbacks will fuel greener business Whenever you turn a pollution cut into a financial asset says Joseph Goffman an attorney at Environmental Defense people go out and make lots of pollution cuts Even where green fervor is of a paler shade corporations are viewing the potential for global regulation as a business risk they need to consider Witness Claiborne Deming Murphys CEO who doesnt see the science of global warming as solid enough yet to cry havoc But Deming hears shareholders clamoring and the bureaucrats buzzing Someone may ask his company to put more than a quarter in that box when it wants to exhale more than its allotted amount of CO Breathe in Hold it You know the drill How much CO did you just exhale Tricky question Yet thats analogous to the one businesses are struggling with on a massive scale Until they figure it out companies interested in trading will be on their own to determine how you buy the right to emit a gas that has no standard of measurement and how to do so when no nation currently assigns a CO property right Its risky as hell says Deming Many groups are working to mitigate that risk The World Resources Institute and others are roadtesting a system that would make trading less risky by creating universal carbonaccounting practices And four companiesArthur Andersen Credit Lyonnais Natsource and Swiss Reare developing an exchange where companies can trade even in an embryonic market devoid of legislative standards Theyre trying to nail down something that will be useful under laws that are not yet defined says Garth Edward a broker at Natsource an energytrading firm The US struggled to introduce a capandtrade system into the Kyoto Protocol and achieved it by agreeing to a tough many say impossible target bringing emissions below levels from to The irony of the current situation is that the Europeans reluctant to accept trading at first have become its champion Britain next month will become the first country to embark on a national trading system Another practice still hotly debated is to assign credits for sequestering carbon in growing forests Trees soak up limited amounts of CO release oxygen into the air and turn carbon into wood The Kyoto mechanisms will evaporate without global ratification thus setting up an early environmental test for President Bush who campaigned against the document But Secretary of State Colin Powell has already heard preliminary briefings on the matter as the US preps for the next round of talks to be held in Bonn in midJuly Bush the First helped pioneer credit trading in when he signed legislation that capped power plants sulfur dioxide emissionsthe main ingredient in acid rainbut allowed the plants to swap credits And Houstonbased Enron an energy trader whose chairman Ken Lay was a prominent W campaign adviser stands to be a huge player in any such market So if its good for business Bush the exbusinessman wont need that big a push With him or without him the monetization of carbon emissionsgreen for greeds sake if nothing elseis gaining momentum So breathe easy For you its still free But for many companies the carbon meter will be running soon In the very near future pollution is going to be either a cost to them or an opportunity

Lemuel Green a flour mill owner took the excess power from the waterturn ed generator at his mill in and sold it between dusk and midnight to anybody in Alton Kan who knew what to do with it Soon he quit the millin g business and started stringing transmission lines across the western part o f the state Before his death in he had built a utility that lit Kans as communities Kansas Citys UtiliCorp United is perhaps the only fourthgeneration familycontrolled electric utility in the country Today the outfit once called Missouri Public Service is headed by Lemuel Greens two greatgrandsons Richard Green took over as chief executive in three years after his fathers death At the time Missouri Public Service served customers in two states and had million in revenues Richards brother Robert now joined him three years later Standing pat was not an option Deregulation was in the air and the rules were changing The brothers remade the company They spent billion buyin g utilities in other parts of the US Canada Australia and New Zealand UtiliCorp now serves million customers in seven states and four countries More important they veered off into other parts of the energy business In they acquired gas properties from Peoples Natural Gas of Omaha and got a twoperson gastrading operation as part of the deal That little trading operation now a subsidiary called Aquila turned into something almost as valuable as all the rest of the company with its megawatts of power generated in some power plants around the country My brother and I received strong advice that we would never be able to be competitive in this business says Bob Green Oh yeah Aquila has employees and competes with the likes of Duke Dynegy and Enron According to Natural Gas Week Aquila was the fourthlargest powerandgas marketer in t he country last year Aquila trades a host of other products as welleverythin g from weathercondition hedges to bandwidth Problem Trading operations require capital just as power plants do The solution until now has been what brother Bob calls our asset lite strategy We want to control the capacity not own it So Aquila may provi de the gas to power a socalled merchant plant one that produces electricity to sell in the market in return for a claim on its production But so far Aquila has not been a big player in the most profitable parts of the businesstaking on big risk in larger transactions the way Enron and Dyneg y do What to do In midDecember UtiliCorp announced that it would offer o f Aquila to the public raising capital while creating a market value for its trading operation just as competitors Constellation Energy and Southern Company are doing The hope is that the new entity will garner a multiple o f to times earnings Then if all were to go as planned UtiliCorp woul d spin off the rest of the operation in a taxfree distribution The timing looks good Aquila has no material exposure in the California market Furthermore the volatility in that market has been a bonanza for many firms that trade power including Aquila Its trading subsidiary is th e reason UtiliCorps earnings were up last year to million on billion in sales UtiliCorps shares doubled in the past year to But will the California crisis nonetheless poison the market for an Aquila stock offering It might And UtiliCorp cannot afford to hold its breath in the capital markets forever Even with its assetlite strategy the compa ny is far more leveraged than most utilities with debt at of capital versus the norm for electric utilities The offering is supposed to rai se million or so that could be used to pay down a bit of the parents billion in debt If Bob Green is walking a financial tightrope you could never tell it by talking to him We see this company as our heritage he says confidently This despite the fact that after seven equity offerings the familys share of UtiliCorp is now down from when Richard took over Might the Greens lose their heirloom in a takeover battle They might but they might come out ahead anyway Look at the family history Lemuel sold some of his utility assets for million in and diversified into California orange groves The assets were resold to Samuel Insull the midwestern electricity magnate who came to a bad end when his pyramid of holding companies collapsed during the Depression Years later after Congress reacted

Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Two years ago Bradley Hoggatt was heading for an academic career in meteorology intent on discovering more about how hurricanes form But just before he started working on a doctorate a very different opportunity blew in Now Mr Hoggatt forecasts weather for a floor full of MBAs who trade billions of dollars in weathersensitive energy commodities such as natural gas and electricity for Aquila Inc the trading subsidiary of a big Midwes t utility With no business background himself Mr Hoggatt is also trading complex financial contracts based on his predictions Im putting my money where m y mouth is says the tall squareshouldered yearold Weathermen and women have become a hot commodity in the exploding energytrading business While offtarget forecasts on television may frustrate parents and schools and embarrass politicians as they did this week on the East Coast they can lose bundles for electricity and naturalg as traders So as trading has boomed so has demand for trained meteorologists a profession that traditionally hasnt paid all that well and is often the butt of jokes From Wall Street to Houstons Louisiana Street where many energy companies have set up shop recent graduates are earning twice what they would earn a t the National Weather Service or in academia The appetite for weather is insatiable says James L Gooding director of meteorology at Duke Energy Corp A former NASA scientist Dr Gooding will be adding a fourth forecast er to his Houston team in the next year Enron Corp an energytrading giant based in Houston has more than double d its staff of weather forecasters to nine in the past three years plucking talent from places like the Weather Channel Williams Cos a Tulsa Okla competitor is endowing university fellowships to lure meteorology students And since Aquila which is owned by UtiliCorp United Inc of Kansas City Mo has hired two other meteorologists from Mr Hoggatts alma mater the University of Wisconsin plus another scientist with a PhD in climatology That hiring paid off a bit during this weeks winter storm in the Northeast While many on the East Coast were getting miscues from TV weathermen on a pending possibly historic blizzard that fizzled in New York and other cities traders at Aquila simply looked to Mr Hoggatt Last Friday Scott Macrorie an electricity trader for the MidAtlantic region at Aquila stopped by to see how the storm was progressing Mr Hoggatts team told him temperatures in his region of interest would be low er because of the storm though the snowfall forecast on TV seemed a little high Sure enough temperatures fell and snowfall in many cities was less than predicted lifting electricity prices and making Mr Macrorie a profit that he says was in the tens of thousands of dollars About university students in the US graduate each year with bachelor s degrees in meteorology according to the American Meteorological Society A n additional or so graduate with masters degrees or doctorates Until jus t a few years ago those graduates didnt typically have many options TV for those who had the blowdried look backoffice jobs with the government or a handful of private consultants for those who didnt Research was an option And some airlines and utilities kept a few meteorologists on staff to help position airplanes or powerline repair trucks during storms Now deeppocketed trading companies are offering many meteorologists with graduate degrees salaries ranging from to Performance and trading bonuses can double or even triple the figure That compares with th e roughly the National Weather Service pays a junior forecaster with a graduate degree Its a bit unusual for meteorologists to have the prospect of lucrative employment after graduation says John NielsenGammon a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas AM University This is a bit of a switch So far there has been no dearth of meteorological talent available partly because the National Weather Service wrapped up a big expansion project in the mids and slowed hiring It hires only to replace people who leave about to meteorologists a year And the highpressure world of billiondollar commodity bets isnt for everyone When Carl Altoe graduated from Penn State one of the nations to p meteorology programs he got a heavy sales pitch from Enron Its quite an impressive place he says of Enrons trading floor but he wasnt sure forecasting skills alone would be enough to make the grade I would be afraid that if money wasnt made in a hurry Id be tossed says Mr

commodity markets to the stocks of retail companies on Wall Street Jon Davis a meteorologist for Salomon Smith Barney in Chicago started forecasting the weather for agriculture traders back in But volatile energy prices have raised the stakes for forecasters who are able to gauge airconditioning use in the summer or naturalgas demand duri ng the winter heating season Meanwhile all sorts of companies are turning to energy traders and Wall Street for weather derivatives complex contracts used to hedge financial risks associated with the weather With every passing year you do more energy and more energy Mr Davis says Despite big advances in data collection and modeling betting millions of dollars on weather forecasts can still be tricky business Shortterm forecasts are pretty good Predicting weather two weeks from now is chancy Most meteorologists get their data from the government particularly the National Weather Service Many then tweak it with their own interpretations or forecasting models Disappointed last year by poor longterm forecasts from private consultants Aquila has a contest offering to the meteorologist or team that can best predict temperatures in major US cities over the course of a year I call it the forecast bakeoff says Mr Hoggatt The high stakes also mean more pressure on forecasters WSI Corp a Billerica Mass weatherforecasting firm started an

Subject Enron Mentions Utility Deregulation Square Peg Round Hole The New York Times Executives Considered to Head Military Los Angeles Times Bush leaning toward execs for military The Seattle Times Enrons Chief Denies Role as Energy Villain Critics regard Kenneth Lay as deregulation opportunist The San Francisco Chronicle Enron boss says hes not to blame for profits in energy crisis Associated Press Newswires The Stadium Curse Some stocks swoon after arena deals The San Francisco Chronicle Money and BusinessFinancial Desk Section ECONOMIC VIEW Utility Deregulation Square Peg Round Hole By JOSEPH KAHN The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company WASHINGTON IN the forensic pursuit of what caused Californias power failure the Bush administration the energy industry and many analysts have granted immunity to deregulation Robert Shapiro a managing director of Enron the giant electricity marketer says the California mess should in no way affect deregulation in other states because California didnt really deregulate Spencer Abraham the new energy secretary said Californians simply goofed setting up a dysfunctional system It is the way California deregulated not deregulation itself that should take the blame they say Yet some economists argue that Californias troubles should inform the debate about whether not just how to deregulate Among them is Alfred E Kahn the Cornell University economist who helped oversee the creation of free markets in the rail trucking and airline industries I am worried about the uniqueness of electricity markets Mr Kahn said He is still studying whether the design flaws in Californias market explain the whole problem But he is sounding a note of skepticism Ive always been uncertain about eliminating vertical integration he said referring to the old ways of allowing a single heavily regulated power company to produce transmit and distribute electricity It may be one industry in which it works reasonably well Mr Kahns comments might sound a little heretical When this former Carter administration official was pushing deregulation it was still a novel and politically risky concept Today getting government out of most businesses is part of the Washington economic canon Moreover few people believe that California the first state to overhaul its electricity sector from top to bottom has proved a good laboratory To satisfy interest groups the markets were designed in an awkward way which soured some deregulation experts on California before the first electron went on the auction block Among the quirks The state required utilities to buy nearly all their power on daily spot markets rather than arranging longterm contracts that might have allowed them to hedge risk Consumer prices were also fixed making it impossible for utilities to pass on higher wholesale costs Paul L Joskow an expert on electricity markets at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a former student of Mr Kahns remains hopeful that the kinks can be ironed out In New England and the the Middle Atlantic states as well in as Britain Chile and Argentina all places that have restructured electricity markets regulators have had to adjust market rules to correct flaws They have found ways to check the tendency of power sellers to exploit infant markets and charge high prices Mr Joskow said Regulators have also had to establish new markets that through price signals encourage power companies to build enough generating capacity so that they have reserves for peak hours During peak hours shortages and price spikes can substantially raise average prices If they can do it in Britain Chile and Argentina then I think we can do it here Mr Joskow said Still he warns that proper regulation requires tough political choices Allowing high prices to pass through to consumers is one Making sure Nimbyism does not prevent the construction of power plants is another The political system must rise to the task Mr Joskow said or the old way might be the best we can do Mr Kahn knows a bit about the old way In the mids he headed the New York Public Service Commission which oversaw electricity and other regulated industries The drawbacks were legendary Local utilities had an endemic tendency to overestimate demand to justify new power plants for which consumers paid through steady rate increases Nearly everyone assumed that competition would slash prices But though free markets do a better job managing rail phone and airline prices they have yet to match regulators ability to juggle the complexities of electricity Mr Kahn said Regulators tended to apply heavy political pressure on utilities to keep prices as low as possible and profit margins steady but thin The vertical integration of electricity monopolies may have also had advantages Mr Kahn said Engineers coordinated power plants and transmission lines in ideal ways Planners who saw the need for new plants helped find a place for them to be built The players all depended on one another he said California has probably not derailed deregulation efforts But it has made people wonder anew whether market forces work for kilowatts as they do for widgets Photo Alfred E Kahn Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved National Desk Executives Considered to Head Military From Associated Press Los Angeles Times

company White was executive assistant to Secretary of State Colin Powell when Powell was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved NEWS Enrons Chief Denies Role as Energy Villain Critics regard Kenneth Lay as deregulation opportunist David Lazarus Chronicle Staff Writer The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL A Copyright Kenneth Lay is one of the energy pirates accused by Californias governor of fleecing consumers As chairman of Enron Corp the worlds largest energy trader Lay is arguably the biggest baddest buccaneer of them all But thats not how he wants to be seen And he certainly doesnt like taking knocks from Gov Gray Davis for having contributed to Californias energy mess Its very unfair Lay said his brown eyes taking on a puppy dog quality Hes trying to vilify us But we didnt make the rules in California We had nothing to do with creating the problem He gazed out from his plush thfloor office Houstons downtown skyscrapers jutted like sharp teeth against the overcast sky Everyone played by the rules Lay said Now our reputations are being maligned In a sense hes right The ultimate blame does rest with California policymakers for deregulating the states electricity market in such a hamfisted way that power giants like Enron cleaned up by exploiting loopholes in the system But Enron was no innocent bystander during the restructuring process Enron and Ken Lay were one of the major players behind the push for deregulation in California said Janee Briesemeister senior policy analyst in the Austin office of Consumers Union A lot of whats happening in California was their idea Those familiar with the states deregulation efforts said Enron was especially eager to ensure that a newly created Power Exchange where wholesale power would be bought and sold was separate from the Independent System Operator which would oversee the electricity grid This fragmented the wholesale market making it harder to monitor said John Rozsa an aide to state Sen Steve Peace DEl Cajon widely regarded as the godfather of Californias bungled deregulation measures Enron isnt in the business of making markets work Rozsa said Theyre in the business of making a buck In an ironic twist however Enron now could play a pivotal role in helping the state remedy past errors and find its energy footing The company has that much clout SEEKING LAYS BLESSING Thus as the governor pushes ahead with a scheme to purchase the transmission lines of Californias cashstrapped utilities he didnt hesitate to call recently seeking Lays personal blessing for the plan This must have been a sweet moment for the man who just weeks earlier had been castigated by Davis in the governors State of the State speech I told him we couldnt support it Lay said a hint of a smile playing across his lips It will lead to an even less efficient transmission grid and longer term it could make things worse Why would Davis swallow his pride and court favor with Enrons big cheese Simple Davis will need the Bush administrations backing to make the powerline sale fly and many believe theres no faster way to reach the new president than via the Houston office of his leading corporate patron Lay and his company have donated more than to Bushs various political campaigns in recent years and he placed Enrons private jet at Bushs disposal during the presidential race So great is Lays influence with the president that some insist he is now serving effectively as shadow energy secretary shaping US energy policy as he sees fit Theres a long history of Enron pulling the levers of its political relationships to get what it wants said Craig McDonald director of Texans for Public Justice a watchdog group What Ken Lay thinks energy policy should be isnt very different from what George Bush and Dick Cheney think it should be ANOTHER VIEWPOINT Lay of course sees things differently At the mere mention of his close rapport with the president his eyes glazed over and he mechanically recited the words he has repeated numerous times in recent months I have known the president and his family for many years Lay said Ive been a strong supporter of his I believe in him and I believe in his policies He insisted that reports of his having sway over Bush on energy matters are grossly exaggerated Still it is striking that Bushs quick decision after taking office to limit federal assistance in solving Californias energy woes virtually mirrored Lays own thoughts on the situation So too with the administrations handsoff approach to resolving the crisis Whatever else Californias power woes have been very kind to Enrons bottom line The companys revenues more than doubled to billion last year They havent hurt Lay either According to company records his pay package more than tripled last year to million Lay and other Enron officials steadfastly refuse to break out the companys California earnings from other worldwide business activities But Lay conceded that Enrons profit from California energy deals last year was not inconsequential We benefit from the volatility he said CAPTIVE MARKETPLACE Thats putting it mildly It could be said that Californias energy mess was tailormade for Enron which is almost uniquely positioned to prosper from a captive marketplace in which electricity and natural gas prices are simultaneously soaring skyward To understand why that is one must look closely at Enrons complex business model The company is much more than just a middleman in brokering energy deals Lay with a doctorate in economics and a background as a federal energy regulator set about completely reinventing Enron in after taking over what was then an unexceptional naturalgas pipeline operator As he saw it the real action was not in distribution or generation of energy but in transacting lightningfast deals wherever electricity or gas is needed treating energy like a tradable commodity for the first time Enron is now the leader in this fastgrowing field and uses that advantage to consolidate its position as the marketmaker of choice for energy buyers and sellers throughout the country It also exploits its size and trading sophistication to structure unusually creative deals For example if electricity prices are down but natural gas prices up Enron might cut a deal to meet a utilitys power needs in return for taking possession of the gas required to run the utilitys plants Enron could then turn around and sell that gas elsewhere using part of the proceeds to purchase lowpriced electricity from another provider which it ships back to the original utility We do best in competitive markets Lay said These are sustainable markets TRADING FRENZY Enrons trading floors buzz all day long with frantic activity as mostly young mostly male employees scan banks of flatpanel displays in search of the best deals Rock music blares from speakers giving the scene an almost fratparty atmosphere The companys trading volume skyrocketed last year with the advent of an Internetbased bidding system which logged trades valued at billion making Enron by far the worlds single biggest ecommerce entity Kevin Presto who oversees Enrons East Coast power trades called up the California electricity market on his computer With a few quick mouse clicks he showed that Enron at that moment was buying power in the Golden State at per megawatt hour and selling it at Some days were at some days and some days Presto said over the steady thumpthump of the trading floors rock n roll soundtrack Theres truly a problem out there This is a recurring theme among Enron officials Californias electricity market is broken and Enron would prefer it if things just settled down As Lay himself put it The worst thing for us is a dysfunctional marketplace In reality Californias dysfunctional marketplace means Enron isnt just making piles of money its seeing profits both coming and going LOTS OF BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA The companys energy services division which handles the complete energy needs of large institutions counts among its clients the University of California and California State school systems Oaklands Clorox Co and even the San Francisco Giants and Pac Bell Park Enron purchases electricity on behalf of these clients from Pacific Gas and Electric Co which by law must keep its rates frozen below current market values At the same time Enron sells power to PGE at skyhigh wholesale levels In other words Enron is buying back its own electricity from PGE for just a fraction of the price it charges the utility These guys are the pariahs of the power system said Nettie Hoge executive director of The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco Why do we need middlemen They dont do anything except mark up the cost To be fair energy marketers such as Enron can help stabilize an efficient marketplace by promoting increased competition between buyers and sellers This has proven the case in Pennsylvania where Enron actively trades among about market participants But in an inefficient market such as California a company like Enron can easily exacerbate things by exploiting loopholes in the states illconceived regulatory framework Sylvester Turner a Houston lawmaker who serves as vice chairman of the state committee that oversees Texas utilities said he cant blame Enron and other power companies for pursuing profits in California California set up some bad rules and these companies played by the rules California set up he said At the end of the day they will behave to enhance their bottom lines But as Texas proceeds toward deregulation of its own electricity market next year Turner said he has learned from Californias experience and is taking steps to prevent Texas power giants from shaking down local consumers LESSONS FROM GOLDEN STATE He has written a bill intended to give the Texas Public Utility Commission more authority in cracking down on market abuses The power companies are fighting the legislation as hard as they can Not least among Turners worries is that Texas will see what California officials believe happened in their state A deliberate withholding of power by leading providers until surging demand had pushed prices higher I have that concern he said I dont necessarily take these companies at their word For his part Lay insists that Enron has never deliberately manipulated electricity prices I dont know of any of that he said Its so easy to conjure up conspiracy theories As a sign of Enrons commitment to solving Californias energy troubles Lay said he supported Davis when the state began negotiating longterm power contracts on behalf of utilities So how many contracts has Enron signed Suddenly the hurt puppyish expression vanished from Lays face and a harder more steely look glinted from his eyes None he said We wont be signing until were certain about recovering our costs Consider this a shot

Lay to discuss negotiations as the state looks to buy power transmission lines from troubled utilities I told him we couldnt support it Lay told the San Francisco Chronicle in an interview at his Houston office It will lead to an even less efficient transmission grid and longer term it could make things worse Lay is not just any privatesector energy czar Enron Corp is the worlds largest energy trader and Lay is a close friend of President George Bush Lay and his corporation have donated more than to Bushs various political campaigns in recent years and he offered Bush use of Enrons private jet during the presidential race But Lay said its economics not politics that matter in Californias energy crisis And he thinks it unfair that Davis has blamed outofstate energy brokers for the protracted problems We didnt make the rules in California Lay said We had nothing to do with creating the problem The problem many analysts agree began with the states deregulation of the power industry in Enron encouraged deregulation and the states ensuing power crisis has been lucrative for the corporation Enrons stock jumped percent in and its revenues more than doubled to billion Lay was compensated accordingly he received nearly million in stock and cash beyond his million salary last year compared with less than million in bonuses in Lay refused to say how much Enron has made off Californias crisis though he conceded the profit was not inconsequential We benefit from the volatility said Lay who took over Enron in and has helped turn the corporation into a major player in the trading of electricity as a commodity But Lay rejected suggestions that Enron has manipulated prices upward by insisting California pay dearly for lastminute power that has helped keep the lights on in recent months I dont know of any of that he said Its so easy to conjure up conspiracy theories Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved BUSINESS NET WORTH The Stadium Curse Some stocks swoon after arena deals Kathleen Pender The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL B Copyright Is buying the name of a bigleague stadium the kiss of death for a company or does it only seem that way From Network Associates Coliseum in Oakland to the unfinished CMGI Field outside Boston the nation is dotted with sports venues named after companies whose stocks have been sacked The Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens play in a stadium named after PSINet whose stock has fallen percent to a share since it bought naming rights The problem names are not all tech The owners of the TWA Dome in St Louis and Pro Player Stadium in Miami are looking for new corporate sponsors because their current ones are bankrupt TWA is an airline Pro Player was part of underwearmaker Fruit of the Loom The home of the Anaheim Angels could be in the market for a new name if Edison International parent of electric utility Southern California Edison runs out of juice Of course these companies were not in trouble when they promised to pay tens or hundreds of millions of dollars to have their names plastered on a ballpark or arena In fact many were at their peak Which begs the question Should investors get worried when a company in which they own stock puts its name up among the floodlights Brian Pears head of equity trading with Wells Capital Management wonders if companies are susceptible to some weird strain of the Sports Illustrated curse It seems as if any athlete who is pictured on the cover of SI magazine invariably loses his next game or pulls a groin muscle Business celebrities suffer from a similar phenomenon Amazoncom Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos was named Time magazines person of the year just before his companys stock price tanked Don Hinchey who advises buyers and sellers in namingrights deals doesnt think the curse holds true in stadium and arena deals You can make a case that a company is doing well when it acquires a naming rights sponsorship but you cant necessarily say it corresponds with a peak in its business says Hinchey director of creative services for the Bonham Group in Denver TRACKING NAMING FIRMS To find out if Hinchey is right I tracked the stock market performance of publicly held companies since they bought naming rights to bigleague sports venues in North America I excluded facilities named after subsidiaries of larger companies including Miller Park in Milwaukee Miller Brewing is part of Philip Morris and Pac Bell Park in San Francisco Pacific Bell is owned by SBC Communications which is putting its own name on an arena in San Antonio I used the announcement date as a starting point because stadium naming deals are after all marketing endeavors The announcement of a deal generates tons of publicity which is considered positive even if the publicity is negative and even if the stadium wont open for several years Then I compared each companys stock market performance with the Standard Poors index during the same period The bottom line of the companies that bought stadium or arena names are trading at a higher stock price today than when the deals were announced according to data from FactSet Research Systems Two companies each bought two names and were counted twice But and this is a big but only of them beat the SP during the period since their respective deals were announced So buying a stadium name might not be a curse but its no guarantee the company will beat the market WINNERS LOSERS The companies that have done best since buying a name come from a wide variety of industries The biggest winner is Qualcomm a wireless telecommunications company Although its stock is down percent from its peak its still up percent since it agreed to slap its name on a San Diego stadium The nextbiggest winners include Target discount stores Ericsson telecom equipment Coors beer Fleet Financial banking Pepsi soft drinks and Enron energy The biggest losers are TWA PSINet Internet service provider CMGI Internet incubator Savvis Communications telecom services and Network Associates network security software Network Associates stock peaked about three months after it bought naming rights to the Oakland Coliseum in September Since then it has suffered a string of setbacks After the Securities and Exchange Commission questioned its accounting practices it restated its financial results for and Its CEO resigned in December Network Associates is paying slightly more than million per year for the coliseum name It can get out of its year deal after five years The company has been paying us says Deena McClain general counsel with the OaklandAlameda County Coliseum Authority We havent had any discussions with them about changing the contract Most namingrights contracts have out clauses that allow the parties to extricate themselves if they want can or need to in the event of financial difficulties or if a team moves says Hinchey Although nobody likes to be associated with a loser stadium owners may benefit if a troubled company cuts out of a deal early Thats because stadium name prices have skyrocketed since the mid s when million a year give or take was average In FedEx agreed to pay million over years to be named home of the Washington Redskins In CMGI agreed to pay million over years to have its name on the new home of the New England Patriots Its questionable what kind of shape CMGI will be in when the stadium opens next year The gallon hat of naming rights deals says Hinchey is in Houston where Reliant Energy will pay million over years to name the Astrodome and a new football stadium after itself Some customers of Reliants utility subsidiary were outraged when the deal was announced because the company was also raising electricity rates Some shareholders also get perturbed when their company spends money on a stadium instead of a new plant or stock dividends But Jim Grinstead editor of Revenues from Sports Venues says you have to look at the stadium purchase in light of total marketing budget It sounds like big money but frequently its over to years If you take out things the company might buy anyway like tickets and luxury suites its small potatoes WHAT A DEAL IS WORTH The main benefit of a stadium deal is the exposure a company gets when a game is broadcast on TV or radio or mentioned in print This is the biggest bang for your buck in terms of branding says Jennifer Keavney a Network Associates vice president who negotiated the stadium deal She says the cost of her deal about million a year wont even buy you a Super Bowl ad It will buy five commercials on a nationally televised football game maybe The Coliseum perched beside Interstate also acts like a giant billboard for the company which frequently gets mentioned in traffic reports Hinchey says most naming deals also include tickets and luxury boxes onsite exposure through signage and kiosks premium nights when the sponsor might offer samples at the park and inclusion in programs tickets and flyers Most companies that strike stadium deals want to become a household name because they sell consumer products or services But not always Com sold nothing but corporate networking gear when it bought the name to Candlestick Park in San Francisco in It was a good move for them says Jim Grinstead editor of Revenues from Sports Venues They got the employees they were looking for the visibility they were looking for At the time they were a player in a crowded field and they wanted to look like a fun place to work Last April Com extended its original year contract for two more years The biggest risk companies run is that the team that plays in their facility will be a loser Companies invest in an entity that can enhance their brand their sales and hospitality efforts Certainly that loses its luster if the team is not performing well Hinchey says But corporations realize the teams success on the field fluctuates It could be a champion one year next year in the dumps The same can be said about the corporate sponsors which is something stadium owners be they taxpayers or business tycoons must realize when they sell a name PHOTO Caption Rich Gannon of the

had the highest AGA number of recorded history for this week last week or next week by bcf seems a little far fetched to me Our analysis is saying gas at we would have had bcf a day more demand that includes commercial residential industrial switching processing as far as bcfd power gen demand that counts the fact that last year was extremely mild versus expectation of normal summer this year west will be running every gas unit virtually all hours as power demand is growing maybe still and hydro way down every molecule that can will flow west from waha this summer versus little last year east power prices really havent reached point of priceing out demand and heat rates healthy enough to where gas can go up without raising power prices to cut demand some concern of more efficient replacing less but hard to quantify were trying to build the stack now to estimate frac margins now positive for all but most inefficient processors will continue coming back a little concerned about oil prices bordering right there now for places like florida and actually saw fl demand rise last week as gas got to parity let me look into inj capability definitely bigger when field is empty from engineering standpoint so any problems really wont arise until fall when gen demand low and inj capacity lowermy initial thoughts bo seems as neutral as everyone else in the market right now really inactive to clarify not raging bull i like everybody want to see what the inj numbers in april look like nobody putting a position on until that starts to clarify just think that hedging demand is making market a little short right now making next move up more likely would be scale up seller though not really sure why cash trades at back doesnt make any sense however as more fields start turning around throughout month the stg arb to great in my opinion to keep spread there must close one way or the other notice that spread tightened to towards end of trading friday in general think that gas is reaching the elasticity stage right here cents lower and no switching no processing and gain back some demand market needs to see some big stg numbers first i think the best play right now is to start buying longer term put spreads Jan look great to me if we get back to and dont match last years early weather bombs away on AM To cc Subject friday this doesnt allow for new generation demandwhich is unclear cuz it requires power px also doesnt accrue for more eficient gen replacing inneficient weather of course but bcfd sounds hiesp shudnt happen until loads peak in julyshud be marginal in aprjun if you notice im not alot diff than your guys demand destruction is implied but im including a factor for RC energy conservationie poor guys like me turning lites off and thermostat downits making a difference that will be less factor in shoulder demand monthsreason why i think y on y sd swing will be closer to bcf aprjun if px doesnt fall and electricity spikes i think well see conservation return cuz i wont turn on my air cnditioner now rember the is vs gas at sub ie february which is approx where we are today all that being said yes some demand has come backbut it is as i consider extraordinary demand destructionthose things which never really have occured beforelike the level for fuel switching in jan and fractionation marginsie liquids which were all non existent a year ago save for residual fuel some ammoniafert prod has come back as well but when you get down to bcfd industrial in the more i think of itmay not be destruction anymore as mucha unction of an economic slowdown anyway i think i only know two guys that are bearishme and one of your big fund customersospraie well see is collins bullish as wellhe seems quieter in the mkt lately heres another onewhat you guys think the industry capacity for injection is on a weekly basis we sud test itin other words if the max is say then means the basis will uttery colpase on daily cuz mkt will keep futs

Plants Shut Down and Sell the Energy Subject Plants Shut Down and Sell the Energy Plants Shut Down and Sell the Energy By Peter Behr Washington Post Staff Writer Thursday December Page E Kaiser Aluminum Corp had planned to spend December making aluminum at its giant smelters in the Pacific Northwest run by electricity from the Bonneville Power Administrations Columbia River dams Then it saw a better deal With California desperate for power and electricity prices hitting unheardof peaks Kaiser shut down its two US smelters last week It is selling the electricity it no longer needs for about times what it pays Bonneville under longstanding contracts It is a measure of this winters fuel crunch Some big industrial firms in energyintensive sectors such as paper fertilizers metals and even oilfield operations can make more money by selling their electricity or natural gas than manufacturing their products The shifts by such large industrial consumers of energy described as unprecedented by analysts will free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter But they also are sowing seeds of potential problems next year Shortages of aluminum and fertilizer for example are likely to give another upward jolt to consumer prices and further weaken the economy analysts said The fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we dont know what theyre going to use to grow crops with said David Wyss chief economist at Standard Poors Some economists have recently increased their warnings about the damaging impact of this winters heating bills on an already weakening economy Goldman Sachs analysts last week estimated that gas heating bills will double this winter to more than for a typical US household That and higher electricity prices will cost consumers billion in higher energy costs compared with a year ago they estimated cutting the expected growth in the nations economic output by one percentage point on an annual rate in the first three months of next year Overall the recent energy price developments have thus added to the risk of a sharp economic slowdown the Goldman Sachs report concluded Terra Industries Inc in Sioux City Iowa has closed three of its six US ammonia plants which use natural gas as a main ingredient for fertilizer production Like Kaiser the company realized it would be much more profitable to stop production in December and sell the natural gas back to the market at current prices which are much higher than the price Terra was obligated to pay under its existing December supply contract said Mark Rosenbury chief administrative officer We looked at these current prices and said This is crazy he said Terra hasnt disclosed the profit it will make selling its gas but Rosenbury said it would be substantial In coming months Terras good fortune could be reversed It usually buys gas a month at a time and the prices for January delivery most likely will be well above its breakeven point That would keep Terras plants closed Rosenbury said but eliminate the opportunity to sell the natural gas at a profit If this persists Rosenbury said its going to be a real problem He estimates that out of a total annual US production capacity of million tons of ammonia about million tons of production isnt operating now Could we be short of fertilizer next spring Its possible that farmers will not have as much as they want Rosenbury said RoysterClark Inc a Norfolk and New York Citybased fertilizer manufacturer and distributor has shut down its one plant in East Dubuque Ill indefinitely and production workers will be laid off beginning next month The story is the same natural gas prices are too high to justify continued production We believe its likely this is a speculative bubble in natural gas prices that will burst and in a few weeks well be able to buy gas at a more reasonable price but that remains to be seen said Paul M Murphy the companys managing director for financial planning A continuation of high natural gas prices would likely shrink production and raise fertilizer prices to a point that could affect farmers decisions to plant feed corn he said Its sticker shock According to Wyss if this winter remains unusually cold and natural gas remains above per million cubic feet double the level a year ago farm products could rise significantly a year from now and into In the aluminum industry several smaller producers have joined Kaiser the industrys No manufacturer in closing down noted Lloyd OCarroll an analyst with BBT Capital Markets in Richmond Aluminum production in November was percent below that of November and Decembers production will be lower still he said Well get more production cut announcements I think he said A slowing in the US and world economies next year could ease the impact of reduced aluminum supplies But if the world economy doesnt fall completely apart then aluminum prices are going to rise and they could rise significantly more than the current forecast he said In Kaisers case its an open question how much of its electric windfall it will keep Kaiser is contractually entitled to buy electricity from Bonneville at a megawatt per hour says spokesman Scott Lamb That is the power it has sold back to Bonneville for a megawatt hour for December But the Bonneville Authority is pressuring Kaiser to use these and future profits from power resales to compensate employees at the shutdown plants to invest in new electric generating capacity or even to refund to Bonnevilles other customers said Bonneville spokesman Ed Mosey Kaiser and Bonneville have negotiated a new power purchase deal to take effect after next October but the power authority says it intends to reduce deliveries to Kaiser if the company tries to pocket the electricity sale profits Out here a deal is a deal but it has to be a moral deal There has to be an ethical dimension to this and were not shy in trying to make sure they live up their advantage in

The Carlyle Groups Scarlet Letter By Lloyd Grove Washington Post Staff Writer Tuesday May Page C The Carlyle Group the Washingtonbased global investment firm boasts an enviable roster of worldclass financiers including former defense secretary Frank Carlucci former secretary of state James Baker former budget director Richard Darman and former British prime minister John Major But as of last Friday it no longer enjoys the services of junior analyst Peter Chung whose international fame is starting to rival that of his elders and betters The Posts Carrie Johnson reports that the yearold Chung a economics graduate of Princeton University who had worked for Merrill Lynch in New York before joining Carlyle was ordered to resign from his job in the firms Seoul office after he sent a shockingly vulgar email detailing his sexual ambitions in South Korea After it was sent last Tuesday Chungs email proliferated all over the Internet headlining the online industry newsletter PrivateEquityCentralnet and made the grayly eminent Carlyle Group blush deep crimson So Ive been in Korea for about a week and a half now and what can I say LIFE IS GOOD Chung emailed a dozen friends Ive got a spanking brand new sq foot bedroom apt Why do I need bedrooms Good question the main bedroom is for my queen size bed where CHUNG is going to bleep every hot chick in Korea over the next years down left to go the second bedroom is for my harem of chickies and the third bedroom is for all of you bleepers when you come out to visit my butt in Korea CHUNG is KING of his domain here in Seoul Last Thursday when Chungs email found its way back to headquarters the ax fell quickly Carlyle Managing Director David Rubenstein told The Posts Johnson I can confirm on the record that hes no longer an employee Chungs former colleagues remained puzzled yesterday by his message A Carlyle source told Johnson Hed only been here five days Ask Merrill Lynch if he did anything like this Merrill Lynch spokesman Joe Cohen told us We have no comment on any statements made or activities taken after Mr Chung left Merrill Lynch But Cohen confirmed that Chung was a summer intern in and and then a fulltime employee in New York from July to April Our calls to Chung were not returned yesterday His younger brother Patrick told us We have no comment at this time Hes still in Seoul May New York Times An EMail Boast to Friends Puts Executive Out of Work By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN Hold on Do not press send A young clickhappy financial executive is wishing that he had never touched his computers left mouse button last Tuesday Paul Chung a recently hired associate at the Carlyle Group in its office in Seoul South Korea was forced to resign on Friday after boasting about his sexual exploits and lavish lifestyle in an email message to buddies at Merrill Lynch in New York where he used to work Unfortunately for Mr Chung a yearold Princeton graduate who had moved to Seoul three days earlier to start his job the message was forwarded or passed on to thousands of people on Wall Street and wound up being sent to his bosses at Carlyle the private equity firm Mr Chung was given the option of resigning or being dismissed a Carlyle executive said The message which was retitled Amazing Cautionary Tale by a banking analyst meandered in and out of email boxes around the world I know I was a stud in NYC but I pretty much get about on average phone numbers a night and at least hot chicks that say that they want to go home with me every night I go out I love the buy side Mr Chung wrote in the message using the companys network He bragged about his spanking brand new sq foot three bedroom apt with a sq foot terrace He bragged that he used one bedroom for his harem and another for other sexual exploits Mr Chung also boasted about his job I have bankers calling me every day with opportunities he wrote and they pretty much cater to my every whim you know golfing events lavish dinners a night out clubbing Reached by telephone in Seoul Mr Chung said Its devastating I really cant comment Sorry Mr Chung is the latest in a string of employees to lose their jobs or be publicly embarrassed by a sexually explicit email message that was forwarded to others In a much publicized email message last year that made its way to hundreds of thousands of inboxes an employee of a British Internet provider wrote to her boyfriend about a sex act Employees of many different companies that passed the message along to friends were dismissed David M Rubenstein a founder and managing director of the Carlyle Group had no comment The Carlyle Group is known for its investments in military companies and its prominent list of advisers including Arthur Levitt the former chairman of the Securities and

THE DUST By ERICA COPULSKY NY POST May Subject The Story Gone Awry of a Private Equity Stud Another Wall Streeter apparently fell victim to the perils of the Digital Age last week when an associate from prominent Washington DC investment firm Carlyle Group reportedly was forced to resign after a risqu email he sent to friends became a chain letter among investment banks around the world The incident began innocently enough when a Peter Chung who represented himself to be a junior staffer in Carlyles Seoul office sent an email to friends boasting of the lavish lifestyle and sexual exploits he is enjoying in his new buyside position In a May email obtained by The Post Living Like A King Chung brags in lewd detail about how he gets on average phone numbers a night and how at least hot chicks that want to go home with him every time he goes out He goes on saying he loves the buyside because bankers pretty much cater to my every whim you know golfing events lavish dinners a night out clubbing He concludes the email by asking his friends to send him condoms by FedEx because he was running out of them The executive was forced to resign from Carlyle Friday less than two weeks after his hiring according to Net news service PrivateEquityCentralnet Carlyle partner David Rubenstein did not return repeated phone messages Chung could not be reached However in a May email purportedly sent by him to a friend he denied writing the email that sparked the controversy That email quickly circulated to hundreds of eager readers who in some cases added their own mocking commentaries One reader called the email kind of a pimpin aint easy version of the Uberconsumer from several years back Another marked it as a lesson of why one should never put anything in print The most biting satire entitled The True Story of a Private Equity Stud urged recipients of the email to contact former Secretary of State James Baker a senior counselor at Carlyle Carlyle Associate Resigns Following Raunchy EMail Incident By David Snow May A junior professional in The Carlyle Groups Seoul office was forced to resign Friday after a raunchy email he sent to friends was forwarded to thousands of people around the world The junior professional an associate sent the message on May to friends via his Carlyle email account In the message the associate expressed excitement about his new position with the Washington DCbased private equity giant But the associate mostly described in bawdy detail the lavish lifestyle and various sexual conquests he enjoyed as a young buyside professional The email made its way to thousands of financial professionals and others around the world and two days later made it to top partners at The Carlyle Group according to a source familiar with the situation Carlyle executives found the email totally inappropriate the source said and were particularly concerned about the mocking commentary that accompanied the message as it was sent from person to person One lengthy commentary described private equity professionals as arrogant and profiting from the hoarding of capital and satirically urged recipients of the forwarded message to contact Carlyle senior counselor James Baker The email highlighted the firm in a very negative way and it was taken very seriously the source said The associate resigned last Friday after having been employed by Carlyle for less than two weeks The Carlyle incident is similar to the Brad and Claire incident that originated in London late last year in which an employee of law firm Norton Rose forwarded to friends an explicit email from his lover The message was forwarded to an estimated million people and eventually made it to the front pages of the British tabloids The Norton Rose employee was subsequently disciplined but not fired In his email the Carlyle associate bragged about having investment bankers cater to my every whim you know golfing events lavish dinners a night out clubbing He said his goal was to sleep with every hot chick in Korea Carlyles Seoul office responsible for leading Carlyles million investment in KorAm Bank of South Korea last year its largest deal

an investment banker is someone in private equity Investment bankers pride themselves on making vast amounts of money but a successful private equity professional takes devilish pride and supports an even bigger ego for working fewer hours while making even more money than his rarely her investment banking brethren Unfortunately some members of the private equity community mistakenly believe that their growing wealth is the result of their own talent and charming personality rather than a simple profiting from the hoarding of capital as Karl Marx so astutely described Consider the plight of Peter Chung see attached email a recent hire at the Carlyle Group After completing his twoyear stint as an Analyst at Merrill Lynch Chung was persuaded to seek out new opportunities in Korea working as part of Carlyles vast Asian investment team Working at a private equity firm allows Chung to check out Korean night clubs which would be legally classified as brothels in the United States times a week though Chung made it clear that he needs only two months to learn a little bit of the buyside business so he can begin nightly visits Already a selfdescribed stud on the New York City dating scene Chung looked to the emerging island of Korea where the standard of living for young foreign men is bolstered by the low per capita income of native residents roughly per person By making in excess of ten times the average national wage Chung quickly found himself to be quite the ladies man as the locals were attracted to his fat wallet and US citizenship Thus bolstered by an initial rendezvous or two Chung decided to cement his legacy by setting out on the quixotic mission to sleep with all of the fine women of Korea As of May Chung alludes to having had sexual relations with five hot chicks According to Chungs own calculations there are roughly one billion hot chicks remaining in Korea Clearly there is a break in Chungs sexual predator model as he apparently believes that not only is the global female population of billion comprised of hot Korean chicks but he will be able to sleep with that many before his finest member falls off or he dies of exhaustion Sadly Chung cannot complete his mission alone The quality of prophylactics in Korea are not quite up to US standards Chung would probably claim Korean condoms are too small and he needs your help to continue his quest for infamy If you would like to contribute to this valiant mission please direct your gift of a FDAapproved domes to the address below Peter Chung The Carlyle Group Suite CCMM Bldg Yoidodong

Jim VandeHei Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc WASHINGTON President Bushs chief political strategist owns hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of stock in companies potentially affected by the presidents top legislative priorities newly released federal records show Karl Rove one of the presidents most trusted advisers on almost every major legislative initiative owns between and of stock in Enron Corp Pfizer Inc General Electric Co Boeing Co and Johnson Johnson among other holdings Federal law requires public officials to report their assets income and debts in broad ranges only All of these companies could be affected by one or more of the policies or legislative initiatives on which the president consults Mr Rove tax cuts increased defense spending an industryoriented energy policy and healthcare reform Mr Rove said yesterday that he has been waiting for several months for approval from the Office of Government Ethics to sell all of his stock holdings and roll the proceeds into a diversified account without having to pay capitalgains taxes as permitted by federal law In the meantime I have had to avoid being involved in matters that specifically and materially affect my specific holdings Mr Rove said Mr Rove said he filed his financial disclosure reports Dec and was later informed by the Office of Government Ethics that he should sell all of his stock holdings to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest But the government ethics office which couldnt be reached for comment yesterday has yet to officially grant Mr Rove a certificate of divestiture which would allow him to roll his proceeds into diversified accounts according to White House spokeswoman Anne Womack It appears that Mr Rove has lost tens of thousands of dollars as a result of the delay because most of his stocks have lost value since the beginning of the year Mr Rove insisted that he has been careful to avoid any discussions that directly affect companies he is invested in as federal conflictofinterest laws require But that cant be easy for Mr Rove widely regarded as one of the most powerful and influential figures in the White House Mr Rove serves as the presidents top political adviser and runs the administrations longterm strategy team He is also the presidents top liaison to outside groups including corporations Hes involved in virtually every decision that is made here says a White House aide It is unclear how many times if ever Mr Rove recused himself from discussion inside the White House President Bush already under fire from Democrats for his administrations close ties to industry is likely to draw more scrutiny as a result of the new disclosures of financial links between top White House officials and major US corporations especially energy firms The White House disclosed the personal finances of Mr Rove and several other top administration officials at the behest of the media It appears that as a result of an administrative backlog Mr Rove is the only member of the senior staff who hasnt been given the green light to sell his stock according to a White House aide The reports show that Mr Rove was one of several White House officials with a financial connection past or present with Enron and other energy companies Larry Lindsey the presidents top economic adviser who helped draft the energy plan received from Enron in for consulting work he did for the company the documents show Lewis Libby chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney who

than energy Imagine the news stories a few years from now Crisis hangover energy stocks sink as prices plunge But California consumers still stuck with high bills The energy industry is suffering its worst downturn since the supply glut of the s as dozens of big new power plants come on line and the justcompleted Alaskan gas pipeline sends natural gas prices to their lowest levels in six years The one bright spot for Texas generators is California where consumers are locked into longterm contracts for wholesale electricity that the state signed at the peak of its blackouts in the summer of Sacramento lawmakers have appealed to President Daschle to help get the state off the hook arguing that California will never claw its way out of its economic slump if businesses continue to flee to states where energy is cheap But top Enron lobbyist Gray Davis a former governor of California warned Daschle that suppliers would have little choice but to go to court to enforce the contracts the state signed Washington and Sacramento are agog with the energy crisis and bursting at the seams with plans to fix it But the one thing no one even environmentalists suggests is letting high energy prices discourage energy consumption or encourage new supplies To economists letting the price rise is the solution said Paul Portney president of Resources for the Future a Washington think tank To elected representatives having the price go up is the problem Political memories tend to be selective and short But it was the energy glut of the s that contributed to Californias blackouts gasoline and amonth heating bills Likewise high prices are now laying the seeds of their own destruction As a story in the New York Times noted an energy investment boom promises a cyclical increase in supplies that is expected to stabilize or reduce prices in coming months many industry executives and private analysts say Through much of the s there was a glut of energy Fuel of all kinds was really cheap How cheap Adjusted for inflation as cheap as in economists calculate Energy is the oxygen of the economy and rockbottom prices contributed to the long economic boom But low prices also caused energy production to slump and consumption to soar People ditched their economy cars for SUVs Houses got bigger ceilings got higher and kitchens sprouted industrial stoves with enough BTUs to melt aluminum Stores offices and homes turned into summertime refrigerators Low prices discouraged energy development Oil was so cheap for so long that people were selling their refineries Portney said You had virtually no exploration for new natural gas when prices were at a BTU As demand soared and supply fell prices rose Profits have grown so robust that green fuels such as biomass and wind are becoming economically viable The oil industry is booming Refineries are expanding The longdelayed construction of a natural gas pipeline from Alaska now looks likely So many power plants are under

currency obligations at BBplus a notch above Moodys Investors Service and Standard Poors cited concerns about fiscal policy privatisation and deterioration in foreign investment climate However economists speculated it could either be on account of Fitch adjusting its ratings in line with other global agencies or a fallout of US energy giant Enron Corps threat to exit an Indian power venture

Singapore on Tuesday to try and settle differences over continued support to a controversial billion power project in India Representatives of some of the worlds largest banks like Citibank ABN AMRO and Bank of America will be at the meeting Indian lenders like the Industrial Development Bank of India State Bank of India and ICICI will also participate Market analysts speculate that the meeting will attempt to forge a joint stand on supporting the project which now produces MW of power and is slated to increase it to MW shortly in its second phase But it comes against a backdrop of rising tension between Dabhol and the Indian state utility the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB which is the sole buyer of Dabhols electricity Indian lenders who have lent the bulk of the funds to the plant want to continue supporting the project But they are being opposed by offshore lenders who want to withdraw their loans Loans of around million of the offshore lenders are covered by guarantees provided by Indian institutions The Indian lenders fearing for their profitability if the foreign banks pull the plug plan to oppose any such move But they have been forced on the backfoot by MSEBs decision last week to stop buying power from Dabhol and terminate its contract with the company under which it agreed to lift the entire output The MSEB has complained that Dabhol produces costly power while Dabhol has blamed MSEB for defaulting on payments worth million Last month Dabhol issued a preliminary notice to terminate its contract to sell power It has also filed for arbitration in London This provoked MSEB to haul Dabhol before a local regulatory body the Maharashtra State Electricity Regulatory Commission MERC which issued a temporary order staying the arbitration proceedings The dispute has already affected Indias image among foreign investors Last week global rating agency Moodys expressed concern over slippage in the Indian governments reform programme and cited the Enrons dispute as an example that the country may be losing credibility with foreign investors The dispute indicates that Indias government may not be willing to live up to its contractual obligations As a consequence this would further deter foreign direct investment from coming into the country Moodys said Indias federal Power Minister Suresh Prabhu tried to dispel those fears in an interview with Reuters on Sunday India is always in favour of making sure that international contracts are respected he said There is no need for concern Indian rupees Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved INDIA UPDATE Indias Prabhu says power reforms enter new phase By Clarence Fernandez Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited BOMBAY June Reuters Indias reforms of its sputtering power sector have entered a new phase with plans afoot to free up private supply overhaul debtridden state utilities and recraft tariffs Power Minister Suresh Prabhu told Reuters With investors fears fanned by a squabble between US energy giant Enron Corp and a local utility Prabhu said in an interview late on Sunday that India is standing behind international contracts Sanctity of contracts has to be kept Prabhu said The row began late last year when the utility in western Maharashtra state defaulted on payments of million to Dabhol Power Company percent owned by Enron The MW power project is Indias largest foreign investment at billion Prabhu has vowed to take Indian reforms in a new direction Absolutely he said in reply to a question whether Indias reforms have entered a different phase The Power Ministry will now also focus on power distribution he added besides its early preoccupation with generation needs In India unfortunately for the last yearsreforms policy was skewed in favour of generation he said We never really realised that distribution is the more important part of the process Prabhu added We have now decided we will make enough structural changes in distribution so that at the end of distribution enough investment is made CHARTERED ACCOUNTANT A chartered accountant Prabhu hails from the verdant regions of Indias western coastal strand and chaired a cooperative bank that was one of the countrys largest in terms of deposits before his foray into politics An errant lock of hair straying across his forehead Prabhu eschews the Indian politicians traditional uniform of starched white handspun cotton for the shirtsleeves and trousers preferred by the professionals who have entered government and whom local media call technocrats Prabhu said India has decided to allow private producers to sell power direct to consumers lifting curbs that have hobbled the countrys decadeold reform effort He said the question of power affordability had spurred him to ask Indias states to permit thirdparty sales of power which analysts have called a stumblingblock for foreign investment They cannot force a generator to sell power only to the SEBs and thats a major change we are trying to make Prabhu said referring to the states SEBs or state electricity boards are owned by the state governments and supply power to most of India India estimates that MW of fresh capacity will have to be installed over the next years to meet its power needs Most of the billion in funds that will be required will have to come from foreign private investment But Indias spotty reform record over the last decade has made investors wary Bureaucratic procedures legal delays and political wrangling have held up reform moves RATING REVISED TO NEGATIVE Last week global rating agency Fitch revised Indias sovereign rating outlook to negative from stable citing fiscal concerns the slow pace of privatisation and deterioration in the countrys foreign investment climate Competing agency Moodys sees signs of slippage in the reforms and Standard Poors has expressed worries over Indias budget deficit Prabhu said he wants to overhaul state power utilities by introducing standard accounting policies cutting transmission and distribution losses to percent and tackling crushing debt thus helping to lure foreign investment into the sector The poor financial health of the utilities expected to run up combined losses of about billion in the fiscal year has proved a hurdle in efforts to draw private investment Prabhu said an expert panel examining ways to restructure SEB finances looking at technical commercial and tariff issues is expected to report within a few weeks For the first time we will be preparing commercial data which is internationally accepted We will be preparing technical data which is internationally appreciable And thirdly well be creating an information base which will be created by experts and then made available to the states he said The utilities transmission and distribution losses run to up to percent of the electricity they generate compared to a figure of about eight percent internationally he said Prabhu wants to trim this to about percent within two or three years In the case of India I am willing to accept a figure of percent to percent because to bring it below that will be technically feasible but commercially unviable he added Other steps to tone up power generation include attempts to link the eastern region with the rest of India efforts to boost plant load factors through modernisation of equipment and to persuade people to use energy more efficiently Prabhu said he is building political will to support these moves through a programme to tell consumers why they can no longer get power

site on June For failing to live up to expectation of the Nigerian government and the people as regard its role in the Independent Power Project IPP initiated by the Lagos State government two years ago Enron the American firm got a hard knock from President Olusegun Obasanjo at the weekend June In his conclusion Obasanjo accused Enron a major player in the electricity project of poor performance and bad faith Ostensibly angry at the delay in the projects full takeoff and the MW recently connected to the national grid from the scheme the president on the American Cable News Network CNN declared Enron has played a dirty game on us Dirty game in two ways Beside putting up an exorbitant price the company according to the president also failed to comply with the terms of the contract Continuing Obasanjo said The price at which they Enron have tried to sell power to us has been very exorbitant Two what they told us they would do they have not done While refusing to disclose the firms charges Enron VicePresident of Marketing John Ambler said the primary objective of the company was to get the project on stream We have a project that is very close to coming on line he said stressing that the companys desire is to see the project work effectively in Nigeria especially in Lagos He added that Enron is committed to the IPP and assured Lagosians that they would soon begin to feel the impact The state government brought forward the June deadline it set for the commencement of the first phase of the project when it fired the first MW of electricity to the national grid two weeks ago At the Government House on May Governor Bola Tinubu said his administration and the contracting firm felt that there was no harm in bringing the date forward and assured that another MW would be added soon He noted that contrary to expectations that the project would cover the entire state at a go it would be in phases and the focus for now would be industrial consumption The concentration for now is not as private homes we would soon get there Tinubu assured The controversial IPP programme which the federal government had at one time been accused of frustrating has suffered several setbacks including Enrons initial plan to sell its shares to AES another American company Last April was originally fixed for the projects takeoff but the failure of Trevi a construction company in charge of transmitters caused a shift in the date Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved India India and Bush Administration Beyond assumptions Business Line The Hindu Copyright C Kasturi Sons Ltd KSL Source World Reporter TM Asia Intelligence Wire SOON after Mr George W Bush Jr won the US elections Indian observers proclaimed quickly that a Republican administration bodes good for India A Republican administration was expected to not pester India about human rights violations in Kashmir not force it to sign the CTBT and get tougher with China Mr George Bushs decision to drop by the External Affairs Minister Mr Jaswant Singhs meeting with the American National Security Advisor Ms Condoleezza Rice seemed to somehow confirm this false sense of euphoria This narrow thinking fails to understand the drivers of Republican ideology The reality is the Republicans care about a range of issues that will force the BJP Government to make some difficult decisions Take the first issue of human rights violations in Kashmir It is true there are many isolationists in the Republican Party who probably do not care about human rights violation in Kashmir so long as it does not affect them and is not happening in their backyard But there is another powerful force in Republican politics the religious wing This includes powerful members of the US Cabinet such as The AttorneyGeneral Mr John Ashcroft who are Christian fundamentalists Mr Bush himself claims to be a born again Christian The religious right is rarely interested in foreign policy it mostly concerns itself with moral and social issues such as abortion and teenage pregnancy But the few times it does intervene it is when it feels a country is persecuting Christians And when it does intervene no Republican administration dares cross it For instance China is periodically identified as a country that persecutes Christians Christian missionaries and ministers are routinely harassed and imprisoned because they are trying to spread their religion Because of this issue Republican members of the Christian right in Congress have all but declared a religious war on China routinely opposing any attempt to improve relations including trade relations with that country India as an emerging power is more carefully watched and frequently mentioned in the American press Stories of Christian missionaries being burnt alive and nuns raped are attributed to elements associated with the Hindu fundamentalist ruling party In its latest human rights report the US State Department noted these acts with concern The Popes mention of these issues to the Prime Minister Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee was also noted in the American press India is perhaps half a step away from being branded as a country that persecutes Christians A selfprofessed bornagain Christian like Mr George Bush would quickly take up the Christian rights cause trumping all other bilateral issues Human rights may not matter to the isolationists but Christian and to a lesser extent Jewish religious freedom matters tremendously to a Republican administration The second fallacy was that since the Republicans in Congress did not pass the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty they would not force other countries to pass the CTBT either But why are the Republicans are opposed to the CTBT The opponents of the CTBT feel that it fails to safeguard American security They frankly care little about Indian security They would love to be able to restrict Indias ability to test and use its weapons To them nuclear weapons not in American hands translates into an unsafe world Unless India manages to convince the Republicans otherwise the Republican administration is likely to tighten the antiproliferation screws on India The third fallacy relates to a tough longterm strategic realignment the Bush Administration will demand of India Mr Bushs foreign policymakers are unreconstructed Cold Warriors In the postCold War era they are desperately searching for an enemy They appear to have settled on China as the next enemy Their next step is to search for allies who rarely challenge their views Thinkers in Washington and New Delhi believe that India and the US are natural allies But such a decision has an enormous range of longterm consequences for India To discuss just a few Most of the Indian militarys equipment comes from Russia and the former Soviet Union Allying with the US will be seen by the Russians as abandoning them and this could have an enormous impact on the legacy military equipment Recent noises from the Foreign Ministry suggest India is also eager about Mr George Bushs proposed missile defence programme But this technology is far from proven and during the decade over which it may be developed if it gets past Congress China will most certainly develop many nuclear weapons These may primarily be a deterrent against the US but it will force India into an arms buildup it can barely afford The Americans are reserving their missile defence system for their closest allies India today is neither fish nor fowl not quite a threat but not quite an ally either It is unlikely that India will be able to convince the Americans to give it the defence system Even if the Americans agree to sell it to India it could never afford the sticker price So before it rejoices at the notion of antiChina hawks in the White House let India ponder over the unexamined consequences The final issue is one that may precipitate in the very near term Enron and Maharashtra find themselves in a dispute that neither wants to lose and that appears to be rapidly getting shriller Mr George Bushs background is as a Texas oilman and he is widely accused in the US of being beholden to the interests of the energy industry In fact they were among the biggest contributors to his campaign The Enron Chairman Mr Kenneth Lay is a friend of Mr Bushs and was seriously considered for a job in his Cabinet He is so well connected that he was recently accused of influencing who is appointed by the White House to regulate the energy industry In the near term Mr Bush could quite possibly lean heavily on New Delhi to make sure that Enrons interests are not neglected If New Delhi does not respond to his satisfaction his opinion of India and consequently his administrations dealings with the country are likely to be coloured far more than we think Giridhar Srinivasan Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved Enrons Indian Creditors Seek to Salvage Dabhol Project New York
