is a significant task involving a good deal of data entry time This is not a task I can help you with due to limited time left at Enron November is my last day Unfortunately for you the folks in Oslo moved quickly and have arranged for me to spend next week working with them In the remaining week after that I will be able to give you advice on how to do the job but not do any of the real hard work for you I suggest you start by setting up a few hydro and thermal stations perhaps of each in two different regions This will ensure you have the basic requirements OK once you have got it to solve There are some example models included in the setup files Case is a good one with one hydro included The graphical user interface is not too bad and is available in both Spanish and English You need to enter Demand data Fuel prices for at least one fuel Basic hydro data only MW cumecMW topology data Basic thermal data MW heat rate fuel type Inflow data weekly or monthly data Set up an area interchange constraint by limiting flows from some group of plants Do you think this strategy is feasible Tom Original Message From Gumucio Jorge Sent Thursday October PM To Halliburton Tom Cc Vince J NRON Rosenberg David Poole Julian Subject Re ModReg for Argentina Hi Tom Thanks for the prompt and accurate evaluation of what MODREG does I know about you leaving Enron and what your schedules looks like so I think I will try to make the best use of time and resources in order to have an SDDP model up and running for Argentina In the meeting we had with Vince K and after reviewing the calibration exercise run with MODREG we have decided to Set up the Argentinean system into the SDDP model I would like to know what information you need in order to get this done Run the calibration exercise with the SDDP model in order to compare results Feed the model with actual data hydro generation Exports from January to June and get the output for Prices Thermal Generation ExportsImports Please find attached the presentation regarding MODREG and the calibration results I will be talking to the consultants in order to get more information in some topics we need further research such as Transmission losses forced dispatched units and gas availability Please contact me so I can start gathering all you need to get the model running Regards Jorge Gumucio File Modregcalibrationppt From Tom nronXgate on PM CDT To Remi nron David M nron Jorge nron cc Vince J nronXgate Zimin nronXgate Subject ModReg for Argentina Folks Heres some preliminary comments on the model we are using for Argentina Please correct me on any misunderstandings ModReg was written by consultants in Buenos Aires Documentation is available in Spanish only All data input is by means of text files which require column orientated input ie numbers must go into specific columns Detailed documentation has been provided specifying the data format for each file A weekly time step is used with five load blocks per week and a time horizon of one year typically Each model run requires about hours of processing ModReg is a modified version of the model used by the grid operator It is coded in Fortran and requires a CPLEX licence CPLEX is a powerful linear programming solver developed by ILOG As the model is written in Fortran the very good higher level interface to CPLEX is not available so the code will have to access CPLEX at a lower level We have no documentation describing how the model algorithms Source code is not available at present ModReg appears to model around busses and lines Lines are characterised by from bus number to bus number maximum MW capacity in each direction a percentage loss factor cost of transmission in each direction and some other details Demand data is specified by week and load block for each bus Thermal plants have a heat rate and maintenance schedule specified with the possibility of multiple fuels I understand that hydro generation schedules for each historical inflow condition are an input to the model as they are calculated elsewhere From the above it appears that we have an unsatisfactory situation ModReg is difficult to use we do not know in detail what the model does we do not have documentation describing the algorithm because source code is not available we are completely dependent on the consultants If Enron is to continue modeling Argentina we should as a minimum have a model that we understand is reasonably easy to use and is documented A graphical user interface is really needed to make ModReg easier to use Documentation is of course essential We should not use a model developed by consultants without documentation These steps would enable us to have more confidence in model results and shortens the learning curve to enable more people to use model SDDP is likely to be a suitable replacement It would require reseroir inflow data rather than the calculated generations The regional loads etc could be modeled using the DC loadflow feature with zero impedance lines Transmission losses in SDDP are a quadratic function of power flows so some guesses would have to be made for line resistence values Setting up an SDDP model to represent all the aspects included in ModReg would be a time consuming job that would require a good undertanding of the data for both models Some direct cut and paste of data from one models files to the others will be possible with a suitable column oriented text editor However the end result would be a model with the desirable attributes of documention GUI interface and flexible
