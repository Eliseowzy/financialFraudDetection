Leopold Of DOW JON ES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow JonesFederal energy regulators may investigate whether the operator of Californias wholesale electricity market has been manipula ting its powerpurchasing practices to reduce the costs of power the state purchased under longterm contracts according to documents obtained Friday by Dow Jones Newswires Friday At issue is whether the California Independent System Operator has violated its own market rules by purchasing expensive power secured by the state un der contracts rather than cheaper power available in the spot market The s tates need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has pro ven embarrassing for Gov Gray Davis who signed billion in deals to he ad off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in California Monday to address generators complaints The energy companies say that the California ISOs purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out of line with the market according to a letter sent by Andrea Wolfman lead FERC counsel for market oversight and enforcement The letter was sent to the ISO the California Department of Water Resource s which has been buying power in lieu of the states struggling utilities since midJanuary and several generators all of which were to attend th e meeting Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedu res of the California ISO as they have had to change in the last nine mont hs are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market st ructure Wolfman said in her letter The purpose of the meeting is to dev elop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling and dispatch generators utilities CDWR on appropriate practices and pr ocedures ISO Procedures Need Explaining FERC The ISOs main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance on the states electrical grid As part of that job the ISO determines wh ich power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from If the ISO cant explain how it makes its decisions FERC may conduct an au dit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated the market Wolfmans office said As discussed FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational aud it of CAISO a second letter from FERCs market oversight and enforcement division states This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could lead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and other practices by the ISO should be investigated The ISOs operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest po wer first The information that generators have provided all leads to a theory that the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus DWR powe r at high prices and protect Gov Davis from political embarrassment the second letter says The ISO has said only that
