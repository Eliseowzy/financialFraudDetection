to answer some of them unfortunately quite few of the terms are complicated and may need further explanation Please feel free to add or improve upon my answers Legacy is anything that has been existence for a long time and handed down from previous generations In the world of telecom there are many different legacies including legacy application legacy card legacy data legacy LAN and legacy equipment There is no precise category of legacy items in short legacy is anything that is outdated but too expensive to replace See for an example Enterprise are companies or retail customers Contrast with wholesale customers which are mainly capacity carriers like Level Global Crossing RBOCS IXCS etc I am not sure what is meant by recommended standard Singlemode fiber SMF is an optical fiber with diameter of to microns about th of an inch used for high speed transmission over long distances It provides greater bandwidth and lower dispersion than multimode fiberdiameter of to microns The next generation of SMF are highspeed data optimized fibers like Cornings LEAF and Lucents TrueWave These new fibers have wider core and better dispersionattenuation characteristics to allow more traffic to travel over longer distances with out having to be amplified The fiber core is the part of the fiber that actually carries the light signal transmission Existing fiber networks of incumbents such as ATT MCI Worldcom and Sprint are largely made up of the older SMF legacy fibers while the new bandwidth barons such as Level Global Crossing Qwest and EBS have deployed the latest SMF IRU Indefeasible Right of Use is a term used in the underseas cable and fiber optic business An IRU is mainly composed of the following elements a Basis of offer transfer of asset ownership of fiber to the buyer In some respects IRUs is similar to real estate acquisition in which ownership of a physical entity passes from seller to buyer by the execution of a contract b Ownership period usually for the planned life of a cable and is determined by the seller Typically a cable life span would be or years However cable life cycles will probably shorten in the near future due to the more rapid pace of the innovation in fiber and photonic engineering c Deposits It is usual for a nonrefundable deposit to be requested by the seller at the time of executing contracts in most cases this is of the purchase price d OM costs OM charges are normally a recurring annual charge payable to the seller or third party OM contractor to cover both costs of daily and emergency maintenance The charges are usually escalated to inflation and to the additional costs associated with cable aging The information transmitted along the various capacities are s and s the digitalized equivalent of voice data or video It is common to express the capacity of a digital transmission medium by the speed or rate at which it is able to transmit digital information A single voice transmission normally operates at kbs a T or a DS the consequent digital signals are all based on the number of DS channels DS standards was developed in North American and is mainly used for copper lines A fiber optics became mainstream SONET Synchronous Optical Network was adopted as a standard for connecting fiberoptic transmission systems SONET is the lowest level of the OSI protocol model the physical layer it is a method of providing a roadway or path that can be used by a variety of traffic sources and protocols In many ways SONET is completely neutral to the content or higher level protocols in the traffic stream itself Basic foundation of SONET consist of DS signal that are multiplexed to create kbps known as STS Synchronous transport signal STS is an electrical signal rate that corresponds to optical carrier line rate of OC building blocks With the older DS systems signals cant jump from DS to DS instead a steps process must be taken which involves adding overhead to the transmission With Sonet higher capacities can be created by interleaving STS signals to create a concatenated or linked signal For example three STS frames can form an STS frame Mbitssec Rates above STS can be created by either directly multiplexing STS signals or by byteinterleaving STS signals SONET can also handle signals below Mbitssec A structure called VT virtual tributary accommodates DS DS and E European equivalent of T at Mbits ATM is Short for Asynchronous Transfer Mode a network technology based on transferring data in cells or packets of a fixed size The cell used with ATM is relatively small compared to units used with older technologies ATM creates a fixed channel or route between two points whenever data transfer begins This differs from TCPIP in which messages are divided into packets and each packet can take a different route from source to destination This difference makes it easier to track and bill data usage across an ATM network but it makes it less adaptable to sudden surges in network traffic ATM is designed specifically to operates with SONET as the transport While new entrants such as Level built its network based on pure IP technology it is still using ATM to link up its core locations The trouble with IP currently is the QoS and delay issues In the future however with advanced protocols such as MPLS routers are expected to eliminate ATM in the network MPLS is an extension of IP and it provides QoS similar to ATM For new entrants the long term goal is to replace the legacy system SONET and ATM with IP over DWDM which is more efficient and lower cost transport SDH is European equivalent of SONET bidirectional line switched ring BLSR SONET operates in several different modes A major distinction in operation is whether the service is deployed in a linear fashion or as one of several ring types There are two types of SONET ring One switches individual paths path switched and the other switches the entire optical line capacity line switched A key difference is the number of fibers used Path switched rings use only two fibers while line switching can use either two or four fibers Four fiber bidirectional line switching sends traffic only in the required direction during normal operation Each direction has a working fiber and a protect fiber in each direction During a fiber interruption the traffic is routed around the break in the opposite direction hence the name bidirectional Throughput capacity is the actual amount of useful information which is transmitted It is used to measure the efficiency of a network Long haul means long distance long haul implies traversing states or countries as oppose to short haul rule A accounting rule in a case in which of the traffic is intrastate and the other interstate then the traffic is deemed to be interstate Susan M NRON PM To Margo nron cc Barbara A nron Donald LassereEnron nron Communications Jeff nron Lara LeibmanEnron nron Communications Marchris nron Mona L nron Ricardo nron

question What is the regulatory analysis of peering arrangments Peering is an act of establishing a relationship to pass Internet traffic between one national internet backbone provider to another national provider Peering is currently not subject to any industryspecific regulations and is governed by commericial requirements The reason that peering is not regulated by Federal Communications Commission or any other agency is mainly due to two factors data traffic has not been subjected to the same stringent regulation as voice traffic history of Internet Since it was the National Science Foundation NSF who founded the first backbone to encourage the exchange of information between different scientists and researchers the open environment for peering was essential to the rapid growth of the Internet Currently most of the Internet traffic is exchanged through private pooling instead of the public Network Access Point NAP With private peering traffic can be exchanged in the same city which avoids the classic sydrome in which traffic that orignates and terminates in Houston would have to travel through NY or even India Please note that peering is not be be confused with Interconnection in the PSTN which are very cumbersome and expensive May I also ask for what reason are you bringing up the topic of peering is there a deal involving this topic Please let me know if

Agenda Meeting for am Thursday January locationcallin to be announced I propose a hour meeting to try to regroup from the holidays and hopefully come up with a framework that will allow us to pick up the pace for future meetings Below is a proposed agenda Establish what we have learned to date Trading of private line and lambda service terminating in Japan unavoidably requires a local license held by local entity therefore trading of private line and lambda service terminating in Japan must be done by a local entity exposure to high Japanese tax and potential double tax reduced if Japan only has halfcircuit but this requires having multiple EBS parties to a trade and trading halfcircuits may not even be a commercial alternative a Master and a confirm must be bilateral ie there can be only be one counterparty on each side of the agreement thus a customer that wishes to trade an entire segment eg Tokyo to San Jose will have to execute two Masters and two confirms if the halfcircuit alternative is used US tax guidelines to avoid double tax on Japanese trading Trading of Australian bandwidth entails no license requirements Trading of Western European bandwidth entails no license requirements provided that no physical fiber is owned Trading US telecom capacity requires an FCC license EBS Inc has an FCC license No other affiliate of EBS Inc needs to acquire an FCC license IF that affiliate is directly or indirectly whollyowned by EBS Inc With regard to any IP transport deal we must have the counterparty enter into a separate Master agreement and confirm with each EBS entity involved in the transaction Thus in an IP transport deal involving numerous countries that require licensed local entities to provide local IP services the counterparty will be required to execute a Master with each of the local entities This is the ONLY feasible way from a legal standpoint to structure an IP transport deal but is not a very good solution None of the foregoing points raise significant accounting issues Other What are the important near term questions that remain to be answered and how long will it take to answer them Does private line and lambda trading of segments terminating in Hong Kong Singapore and India unavoidably require local license held by local entity If so is there any way to limit the problem Does IP transport constitute a telecommunications service that requires a license in Sao Paulo Tel Aviv Japan Singapore Hong Kong and India If so must that license be held by a local entity Does IP transit constitute a telecommunications service that requires a license in Sao Paulo Tel Aviv Japan Singapore Hong Kong and India If so must that license be held by a local entity What is the legal relationship of parties

question What is the regulatory analysis of peering arrangments Peering is an act of establishing a relationship to pass Internet traffic between one national internet backbone provider to another national provider Peering is currently not subject to any industryspecific regulations and is governed by commericial requirements The reason that peering is not regulated by Federal Communications Commission or any other agency is mainly due to two factors data traffic has not been subjected to the same stringent regulation as voice traffic history of Internet Since it was the National Science Foundation NSF who founded the first backbone to encourage the exchange of information between different scientists and researchers the open environment for peering was essential to the rapid growth of the Internet Currently most of the Internet traffic is exchanged through private pooling instead of the public Network Access Point NAP With private peering traffic can be exchanged in the same city which avoids the classic sydrome in which traffic that orignates and terminates in Houston would have to travel through NY or even India Please note that peering is not be be confused with Interconnection in the PSTN which are very cumbersome and expensive May I also ask for what reason are you bringing up the topic of peering is there a deal involving this topic Please let me know if

Agenda Meeting for am Thursday January locationcallin to be announced I propose a hour meeting to try to regroup from the holidays and hopefully come up with a framework that will allow us to pick up the pace for future meetings Below is a proposed agenda Establish what we have learned to date Trading of private line and lambda service terminating in Japan unavoidably requires a local license held by local entity therefore trading of private line and lambda service terminating in Japan must be done by a local entity exposure to high Japanese tax and potential double tax reduced if Japan only has halfcircuit but this requires having multiple EBS parties to a trade and trading halfcircuits may not even be a commercial alternative a Master and a confirm must be bilateral ie there can be only be one counterparty on each side of the agreement thus a customer that wishes to trade an entire segment eg Tokyo to San Jose will have to execute two Masters and two confirms if the halfcircuit alternative is used US tax guidelines to avoid double tax on Japanese trading Trading of Australian bandwidth entails no license requirements Trading of Western European bandwidth entails no license requirements provided that no physical fiber is owned Trading US telecom capacity requires an FCC license EBS Inc has an FCC license No other affiliate of EBS Inc needs to acquire an FCC license IF that affiliate is directly or indirectly whollyowned by EBS Inc With regard to any IP transport deal we must have the counterparty enter into a separate Master agreement and confirm with each EBS entity involved in the transaction Thus in an IP transport deal involving numerous countries that require licensed local entities to provide local IP services the counterparty will be required to execute a Master with each of the local entities This is the ONLY feasible way from a legal standpoint to structure an IP transport deal but is not a very good solution None of the foregoing points raise significant accounting issues Other What are the important near term questions that remain to be answered and how long will it take to answer them Does private line and lambda trading of segments terminating in Hong Kong Singapore and India unavoidably require local license held by local entity If so is there any way to limit the problem Does IP transport constitute a telecommunications service that requires a license in Sao Paulo Tel Aviv Japan Singapore Hong Kong and India If so must that license be held by a local entity Does IP transit constitute a telecommunications service that requires a license in Sao Paulo Tel Aviv Japan Singapore Hong Kong and India If so must that license be held by a local entity What is the legal relationship of parties to peering arrangements What is the regulatory analysis of peering arrangments What is the tax analysis of peering arrangments Other Update on Singapore Pioneer Status application Are there things

attempted to answer some of them unfortunately quite few of the terms are complicated and may need further explanation Please feel free to add or improve upon my answers Legacy is anything that has been existence for a long time and handed down from previous generations In the world of telecom there are many different legacies including legacy application legacy card legacy data legacy LAN and legacy equipment There is no precise category of legacy items in short legacy is anything that is outdated but too expensive to replace See for an example Enterprise are companies or retail customers Contrast with wholesale customers which are mainly capacity carriers like Level Global Crossing RBOCS IXCS etc I am not sure what is meant by recommended standard Singlemode fiber SMF is an optical fiber with diameter of to microns about th of an inch used for high speed transmission over long distances It provides greater bandwidth and lower dispersion than multimode fiberdiameter of to microns The next generation of SMF are highspeed data optimized fibers like Cornings LEAF and Lucents TrueWave These new fibers have wider core and better dispersionattenuation characteristics to allow more traffic to travel over longer distances with out having to be amplified The fiber core is the part of the fiber that actually carries the light signal transmission Existing fiber networks of incumbents such as ATT MCI Worldcom and Sprint are largely made up of the older SMF legacy fibers while the new bandwidth barons such as Level Global Crossing Qwest and EBS have deployed the latest

fiber to the buyer In some respects IRUs is similar to real estate acquisition in which ownership of a physical entity passes from seller to buyer by the execution of a contract b Ownership period usually for the planned life of a cable and is determined by the seller Typically a cable life span would be or years However cable life cycles will probably shorten in the near future due to the more rapid pace of the innovation in fiber and photonic engineering c Deposits It is usual for a nonrefundable deposit to be requested by the seller at the time of executing contracts in most cases this is of the purchase price d OM costs OM charges are normally a recurring annual charge payable to the seller or third party OM contractor to cover both costs of daily and emergency maintenance The charges are usually escalated to inflation and to the additional costs associated with cable aging The information transmitted along the various capacities are s and s the digitalized equivalent of voice data or video It is common to express the capacity of a digital transmission medium by the speed or rate at which it is able to transmit digital information A single voice transmission normally operates at kbs a T or a DS the consequent digital signals are all based on the number of DS channels DS standards was developed in North American and is mainly used for copper lines A fiber optics became mainstream SONET Synchronous Optical Network was adopted as a standard for connecting fiberoptic transmission systems SONET is the lowest level of the OSI protocol model the physical layer it is a method of providing a roadway or path that can be used by a variety of traffic sources and protocols In many ways SONET is completely neutral to the content or higher level protocols in the traffic stream itself Basic foundation of SONET consist of DS signal that are multiplexed to create kbps known as STS Synchronous transport signal STS is an electrical signal rate that corresponds to optical carrier line rate of OC building blocks With the older DS systems signals cant jump from DS to DS instead a steps process must be taken which involves adding overhead to the transmission With Sonet higher capacities can be created by interleaving STS signals to create a concatenated or linked signal For example three STS frames can form an STS frame Mbitssec Rates above STS can be created by either directly multiplexing STS signals or by byteinterleaving STS signals SONET can also handle signals below Mbitssec A structure called VT virtual tributary accommodates DS DS and E European equivalent of T at Mbits ATM is Short for Asynchronous Transfer Mode a network technology based on transferring data in cells or packets of a fixed size The cell used with ATM is relatively small compared to units used with older technologies ATM creates a fixed channel or route between two points whenever data transfer begins This differs from TCPIP in which messages are divided into packets and each packet can take a different route from source to destination This difference makes it easier to track and bill data usage across an ATM network but it makes it less adaptable to sudden surges in network traffic ATM is designed specifically to operates with SONET as the transport While new entrants such as Level built its network based on pure IP technology it is still using ATM to link up its core locations The trouble with IP currently is the QoS and delay issues In the future however with advanced protocols such as MPLS routers are expected to eliminate ATM in the network MPLS is an extension of IP and it provides QoS similar to ATM For new entrants the long term goal is to replace the legacy system SONET and ATM with IP over DWDM which is more efficient and lower cost transport SDH is European equivalent of SONET bidirectional line switched ring BLSR SONET operates in several different modes A major distinction in operation is whether the service is deployed in a linear fashion or as one of several ring types There are two types of SONET ring One switches individual paths path switched and the other switches the entire optical line capacity line switched A key difference is the number of fibers used Path switched rings use only two fibers while line switching can use either two or four fibers Four fiber bidirectional line switching sends traffic only in the required direction during normal operation Each direction has a working fiber and a protect fiber in each direction During a fiber interruption the traffic is routed around the break in the opposite direction hence the name bidirectional Throughput capacity is the actual amount of useful information which is transmitted It is used to measure the efficiency of a network Long haul means long distance long haul implies traversing states or countries as oppose to short haul rule A accounting rule in a case in which of the traffic is intrastate and the other interstate then the traffic is deemed to be interstate Susan M NRON PM To Margo nron cc Barbara A nron Donald LassereEnron nron Communications Jeff nron Lara LeibmanEnron nron Communications Marchris nron Mona L nron Ricardo nron

list of conceptsterms Heres my list of some things that I would like to learn more about The difference between recommended standard RS and singlemode fiber SMF cable What is an indefeasible right of use IRU It is like a rightofway What are the differences in the various capacities of cable DS OC etc Not just the amount of capacity each has but what types of information are transmitted along each What is a synchronous optical network SONET What is asynchronous transfer mode ATM What is synchronous digital hierarchy SDH I think this is used in Europe but Im not sure What is a bidirectional line switched ring BLSR What is throughput capacity What does the term long haul mean I still dont have a grasp of the rule Unfortunately I think I need this one spelled out in the most basic terms I have many more questions but I think this is a good start Thanks Margo Reyna Regulatory Analyst Enron Corp Government Affairs Phone
