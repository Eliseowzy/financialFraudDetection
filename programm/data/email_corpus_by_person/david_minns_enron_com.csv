<5086432.1075859905507.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,david.minns@enron.com,2000-02-02 09:41:00,Re Australian Power EOL Long Form Description Cc I would like to thank you for your review of our draft product description The benefit of your experience is invaluable in assisting us to develop our forms I had a couple of reservations about some changes you proposed In particular the changes to the Swap product description would involve the Fixed and Floating Price in each Calculation Period half hour being averaged over a Settlement or Determination Period The payment obligation would then be multiplied by the Notional Quantity Per Settlement Period to get the amount payable on the Settlement Date This not the way electricity derivatives are traded on the Australian electricity pool In addition to being inconsistent with the terminology both within our documentation and industry agreed forms we would have difficulty in having this new trading form adopted by the market In brief in Australia electricity trades occur in the following manner Trades are calculated on the basis of discrete half hourly Calculation Periods Payment obligations for these Calculation Periods are then aggregated on Settlement Date each month The Settlement Date is defined as the day each month when parties are obliged to make payments under the National Electricity Code It is the market custom for the Notional Quantity to be quoted in MWs This number is then divided in half to calculate to convert it into MWhs which becomes the Notional Quantity per Calculation Period To ensure its consistency with market practice we have determined that amounts should be quoted in MWs then converted in this manner into MWhs This is explained in the product description Mark Taylor and myself discussed the principles that should be followed in preparing long form product descriptions Whilst we should endeavour for consistency in drafting and in terminology amongst products the primary concern is to ensure that the terms used in the long form descriptions are consistent with our GTCs other relevant contractual arrangements with the counterparties and market trading forms There are also practical reasons for adopting terminology used in a particular market We would have some difficulty in attempting to market EnronOnline to potential counterparties if we also simultaneously convince them to commence trading on another type of product Furthermore departure from agreed forms of trading will increase the transaction risk I would be interested in getting your views as we are planning to turn out a number of descriptions over the next week based on our original form Forwarded by David MinnsENRONDEVELOPMENT on PM Paul Smith PM To David MinnsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Allan FordENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re Australian Power EOL Long Form Description David I have changed the description of the reference load shape for OffPeak and Flat trades Can you pls OK these before I proceed with other regions In the meantime I will use the original Peak template as the base for options Rgds Paul David Minns To Paul SmithENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Paul QuilkeyENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re Australian Power EOL Long Form Description The major change is the adoption of a new product into Australia The current arrangement is for trades to be effected in discrete minute Calculation Periods settled monthly in accordance with an the NEMMCO calendar What is proposed is for the floating amounts to to be averaged over a Settlement Period The implication is that the Average Floating Amount is this the Average Floating Price multiplied by the number of Calculation Periods This should equate to the same figure There are a couple of concerns This is not what is currently traded There are no definitions to cover these terms We would also have to amend the GTCs and existing ISDA Agreements to be able to trade this type of Product Apart from additional definitions issues such as rounding conventions for averaging would also need to be addressed We will need to educate potential counterparties as to this produce There is also a change to require counterparties to quote a volume per Settlement Period A figure is quoted in MW and then multiplied by the number of hours within the Settlement Period to get the Notional Quantity Per Settlement Period Assuming this is limited to the number of hours within each Victorian NEM Peak during the Settlement Period it should work But there will need to be an explanation that the Average Floating Amount is the Average Floating Price multiplied by the Notional Quantity Per Settlement Period If we must adopt this form then we have no choice but I believe that it will cause difficulties in implementing EnronOnline We will need not only sell the system but also new products A further level of complexity will be added to trades as we attempt modify the current Australian market conventions Paul Smith AM To David MinnsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Subject Australian Power EOL Long Form Description David Here is the response from Mark Comments Rgds Paul Forwarded by Paul SmithENRONDEVELOPMENT on Mark CT To David CT cc Paul SmithENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Australian Power EOL Long Form Description David I have reviewed the language sent by Paul The description is broken down into paragraphs for the record Paragraphs all cover details usually covered in the Product Type description is actually settlement dates for which we do not have a separate attribute Paragraph is reference period Paragraph is Index Paragraph is loadshape These look fine to me subject to my observations on whether we can use the Averaging language Paragraph covers attributes currency looks fine and Unit of Measure for which I suggest we go with our current language for MWh which details that the volume submitted by the counterparty is MWh per hour The product type language does not refer to determination or settlement periods but calculation periods half hourly and then details the computation of volume for a calculation period If we are consistent with the approach used in other products we would refere to the average reference price being the index within a determination period and further define the determination period If we average this also changes the loadshape language I have attached a document with the language I would propose referring to averaging Paul I have reviewed the descriptions comparative to those already held for power financial swaps on the system David may have further comments David is not back until th Feb and you may wish to have your legal team consider if the averaging language can be used in Australia before he returns If it can not I suggest we could add the definition of determination period and state that the settlement amount is the aggregation of the amounts computed for all calculation periods within the determination period The second attachment

<8773877.1075859916191.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,david.minns@enron.com,2000-03-17 13:58:00,Re Australian Status Cc indeed be a St Patricks Day for us to remember in years to come Now that I am back in the office from Adelaide let me give some more considered replies It appears there has been a bit a communication mixup no doubt not helped by me being out of the office So l let me go back to the beginning Enron Australia Finance Pty Ltd is authorised to trade Australian power derivatives with counterparties so long as it follows certain procedures laid out by the Government These require that before entering into a contract with a counterparty the registered facility provider ie Enron Australia Finance must be satisfied on reasonable grounds a about the creditworthiness of the counterparty and b that the counterparty is contracting on its own account This obligation is imposed on EAF and makes no difference whether the counterparty has an Australian presence or not In the case of EAF there was also a requirement for us to provide counterparties with an Enron Corp guaranty Although this strict legal obligation provision was deleted in July Hence one of the issues that was addressed in our legal checklist was a procedure to vet potential counterparties We have procedures in place in the Sydney office to do this I understood that this activity would still be done in Sydney ie our list of counterparties the alternative was to develop procedures if it was to done else where On Tuesday we will submitt the formal notification we need to make to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission that we are adopting a screen based trading system This is a legal requirement Although unlikely they may enquire as to our procedures for vetting counterparties I was ready to explain there will be a continuation of the same procedures In short there is nothing which needs to be added to extend the GTCs to counterparties that do not have an Australian presence The major sensitivity is taxes and withholding tax in particular where the payment is being directed outside Australia On reviewing the subject this evening I agree with Chris Catts there does not appear to be an issue But I endorse Heidis comment that now we know that there could be nonresident counterparties a first for us lets close off the tax issue I have reviewed the various GTCs and probably the attached ECT Resources International Corp GTCs is the most appropriate base to develop an appropriate clause Heidi I can reschedule to get some time on Monday to meet with Chris We could hopefully settle the words In the interim I confirm that the GTCs are satisfactory David F if you must load GTCs Friday Houston time then I suggest we go with what we have I would ask for one small changeOne small change though Tana picked up one point A new paragraph f should be included as follows f Subparagragh c of the ISDA Master Agreement will not apply to all Transactions Heidi Mason PM To David CT cc Debbie R CT Tana CT David MinnsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Mark CT Paul SmithENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Mark CT Arfan CT Susan MuschENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re Australian Status Dave I have had the following responses on the issues we discussed earlier I spoke with David Minns re the Eligible Persons criteria and he noted that while he had discussed the capitalasset holding criteria with Tana he had not provided to anyone the other criteria and that while these may be covered by the US criteria there will need to be a review of all criteria before we can assess that all are covered I spoke with Chris Catt at Price Waterhouse Coopers and he confirmed that provided there is no interest component in the cross border settlements made there will be no withholding tax issues re the paymentsreceipts I am going to meet with Chris on Monday to discuss both the taxation implications and to review the GTC On the settlement issue in the short term the best way to do the settlements for nonNEMMCO members would be via wires from Houston this is how we settled our one previous cross border transaction as this gives a third party review of the payments prior to release Regards Heidi David CT To Debbie R CT Tana CT David MinnsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Heidi MasonENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Mark CT Paul SmithENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Mark CT Arfan CT Subject Australian Status As I understand it the current situation with regard to international companies being able to transact on Australian power is this The only remaining potential issue is witholding tax This may or may not be an issue and is being researched by Heidi Mason If it is an issue it is possible that we can borrow some language from the US financial GTC Heidi will coordinate with David Minns and suggest a solution if required for incorporation into the Australian GTC An issue was raised with regard to Eligible Persons and the requirement that an Eligible Person hold more than AUS million However Tana Jones has been in discussion with David Minns on this issue and determined that the US requirements are in fact more stringent than the Australian ones hence the application of US criteria for Financial trades should be more than sufficient to meet the Australian Eligible Persons requirements Furthermore a perusal of the approvals by credit indicate that no companies with an Erating of less than have been approved by credit An issue was also raised with regard to settlements and the use of AustraClear However as we are unlikely to have large numbers of foreign companies transacting on Australian power in the near term this should be a problem which can be resolved in the back office if it arises and should not impact the GTC the planned Monday launch or the customer profiles At this point I am anticipating possibly having a witholding tax revision to the GTC which will be uploaded to the system on Friday Houston time If anyone has any questions or concerns please contact me on office or cell Thanks Dave

copies of the GTCs From a practical perspective we will only be trading with Counterparties under ISDA Master Agreements which have detailed credit provisions I do not believe it is necessary for to register EnronOnline as a business name However I have given instructions to price registering it as a trade mark The domain is being registered by us There are requirements we must follow under the Exempt Market Declaration as to whether it is appropriate or not to trade with a particular counterparty If Enron Australia Finance PtyLtd is the counterparty these obligations remain irrespective of the location of the counterparty It is our understanding that this process will performed in Australia These obligations are summarised in paragraph of the advice The use of the term firm is not an issue as far a contract formation is concerned However I have made some suggestions about the context this term is used in our presentation material Prices quoted are firm with certain qualifications Assuming the reasons given in the on screen explanation are only reasons why an offer could be rejected then there is no problem Agreed the new words should outside the brackets At this stage we were planning to continue the current confirmation practice Assuming the requisite degree of comfort of counterparties then we could move to a reliance on EnronOnline confirmations Conceptually a nonISDA Master Agreement could be developed This would present some difficulties because the industry conventions incorporate the ISDA Master Agreement as a basis Any reason why we would want to move to a nonISDA form As a next step we are now moving to settle the advice When I will circulate this final copy I will include a list of action items None of these appear time critical for implementation but for completeness should closed off For example we have produced a definitive explanation as to the records that would need to be available if were required to prove the terms of a contract in court Whilst Im sure these records are available I would like some one familiar with the system to confirm this David CT AM To David MinnsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Paul SmithENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Mark CT Paul CT Subject Re EnronOnline David Thanks for your email I noted a few points which I hope may be helpful re your comment Obviously we are in a position to have different GTCs for different counterparties Please note that we are able to carry up to two versions of the GTC Online One with the collateral clause and one without and the assignment of GTC has been done by the credit dept based on creditworthiness of the customer Of course this does not impact our ability to enter into separate Master Agreements or side letters which amend the terms of the GTC for specific customers we just cant carry copies of this amendment electronically on EnronOnline Will you look after registering EnronOnline as a business name I have asked Paul Goddard to check regarding the trademarking activities and internet domain registration undertaken so far for EnronOnline in Australia Can you provide some details as to the criteria required in assessing the Exempt Futures Market Declaration Does this apply to ourselves as well as our customers Will we need to incorporate this into our review of Australian customers andor any customers outside of Australia who wish to trade Australian power if any Please note that the new EnronOnline home page screen states EnronOnline prices are firm I assume this does not cause any problems for Austrlian law regarding the legal definition of Invitation to Treat Offer and Acceptance Please note also the related information on the Click for Details link on the homepage The comments in the Mallesons document regarding Enron Responds to the Offer are not strictly correct The customer is essentially only able to select a volume equal to or less than that shown on EnronOnline and can only submit a price which is shown on EnronOnline please call me for a more detailed discussion of the price range function if needed Enron can only reject such Offers if the customers credit limit is insufficient or if the price or volume is no longer on the system at the instant in which the customers offer hits our database The acceptancerejection of a customers offer at our database is entirely automatic and nearly instantaneous Confirmation Exchanged although we currently issue faxed confirmations please note that under EnronOnline we are not under obligation to do so the electronic confirmation is deemed sufficient Does the first PA

Password Agreement Fine seems a good to give address for notices etc ETA I asked Mallesons to consider the wording of the indemnity clause under Australian law The major concern is that in Australia special damages has a near opposite meaning to the US The suggested amendment to clause c I believe we could dispense with It relates to a concern that an Enron acceptance may be accessible on the

AFMA endorsed amendment to the clause relating to negative prices and market disruption events will be prepared this would need to be included in the GTCs and your ISDAs it would not seem practical to

them David Minns PM To David CT cc Paul SmithENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Mark CT Paul CT Subject Re EnronOnline Dave thanks for your comments Following your sequence please note the following Agreed we can have multiple copies of the GTCs From a practical perspective we will only be trading with Counterparties under ISDA Master Agreements which have detailed credit provisions I do not believe it is necessary for to register EnronOnline as a business name However I have given instructions to price registering it as a trade mark The domain is being registered by us There are requirements we must follow under the Exempt Market Declaration as to whether it is appropriate or not to trade with a particular counterparty If Enron Australia Finance PtyLtd is the counterparty these obligations remain irrespective of the location of the counterparty It is our understanding that this process will performed in Australia These obligations are summarised in paragraph of the advice The use of the term firm is not an issue as far a contract formation is concerned However I have made some suggestions about the context this term is used in our presentation material Prices quoted are firm with certain qualifications Assuming the reasons given in the on screen explanation are only reasons why an offer could be rejected then there is no problem Agreed the new words should outside the brackets At this stage we were planning to continue the current confirmation practice Assuming the requisite degree of comfort of counterparties then we could move to a reliance on EnronOnline confirmations Conceptually a nonISDA Master Agreement could be developed This would present some difficulties because the industry conventions incorporate the ISDA Master Agreement as a basis Any reason why we would want to move to a nonISDA form As a next step we are now moving to settle the advice When I will circulate this final copy I will include a list of action items None of these appear time critical for implementation but for completeness should closed off For example we have produced a definitive explanation as to the records that would need to be available if were required to prove the terms of a contract in court Whilst Im sure these records are available I would like some one familiar with the system to confirm this David CT AM To David MinnsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Paul SmithENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Mark CT Paul CT Subject Re EnronOnline David Thanks for your email I noted a few points which I hope may be helpful re your comment Obviously we are in a position to have different GTCs for different counterparties Please note that we are able to carry up to two versions of the GTC Online One with the collateral clause and one without and the assignment of GTC has been done by the credit dept based on creditworthiness of the customer Of course this does not impact our ability to enter into separate Master Agreements or side letters which amend the terms of the GTC for specific customers we just cant carry copies of this amendment electronically on EnronOnline Will you look after registering EnronOnline as a business name I have asked Paul Goddard to check regarding the trademarking activities and internet domain registration undertaken so far for EnronOnline in Australia Can you provide some details as to the criteria required in assessing the Exempt Futures Market Declaration Does this apply to ourselves as well as our customers Will we need to incorporate this into our review of Australian customers andor any customers outside of Australia who wish to trade Australian power if any Please note that the new EnronOnline home page screen states EnronOnline prices are firm I assume this does not cause any problems for Austrlian law regarding the legal definition of Invitation to Treat Offer and Acceptance Please note also the related information on the Click for Details link on the homepage The comments in the Mallesons document regarding Enron Responds to the Offer are not strictly correct The customer is essentially only able to select a volume equal to or less than that shown on EnronOnline and can only submit a price which is shown on EnronOnline please call me for a more detailed discussion of the price range function if needed Enron can only reject such Offers if the customers credit limit is insufficient or if the price or volume is no longer on the system at the instant in which the customers offer hits our database The acceptancerejection of a customers offer at our database is entirely automatic and nearly instantaneous Confirmation Exchanged although we currently issue faxed confirmations please note that under EnronOnline we are not under obligation to do so the electronic confirmation is deemed sufficient Does the first PA amendment read correctly also the first ETA amendment GTC amendment Do we need to reference ISDA Is it not possible at some time now or in the future to have a nonISDA master Dave David NRONDEVELOPMENT AM To Paul SmithENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Mark CT Paul QuilkeyENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT David CT Subject EnronOnline Attached is a draft advice from Mallesons on EnronOnline Of immediate concern to us are the form of the various agreements for the road show next week Mallesons have suggested some minor attachments These are in the annexes to the advice Following are my comments Password Agreement Fine seems a good to give address for notices etc ETA I asked Mallesons to consider the wording of the indemnity clause under Australian law The major concern is that in Australia special damages has a near opposite meaning to the US The suggested amendment to clause c I believe we could dispense with It relates to a concern that an Enron acceptance may be accessible on the Website Server However from what I have been told this is not a foreseeable eventuality GTCs Minor changes The only one we are unlikely to incorporate relates to the collateral clause Obviously we are in a position to have different GTCs for different counterparties As a next step Paul I will give you copies of the Password Agreement and the ETA for inclusion in Road Show I expect to settle the advice early week and will circulate it Forwarded by David MinnsENRONDEVELOPMENTon PM Farrell Scott on PM To cc James Martin Subject EnronOnline Mallesons Stephen Jaques Confidential communication David Please find attached a further draft of the advice marked up to show the changes made from the previous draft DOC In particular please note that we have suggested amendments to the agreements in the schedule if these are acceptable for use we will accept the revision mode in the final version If they are not please let us know as certain negative prices are now possible it is expected that an AFMA endorsed amendment to the clause relating to negative prices and market disruption events will be prepared this would need to be included in the GTCs and your ISDAs it would not seem practical to include the collateral language in the GTCs only in respect of some clients as the GTCs are standard provisions Would collateral arrangements in relation to particular clients using GTCs be best documented separately will offers on EnronOnline be considered by a EAF trader in Australia before being accepted the trade practices material can be completed whenever it is convenient for one of our trade practices lawyers to review the working site as a whole Best regards Scott Farrell Senior Associate Mallesons Stephen Jaques Sydney Direct line

<20352803.1075859990585.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,david.minns@enron.com,2000-03-17 13:58:00,Re Australian Status Cc indeed be a St Patricks Day for us to remember in years to come Now that I am back in the office from Adelaide let me give some more considered replies It appears there has been a bit a communication mixup no doubt not helped by me being out of the office So l let me go back to the beginning Enron Australia Finance Pty Ltd is authorised to trade Australian power derivatives with counterparties so long as it follows certain procedures laid out by the Government These require that before entering into a contract with a counterparty the registered facility provider ie Enron Australia Finance must be satisfied on reasonable grounds a about the creditworthiness of the counterparty and b that the counterparty is contracting on its own account This obligation is imposed on EAF and makes no difference whether the counterparty has an Australian presence or not In the case of EAF there was also a requirement for us to provide counterparties with an Enron Corp guaranty Although this strict legal obligation provision was deleted in July Hence one of the issues that was addressed in our legal checklist was a procedure to vet potential counterparties We have procedures in place in the Sydney office to do this I understood that this activity would still be done in Sydney ie our list of counterparties the alternative was to develop procedures if it was to done else where On Tuesday we will submitt the formal notification we need to make to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission that we are adopting a screen based trading system This is a legal requirement Although unlikely they may enquire as to our procedures for vetting counterparties I was ready to explain there will be a continuation of the same procedures In short there is nothing which needs to be added to extend the GTCs to counterparties that do not have an Australian presence The major sensitivity is taxes and withholding tax in particular where the payment is being directed outside Australia On reviewing the subject this evening I agree with Chris Catts there does not appear to be an issue But I endorse Heidis comment that now we know that there could be nonresident counterparties a first for us lets close off the tax issue I have reviewed the various GTCs and probably the attached ECT Resources International Corp GTCs is the most appropriate base to develop an appropriate clause Heidi I can reschedule to get some time on Monday to meet with Chris We could hopefully settle the words In the interim I confirm that the GTCs are satisfactory David F if you must load GTCs Friday Houston time then I suggest we go with what we have I would ask for one small changeOne small change though Tana picked up one point A new paragraph f should be included as follows f Subparagragh c of the ISDA Master Agreement will not apply to all Transactions Heidi Mason PM To David CT cc Debbie R CT Tana CT David MinnsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Mark CT Paul SmithENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Mark CT Arfan CT Susan MuschENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re Australian Status Dave I have had the following responses on the issues we discussed earlier I spoke with David Minns re the Eligible Persons criteria and he noted that while he had discussed the capitalasset holding criteria with Tana he had not provided to anyone the other criteria and that while these may be covered by the US criteria there will need to be a review of all criteria before we can assess that all are covered I spoke with Chris Catt at Price Waterhouse Coopers and he confirmed that provided there is no interest component in the cross border settlements made there will be no withholding tax issues re the paymentsreceipts I am going to meet with Chris on Monday to discuss both the taxation implications and to review the GTC On the settlement issue in the short term the best way to do the settlements for nonNEMMCO members would be via wires from Houston this is how we settled our one previous cross border transaction as this gives a third party review of the payments prior to release Regards Heidi David CT To Debbie R CT Tana CT David MinnsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Heidi MasonENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Mark CT Paul SmithENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Mark CT Arfan CT Subject Australian Status As I understand it the current situation with regard to international companies being able to transact on Australian power is this The only remaining potential issue is witholding tax This may or may not be an issue and is being researched by Heidi Mason If it is an issue it is possible that we can borrow some language from the US financial GTC Heidi will coordinate with David Minns and suggest a solution if required for incorporation into the Australian GTC An issue was raised with regard to Eligible Persons and the requirement that an Eligible Person hold more than AUS million However Tana Jones has been in discussion with David Minns on this issue and determined that the US requirements are in fact more stringent than the Australian ones hence the application of US criteria for Financial trades should be more than sufficient to meet the Australian Eligible Persons requirements Furthermore a perusal of the approvals by credit indicate that no companies with an Erating of less than have been approved by credit An issue was also raised with regard to settlements and the use of AustraClear However as we are unlikely to have large numbers of foreign companies transacting on Australian power in the near term this should be a problem which can be resolved in the back office if it arises and should not impact the GTC the planned Monday launch or the customer profiles At this point I am anticipating possibly having a witholding tax revision to the GTC which will be uploaded to the system on Friday Houston time If anyone has any questions or concerns please contact me on office or cell Thanks Dave

description The benefit of your experience is invaluable in assisting us to develop our forms I had a couple of reservations about some changes you proposed In particular the changes to the Swap product description would involve the Fixed and Floating Price in each Calculation Period half hour being averaged over a Settlement or Determination Period The payment obligation would then be multiplied by the Notional Quantity Per Settlement Period to get the amount payable on the Settlement Date This not the way electricity derivatives are traded on the Australian electricity pool In addition to being inconsistent with the terminology both within our documentation and industry agreed forms we would have difficulty in having this new trading form adopted by the market In brief in Australia electricity trades occur in the following manner Trades are calculated on the basis of discrete half hourly Calculation Periods Payment obligations for these Calculation Periods are then aggregated on Settlement Date each month The Settlement Date is defined as the day each month when parties are obliged to make payments under the National Electricity Code It is the market custom for the Notional Quantity to be quoted in MWs This number is then divided in half to calculate to convert it into MWhs which becomes the Notional Quantity per Calculation Period To ensure its consistency with market practice we have determined that amounts should be quoted in MWs then converted in this manner into MWhs This is explained in the product description Mark Taylor and myself discussed the principles that should be followed in preparing long form product descriptions Whilst we should endeavour for consistency in drafting and in terminology amongst products the primary concern is to ensure that the terms used in the long form descriptions are consistent with our GTCs other relevant contractual arrangements with the counterparties and market trading forms There are also practical reasons for adopting terminology used in a particular market We would have some difficulty in attempting to market EnronOnline to potential counterparties if we also simultaneously convince them to commence trading on another type of product Furthermore departure from agreed forms of trading will increase the transaction risk I would be interested in getting your views as we are planning to turn out a number of descriptions over the next week based on our original form Forwarded by David MinnsENRONDEVELOPMENT on PM Paul Smith PM To David MinnsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Allan FordENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re Australian Power EOL Long Form Description David I have changed the description of the reference load shape for OffPeak and Flat trades Can you pls OK these before I proceed with other regions In the meantime I will use the original Peak template as the base for options Rgds Paul David Minns To Paul SmithENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Paul QuilkeyENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re Australian Power EOL Long Form Description The major change is the adoption of a new product into Australia The current arrangement is for trades to be effected in discrete minute Calculation Periods settled monthly in accordance with an the NEMMCO calendar What is proposed is for the floating amounts to to be averaged over a Settlement Period The implication is that the Average Floating Amount is this the Average Floating Price multiplied by the number of Calculation Periods This should equate to the same figure There are a couple of concerns This is not what is currently traded There are no definitions to cover these terms We would also have to amend the GTCs and existing ISDA Agreements to be able to trade this type of Product Apart from additional definitions issues such as rounding conventions for averaging would also need to be addressed We will need to educate potential counterparties as to this produce There is also a change to require counterparties to quote a volume per Settlement Period A figure is quoted in MW and then multiplied by the number of hours within the Settlement Period to get the Notional Quantity Per Settlement Period Assuming this is limited to the number of hours within each Victorian NEM Peak during the Settlement Period it should work But there will need to be an explanation that the Average Floating Amount is the Average Floating Price multiplied by the Notional Quantity Per Settlement Period If we must adopt this form then we have no choice but I believe that it will cause difficulties in implementing EnronOnline We will need not only sell the system but also new products A further level of complexity will be added to trades as we attempt modify the current Australian market conventions Paul Smith AM To David MinnsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Subject Australian Power EOL Long Form Description David Here is the response from Mark Comments Rgds Paul Forwarded by Paul SmithENRONDEVELOPMENT on Mark CT To David CT cc Paul SmithENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Australian Power EOL Long Form Description David I have reviewed the language sent by Paul The description is broken down into paragraphs for the record Paragraphs all cover details usually covered in the Product Type description is actually settlement dates for which we do not have a separate attribute Paragraph is reference period Paragraph is Index Paragraph is loadshape These look fine to me subject to my observations on whether we can use the Averaging language Paragraph covers attributes currency looks fine and Unit of Measure for which I suggest we go with our current language for MWh which details that the volume submitted by the counterparty is MWh per hour The product type language does not refer to determination or settlement periods but calculation periods half hourly and then details the computation of volume for a calculation period If we are consistent with the approach used in other products we would refere to the average reference price being the index within a determination period and further define the determination period If we average this also changes the loadshape language I have attached a document with the language I would propose referring to averaging Paul I have reviewed the descriptions comparative to those already held for power financial swaps on the system David may have further comments David is not back until th Feb and you may wish to have your legal team consider if the averaging language can be used in Australia before he returns If it can not I suggest we could add the definition of determination period and state that the settlement amount is the aggregation of the amounts computed for all calculation periods within the determination period The second attachment
