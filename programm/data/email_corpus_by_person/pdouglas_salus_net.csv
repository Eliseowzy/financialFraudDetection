classroom computer program I would think this could be good for TFA How are you coming with the conatcts I gave you PD Saturday November News from Los Angeles in the Los Angeles Times Riordan to Join LA Unified After He Leaves City Hall Mayor In an address to Valley leaders he strongly denounces secession then makes surprising disclosure about plan to take executive post with district By JIM NEWTON Times Staff Writer In his final annual address on the state of the San Fernando Valley Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan on Friday delivered his most forceful call ever for that area to remain part of the larger city then surprised the audience by announcing that he will go to work for the Los Angeles Unified School District when he finishes his term in office Speaking to a group of Valley business leaders Riordan denounced secession on political moral and practical grounds warning that it would force a tax hike leave the Valley with uncertain leadership and abandon the citys poor I love the Valley Riordan said I feel that youre part of the family and I dont want you to desert the family The rest of the city needs you You cant abandon the poor It just isnt right Riordans pointed rejection of secession represents a significant escalation in his efforts to head off that politically charged prospecta topic so heated that in a mayoral debate following Riordans speech not one of the six candidates angling for election in April so much as mentioned the word Riordan by contrast tackled the issue headon and in far more confrontational terms than he ever has before Secession Riordan said bluntly is a lousy idea As significant as that pronouncement was however the mayor almost overshadowed it with an offhand personal remark in response to a question after his speech Asked to elaborate on his thoughts about breaking up the school district Riordan let slip that he intends to go to work for LA Unified after he finishes his second term as mayor which ends next summer The mayor who helped elect four of the school boards seven members said he has been in discussions with Supt Roy Romer and has agreed to accept an executive position with the district next year Riordan did not elaborate but in an interview later he said he and the superintendent had agreed that Riordan would run the districts classroom computer program The former Colorado governor who now runs the citys schools was not immediately available for comment At the district Riordan said he will be in charge of working with schools to make effective use of computers in the classroom Riordan who has donated thousands of computers to schools in various parts of the country said the job fit his talents I think this is something Im good at he said I know the experts in the field Riordans postmayoral plans have for months been the object of much speculation Most observers predicted he would do something in the field of education because no topic animates Riordan as much as children and schools But Riordan is a multimillionaire and he will be over when he finishes his second term as mayor He passed up the chance to run for governor in and some friends had predicted he would slow down when he wrapped up his mayoral administration The idea of a quiet retirement however seems to have little appeal for Riordan an energetic and restless man Asked how long he intended to take off between finishing his work as mayor and starting his new job at the school district Riordan responded three or four hours Riordan has held office for nearly eight years and for that entire time has enjoyed the strong support of the San Fernando Valley It was the Valley that helped put him in office in and polls since have shown that though he is popular citywide he enjoys his greatest approval ratings north of the Hollywood Hills As the race to succeed him gathers steam some of the candidates clearly covet Riordans base in the Valley On Friday City Councilman Joel Wachs often invoked the mayors name during a lowenergy debate among the six leading mayoral candidates Among other things Wachs praised Riordans economic development initiatives and his handling of the recently completed negotiations between the city and federal government over the future of the Los Angeles Police Department So effusive was Wachs in his praise of Riordan that eventually businessman Steve Soboroff complained As Soboroff pointed out to the audience Riordan has endorsed his candidacy not Wachs Soboroff suggested that his rival withdraw from the race and back him instead Wachs laughed but did not respond The debatereally more of a panel discussion in which the candidates rarely addressed one another while sitting cheekbyjowl in straightbacked chairsalso was notable as the first joint appearance of the candidates to include state Controller Kathleen Connell the latest contender to join the race Connell used her debut debate performance to stress her determination to bring tough fiscal management to the problems of Los Angeles She addressed issues such as police corruption transportation and the citys business climate in terms of their economic impact arguing that her experience in the private sector and as controller made her the right person to handle that task In other debate highlights City Atty James Hahn and Assemblyman Antonio Villaraigosa enthusiastically welcomed the signing of the consent decree with the federal government on police reform Connell Wachs and US Rep Xavier Becerra also applauded the deal though in less glowing terms Soboroff was the only candidate to oppose it calling it an abdication of local responsibility
