Martin Chavez at Kiodex and he confirmed as well I think the bigger issue is that other enterprises are starting to try to build businesses around their systems and operations I think we have a good head start with CommodityLogic and Kiodex but we have to run even faster now GP Original Message From Richter Brad Sent Wednesday August AM To Piper Greg Subject FW Commercialization of back office competitor FYI Original Message From Pacheco Leonardo Sent Wednesday August AM To Richter Brad Subject RE Commercialization of back office competitor Brad You are right Aquilas Risk is similar to Kiodexs offering It is a webbased Reporting and Valuation Tool no software downloads are needed The difference is that Risk focuses on reporting and valuation In other words Risk does not offer Pricing Calculators as does Kiodexs It seems to me that Kiodexs Risk Workbench is a more robust solution because it provides decision tools to price opportunities before transacting while Risk is after the fact reporting and transacting It looks to me that when Commodity Logic launches its Risk Valuation modules it will become more of a direct competitor to Risk In its initial phase Risk is offering services to the Gas market only Soon they will offer the tools for the power markets Risks products OTC Trade Preview details of transactions as entered into system DailyMonthly Futures and Forwards Reports position exposures and daily Pals based on marktomarket accounting Options Valuation Report measures exposures due to options plus volatility calculations ie Greeks Daily Monthly Total Position Summary total picture of risk exposure in the portfolio Risks target market Similar to Commodity Logics market They will target medium to small shops that do not have the technology staff or resources to run sophisticated reporting and valuation inhouse Let me know if you have any questions Leonardo Original Message From Richter Brad Sent Tuesday August PM To Pacheco Leonardo

least have a chance to do your idea Muller head of Corp development responded saying he will try to get the ideas in to the final agreement with Lance Schuler Anne Koehler and I said McMahon supported these ideas Basically trying to get the proper language at this past the th hour so Delaineys NewCo and a service company have a better idea of what the systems can be used for after NetCo I dont think the existing agreements actually prohibit it but it is not as clear as it should be for a service company or NewCo wholesale Thanks GP Original Message From Piper Greg Sent Monday January PM To Koehler Anne C Cc Detmering Tim Webb Jay Muller Mark S Schuler Lance Legal Subject FW template assignment and license agreement My suggestions and issues with the latest assignment and license agreement First I have not seen the Contribution Agreement so I dont know the definition of affiliate Delaineys NewCo will be interested in that since the document licenses back all the applications to Enron and its affiliates Also if an affiliate becomes a rd party due to sell down or sale we need the ability to continue the sub license to the rd parties Second section says within business days after Closing Date as defined in Contribution Agreement Assignor will deliver to Assignee one tangible copy of Source and Object Code and documentation I dont think that follows the plan to duplicate everything by the end of January or early February then get going our separate ways I am worried that Enron cant meet that day demand since we are in a process together to copy everything Webb should comment on this Also we need the ability to license the nonEOL applications to a third party so they can use them to offer and build a service company around them including gas and power logistics and settlement This rd party would not trade against NetCo but would offer mid and back office services to trading companies This would actually benefit NetCo since this entity could improves scheduling and settlements in the industry Existing NetCo management would understand this Also I think noncompete issues should be at the commercial level in the agreement not the systems level so I would vote to remove in a the language around sublicenses in the field of use with trading etc as we discussed today I am not sure what trading means for this or other documents Finally in section what are the prohibited commodities Thanks GP Original Message From mailto Sent Monday January PM To Piper Greg Cc Subject template assignment and license agreement Greg Here is a copy of the template assignment
