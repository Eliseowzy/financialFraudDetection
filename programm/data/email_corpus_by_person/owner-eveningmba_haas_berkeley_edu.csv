here it comes again Diane HI Everyone Its just about time to think about registering for Fall classes Early next week TJ will be sending materials to your home addresses and its very important that you read through them carefully In the meantime Ive attached a preliminary list of electives that will be offered Most importantly please remember that there are two rounds of preenrollment for Fall classes You must enroll in classes during Round I to retain your seniority status in classes So for example if you are going to be a fifth semester student in the fall and forget to sign up for classes during Round I and then try to get into an oversubscribed class in Round II you will have lost your seniority status because you did not sign up in Round I For those of you who would like to get academic advising eg Which courses do I take if I want to be a consumer products marketer or program planning eg How do graduate in five semesters please feel free to make a telephone or inperson appointment with me Advising by email is nearly impossible because of the level detail required for effective advising As course descriptions become available they will be put up on the web UPDATES ON UNKNOWNS IN THE EvMBA ELECTIVE COURSES E Corporate Financial Reporting Brett Trueman Brett Trueman is the Accounting group chair and is a fabulous teacher winning the Outstanding Teacher of the Year Award in the day program If youre interested in Corporate Finance or Investments you should take this course eventually E Corporate Finance Levy Amnon Levy has a PhD from Kellogg did his undergraduate work in economics here at Berkeley and is visiting next year from NYU E Futures and Options Manuel Ammann Prof Ammann is a visitor from the University of St Gallen in Switzerland He visited here last year and I heard he is great E Leadership Nancy Euske Nancy teaches the core course in OB and has done an excellent job This will NOT be Jenny Chatmans Leadership course taught by Nancy Euske It will

national brand and marketing consulting practice Mr Upshaw was formerly Executive Vice PresidentBrand Marketing for Ketchum Communications Worldwide and has written two books Building Brand Identity A Strategy for Success in a Hostile Marektplace and The Masterbrand Mandate E Deals Shelanski Howard Shelanski is a professor at Boalt and the basic premise of the course is to tie contract theory contract law and business strategy together How do structures of relationships between firms or more generally contracting parties change with contract law and strategic imperatives The course will give students some tools to think about business development from both a legal and economic standpoint E EBusiness Supply Chain Management Hamid Noori Hamid is a Professor of Technology and Operations Management at the Laurier Business School Wilfird Laureir University in Waterloo Ontario E New Telecom Ventues Bob Harris Bob Harris is a young retired faculty member who went on to establish a very successful consulting company Bob is a great teacher I had him for Macro and he is thrilled to be back teaching a course on Entrepreneurship in Telecommunications E Pricing Strategy Scott Davis Scott is teaching this course this semester and is doing a great job He used to be a faculty member at Washington University in St Louis where he won the Outstanding Teacher of the Year Award but he moved

DC This course will be banking related covering topics such as interest risk and measuring and controlling credit risk in financial institutions BA Contemporary Philanthropy Th pm Fran Van Loo Fran is a Haas economist who also runs the Public and NotforProfit Program BAC Entrepreneurship Workshop M pm Danner This course is for those students who are actually in the process of going live with an entrepreneurial idea Please check the website for details BAD Strategic Marketing Planning Th pm Peter Wilton Some overlap with E but definitely a great class taught by a great instructor SOME GENERAL COMMENTS You should try to take Competitive Strategy as late in your program as you possibly can You will get a lot more out of it if you bring to the course as much previous coursework as possible Obviously you need to balance this against the risk of the course not being offered in subsequent semesters but it is best to take that course later in your program Currently Katz is scheduled to teach the course in Spring as well as F Finance is divided into two main areas Corporate Finance and Investments Corporate Finance if you are interested in corporate finance you would probably want to take some combination of E E E E for companies doing a lot of internationalglobal operations and perhaps E and perhaps E Valuation for large companies involved in a lot of acquisitions Investments if youre interested in Investments investment banking financial services etc you should probably want to take some combination of E E andor E for individuals going into Mergers and Acquisitions E andor E and E if your company is involved in intl markets If you dont want to go into finance but feel like you need a little more finance that just E Money Markets E is a great class taught by a great instructor Please see web for more detail If you are truly interested in concentrating in marketing the two core electives for marketers are E Marketing Research and EB Product Management These two courses will give you the critical basics needed for careers in marketing Additionally Pricing Strategy is an important course The many other marketing classes are more specific to particular industries eg Internet Strategy HighTech Marketing etc I believe very strongly that EVERYONE should graduate with at least one OB elective In addition to the very popular Negotiations course we have some other great OB classes Org Strategy with Bahrami Leadership with Chatman or Euske Power and Politics in Orgs with Schroth in Spring etc When alums are surveyed they always say I wish I took more OB I know youve heard me say this a million times If anything else comes up Ill keep you posted Cheers Diane Felectivesdoc

William Hambrecht the legendary investment banker who brought us Apple Computer Genentech and the OpenIPO is the recipient of the Lester Center Lifetime Achievement Award at UC Berkeleys Haas School of Business The award will be presented by the Lester Center for Entrepreneurship Innovation at the UC Berkeley Entrepreneurs Forum on Thursday April in Arthur Andersen Auditorium Hambrecht is best known as the cofounder of the firm Hambrecht Quist who se westcoast style investment banking helped launch some of Silicon Valleys greatest success stories In the firm managed the initial public offerings of Apple Genentech and People Express By Hambrecht Qui st had worked with over companies including Adobe Systems Advanced Fiber Communications Apollo Computer Convergent Technologies Evans Sutherlan d ReadRite Sybase VLSI Technologies and Xilinx In Hambrecht Quist managed the IPO of Boston Beer maker of Samuel Adams Boston Lager that inspired Hambrecht to brainstorm the possibility o f IPOs that are open to the public Boston Beer CEO Jim Koch insisted on maki ng percent of the IPO shares available to his market the people who drank his beer The idea meant taking a significant portion of the shares away fr om institutional investors the industrys mainstay In addition opening the IPO to individuals required shipping sixpacks to the stores with little forms attached that allowed consumers to make a bid to buy a piece of Bosto n Beer However the new approach demonstrated its business potential when the million IPO in was oversubscribed by million all from individual investors The question was how to streamline the process Answer the Internet In Bill Hambrecht decided to start a new firm WR Hambrecht Co that uses the Internet to create an open system for all investors from individual consumers to the largest institutional investors to have equa l opportunities to make bids for IPO stocks thus the name OpenIPO OpenIPOs are not only open to small investors but are built on a Dutch auction model where the investors not the investment bank set the price WR Hambrecht Cos most recent IPO included Peets Coffee and Tea a smal l Berkeley coffeehouse Peets was the th Internetbased public stock offeri ng led by WR Hambrecht Co in the past years In awarding the Lifetime Achievement Award the Lester Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation is able to bring outstanding innovators and entrepreneurs to the Berkeley campus The Lester Center hopes that this kin d of interaction among academics students and practitioners will foster entrepreneurial success for individuals and the community as a whole Previous winners of the Lester Center Lifetime Achievement Award include Gordon Moore one of the original founders of Intel in Arthur Rock the original venture capitalist behind Silicon Valleys very first semiconductor company Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel in a nd Dr Alejandro Zaffaroni who founded Alza Corp and a series of other biote ch

areas within economics that it is difficult to characterize except to note that it is all uniformly excellent and always exhibits great clarity of thought Her works are always about matters of interest usually of importance to policy debates and they provide tremendous insights into these matters Yellens work includes major contributions in international economics macroeconomics microeconomics labor economics and the economics of social policy Her writing has often focused on federal economic policy issues She has served as Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers and as a

crime and teen pregnancy She graduated summa cum laude from Brown University with a degree in economics in and received her PhD in economics from Yale University in You cannot help but learn from and

teacher and a valued citizen of the Haas School and campus The academy has numbered among its members each generations finest minds and most influential leaders from George Washington and Ben Franklin in the eighteenth century to Daniel Webster and Ralph Waldo Emerson in the nineteenth and Albert Einstein and Winston Churchill in the twentieth The current membership of Fellows and Foreign Honorary

ranking of business schools in a special section of the newspaper on Monday April Although the Haas School ranked only st out of in the survey the schools showing outscored all other business schools from the West Coast through the Rocky Mountain states including Thunderbird UC Irvine UC Davis UCLAAnderson Brigham Young and surprisingly Stanford This is the first time in any major media ranking of business schools that HaasBerkeley has done better than Stanfords Graduate School of Business The Journals ranking of business schools its first ever is based on the opinions of MBA recruiters The schools themselves supplied the names of its recruiters to the newspaper Each recruiter was asked to rate as many as three schools and was instructed to rate only schools with which he or she had recruiting experience in the previous two years Under the rules recruiters who were also alumni of the school at which they recruited were permitted to rate their own alma mater The Journals methodology produced results that are sure to be much discussed and questioned Traditional powerhouse business schools such as Wharton Columbia Duke and Stanford were significantly outranked by lesserknown business schools such as Purdue Southern Methodist University Wake Forest and Michigan State In general schools from the Western States did less well than others in the Journals ranking which has also been true of Business Weeks survey that is based in part on a smaller survey of recruiters The top school in the Journals ranking was Dartmouths Tuck School followed by Carnegie Mellon Yale Michigan and NorthwesternKellogg The editor of the special Journal section Ron Alsop told a group of business school deans in New York last week there are a lot of surprises in the Journals rankings Alsop spoke at an annual conference of business schools The Journal also listed the Haas School as being among the top schools in the world that excels in the teaching of ecommence subjects and the th best school internationally for its students entrepreneurial skills These rankings were also based on recruiter input The results of the Wall Street Journals survey are clearly controversial underscoring the need to think deeply about each ranking and what it purports to measure said Richard Kurovsky executive director of marketing and communications at the Haas School With the continuing proliferation of new rankings schools that do well in one ranking now find themselves doing less well in the next forcing everyone to sort out what it all means This may ultimately be a very good thing for the consumers of rankings In other rankings over the past eight months Haas has placed in US News in the Financial Times ranking of international business schools and in Business Weeks survey The entire package of Wall Street Journal rankings and related stories can be viewed online at specialreportsbschoolguideindexhtml BERKELEY TEAM WINS ADVERTISING CASE COMPETITION The team

School of Business the College of Engineering and the School of Information Management and Systems are launching an innovative program that blends academic training in entrepreneurship with handson industry experience at Silicon Valley startups The Mayfield Fund a toptier venture capital firm headquartered in Menlo Park California has committed million to fund the new program at UC Berkeley to be called the UC Berkeley Mayfield Fellows Program The new program will be administered by the Management of Technology Program MOT a partnership created in by the above three units of the UC Berkeley campus Under the UC Berkeley Mayfield Fellows Program graduate students selected from the College of Engineering the Haas School of Business and the School of Information Management and Systems work as summer interns at venturebacked high tech firms in Silicon Valley I dont believe any other university offers its graduate students such rigorous training in starting new hightech ventures from both a business and a technology perspective explains Richard Newton dean of the College of Engineering Add to that the opportunity to work directly for the CEO of a hightech startup as part of the academic experience and we have created something truly extraordinary for our students The first group of UC Berkeley Mayfield Fellows was announced this week four each from the College of Engineering and the Haas School all with extensive technical training and previous work experience in high tech The names of the fellows will be announced at a later date In addition to the summer internships UC Berkeley Mayfield Fellows participate in intensive classroom work intended to blend the practical experience gained through their internships with the challenge and growth of a series of graduate seminars on technology and entrepreneurship The UC Berkeley Mayfield Fellows Program is a great example of the way in which were succeeding at blending handson industry experience at Silicon Valley companies into the Haas academic experience says Andrew Isaacs executive director of MOT The joint MOTLester Center collaboration on this program makes this new venture all the more exciting The Mayfield Fund has made the million commitment to UC Berkeley as part of its support of the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society CITRIS being created within UC as a focal point to apply advances in information technology to the solution of societys most critical needs Mayfield is excited by the opportunity to participate with UC Berkeley in a program that will enrich the entrepreneurial experience for graduate students said Michael Levinthal Mayfield Fund general partner The continual success of startups that have flowed from UC Berkeley to the Bay Area and beyond is exceptional and Mayfield is proud of our association with this process CALIFORNIAS SLUMPING ECONOMY FACES MULTIYEAR RECOVERY SAYS RESEARCHERS As Californias prosperous glow begins to tarnish the state as a whole faces sharply escalating unemployment rates a leveling off or decline in home prices rising office vacancies and reduced construction over the next two to three years These are the conclusions of Professor Dwight Jaffee and California economist Cynthia Kroll of the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics In the centers recently released Spring Research Report Jaffee and Kroll point to the vulnerability of California and particularly of the San Francisco Bay Area as the US economy slows The authors look at the states experience in past recessions and conclude that a two to three year adjustment period is likely before the state resumes expansion Jaffee and Kroll point out that the major stock price adjustments that occurred earlier this year reflected real changes in the economic factors driving Californias economy Driven by expansion of dotcom and high tech sectors computer programming employment alone grew by over jobs in with much of this increase found in the San Francisco Bay Area The bursting of the dotcom bubble and subsequent layoff announcements leave this sector and the Bay Area particularly vulnerable The real estate market will also feel the effects in coming months and the impact on the office real estate market is likely to be substantial In fact prices have already begun to decline in this sector San Franciscos SoMa South of Market district which has recently put on the market many offices geared toward dotcomtype firms is most likely to suffer as a wave of these companies goes out of business The authors argue that office rents could drop substantially at least in San Franciscos downtown area and perhaps as much as in the areas most heavily affected by the dotcom bust Dropping rents could temper the rise in vacancies Companies that were previously forced out of the market by skyhigh lease prices are now looking at reduced rates The residential real estate market will also be affected by the economic adjustment Kroll and Jaffee expect the highend residential real estate market previously fueled by stock market gains to contract the most as the crop of dotcom employees who found their way to quick wealth sell their newly overpriced homes Lower and midrange markets will see more moderate price adjustments Based on past history the researchers maintain that job losses and declining real estate prices could continue for two to three years They point out that in the longer term both Silicon Valley and California as a whole have shown an economic resilience and the ability to resume expansion after a slowdown or recession UC BERKELEY TEAMS WIN TWO REAL ESTATE CHALLENGES Victory came to the Haas and other UC Berkeley graduate students who participated in the two most recent real estate competitions the National Association of Industrial and Office Properties NAIOP Challenge and the Bank of America LowIncome Housing Challenge NAIOP Real Estate Development

Responds to Business Week Ranking of Haas School Gertler Finds Mexicos AntiPoverty Program Improves the Health of Poor Families Students Share the Wealth Through Students for Students New Staff Haas in the News Happening at Haas Haas Celebrations DEAN TYSON RESPONDS TO BUSINESS WEEK RANKING OF HAAS SCHOOL By Laura Tyson The Haas School of Business is one of the worlds outstanding business schools The best indicator of its quality is market competition The very top business schools compete vigorously with Haas for students and faculty And Haas MBAs are regularly courted and hired by many of the worlds most selective firms The recent rankings of business schools published by Business Week do not reflect these market assessments of the quality of the Haas School In contrast to a rank of in the Business Week results Haas earned a rank of in US News a rank of among US schools in the Financial Times and a rank of in Forbes during the last year The discrepancy in these results suggests that there are special features of the Business Week methodology that make it a misleading measure of quality Nonetheless there are lessons to be learned and information to be gleaned by analyzing the Business Week results Lets start with a few bright spots The Haas School ranked in student satisfaction which accounts for about of the total score This is a reasonable showing one that has improved over time and one that I am committed to improve still further in the future This years ranking in student satisfaction is based on opinions from the Class of which accounted for of the responses as well as opinions from the classes of and each of which accounted for of the responses The two earlier classes did not benefit from the many enhancements in school services that have been realized during the last two years With the Schools dedication to continuous improvement we hope and anticipate that satisfaction levels among current and future students will continue to trend upward I am enormously pleased that the Career Services office and its outstanding professional team have revitalized this missioncritical service at the Haas School In its last survey only two years ago Business Week ranked the Haas career services office at the bottom of its top list Only two years later Business Week applauded the efforts of the Career Services staff Praise for their efforts is richly deserved Probably the most troubling aspect of the Business Week survey was the ranking by corporate recruiters According to this indicator which accounts for of the total score the Haas School fell from two years ago to this year Despite the Schools disappointing ranking on this measure however the performance of Haas students on the job marketas measured by both the number of job offers per student and the median postMBA salary per studentwas as good or better than most of the other business schools that were ranked higher on the recruiter survey There are two partial explanations for this puzzling discrepancy First the Business Week methodology appears to suffer from a persistent East Coast bias in its survey of recruiters No school west of the Mississippi made it into Business Weeks top ten this year and West coast schools have always done less well than Eastern and Midwestern Schools in Business Week rankings To some extent this bias reflects the fact that many of the oldeconomy corporate recruiters surveyed by Business Week interview and hire many more students from Eastern and Midwestern Schools than from Western Schools Such firms know that the odds of their attracting Haas graduates are low given the Schools small size and the preference of many Haas students to remain in the Bay Area and to work for New Economy firms too small andor too new to be included in Business Weeks survey of corporate recruiters Second according to a recent statistical analysis by MBA Program Director David Downs smaller business schools have historically done less well on Business Week rankings than larger ones This year as in past years most of the very top schools are at least twice as large as Haas as measured by the size of their MBA class Darden won the best showing for small schools this year earning a rank of while Tuck the smallest business school fell to Size and rank may be related in the Business Week methodology simply because large corporate recruiters are less likely to be well informed about the quality of programs at smaller schools and more likely to come away emptyhanded if they try to recruit at such schools Another troubling and perplexing conclusion of the Business Week methodology was the poor performance of the Haas School on a new indicator called intellectual capital This indicator which accounts for of the total score purports to assess the quality and influence of faculty research Haas ranked th out of on this measurea result that starkly contrasts with the ranking Haas earned for the quality of its faculty research from the Financial Times in January of this year We are concerned about the methodology adopted by Business Week For example the magazine states that its survey measured intellectual capital based on both the number of faculty publications in selected journals and the length of such articles The latter measure is surely a peculiar indicator of research excellence We hope to work with Business Week to learn more about its methodology in this area and to suggest ways it could be improved to provide more meaningful results As I stated at the outset there are things to be learned from the Business Week rankings For example students expressed some reservations about the quality of the curriculum I take these reservations very seriously and plan to initiate a fullscale discussion among faculty and students to determine what changes should be made in the curriculum Over the coming year I look forward to your comments observations and suggestions about how Haas can continue to improve in this and other areas At the same time I want to emphasize my belief that the Business Week rankings fail to reflect the worldclass attributes of the Haas School attributes that make it a very special place to get a business education GERTLER FINDS MEXICOS ANTIPOVERTY PROGRAM IMPROVES THE HEALTH OF POOR FAMILIES The Mexican antipoverty program PROGRESA has succeeded in reducing childhood illness by percent and has significantly increased the health of babies and pregnant mothers among program participants according to a recent study by Paul Gertler professor at Haas and faculty director of the Graduate Program in Health Management One of the greatest tragedies of extreme poverty is its intergenerational transmission says Gertler Few children of extremely poor parents are able to escape poverty Gertler evaluated the impact of PROGRESA on the health of young children and adults and on the economic productivity of the households participating in the program Gertler was one of six researchers from Mexico and the US evaluating the success of different aspects health nutrition education etc of PROGRESA PROGRESA was adopted in to promote education improve health care and health maintenance and better nutrition among Mexicos rural families living in extreme poverty The program provides education grants nutritional supplements education on hygiene and nutrition and cash transfers for food directly to mothers in participating villages This unique approach has been found to increase the chances that the benefits will be used for the purposes for which they were designed PROGRESA emphasizes helping children under six pregnant women and lactating women By the end of the program had reached approximately million families in almost localities in states Its budget was million or of the Mexican GDP In his evaluation of PROGRESAs health care effects Gertler found that participating villages showed a quicker increase in visits to the available health clinics than in nonparticipating villages The study also found that PROGRESA resulted in more pregnant women visiting health clinics during their first instead of their second or third trimesters thus increasing their own health and that of their babies As PROGRESA participants increasingly took advantage of the available health care such as visits to monitor nutrition prenatal care and immunization the number of severe illnesses declined reducing the number of hospitalizations by Due to the success of the program the PROGRESA model is already being adopted by other povertystricken countries such as Argentina Columbia Honduras and Nicaragua STUDENTS SHARE THE WEALTH THROUGH STUDENTS FOR STUDENTS Last year as part of an effort to support their fellow MBA students in pursuing less

Recession Risk is Rising According to Research by Professor Kenneth Rosen FCC Commissioner to Speak at Workshop on Regulating on the Technological Edge Thomas Siebel Inaugurates Second Year of Fisher Center Seminar Series Former Oracle President and COO Ray Lane Predicts the Future for DotComs Dean Emeritus Earl Budd Cheit Honored by Cal Performances New Faces at Haas Haas in the News Happening at Haas Haas Celebrations RECESSION RISK IS RISING ACCORDING TO RESEARCH BY PROFESSOR KENNETH ROSEN The risk that the US economy is headed for a recession is rising according to new research by Prof Kenneth Rosen cochair of the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economies at the Haas School and his coauthor Amanda Howard senior analyst at the consulting firm RCG Rosen and Howard based their conclusion on a study of eight leading economic indicators While advancements in technology have enabled notable productivity improvements those gains are overstated say the authors about the argument that increased productivity levels will continue to ward off a recession The US sits on the high end of an economic seesaw held up by a series of related and increasingly less sturdy imbalances High oil prices a tight labor market and a potentially weaker dollar will encourage price and wage inflation and potentially even higher interest rates say the authors At the same time likely declines in foreign investment and venture capital funding would encourage the stock market bubble to burst and thus reduce consumer spending As the technology sector continues to contract and without venture capital funding to support the large percentage of unprofitable Internet businesses a substantial number of jobs will be lost argue Howard and Rosen Under these circumstances the record level of private sector debt and the negative personal savings rate would become increasingly problematic It is the interaction of all of these imbalances that make the risk of a recession so great conclude the authors FCC COMMISSIONER TO SPEAK AT WORKSHOP ON REGULATING ON THE TECHNOLOGICAL EDGE Federal Communications Commissioner Michael K Powell will give the keynote address to the Regulating on the

Raghubir Applies Marketing Research To AIDS Prevention Efforts Haas Program Attracts NonBusiness Students From Across the US CED Creates Custom Programs for Los Alamos National Lab Haas EMail is Available on the Web Faculty News Haas in the News Happening at Haas Alumni Events Haas Celebrations PROF RAGHUBIR APPLIES MARKETING RESEARCH TO AIDS PREVENTION EFFORTS Individuals instinctive need to feel good about themselves adversely affects their ability to respond to many AIDS prevention campaigns and their willingness to change their behavior or seek treatment according to Priya Raghubir Haas assistant professor in marketing and Geeta Menon associate professor of marketing at New York University Raghubir and Menon applied the principles of marketing research to provide critical insight into how public health officials and social marketers can design more effective AIDS prevention campaigns As the epidemic is experiencing a rebound efforts to increase awareness of AIDS and risky behaviors now are as important as ever said Raghubir noting the United States is reporting an average of new cases of HIV infection each year It is critical that public health officials are able to craft surveys and educational campaigns that overcome bias and denial help audiences see themselves as at risk and prompt a positive response The researchers found that the self positivity bias a phenomenon that creates a need in individuals to feel good about themselves deters target audiences of AIDS awareness campaigns from identifying with the material in the ads and therefore prevents them from processing the information effectively Specifically this bias causes individuals to perceive that they are less likely than others to contract the virus or the disease Furthermore the less similar the person or situation depicted in the ad is to the individuals reading it the lower the individuals perceive their risk of contracting the virus Prevention campaigns are designed based on the results of surveys distributed to identify public awareness and levels of risky behavior Raghubir and Menon discovered that the same biases that plague prevention campaigns can be found in the surveys on which the ads are based For example the need to conform to social norms leads survey subjects to overstate their socially desirable behaviors eg use of condoms and to underreport their socially undesirable behaviors eg sharing needles Surveys generally remind individuals of unsafe behaviors they may have practiced However subjects may find it difficult to remember whether or how often they have engaged in these behaviors either because the survey mentioned several such behaviors or because the individuals have not engaged in such behaviors often or recently Difficulty in accessing this information leads to skewed survey responses Based on these findings the authors developed new guidelines for social marketers and public health officials to increase the effectiveness of AIDS prevention campaigns HAAS PROGRAM ATTRACTS NONBUSINESS STUDENTS FROM ACROSS THE US The Haas School has enrolled a group of undergraduates from institutions around the globe to participate in

second announcement regarding our plans for the EMBA Seminar in International Business Much of this message is a repeat of the initial one But some points have been added NEW MATERIAL As of today December we have received deposits from interested students Should you be interested in participating and have not yet applied please do so as soon as possible but in any case before the December deadline Regarding the possibility of visiting Cuba some of you have asked about the legality of this Please note that I have a license from the US Dept of the Treasury that permits me to send students enrolled in a legitimate course for credit to Cuba under certain conditions The current political situation in Indonesia is uncertain However my sources there indicate that it should be OK for us to visit there if we decide to do so But if the situation worsens we would alter the itinerary Some applications have been submitted without a preference for destination YOU MUST indicate your priority You can rank all three destinations if you wish but you must indicate at a minimum your priority for program A or B Should you not be selected for your first choice you will be transferred to the appropriate priority pool of your second choice REPEAT For those of you unfamiliar with this course please see groupsHaasGlobalNGcourseoutlinehtm for the version that looked at Ghana Belgium and the Netherlands or groupsHaasGlobalJVcourseoutlinehtm for the version that included Japan and Vietnam For we are going to try something slightly different We will have two distinct programs one will be a repeat of last years and the other will venture into new territory The details are as follows Please note that everything mentioned below is still tentative and subject to change or cancellation PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS Both programs will commence with a series of classes at Haas in June Program A led by Diane Dimeff will retrace the itinerary of the program to Ghana the Netherlands and Belgium The approximate dates for the travel portion will be Saturday July through Saturday July Program B led by Sebastian Teunissen will consist of one of two possible itineraries depending on student demand itinerary Cuba Panama and Venezuela or Costa Rica itinerary Australia and Indonesia Travel for program B will also start on approximately July and end on approximately July Costs for the programs are expected to be approximately equal to those charged in previous years with the exception of the AustraliaIndonesia option If this program is selected the final cost is likely to be roughly higher due to increased air fares Final costs will be determined once itineraries are set As you can see planning is still in the early stages But before we go much farther we need to know who is interested in participating So we need to receive expressions of interest in the form of a refundable deposit from interested students APPLICATION PRIORITIES Students will have different priorities depending on seniority Priorities are as follows Top Priority both programs students in fourth semester or higher in January who HAVE NOT participated in the program in a previous year Second Priority Program B only students in fourth semester or higher who did participate in the program in a previous year These students are not eligible for program A Lowest Priority both programs students in second or third semester Each group is limited to a maximum of students APPLICATION PROCEDURE Please submit to the Evening MBA office a check in the sum of payable to UC Regents together with the following information no later than December Name Semester level as of January Whether or not you have previously participated in the program Choice of program A or B If you choose program B please also indicate your preferred destination Latin America or AustraliaIndonesia email address Once we have a clear indication of preferences the final details will be planned and announced The announcement will likely be made in January At that time you will be advised of the program for which you are eligible You will then be asked to increase your deposit by and the entire deposit becomes nonrefundable OTHER ISSUES Please check your passport to ensure that it expires no earlier than December If it does please renew it now Passports with shorter expirations may be rejected for visas

Raghubir Applies Marketing Research To AIDS Prevention Efforts Haas Program Attracts NonBusiness Students From Across the US CED Creates Custom Programs for Los Alamos National Lab Haas EMail is Available on the Web Faculty News Haas in the News Happening at Haas Alumni Events Haas Celebrations PROF RAGHUBIR APPLIES MARKETING RESEARCH TO AIDS PREVENTION EFFORTS Individuals instinctive need to feel good about themselves adversely affects their ability to respond to many AIDS prevention campaigns and their willingness to change their behavior or seek treatment according to Priya Raghubir Haas assistant professor in marketing and Geeta Menon associate professor of marketing at New York University Raghubir and Menon applied the principles of marketing research to provide critical insight into how public health officials and social marketers can design more effective AIDS prevention campaigns As the epidemic is experiencing a rebound efforts to increase awareness of AIDS and risky behaviors now are as important as ever said Raghubir noting the United States is reporting an average of new cases of HIV infection each year It is critical that public health officials are able to craft surveys and educational campaigns that overcome bias and denial help audiences see themselves as at risk and prompt a positive response The researchers found that the self positivity bias a phenomenon that creates a need in individuals to feel good about themselves deters target audiences of AIDS awareness campaigns from identifying with the material in the ads and therefore prevents them from processing the information effectively Specifically this bias causes individuals to perceive that they are less likely than others to contract the virus or the disease Furthermore the less similar the person or situation depicted in the ad is to the individuals reading it the lower the individuals perceive their risk of contracting the virus Prevention campaigns are designed based on the results of surveys distributed to identify public awareness and levels of risky behavior Raghubir and Menon discovered that the same biases that plague prevention campaigns can be found in the surveys on which the ads are based For example the need to conform to social norms leads survey subjects to overstate their socially desirable behaviors eg use of condoms and to underreport their socially undesirable behaviors eg sharing needles Surveys generally remind individuals of unsafe behaviors they may have practiced However subjects may find it difficult to remember whether or how often they have engaged in these behaviors either because the survey mentioned several such behaviors or because the individuals have not engaged in such behaviors often or recently Difficulty in accessing this information leads to skewed survey responses Based on these findings the authors developed new guidelines for social marketers and public health officials to increase the effectiveness of AIDS prevention campaigns HAAS PROGRAM ATTRACTS NONBUSINESS STUDENTS FROM ACROSS THE US The Haas School has enrolled a group of undergraduates from institutions around the globe to participate in

students enrolled in a legitimate course for credit to Cuba under certain conditions The current political situation in Indonesia is uncertain However my sources there indicate that it should be OK for us to visit there if we decide to do so But if the situation worsens we would alter the itinerary Some applications have been submitted without a preference for destination YOU MUST indicate your priority You can rank all three destinations if you wish but you must indicate at a minimum your priority for program A or B Should you not be selected for your first choice you will be transferred to

School of Business the College of Engineering and the School of Information Management and Systems are launching an innovative program that blends academic training in entrepreneurship with handson industry experience at Silicon Valley startups The Mayfield Fund a toptier venture capital firm headquartered in Menlo Park California has committed million to fund the new program at UC Berkeley to be called the UC Berkeley Mayfield Fellows Program The new program will be administered by the Management of Technology Program MOT a partnership created in by the above three units of the UC Berkeley campus Under the UC Berkeley Mayfield Fellows Program graduate students selected from the College of Engineering the Haas School of Business and the School of Information Management and Systems work as summer interns at venturebacked high tech firms in Silicon Valley I dont believe any other university offers its graduate students such rigorous training in starting new hightech ventures from both a business and a technology perspective explains Richard Newton dean of the College of Engineering Add to that the opportunity to work directly for the CEO of a hightech startup as part of the academic experience and we have created something truly extraordinary for our students The first group of UC Berkeley Mayfield Fellows was announced this week four each from the College of Engineering and the Haas School all with extensive technical training and previous work experience in high tech The names of the fellows will be announced at a later date In addition to the summer internships UC Berkeley Mayfield Fellows participate in intensive classroom work intended to blend the practical experience gained through their internships with the challenge and growth of a series of graduate seminars on technology and entrepreneurship The UC Berkeley Mayfield Fellows Program is a great example of the way in which were succeeding at blending handson industry experience at Silicon Valley companies into the Haas academic experience says Andrew Isaacs executive director of MOT The joint MOTLester Center collaboration on this program makes this new venture all the more exciting The Mayfield Fund has made the million commitment to UC Berkeley as part of its support of the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society CITRIS being created within UC as a focal point to apply advances in information technology to the solution of societys most critical needs Mayfield is excited by the opportunity to participate with UC Berkeley in a program that will enrich the entrepreneurial experience for graduate students said Michael Levinthal Mayfield Fund general partner The continual success of startups that have flowed from UC Berkeley to the Bay Area and beyond is exceptional and Mayfield is proud of our association with this process CALIFORNIAS SLUMPING ECONOMY FACES MULTIYEAR RECOVERY SAYS RESEARCHERS As Californias prosperous glow begins to tarnish the state as a whole faces sharply escalating unemployment rates a leveling off or decline in home prices rising office vacancies and reduced construction over the next two to three years These are the conclusions of Professor Dwight Jaffee and California economist Cynthia Kroll of the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics In the centers recently released Spring Research Report Jaffee and Kroll point to the vulnerability of California and particularly of the San Francisco Bay Area as the US economy slows The authors look at the states experience in past recessions and conclude that a two to three year adjustment period is likely before the state resumes expansion Jaffee and Kroll point out that the major stock price adjustments that occurred earlier this year reflected real changes in the economic factors driving Californias economy Driven by expansion of dotcom and high tech sectors computer programming employment alone grew by over jobs in with much of this increase found in the San Francisco Bay Area The bursting of the dotcom bubble and subsequent layoff announcements leave this sector and the Bay Area particularly vulnerable The real estate market will also feel the effects in coming months and the impact on the office real estate market is likely to be substantial In fact prices have already begun to decline in this sector San Franciscos SoMa South of Market district which has recently put on the market many offices geared toward dotcomtype firms is most likely to suffer as a wave of these companies goes out of business The authors argue that office rents could drop substantially at least in San Franciscos downtown area and perhaps as much as in the areas most heavily affected by the dotcom bust Dropping rents could temper the rise in vacancies Companies that were previously forced out of the market by skyhigh lease prices are now looking at reduced rates The residential real estate market will also be affected by the economic adjustment Kroll and Jaffee expect the highend residential real estate market previously fueled by stock market gains to contract the most as the crop of dotcom employees who found their way to quick wealth sell their newly overpriced homes Lower and midrange markets will see more moderate price adjustments Based on past history the researchers maintain that job losses and declining real estate prices could continue for two to three years They point out that in the longer term both Silicon Valley and California as a whole have shown an economic resilience and the ability to resume expansion after a slowdown or recession UC BERKELEY TEAMS WIN TWO REAL ESTATE CHALLENGES Victory came to the Haas and other UC Berkeley graduate students who participated in the two

interest usually of importance to policy debates and they provide tremendous insights into these matters Yellens work includes major contributions in international economics macroeconomics microeconomics labor economics and the economics of social policy Her writing has often focused on federal economic policy issues She has served as Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers and as a

ranking of business schools in a special section of the newspaper on Monday April Although the Haas School ranked only st out of in the survey the schools showing outscored all other business schools from the West Coast through the Rocky Mountain states including Thunderbird UC Irvine UC Davis UCLAAnderson Brigham Young and surprisingly Stanford This is the first time in any major media ranking of business schools that HaasBerkeley has done better than Stanfords Graduate School of Business The Journals ranking of business schools its first ever is based on the opinions of MBA recruiters The schools themselves supplied the names of its recruiters to the newspaper Each recruiter was asked to rate as many as three schools and was instructed to rate only schools with which he or she had recruiting experience in the previous two years Under the rules recruiters who were also alumni of the school at which they recruited were permitted to rate their own alma mater The Journals methodology produced results that are sure to be much discussed and questioned Traditional powerhouse business schools such as Wharton Columbia Duke and Stanford were significantly outranked by lesserknown business schools such as Purdue Southern Methodist University Wake Forest and Michigan State In general schools from the Western States did less well than others in the Journals ranking which has also been true of Business Weeks survey that is based in part on a smaller survey of recruiters The top school in the Journals ranking was Dartmouths Tuck School followed by Carnegie Mellon Yale Michigan and NorthwesternKellogg The editor of the special Journal section Ron Alsop told a group of business school deans in New York last week there are a lot of surprises in the Journals rankings Alsop spoke at an annual conference of business schools The Journal also listed the Haas School as being among the top schools in the world that excels in the teaching of ecommence subjects and the th best school internationally for its students entrepreneurial skills These rankings were also based on recruiter input The results of the Wall Street Journals survey are clearly controversial underscoring the need to think deeply about each ranking and what it purports to measure said Richard Kurovsky executive director of marketing and communications at the Haas School With the continuing proliferation of new rankings schools that do well in one ranking now find themselves doing less well in the next forcing everyone to sort out what it all means This may ultimately be a very good thing for the consumers of rankings In other rankings over the past eight months Haas has placed in US News in the Financial Times ranking of international business schools and in Business Weeks survey The entire package of Wall Street Journal rankings and related stories can be viewed online at specialreportsbschoolguideindexhtml BERKELEY TEAM WINS ADVERTISING CASE COMPETITION The team

CENTER LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD William Hambrecht the legendary investment banker who brought us Apple Computer Genentech and the OpenIPO is the recipient of the Lester Center Lifetime Achievement Award at UC Berkeleys Haas School of Business The award will be presented by the Lester Center for Entrepreneurship Innovation at the UC Berkeley Entrepreneurs Forum on Thursday April in Arthur Andersen Auditorium Hambrecht is best known as the cofounder of the firm Hambrecht Quist who se westcoast style investment banking helped launch some of Silicon Valleys greatest success stories In the firm managed the initial public offerings of Apple Genentech and People Express By Hambrecht Qui st had worked with over companies including Adobe Systems Advanced Fiber Communications Apollo Computer Convergent Technologies Evans Sutherlan d ReadRite Sybase VLSI Technologies and Xilinx In Hambrecht Quist managed the IPO of Boston Beer maker of Samuel Adams Boston Lager that inspired Hambrecht to brainstorm the possibility o f IPOs that are open to the public Boston Beer CEO Jim Koch insisted on maki ng percent of the IPO shares available to his market the people who drank his beer The idea meant taking a significant portion of the shares away fr om institutional investors the industrys mainstay In addition opening the IPO to individuals required shipping sixpacks to the stores with little forms attached that allowed consumers to make a bid to buy a piece of Bosto n Beer However the new approach demonstrated its business potential when the million IPO in was oversubscribed by million all from individual investors The question was how to streamline the process Answer the Internet In Bill Hambrecht decided to start a new firm WR Hambrecht Co that uses the Internet to create an open system for all investors from individual consumers to the largest institutional investors to have equa l opportunities to make bids for IPO stocks thus the name OpenIPO OpenIPOs are not only open to small investors but are built on a Dutch auction model where the investors not the investment bank set the price WR Hambrecht Cos most recent IPO included Peets Coffee and Tea a smal l

it comes again Diane HI Everyone Its just about time to think about registering for Fall classes Early next week TJ will be sending materials to your home addresses and its very important that you read through them carefully In the meantime Ive attached a preliminary list of electives that will be offered Most importantly please remember that there are two rounds of preenrollment for Fall classes You must enroll in classes during Round I to retain your seniority status in classes So for example if you are going to be a fifth semester student in the fall and forget to sign up for classes during Round I and then try to get into an oversubscribed class in Round II you will have lost your seniority status because you did not sign up in Round I For those of you who would like to get academic advising eg Which courses do I take if I want to be a consumer products marketer or program planning eg How do graduate in five semesters please feel free to make a telephone or inperson appointment with me Advising by email is nearly impossible because of the level detail required for effective advising As course descriptions become available they will be put up on the web UPDATES ON UNKNOWNS IN THE EvMBA ELECTIVE COURSES E Corporate Financial Reporting Brett Trueman Brett Trueman is the Accounting group chair and is a fabulous teacher winning the Outstanding Teacher of the Year Award in the day program If youre interested in Corporate Finance or Investments you should take this course eventually E Corporate Finance Levy Amnon Levy has a PhD from Kellogg did his undergraduate work in economics here at Berkeley and is visiting next year from NYU E Futures and Options Manuel Ammann Prof Ammann is a visitor from the University of St Gallen in Switzerland He visited here last year and I heard he is great E Leadership Nancy Euske Nancy teaches the core course in OB and has done an excellent job This will NOT be Jenny Chatmans Leadership course taught by Nancy Euske It will be Nancys Leadership course Please check the web site for a detailed description E HighTech Marketing Rajiv Surendra Rajiv has a PhD from Carnegie Mellon and will be visiting here next year from the University of Chicago Hes taught High Tech Marketing and Pricing Strategies in both the full and parttime MBA programs at Chicago E Branding Upshaw Lynn Upshaw is principal of Upshaw Associates a national brand and marketing consulting practice Mr Upshaw was formerly Executive Vice PresidentBrand Marketing for Ketchum Communications Worldwide and has written two books Building Brand Identity A Strategy for Success in a Hostile Marektplace and The Masterbrand Mandate E Deals Shelanski Howard Shelanski is a professor at Boalt and the basic premise of the course is to tie contract theory contract law and business strategy together How do structures of relationships between firms or more generally contracting parties change with contract law and strategic imperatives The course will give students some tools to think about business development from both a legal and economic standpoint E EBusiness Supply Chain Management Hamid Noori Hamid is a Professor of Technology and Operations Management at the Laurier Business School Wilfird Laureir University in Waterloo Ontario E New Telecom Ventues Bob Harris Bob Harris is a young retired faculty member who went on to establish a very successful consulting company Bob is a great teacher I had him for Macro and he is thrilled to be back teaching a course on Entrepreneurship in Telecommunications E Pricing Strategy Scott Davis Scott is teaching this course this semester and is doing a great job He used to be a faculty member at Washington University in St Louis where he won the Outstanding Teacher of the Year Award but he moved out here and established a successful marketing consulting practice in the Sacramento area COURSES YOU MIGHT THINK ABOUT IN THE DAY PROGRAM BA Portfolio Management Th pm Jim Wilcox Jim teaches our EB class though he has been serving in Washington DC as Comptroller of the Treasury for the past two years and won the Outstanding Teacher of the Year Award in the EvMBA Program just before he left for DC This course will be banking related covering topics such as interest risk and measuring and controlling credit risk in financial institutions BA Contemporary Philanthropy Th pm Fran Van Loo Fran is a Haas economist who also runs the Public and NotforProfit Program BAC Entrepreneurship Workshop M pm Danner This course is for those students who are actually in the process of going live with an entrepreneurial idea Please check the website for details BAD Strategic Marketing Planning Th pm Peter Wilton Some overlap with E but definitely a great class taught by a great instructor SOME GENERAL COMMENTS You should try to take Competitive Strategy as late in your program as you possibly can You will get a lot more out of it if you bring to the course as much previous coursework as possible Obviously you need to balance this against the risk of the course not being offered in subsequent semesters but it is best to take that course later in your program Currently Katz is scheduled to teach the course in Spring as well as F Finance is divided into two main areas Corporate Finance and Investments Corporate Finance if you are interested in corporate finance you would probably want to take some combination of E E E E for companies doing a lot of internationalglobal operations and perhaps E and perhaps E Valuation for large companies involved in a lot of acquisitions Investments if youre interested in Investments investment banking financial services etc you should probably want to take some combination of E E andor E for individuals going into Mergers and Acquisitions E andor E and E if your company is involved in intl markets If you dont want to go into finance but feel like you need a little more finance that just E Money Markets E is a great class taught by a great instructor Please see web for more detail If you are truly interested in concentrating in marketing the two core electives for marketers are E Marketing Research and EB Product Management These two courses will give you the critical basics needed for careers in marketing Additionally Pricing Strategy is an important course The many other marketing classes are more specific to particular industries eg Internet Strategy HighTech Marketing etc I believe very strongly that EVERYONE should graduate with at least one OB elective In addition to the very popular Negotiations course we have some other great OB classes Org Strategy with Bahrami Leadership with Chatman or Euske Power and Politics in Orgs with Schroth in Spring etc When alums are surveyed they always say I wish I took more OB I know youve heard me say this a million times If anything else comes up Ill keep you posted Cheers Diane Felectivesdoc

Responds to Business Week Ranking of Haas School Gertler Finds Mexicos AntiPoverty Program Improves the Health of Poor Families Students Share the Wealth Through Students for Students New Staff Haas in the News Happening at Haas Haas Celebrations DEAN TYSON RESPONDS TO BUSINESS WEEK RANKING OF HAAS SCHOOL By Laura Tyson The Haas School of Business is one of the worlds outstanding business schools The best indicator of its quality is market competition The very top business schools compete vigorously with Haas for students and faculty And Haas MBAs are regularly courted and hired by many of the worlds most selective firms The recent rankings of business schools published by Business Week do not reflect these market assessments of the quality of the Haas School In contrast to a rank of in the Business Week results Haas earned a rank of in US News a rank of among US schools in the Financial Times and a rank of in Forbes during the last year The discrepancy in these results suggests that there are special features of the Business Week methodology that make it a misleading measure of quality Nonetheless there are lessons to be learned and information to be gleaned by analyzing the Business Week results Lets start with a few bright spots The Haas School ranked in student satisfaction which accounts for about of the total score This is a reasonable showing one that has improved over time and one that I am committed to improve still further in the future This years ranking in student satisfaction is based on opinions from the Class of which accounted for of the responses as well as opinions from the classes of and each of which accounted for of the responses The two earlier classes did not benefit from the many enhancements in school services that have been realized during the last two years With the Schools dedication to continuous improvement we hope and anticipate that satisfaction levels among current and future students will continue to trend upward I am enormously pleased that the Career Services office and its outstanding professional team have revitalized this missioncritical service at the Haas School In its last survey only two years ago Business Week ranked the Haas career services office at the bottom of its top list Only two years later Business Week applauded the efforts of the Career Services staff Praise for their efforts is richly deserved Probably the most troubling aspect of the Business Week survey was the ranking by corporate recruiters According to this indicator which accounts for of the total score the Haas School fell from two years ago to this year Despite the Schools disappointing ranking on this measure however the performance of Haas students on the job marketas measured by both the number of job offers per student and the median postMBA salary per studentwas as good or better than most of the other business schools that were ranked higher on the recruiter survey There are two partial explanations for this puzzling discrepancy First the Business Week methodology appears to suffer from a persistent East Coast bias in its survey of recruiters No school west of the Mississippi made it into Business Weeks top ten this year and West coast schools have always done less well than Eastern and Midwestern Schools in Business Week rankings To some extent this bias reflects the fact that many of the oldeconomy corporate recruiters surveyed by Business Week interview and hire many more students from Eastern and Midwestern Schools than from Western Schools Such firms know that the odds of their attracting Haas graduates are low given the Schools small size and the preference of many Haas students to remain in the Bay Area and to work for New Economy firms too small andor too new to be included in Business Weeks survey of corporate recruiters Second according to a recent statistical analysis by MBA Program Director David Downs smaller business schools have historically done less well on Business Week rankings than larger ones This year as in past years most of the very top schools are at least twice as large as Haas as measured by the size of their MBA class Darden won the best showing for small schools this year earning a rank of while Tuck the smallest business school fell to Size and rank may be related in the Business Week methodology simply because large corporate recruiters are less likely to be well informed about the quality of programs at smaller schools and more likely to come away emptyhanded if they try to recruit at such schools Another troubling and perplexing conclusion of the Business Week methodology was the poor performance of the Haas School on a new indicator called intellectual capital This indicator which accounts for of the total score purports to assess the quality and influence of faculty research Haas ranked th out of on this measurea result that starkly contrasts with the ranking Haas earned for the quality of its faculty research from the Financial Times in January of this year We are concerned about the methodology adopted by Business Week For example the magazine states that its survey measured intellectual capital based on both the number of faculty publications in selected journals and the length of such articles The latter measure is surely a peculiar indicator of research excellence We hope to work with Business Week to learn more about its methodology in this area and to suggest ways it could be improved to provide more meaningful results As I stated at the outset there are things to be learned from the Business Week rankings For example students expressed some reservations about the quality of the curriculum I take these reservations very seriously and plan to initiate a fullscale discussion among faculty and students to determine what changes should be made in the curriculum Over the coming year I look forward to your comments observations and suggestions about how Haas can continue to improve in this and other areas At the same time I want to emphasize my belief that the Business Week rankings fail to reflect the worldclass attributes of the Haas School attributes that make it a very special place to get a business education GERTLER FINDS MEXICOS ANTIPOVERTY PROGRAM IMPROVES THE HEALTH OF POOR FAMILIES The Mexican antipoverty program PROGRESA has succeeded in reducing childhood illness by percent and has significantly increased the health of babies and pregnant mothers among program participants according to a recent study by Paul Gertler professor at Haas and faculty director of the Graduate Program in Health Management One of the greatest tragedies of extreme poverty is its intergenerational transmission says Gertler Few children of extremely poor parents are able to escape poverty Gertler evaluated the impact of PROGRESA on the health of young children and adults and on the economic productivity of the households participating in the program Gertler was one of six researchers from Mexico and the US evaluating the success of different aspects health nutrition education etc of PROGRESA PROGRESA was adopted in to promote education improve health care and health maintenance and better nutrition among Mexicos rural families living in extreme poverty The program provides education grants nutritional supplements education on hygiene and nutrition and cash transfers for food directly to mothers in participating villages This unique approach has been found to increase the chances that the benefits will be used for the purposes for which they were designed PROGRESA emphasizes helping children under six pregnant women and lactating women By the end of the program had reached approximately million families in almost localities in states Its budget was million or of the Mexican GDP In his evaluation of PROGRESAs health care effects Gertler found that participating villages showed a quicker increase in visits to the available health clinics than in nonparticipating villages The study also found that PROGRESA resulted in more pregnant women visiting health clinics during their first instead of their second or third trimesters thus increasing their own health and that of their babies As PROGRESA participants increasingly took advantage of the available health care such as visits to monitor nutrition prenatal care and immunization the number of severe illnesses declined reducing the number of hospitalizations by Due to the success of the program the PROGRESA model is already being adopted by other povertystricken countries such as Argentina Columbia Honduras and Nicaragua STUDENTS SHARE THE WEALTH THROUGH STUDENTS FOR STUDENTS Last year as part of an effort to support their fellow MBA students in pursuing less

Recession Risk is Rising According to Research by Professor Kenneth Rosen FCC Commissioner to Speak at Workshop on Regulating on the Technological Edge Thomas Siebel Inaugurates Second Year of Fisher Center Seminar Series Former Oracle President and COO Ray Lane Predicts the Future for DotComs Dean Emeritus Earl Budd Cheit Honored by Cal Performances New Faces at Haas Haas in the News Happening at Haas Haas Celebrations RECESSION RISK IS RISING ACCORDING TO RESEARCH BY PROFESSOR KENNETH ROSEN The risk that the US economy is headed for a recession is rising according to new research by Prof Kenneth Rosen cochair of the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economies at the Haas School and his coauthor Amanda Howard senior analyst at the consulting firm RCG Rosen and Howard based their conclusion on a study of eight leading economic indicators While advancements in technology have enabled notable productivity improvements those gains are overstated say the authors about the argument that increased productivity levels will continue to ward off a recession The US sits on the high end of an economic seesaw held up by a series of related and increasingly less sturdy imbalances High oil prices a tight labor market and a potentially weaker dollar will encourage price and wage inflation and potentially even higher interest rates say the authors At the same time likely declines in foreign investment and venture capital funding would encourage the stock market bubble to burst and thus reduce consumer spending As the technology sector continues to contract and without venture capital funding to support the large percentage of unprofitable Internet businesses a substantial number of jobs will be lost argue Howard and Rosen Under these circumstances the record level of private sector debt and the negative personal savings rate would become increasingly problematic It is the interaction of all of these imbalances that make the risk of a recession so great conclude the authors FCC COMMISSIONER TO SPEAK AT WORKSHOP ON REGULATING ON THE TECHNOLOGICAL EDGE Federal Communications Commissioner Michael K Powell will give the keynote address to the Regulating on the
