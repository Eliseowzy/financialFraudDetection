WASHINGTON FEDERAL AFFAIRS FERC DeFederalizes California Markets Adopts Other Structural Reforms At a special meeting Friday afternoon FERC unanimously approved its eagerl y awaited final order reforming the California wholesale markets adopting th e major outlines of its November proposed order and sending back to California the responsibility for addressing staterelated matters At the same time FERC deferred consideration of retroactive refund issues as well as the imposition of regionwide price caps FERC reiterated their earlier conclusions that under certain circumstances California ratepayers were subjected to unjust and unreasonable power rates due to Californias seriously flawed market structure and rules in conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions throughout the West FERC adopted the November proposal to eliminate effective immediately the states mandatory requirement that the states investorowned utilities buy and sell electricity through the PX and allow these utilities to purchase electricity through forward contracts and other alternative mechanisms to manage supply risks FERC terminated the PXs rate schedules effective at the close of business on April In effect as Chairman James Hoecker stated the order defederalizes percent of the California wholesale market established under the states restructuring law returning ratemaking authority over companyowned generation to the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC The agency also modified the effective period of the MWh soft cap proposal limiting its application through April whereupon a comprehensive and systematic monitoring and mitigation program which incorporates appropriate thresholds screen and mitigation measures must b e in place In a related move FERC ordered a technical conference early nex t year to develop such a program by March so that these measures can be place by the May deadline Energy Secretary Issues Order to Power Generators and Marketers To Bolst er Californias Supplies Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has responded to the severely constrained power supply situation in California by issuing an order pursuant to Secti on c of the Federal Power Act to require generators and marketers to mak e power available to meet the states electricity needs The emergency directive requires that if the California independent system operator ISO certifies that there is an inadequate supply of electricity certain suppliers would be required to make power available to the ISO if they have power available in excess of the amount needed to satisfy service to firm customers Those suppliers that have provided power to the California power exchange PX and the ISO over the last days that have firm capacity available would be subject to the order Under the order the ISO is required to provide notice to each supplier subject to the order of the amount and type of service requested by pm EST on the day before the requested service The ISO must to the extent feasible allocate the requests in proportion to the amount of each suppliers available power The price for the power provided pursuant to t he order will be set by an agreement between the ISO and the supplier If no agreement is reached FERC is to determine the just and reasonable rate at a later date The order will remain in effect until am EST on December unless modified EPA Sets Plans to Regulate Plants Mercury Emissions EPA Administrator Carol Browner in a longawaited announcement indicated last week that the Administration will require reductions of mercury emissions from coal and oilfired power plants The agency stated that it plans to propose new regulations in December and hopes to finalize ne w rules by December In the wake of the decision EEI called on EPA to make certain that any program to control utilities mercury emissions be based on the best scientific information available in order to assure the protection of publi c health EEI urges EPA to maintain its commitment to resolving the key scientific and technological issues said Paul Bailey EEI Vice President Environmental Affairs Given these uncertainties EEI is disappointed that the regulatory determination includes statements regarding public health threats and hazards that are unsupported by current science said Mr Bail ey In the meantime the electric power industry will continue to work with al l stakeholders to determine the extent to which additional mercury reductions from power plants may be needed and how those cuts should be achieved Mr Bailey concluded MERGERS ACQUISITIONS Calpine Completes Acquisition of EMI Power Assets Calpine Corporation has announced that it has completed the acquisition of power assets from Energy Management Inc EMI In the deal Calpine acquired the remaining interest in three recently constructed combinedcyc le power generating facilities located in New England as well as a joint marketing venture between Calpine and EMI Prior to the transaction Calpi ne held a percent net interest in the projects We are very pleased to have completed the acquisition of these new and highly efficient power plants The Dighton Tiverton and Rumford faciliti es were among the first merchant power plants to enter commercial operation in New England said Calpine Senior Vice President Bob Alff Combined with our other announced project in the Northeast we have created a coordinated system of lowcost assets with excellent geographic diversity to provide power to a very attractive New England market added Alff Exelon Completes Acquisition of Percent of Sithe Exelon Corporation and Sithe Energies have announced the completion of Exelons acquisition of percent of the stock of Sithe The completion of the acquisition finalizes an agreement in

are summaries of two significant activities that occurred Friday December Energy Secretary Richardson issuance of an emergency order Richardsons statement and FPA Section c order is posted on DOEs Web site at HQPressreleasesdecprprhtml FERCs final order to fix California wholesale markets FERCs Order can be viewed at issuesnewscalorderpdf California Supplies Ordered by Richardson o Richardson orders listed entities to supply excess power to California ISO o Order is effective as soon as ISO certifies shortage but ends unless extended o Prices to be agreed to by supplier and ISO or FERC will set rate later o FPA emergency power authority transferred to DOE in As he said he would on December US Department of Energy Secretary Bill Richardson found an emergency exists in California by reason of the shortage of electric energy and issued an emergency order under section c of the Federal Power Act FPA requiring listed generators and marketers to provide any power in excess of the needs of their firm customers to the California ISO In a statement Richardson said the threat to the reliability of the California grid requires a longterm solution but that in the shortterm power must keep flowing to the state to avert blackouts The listed suppliers have hours after the ISO certifies to DOE that it has been unable to acquire adequate supplies in the market to begin providing requested service to the ISO The ISO must inform each supplier subject to the order of the amount and type of energy or services required by PM Eastern Standard Time the day before the services are needed The order directs the ISO to allocate to the extent feasible requested services among subject entities in proportion to each suppliers available excess power The order is effective immediately and will terminate at AM Eastern Time December unless extended To continue to obtain supplies under this emergency authority the ISO must recertify the shortage to DOE headquarters every hours The terms of the provision of electric energy and other services by suppliers to the ISO are to be agreed to by the parties If no agreement is reached then under the FPAs emergency authority Secretary Richardson will immediately prescribe the conditions of service and refer the rate issue to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for a determination at a later date by that agency in accordance with its standards and procedures and will prescribe by supplemental order such rates as it finds to be just and reasonable The authority of FERC to set rates for power supplied under emergency order at just and reasonable levels where the parties themselves do not agree to a rate is explicitly included in FPA Section c The DOE Organization Act of transferred the emergency powers of this section from FERC to DOE The entities identified in the orders attachment are all the entities that have provided power to the ISO over the last days Those entities are ordered to make arrangements to generate deliver interchange and transmit electric energy when as and in such amounts as may be requested by the ISO acting as agent for and on behalf of Scheduling Coordinators Source DOE Secretary Richardsons December statement and order Electric Power Daily December FERC DeFederalizes California Markets Adopts Other Structural Reforms A summary of the December Order and Commission Discussion At its special meeting today FERC unanimously approved its eagerly awaited final order reforming the California wholesale markets adopting the major outlines of its November proposed order and sending back to California the responsibility for addressing staterelated matters as discussed below At the same time FERC deferred consideration of retroactive refund issues as well as the imposition of regionwide price caps FERC reiterated the November conclusions that under certain circumstances California ratepayers were subjected to unjust and unreasonable power rates due to Californias seriously flawed market structure and rules in conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions throughout the West While all four commissioners supported the order as a consensusbased outcome that appropriately balanced all competing interests each commissioner expressed reservations with particular aspects of the order Chairman Hoecker and Comm Breathitt expressed the strongest endorsement while Comms Hebert and Massey laid out their positions where they believed the Commission had either overreached or not gone far enough just as they did on November as discussed below Highlights of key actions FERC adopted the November proposal to eliminate effective immediately the states mandatory requirement that the states investorowned utilities buy and sell electricity through the PX and allow these utilities to purchase electricity through forward contracts and other alternative mechanisms to manage supply risks FERC terminated the PXs rate schedules effective at the close of business on April In effect as Chairman Hoecker stated the order defederalizes percent of the California wholesale market established under the states restructuring law returning ratemaking authority over companyowned generation to the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC FERC modified the effective period of the November MWh soft cap proposal limiting its application through April whereupon a comprehensive and systematic monitoring and mitigation program which incorporates appropriate thresholds screen and mitigation measures must be in place In a related move FERC ordered a technical conference early next year to develop such a program by March so that these measures can be place by the May deadline In a major modification FERC revised the refund conditions to clarify that while certain refund conditions will continue to apply unless FERC issues written notification to the seller that its transaction is still under review refund potential on a transaction will close after days As proposed however supply bids in excess of will be prohibited from setting the marketclearing price for all bidders and sellers bidding above MWh will be required to report their bids to FERC on a confidential weekly basis and provide certain cost support FERC adopted the November proposal to require the establishment of independent nonstakeholder governing board for the ISO The ISO Governing Board must relinquish their decisionmaking power and operating control to the ISO management on January A future order will set procedures for discussion with state representatives on the board selection process In a major modification FERC adopted a MWh price benchmark for assessing prices of fiveyear energy supply contracts This benchmark will be used in assessing any complaints regarding justness and reasonableness of pricing longterm contracts To facilitate prompt negotiation of longer term power contracts at reasonable rates FERC announced that it will hold a settlement conference with market participants FERC adopted the November proposal to require market participants to schedule percent of their transactions in the dayahead market and instituting a penalty charge for underscheduling in excess of five percent of hourly load requirements in order to discourage overreliance on the realtime spot market FERC directed the ISO and the three investorowned utilities to file generation interconnection standards FERC affirmed the longerterm measures proposed in the November order including submission of a congestion management design proposal by April FERC deferred resolving key issues including establishing new ISO board selection procedures developing appropriate market monitoring measures and negotiating protective orders associated with data collection FERC reiterated its November call to California policy makers there to resolve state issues such as immediately implementing the availability of day ahead markets for power purchases development of demand responses siting of generation and transmission and assurance of sufficient reserve requirements Commissioner Responses Comm Hebert reluctantly concurred calling the final order a missed opportunity to among other things send appropriate signals for new generation siting and conservation Reiterating his November concerns Hebert recounted the remedial remedies that he maintained the Commission should and should not have adopted While expressing pleasure at the tone of the order balanced and considerate the bid certainly reversal and the role reserved for the state in the selection of the new ISO board Hebert nonetheless objected to the benchmark prices established in the order which he maintained appeared to be unreasonably low Hebert faulted the Commission for not attempting to reconcile the instant order with the November order approving the CA ISOs emergency MWh soft cap proposal Hebert ended by challenging the CPUC to do what it can to encourage utilities there to forward contract including easing the existing prudence review requirements Comm Breathitt endorsed the Order reiterating her support for progress towards open and competitive markets She noted that the Order properly walked the line by taking all of the competing interests into account calling it less than ideal but a step in the right direction She also concentrated her remarks on the importance of creating stability which will be accomplished by encouraging long term contracts and the implementation of the MWh breakpoint Additionally she mentioned that any price below the MWh benchmark will be presumed just and reasonable Comm Massey concurred but prefaced his remarks by expressing sympathy for California ratepayers stating that he felt that market power had been exercised that prices were not just and reasonable and that the marketers had profited too much at the expense of others in the market He warned that as he understood the legal precedents the Federal Courts were poised to grant cost recovery relief to the retailers which would then be passed on to consumers On the positive side he approved of the defederalization of of the market and the creation of long term contracts However he emphasized that California regulators must now take the responsibility of creating more generation and transmission In the long term Comm Massey hoped that solutions could be reached starting with a technical conference and that the market would have rules more like PJM Finally Comm Massey articulated what he would have liked to have done differently He stated that he disagreed with the fact that there is not enough evidence to show that market power existed and he pointed to the ongoing investigation He also disagreed with the MWh breakpoint preferring instead a hard price per generator The Commissioner said he would have set the long term benchmark for only two years instead of five and that he would have opened a section investigation in the West Finally he stated that he would have liked to address the issue of refunds Chairman Hoecker began his comments by saying that the Commission was forced to act and act quickly because the stakes are so high He feels that it is now time for the state regulators and markets to act He noted that by shrinking the Cal PX the responsibility is now with the CPUC to fashion the long term contracts and that hopefully we will exit this situation with the least amount of damage to the utilities In regards to suggestions for a regional price cap the Chairman stated that this would not work due to the fact that the Commission has no jurisdiction over Bonneville WAPA and the public power producers and that there is no spot market in the Northwest However he did urge Secretary Richardson to convene a conference in order to address regional issues Finally in conceptually addressing the California situation the Chairman stated that competition or deregulation did not fail in California but that there never was competition in California

Alliance Express The following is a summary of the most recent FERC meeting followed by a listing of the most recent FERC filings In a brief meeting yesterday FERC approved a Final Rule adopting Section merger filing requirements generally as proposed and extended the existing NYISO bid cap in its nonspinning reserves market and the related mandatory bidding requirement until such time that the New York market can be determined to be workably competitive At the same time FERC ordered a technical conference to explore changes to the NYISO reserves market and urged market participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution next steps and deadlines for resolutionimplementation Additional details are provided below FERC Updates Streamlines Merger Filing Process FERC unanimously approved its proposed Order revising the reporting requirements for mergers However Comm Hebert did so with reservations as discussed below Commission staff stated that the Order closely follows the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking previously issued but adds more detail and more certainty to the industry Staff stated that the Order is improved over the proposed rule because it includes exemptions from reporting for certain entities and it more precisely defines geographical areas and products According to FERC the draft Order revises the Commissions filing requirements to reflect existing merger policy based on FERCs Merger Policy Guidelines provides more detail for the industry in developing competitive market analyses The rule continues the existing screening process for mergers with potential horizontal competitive concerns In addition the rule establishes informational requirements for vertical competitive analyses streamlines filing requirements for transactions that do not raise competitive concerns and reduces the industrys regulatory burden by eliminating outdated filing requirements The Rule will take effect days after its publication in the Federal Register Commissioner Reaction Comm Hebert expressed reservations that although he was voting for the Rule FERC should not be duplicating the Department of Justice DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission FTC market concentration analyses and that FERC should follow the lead of antitrust enforcement officials who could also analyze mergers faster and more confidentially He also stated that FERC should review the filings after the DOJ or the FTC review them not before and that there should be a definite time frame for review Hebert did mention that he was pleased that RTOs and the disposition of transmission assets would be exempt that ancillary services would be considered as a separate product and that the Final Rule opens the door for alternative market analysis Comm Breathitt supported the Final Rule stating that it should expedite the approval process and that the regulatory burden should be eased due to the fact that older irrelevant requirements have been dropped She indicated that the Final Rule balanced the need for speedy decisions while protecting the public interest by stating that the process will be efficient yet sufficient The Commissioner said that she was pleased the Final Rule addressed technical issues such as computer modeling as well as retail competition and one of her main concerns confidentiality Comm Massey fully supported the Final Rule emphasizing that it would improve response time lessen the need to ask for more data and allow the industry to better predict Commission actions Like Commissioner Breathitt Massey was pleased that the Order will allow market modeling analysis that will better enable FERC to evaluate market concentration and allow applicants to point to other factors when concentration appears too high Massey also stated that the new Rule includes the ability to address many of FERCs concerns such as future mergers when they occur in succession retail competition mitigation by the enlargement of markets through RTOs and analysis of ancillary services In sum he averred that the Order will provide FERC with the tools it needs for accurate analysis while taking into consideration the rapid changes in the industry Chairman Hoecker also voiced his support and noted that he felt that this was a very important Rule In response to Comm Hebert Chairman Hoecker said that the DOJ and FTC actually wait for FERCs report before issuing their own that the antitrust enforcement agencies rely on FERCs expertise when reviewing mergers in the electric and gas industries There is a major positive connection between industry consolidation and RTOs and that both are reconfiguring the markets and effect how they work he noted Because the RTOs enlarge the size of the subject market he indicated RTOs will help to preserve competition Therefore more and larger RTOs should allow for more mergers he said The Chairman cautioned that this is not to imply that joining an RTO is a requirement for a merger but that it would certainly be viewed favorably NYISO Bid Caps Extended Until Ancillary Service Market Shown to be Workably Competitive In a decision with Comm Hebert dissenting FERC extended the existing NYISO bid cap in its nonspinning reserves market and the related mandatory bidding requirement until such time as that market can be determined to be workably competitive At the same time FERC ordered a technical conference to explore changes to the NYISO reserves market and urged market participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution next steps and deadlines for resolutionimplementation In so doing FERC rejected certain aspects of NYISOs September and compliance filing submitted pursuant to its May order imposing a temporary bid cap through October The ISOs efforts to correct market flaws identified in the order and further strengthen market performance had not yet satisfied the Commissions directives FERC concluded FERC found that while NYISO has achieved solid progress in certain areas overall the ISO has not shown sufficient improvement to warrant raising and then gradually lifting the temporary bid cap in the ISOs nonspinning reserve market by April as the ISO requested Commissioner Reaction Comms Hoecker Massey and Breathitt all endorsed the order as an imperfect solution yet a pragmatic approach toward resolving the flaws plaguing the ISOs market Comm Hebert faulted the Commission for squandering an opportunity to incentivize additional supply by lifting the price controls Hoecker and Breathitt joined Hebert in expressing disappointment in the lack of the ISOs progress but contended that significant outstanding issues must be resolved before the bid cap can be lifted In other action FERC accepted NYISOs and NEPOOLs proposed Emergency Energy Transaction

results of its eagerly awaited probe into Californias summer power crisis concluding that under certain circumstances California ratepayers were subjected to unjust and unreasonable power rates due to Californias seriously flawed market structure and rules in conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions throughout the West The FERC staff report on western markets and the causes of the Summer Price Abormalities entitled Part I of Staff Report on US Bulk Power Markets is available at the following website electricbulkpowerhtm In response FERC issued an order proposing a series of sweeping structural changes to the California ISO and PX to help remedy the pricing problems and solicited public comment by November A technical conference has also been scheduled for November to discuss the proposed solutions and other remedies that might be suggested details TBA While all four commissioners supported the order the order stretched the Commission Chairman Hoecker and Comm Breathitt expressed strong endorsements while Comms Hebert and Massey concurred citing areas where they felt the Commission had either overreached or not gone far enough as discussed below A final order is expected to be issued by years end At the same time the Commission warned California consumers of their continued risk of paying higher prices unless policy makers there resolve state issues such as immediately implementing the availability of day ahead markets for power purchases development of demand responses siting of generation and transmission and assurance of sufficient reserve requirements Highlights of Proposed California Structural Remedy In its order FERC proposed a series of market overhauls including Eliminating the states mandatory requirement that the states investorowned utilities buy and sell electricity through the PX and allowing these utilities to purchase electricity through forward contracts and other alternative mechanisms to manage supply risks Requiring market participants to schedule percent of their transactions in the dayahead market and instituting a penalty charge for underscheduling in excess of five percent of hourly load requirements in order to discourage overreliance on the realtime spot market Establishing independent nonstakeholder governing boards for the ISO and PX Modifying the current single price auction system by a imposing a temporary MWh soft cap that prohibits supply bids in excess of from setting the marketclearing price for all bidders b requiring sellers bidding above MWh to report their bids to FERC on a confidential weekly basis and provide certain cost support and c requiring the ISO and PX to report monthly information on such bids The Commissions price mitigation measures would remain in effect through December Declining to order retroactive refunds for the states ratepayers and utilities citing insufficient authority to do so but subjecting sellers to potential refund liability for transactions from October until December but no lower than their marginal or opportunity costs if FERC finds noncompetitive behavior Encouraging accelerated state siting approval and introduction of demand response management programs Separately the draft order rejected the ISOs request for an extension of its current purchase price cap authority and the PXs request for price capping authority Commissioner Responses Comm Herbert reluctantly concurred noting that his decision may change when a final order is considered based on comments filed or testimony offered at the November meeting He stressed that he would have preferred that the order address four areas eliminate all price controls in California markets abolish the single price auction entirely terminate the buy and sell mandate in the PX and direct the ISO to address a long list of cited problems in its January RTO filing rather than having the Commission prescribe specific remedies Hebert stated that while he was opposed in principle to the soft cap concept if one had to be adopted then the soft cap should increase incrementally increase over time at specific preannounced dates He believes that this would serve to both encourage greater investment in facilities and additional forward contracting as well as provide an incentive for California regulators to address market design and other flaws Also he would not have disbanded the stakeholder governing boards at this time but allow the ISO and PX to address this issue in their January RTO filings In addition he would not dictate risk management methods preferring instead that market participants determine appropriate actions on their own Finally he advised Californians not to be so environmentally focused that they do not realize their tremendous need for generation capacity Comm Breathitt stated her approval of the Order while warning that FERC cannot allow the events of this past summer to reverse or slow the progress towards open and competitive markets She noted that it was the Commissions job to guide the market to selfcorrect and not to conduct command and control She also commended the managers of the ISO and PX saying that they have performed admirably However she noted she is awaiting comments on the single price auction remedy and its accompanying confidential reporting requirements Comm Massey concurred but emphasized that he advocates a more aggressive approach He feels that the Congress has put its thumb on the scale in the Federal Power Act to protect consumers Stating that prices will continue to be unreasonable in the future he believes that this Order moves in the right direction by proposing solutions to identified problems such as an over reliance on the spot market lack of demand response the need to reconstitute governance of the ISO and PX and the elimination of the buysell mandate Comm Massey specifically called for comments regarding whether the MWh soft cap went far enough whether FERC has the legal authority to issue refunds and to determine whether there should be a requirement for a certain percentage of forward contracting to hedge against the spot market price volatility Finally Chairman Hoecker stated his strong support of the Order but noted that this is no time to pull punches He emphasized that the Commission needed frank comments from the industry He echoed Comm Breathitts warning that competition is at risk and that they needed to get the markets back on track Noting that the Commission lacked authority to order refunds he stated that the responsibility rests with Congress Addressing jurisdictional issues he stated that siting problems encountered at the state level are slowing the meandering transition to competition He feels that the state of California and FERC need to work together to resolve these problems and that FERC is not attempting to usurp power Rather California is part of a broader interstate market and is dependent on the western region for reliable energy thus placing the burden on federal action to make things work Hoecker maintained The Chairman also said that the Commission will fully investigate and act upon complaints of market power abuse or further evidence provided by staffs ongoing investigation If you have any questions or comments please call Jack Cashin at

WASHINGTON FEDERAL AFFAIRS FERC DeFederalizes California Markets Adopts Other Structural Reforms At a special meeting Friday afternoon FERC unanimously approved its eagerl y awaited final order reforming the California wholesale markets adopting th e major outlines of its November proposed order and sending back to California the responsibility for addressing staterelated matters At the same time FERC deferred consideration of retroactive refund issues as well as the imposition of regionwide price caps FERC reiterated their earlier conclusions that under certain circumstances California ratepayers were subjected to unjust and unreasonable power rates due to Californias seriously flawed market structure and rules in conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions throughout the West FERC adopted the November proposal to eliminate effective immediately the states mandatory requirement that the states investorowned utilities buy and sell electricity through the PX and allow these utilities to purchase electricity through forward contracts and other alternative mechanisms to manage supply risks FERC terminated the PXs rate schedules effective at the close of business on April In effect as Chairman James Hoecker stated the order defederalizes percent of the California wholesale market established under the states restructuring law returning ratemaking authority over companyowned generation to the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC The agency also modified the effective period of the MWh soft cap proposal limiting its application through April whereupon a comprehensive and systematic monitoring and mitigation program which incorporates appropriate thresholds screen and mitigation measures must b e in place In a related move FERC ordered a technical conference early nex t year to develop such a program by March so that these measures can be place by the May deadline Energy Secretary Issues Order to Power Generators and Marketers To Bolst er Californias Supplies Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has responded to the severely constrained power supply situation in California by issuing an order pursuant to Secti on c of the Federal Power Act to require generators and marketers to mak e power available to meet the states electricity needs The emergency directive requires that if the California independent system operator ISO certifies that there is an inadequate supply of electricity certain suppliers would be required to make power available to the ISO if they have power available in excess of the amount needed to satisfy service to firm customers Those suppliers that have provided power to the California power exchange PX and the ISO over the last days that have firm capacity available would be subject to the order Under the order the ISO is required to provide notice to each supplier subject to the order of the amount and type of service requested by pm EST on the day before the requested service The ISO must to the extent feasible allocate the requests in proportion to the amount of each suppliers available power The price for the power provided pursuant to t he order will be set by an agreement between the ISO and the supplier If no agreement is reached FERC is to determine the just and reasonable rate at a later date The order will remain in effect until am EST on December unless modified EPA Sets Plans to Regulate Plants Mercury Emissions EPA Administrator Carol Browner in a longawaited announcement indicated last week that the Administration will require reductions of mercury emissions from coal and oilfired power plants The agency stated that it plans to propose new regulations in December and hopes to finalize ne w rules by December In the wake of the decision EEI called on EPA to make certain that any program to control utilities mercury emissions be based on the best scientific information available in order to assure the protection of publi c health EEI urges EPA to maintain its commitment to resolving the key scientific and technological issues said Paul Bailey EEI Vice President Environmental Affairs Given these uncertainties EEI is disappointed that the regulatory determination includes statements regarding public health threats and hazards that are unsupported by current science said Mr Bail ey In the meantime the electric power industry will continue to work with al l stakeholders to determine the extent to which additional mercury reductions from power plants may be needed and how those cuts should be achieved Mr Bailey concluded MERGERS ACQUISITIONS Calpine Completes Acquisition of EMI Power Assets Calpine Corporation has announced that it has completed the acquisition of power assets from Energy Management Inc EMI In the deal Calpine acquired

Alliance Express The following is a summary of the most recent FERC meeting followed by a listing of the most recent FERC filings In a brief meeting yesterday FERC approved a Final Rule adopting Section merger filing requirements generally as proposed and extended the existing NYISO bid cap in its nonspinning reserves market and the related mandatory bidding requirement until such time that the New York market can be determined to be workably competitive At the same time FERC ordered a technical conference to explore changes to the NYISO reserves market and urged market participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution next steps and deadlines for resolutionimplementation Additional details are provided below FERC Updates Streamlines Merger Filing Process FERC unanimously approved its proposed Order revising the reporting requirements for mergers However Comm Hebert did so with reservations as discussed below Commission staff stated that the Order closely follows the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking previously issued but adds more detail and more certainty to the industry Staff stated that the Order is improved over the proposed rule because it includes exemptions from reporting for certain entities and it more precisely defines geographical areas and products According to FERC the draft Order revises the Commissions filing requirements to reflect existing merger policy based on FERCs Merger Policy Guidelines provides more detail for the industry in developing competitive market analyses The rule continues the existing screening process for mergers with potential horizontal competitive concerns In addition the rule establishes informational requirements for vertical competitive analyses streamlines filing requirements for transactions that do not raise competitive concerns and reduces the industrys regulatory burden by eliminating outdated filing requirements The Rule will take effect days after its publication in the Federal Register Commissioner Reaction Comm Hebert expressed reservations that although he was voting for the Rule FERC should not be duplicating the Department of Justice DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission FTC market concentration analyses and that FERC should follow the lead of antitrust enforcement officials who could also analyze mergers faster and more confidentially He also stated that FERC should review the filings after the DOJ or the FTC review them not before and that there should be a definite time frame for review Hebert did mention that he was pleased that RTOs and the disposition of transmission assets would be exempt that ancillary services would be considered as a separate product and that the Final Rule opens the door for alternative market analysis Comm Breathitt supported the Final Rule stating that it should expedite the approval process and that the regulatory burden should be eased due to the fact that older irrelevant requirements have been dropped She indicated that the Final Rule balanced the need for speedy decisions while protecting the public interest by stating that the process will be efficient yet sufficient The Commissioner said that she was pleased the Final Rule addressed technical issues such as computer modeling as well as retail competition and one of her main concerns confidentiality Comm Massey fully supported the Final Rule emphasizing that it would improve response time lessen the need to ask for more data and allow the industry to better predict Commission actions Like Commissioner Breathitt Massey was pleased that the Order will allow market modeling analysis that will better enable FERC to evaluate market concentration and allow applicants to point to other factors when concentration appears too high Massey also stated that the new Rule includes the ability to address many of FERCs concerns such as future mergers when they occur in succession retail competition mitigation by the enlargement of markets through RTOs and analysis of ancillary services In sum he averred that the Order will provide FERC with the tools it needs for accurate analysis while taking into consideration the rapid changes in the industry Chairman Hoecker also voiced his support and noted that he felt that this was a very important Rule In response to Comm Hebert Chairman Hoecker said that the DOJ and FTC actually wait for FERCs report before issuing their own that the antitrust enforcement agencies rely on FERCs expertise when reviewing mergers in the electric and gas industries There is a major positive connection between industry consolidation and RTOs and that both are reconfiguring the markets and effect how they work he noted Because the RTOs enlarge the size of the subject market he indicated RTOs will help to preserve competition Therefore more and larger RTOs should allow for more mergers he said The Chairman cautioned that this is not to imply that joining an RTO is a requirement for a merger but that it would certainly be viewed favorably NYISO Bid Caps Extended Until Ancillary Service Market Shown to be Workably Competitive In a decision with Comm Hebert dissenting FERC extended the existing NYISO bid cap in its nonspinning reserves market and the related mandatory bidding requirement until such time as that market can be determined to be workably competitive At the same time FERC ordered a technical conference to explore changes to the NYISO reserves market and urged market participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution next steps and deadlines for resolutionimplementation In so doing FERC rejected certain aspects of NYISOs September and compliance filing submitted pursuant to its May order imposing a temporary bid cap through October The ISOs efforts to correct market flaws identified in the order and further strengthen market performance had not yet satisfied the Commissions directives FERC concluded FERC found that while NYISO has achieved solid progress in certain areas overall the ISO has not shown sufficient improvement to warrant raising and then gradually lifting the temporary bid cap in the ISOs nonspinning reserve market by April as the ISO requested Commissioner Reaction Comms Hoecker Massey and Breathitt all endorsed the order as an imperfect solution yet a pragmatic approach toward resolving the flaws plaguing the ISOs market Comm Hebert faulted the Commission for squandering an opportunity to incentivize additional supply by lifting the price controls Hoecker and Breathitt joined Hebert in expressing disappointment in the lack of the ISOs progress but contended that significant outstanding issues must be resolved before the bid cap can be lifted In other action FERC accepted NYISOs and NEPOOLs proposed Emergency Energy Transaction

results of its eagerly awaited probe into Californias summer power crisis concluding that under certain circumstances California ratepayers were subjected to unjust and unreasonable power rates due to Californias seriously flawed market structure and rules in conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions throughout the West The FERC staff report on western markets and the causes of the Summer Price Abormalities entitled Part I of Staff Report on US Bulk Power Markets is available at the following website electricbulkpowerhtm In response FERC issued an order proposing a series of sweeping structural changes to the California ISO and PX to help remedy the pricing problems and solicited public comment by November A technical conference has also been scheduled for November to discuss the proposed solutions and other remedies that might be suggested details TBA While all four commissioners supported the order the order stretched the Commission Chairman Hoecker and Comm Breathitt expressed strong endorsements while Comms Hebert and Massey concurred citing areas where they felt the Commission had either overreached or not gone far enough as discussed below A final order is expected to be issued by years end At the same time the Commission warned California consumers of their continued risk of paying higher prices unless policy makers there resolve state issues such as immediately implementing the availability of day ahead markets for power purchases development of demand responses siting of generation and transmission and assurance of sufficient reserve requirements Highlights of Proposed California Structural Remedy In its order FERC proposed a series of market overhauls including Eliminating the states mandatory requirement that the states investorowned utilities buy and sell electricity through the PX and allowing these utilities to purchase electricity through forward contracts and other alternative mechanisms to manage supply risks Requiring market participants to schedule percent of their transactions in the dayahead market and instituting a penalty charge for underscheduling in excess of five percent of hourly load requirements in order to discourage overreliance on the realtime spot market Establishing independent nonstakeholder governing boards for the ISO and PX Modifying the current single price auction system by a imposing a temporary MWh soft cap that prohibits supply bids in excess of from setting the marketclearing price for all bidders b requiring sellers bidding above MWh to report their bids to FERC on a confidential weekly basis and provide certain cost support and c requiring the ISO and PX to report monthly information on such bids The Commissions price mitigation measures would remain in effect through December Declining to order retroactive refunds for the states ratepayers and utilities citing insufficient authority to do so but subjecting sellers to potential refund liability for transactions from October until December but no lower than their marginal or opportunity costs if FERC finds noncompetitive behavior Encouraging accelerated state siting approval and introduction of demand response management programs Separately the draft order rejected the ISOs request for an extension of its current purchase price cap authority and the PXs request for price capping authority Commissioner Responses Comm Herbert reluctantly concurred noting that his decision may change when a final order is considered based on comments filed or testimony offered at the November meeting He stressed that he would have preferred that the order address four areas eliminate all price controls in California markets abolish the single price auction entirely terminate the buy and sell mandate in the PX and direct the ISO to address a long list of cited problems in its January RTO filing rather than having the Commission prescribe specific remedies Hebert stated that while he was opposed in principle to the soft cap concept if one had to be adopted then the soft cap should increase incrementally increase over time at specific preannounced dates He believes that this would serve to both encourage greater investment in facilities and additional forward contracting as well as provide an incentive for California regulators to address market design and other flaws Also he would not have disbanded the stakeholder governing boards at this time but allow the ISO and PX to address this issue in their January RTO filings In addition he would not dictate risk management methods preferring instead that market participants determine appropriate actions on their own Finally he advised Californians not to be so environmentally focused that they do not realize their tremendous need for generation capacity Comm Breathitt stated her approval of the Order while warning that FERC cannot allow the events of this past summer to reverse or slow the progress towards open and competitive markets She noted that it was the Commissions job to guide the market to selfcorrect and not to conduct command and control She also commended the managers of the ISO and PX saying that they have performed admirably However she noted she is awaiting comments on the single price auction remedy and its accompanying confidential reporting requirements Comm Massey concurred but emphasized that he advocates a more aggressive approach He feels that the Congress has put its thumb on the scale in the Federal Power Act to protect consumers Stating that prices will continue to be unreasonable in the future he believes that this Order moves in the right direction by proposing solutions to identified problems such as an over reliance on the spot market lack of demand response the need to reconstitute governance of the ISO and PX and the elimination of the buysell mandate Comm Massey specifically called for comments regarding whether the MWh soft cap went far enough whether FERC has the legal authority to issue refunds and to determine whether there should be a requirement for a certain percentage of forward contracting to hedge against the spot market price volatility Finally Chairman Hoecker stated his strong support of the Order but noted that this is no time to pull punches He emphasized that the Commission needed frank comments from the industry He echoed Comm Breathitts warning that competition is at risk and that they needed to get the markets back on track Noting that the Commission lacked authority to order refunds he stated that the responsibility rests with Congress Addressing jurisdictional issues he stated that siting problems encountered at the state level are slowing the meandering transition to competition He feels that the state of California and FERC need to work together to resolve these problems and that FERC is not attempting to usurp power Rather California is part of a broader interstate market and is dependent on the western region for reliable energy thus placing the burden on federal action to make things work Hoecker maintained The Chairman also said that the Commission will fully investigate and act upon complaints of market power abuse or further evidence provided by staffs ongoing investigation If you have any questions or comments please call Jack Cashin at

are summaries of two significant activities that occurred Friday December Energy Secretary Richardson issuance of an emergency order Richardsons statement and FPA Section c order is posted on DOEs Web site at HQPressreleasesdecprprhtml FERCs final order to fix California wholesale markets FERCs Order can be viewed at issuesnewscalorderpdf California Supplies Ordered by Richardson o Richardson orders listed entities to supply excess power to California ISO o Order is effective as soon as ISO certifies shortage but ends unless extended o Prices to be agreed to by supplier and ISO or FERC will set rate later o FPA emergency power authority transferred to DOE in As he said he would on December US Department of Energy Secretary Bill Richardson found an emergency exists in California by reason of the shortage of electric energy and issued an emergency order under section c of the Federal Power Act FPA requiring listed generators and marketers to provide any power in excess of the needs of their firm customers to the California ISO In a statement Richardson said the threat to the reliability of the California grid requires a longterm solution but that in the shortterm power must keep flowing to the state to avert blackouts The listed suppliers have hours after the ISO certifies to DOE that it has been unable to acquire adequate supplies in the market to begin providing requested service to the ISO The ISO must inform each supplier subject to the order of the amount and type of energy or services required by PM Eastern Standard Time the day before the services are needed The order directs the ISO to allocate to the extent feasible requested services among subject entities in proportion to each suppliers available excess power The order is effective immediately and will terminate at AM Eastern Time December unless extended To continue to obtain supplies under this emergency authority the ISO must recertify the shortage to DOE headquarters every hours The terms of the provision of electric energy and other services by suppliers to the ISO are to be agreed to by the parties If no agreement is reached then under the FPAs emergency authority Secretary Richardson will immediately prescribe the conditions of service and refer the rate issue to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for a determination at a later date by that agency in accordance with its standards and procedures and will prescribe by supplemental order such rates as it finds to be just and reasonable The authority of FERC to set rates for power supplied under emergency order at just and reasonable levels where the parties themselves do not agree to a rate is explicitly included in FPA Section c The DOE Organization Act of transferred the emergency powers of this section from FERC to DOE The entities identified in the orders attachment are all the entities that have provided power to the ISO over the last days Those entities are ordered to make arrangements to generate deliver interchange and transmit electric energy when as and in such amounts as may be requested by the ISO acting as agent for and on behalf of Scheduling Coordinators Source DOE Secretary Richardsons December statement and order Electric Power Daily December FERC DeFederalizes California Markets Adopts Other Structural Reforms A summary of the December Order and Commission Discussion At its special meeting today FERC unanimously approved its eagerly awaited final order reforming the California wholesale markets adopting the major outlines of its November proposed order and sending back to California the responsibility for addressing staterelated matters as discussed below At the same time FERC deferred consideration of retroactive refund issues as well as the imposition of regionwide price caps FERC reiterated the November conclusions that under certain circumstances California ratepayers were subjected to unjust and unreasonable power rates due to Californias seriously flawed market structure and rules in conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions throughout the West While all four commissioners supported the order as a consensusbased outcome that appropriately balanced all competing interests each commissioner expressed reservations with particular aspects of the order Chairman Hoecker and Comm Breathitt expressed the strongest endorsement while Comms Hebert and Massey laid out their positions where they believed the Commission had either overreached or not gone far enough just as they did on November as discussed below Highlights of key actions FERC adopted the November proposal to eliminate effective immediately the states mandatory requirement that the states investorowned utilities buy and sell electricity through the PX and allow these utilities to purchase electricity through forward contracts and other alternative mechanisms to manage supply risks FERC terminated the PXs rate schedules effective at the close of business on April In effect as Chairman Hoecker stated the order defederalizes percent of the California wholesale market established under the states restructuring law returning ratemaking authority over companyowned generation to the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC FERC modified the effective period of the November MWh soft cap proposal limiting its application through April whereupon a comprehensive and systematic monitoring and mitigation program which incorporates appropriate thresholds screen and mitigation measures must be in place In a related move FERC ordered a technical conference early next year to develop such a program by March so that these measures can be place by the May deadline In a major modification FERC revised the refund conditions to clarify that while certain refund conditions will continue to apply unless FERC issues written notification to the seller that its transaction is still under review refund potential on a transaction will close after days As proposed however supply bids in excess of will be prohibited from setting the marketclearing price for all bidders and sellers bidding above MWh will be required to report their bids to FERC on a confidential weekly basis and provide certain cost support FERC adopted the November proposal to require the establishment of independent nonstakeholder governing board for the ISO The ISO Governing Board must relinquish their decisionmaking power and operating control to the ISO management on January A future order will set procedures for discussion with state representatives on the board selection process In a major modification FERC adopted a MWh price benchmark for assessing prices of fiveyear energy supply contracts This benchmark will be used in assessing any complaints regarding justness and reasonableness of pricing longterm contracts To facilitate prompt negotiation of longer term power contracts at reasonable rates FERC announced that it will hold a settlement conference with market participants FERC adopted the November proposal to require market participants to schedule percent of their transactions in the dayahead market and instituting a penalty charge for underscheduling in excess of five percent of hourly load requirements in order to discourage overreliance on the realtime spot market FERC directed the ISO and the three investorowned utilities to file generation interconnection standards FERC affirmed the longerterm measures proposed in the November order including submission of a congestion management design proposal by April FERC deferred resolving key issues including establishing new ISO board selection procedures developing appropriate market monitoring measures and negotiating protective orders associated with data collection FERC reiterated its November call to California policy makers there to resolve state issues such as immediately implementing the availability of day ahead markets for power purchases development of demand responses siting of generation and transmission and assurance of sufficient reserve requirements Commissioner Responses Comm Hebert reluctantly concurred calling the final order a missed opportunity to among other things send appropriate signals for new generation siting and conservation Reiterating his November concerns Hebert recounted the remedial remedies that he maintained the Commission should and should not have adopted While expressing pleasure at the tone of the order balanced and considerate the bid certainly reversal and the role reserved for the state in the selection of the new ISO board Hebert nonetheless objected to the benchmark prices established in the order which he maintained appeared to be unreasonably low Hebert faulted the Commission for not attempting to reconcile the instant order with the November order approving the CA ISOs emergency MWh soft cap proposal Hebert ended by challenging the CPUC to do what it can to encourage utilities there to forward contract including easing the existing prudence review requirements Comm Breathitt endorsed the Order reiterating her support for progress towards open and competitive markets She noted that the Order properly walked the line by taking all of the competing interests into account calling it less than ideal but a step in the right direction She also concentrated her remarks on the importance of creating stability which will be accomplished by encouraging long term contracts and the implementation of the MWh breakpoint Additionally she mentioned that any price below the MWh benchmark will be presumed just and reasonable Comm Massey concurred but prefaced his remarks by expressing sympathy for California ratepayers stating that he felt that market power had been exercised that prices were not just and reasonable and that the marketers had profited too much at the expense of others in the market He warned that as he understood the legal precedents the Federal Courts were poised to grant cost recovery relief to the retailers which would then be passed on to consumers On the positive side he approved of the defederalization of of the market and the creation of long term contracts However he emphasized that California regulators must now take the responsibility of creating more generation and transmission In the long term Comm Massey hoped that solutions could be reached starting with a technical conference and that the market would have rules more like PJM Finally Comm Massey articulated what he would have liked to have done differently He stated that he disagreed with the fact that there is not enough evidence to show that market power existed and he pointed to the ongoing investigation He also disagreed with the MWh breakpoint preferring instead a hard price per generator The Commissioner said he would have set the long term benchmark for only two years instead of five and that he would have opened a section investigation in the West Finally he stated that he would have liked to address the issue of refunds Chairman Hoecker began his comments by saying that the Commission was forced to act and act quickly because the stakes are so high He feels that it is now time for the state regulators and markets to act He noted that by shrinking the Cal PX the responsibility is now with the CPUC to fashion the long term contracts and that hopefully we will exit this situation with the least amount of damage to the utilities In regards to suggestions for a regional price cap the Chairman stated that this would not work due to the fact that the Commission has no jurisdiction over Bonneville WAPA and the public power producers and that there is no spot market in the Northwest However he did urge Secretary Richardson to convene a conference in order to address regional issues Finally in conceptually addressing the California situation the Chairman stated that competition or deregulation did not fail in California but that there never was competition in California

Californias Supplies Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has responded to the severely constrained power supply situation in California by issuing an order pursuant to Secti on c of the Federal Power Act to require generators and marketers to mak e power available to meet the states electricity needs The emergency directive requires that if the California independent system operator ISO certifies that there is an inadequate supply of electricity certain suppliers would be required to make power available to the ISO if they have power available in excess of the amount needed to satisfy service to firm customers Those suppliers that have provided power to the California power exchange PX and the ISO over the last days that have firm capacity available would be subject to the order Under the order the ISO is required to provide notice to each supplier subject to the order of the amount and type of service requested by pm EST on the day before the requested service The ISO must to the extent feasible allocate the requests in proportion to the amount of each suppliers available power The price for the power provided pursuant to t he order will be set by an agreement between the ISO and the supplier If no agreement is reached FERC is to determine the just and reasonable rate at a later date The order will remain in effect until am EST on December unless modified EPA Sets Plans to Regulate Plants Mercury Emissions EPA Administrator Carol Browner in a longawaited announcement indicated last week that the Administration will require reductions of mercury emissions from coal and oilfired power plants The agency stated that it plans to propose new regulations in December and hopes to finalize ne w rules by December In the wake of the decision EEI called on EPA to make certain that any program to control utilities mercury emissions be based on the best scientific information available in order to assure the protection of publi c health EEI urges EPA to maintain its commitment to resolving the key scientific and technological issues said Paul Bailey EEI Vice President Environmental Affairs Given these uncertainties EEI is disappointed that the regulatory determination includes statements regarding public health threats and hazards that are unsupported by current science said Mr Bail ey In the meantime the electric power industry will continue to work with al l stakeholders to determine the extent to which additional mercury reductions from power plants may be needed and how those cuts should be achieved Mr Bailey concluded MERGERS ACQUISITIONS

are summaries of two significant activities that occurred Friday December Energy Secretary Richardson issuance of an emergency order Richardsons statement and FPA Section c order is posted on DOEs Web site at HQPressreleasesdecprprhtml FERCs final order to fix California wholesale markets FERCs Order can be viewed at issuesnewscalorderpdf California Supplies Ordered by Richardson o Richardson orders listed entities to supply excess power to California ISO o Order is effective as soon as ISO certifies shortage but ends unless extended o Prices to be agreed to by supplier and ISO or FERC will set rate later o FPA emergency power authority transferred to DOE in As he said he would on December US Department of Energy Secretary Bill Richardson found an emergency exists in California by reason of the shortage of electric energy and issued an emergency order under section c of the Federal Power Act FPA requiring listed generators and marketers to provide any power in excess of the needs of their firm customers to the California ISO In a statement Richardson said the threat to the reliability of the California grid requires a longterm solution but that in the shortterm power must keep flowing to the state to avert blackouts The listed suppliers have hours after the ISO certifies to DOE that it has been unable to acquire adequate supplies in the market to begin providing requested service to the ISO The ISO must inform each supplier subject to the order of the amount and type of energy or services required by PM Eastern Standard Time the day before the services are needed The order directs the ISO to allocate to the extent feasible requested services among subject entities in proportion to each suppliers available excess power The order is effective immediately and will terminate at AM Eastern Time December unless extended To continue to obtain supplies under this emergency authority the ISO must recertify the shortage to DOE headquarters every hours The terms of the provision of electric energy and other services by suppliers to the ISO are to be agreed to by the parties If no agreement is reached then under the FPAs emergency authority Secretary Richardson will immediately prescribe the conditions of service and refer the rate issue to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for a determination at a later date by that agency in accordance with its standards and procedures and will prescribe by supplemental order such rates as it finds to be just and reasonable The authority of FERC to set rates for power supplied under emergency order at just and reasonable levels where the parties themselves do not agree to a rate is explicitly included in FPA Section c The DOE Organization Act of transferred the emergency powers of this section from FERC to DOE The entities identified in the orders attachment are all the entities that have provided power to the ISO over the last days Those entities are ordered to make arrangements to generate deliver interchange and transmit electric energy when as and in such amounts as may be requested by the ISO acting as agent for and on behalf of Scheduling Coordinators Source DOE Secretary Richardsons December statement and order Electric Power Daily December FERC DeFederalizes California Markets Adopts Other Structural Reforms A summary of the December Order and Commission Discussion At its special meeting today FERC unanimously approved its eagerly awaited final order reforming the California wholesale markets adopting the major outlines of its November proposed order and sending back to California the responsibility for addressing staterelated matters as discussed below At the same time FERC deferred consideration of retroactive refund issues as well as the imposition of regionwide price caps FERC reiterated the November conclusions that under certain circumstances California ratepayers were subjected to unjust and unreasonable power rates due to Californias seriously flawed market structure and rules in conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions throughout the West While all four commissioners supported the order as a consensusbased outcome that appropriately balanced all competing interests each commissioner expressed reservations with particular aspects of the order Chairman Hoecker and Comm Breathitt expressed the strongest endorsement while Comms Hebert and Massey laid out their positions where they believed the Commission had either overreached or not gone far enough just as they did on November as discussed below Highlights of key actions FERC adopted the November proposal to eliminate effective immediately the states mandatory requirement that the states investorowned utilities buy and sell electricity through the PX and allow these utilities to purchase electricity through forward contracts and other alternative mechanisms to manage supply risks FERC terminated the PXs rate schedules effective at the close of business on April In effect as Chairman Hoecker stated the order defederalizes percent of the California wholesale market established under the states restructuring law returning ratemaking authority over companyowned generation to the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC FERC modified the effective period of the November MWh soft cap proposal limiting its application through April whereupon a comprehensive and systematic monitoring and mitigation program which incorporates appropriate thresholds screen and mitigation measures must be in place In a related move FERC ordered a technical conference early next year to develop such a program by March so that these measures can be place by the May deadline In a major modification FERC revised the refund conditions to clarify that while certain refund conditions will continue to apply unless FERC issues written notification to the seller that its transaction is still under review refund potential on a transaction will close after days As proposed however supply bids in excess of will be prohibited from setting the marketclearing price for all bidders and sellers bidding above MWh will be required to report their bids to FERC on a confidential weekly basis and provide certain cost support FERC adopted the November proposal to require the establishment of independent nonstakeholder governing board for the ISO The ISO Governing Board must relinquish their decisionmaking power and operating control to the ISO management on January A future order will set procedures for discussion with state representatives on the board selection process In a major modification FERC adopted a MWh price benchmark for assessing prices of fiveyear energy supply contracts This benchmark will be used in assessing any complaints regarding justness and reasonableness of pricing longterm contracts To facilitate prompt negotiation of longer term power contracts at reasonable rates FERC announced that it will hold a settlement conference with market participants FERC adopted the November proposal to require market participants to schedule percent of their transactions in the dayahead market and instituting a penalty charge for underscheduling in excess of five percent of hourly load requirements in order to discourage overreliance on the realtime spot market FERC directed the ISO and the three investorowned utilities to file generation interconnection standards FERC affirmed the longerterm measures proposed in the November order including submission of a congestion management design proposal by April FERC deferred resolving key issues including establishing new ISO board selection procedures developing appropriate market monitoring measures and negotiating protective orders associated with data collection FERC reiterated its November call to California policy makers there to resolve state issues such as immediately implementing the availability of day ahead markets for power purchases development of demand responses siting of generation and transmission and assurance of sufficient reserve requirements Commissioner Responses Comm Hebert reluctantly concurred calling the final order a missed opportunity to among other things send appropriate signals for new generation siting and conservation Reiterating his November concerns Hebert recounted the remedial remedies that he maintained the Commission should and should not have adopted While expressing pleasure at the tone of the order balanced and considerate the bid certainly reversal and the role reserved for the state in the selection of the new ISO board Hebert nonetheless objected to the benchmark prices established in the order which he maintained appeared to be unreasonably low Hebert faulted the Commission for not attempting to reconcile the instant order with the November order approving the CA ISOs emergency MWh soft cap proposal Hebert ended by challenging the CPUC to do what it can to encourage utilities there to forward contract including easing the existing prudence review requirements Comm Breathitt endorsed the Order reiterating her support for progress towards open and competitive markets She noted that the Order properly walked the line by taking all of the competing interests into account calling it less than ideal but a step in the right direction She also concentrated her remarks on the importance of creating stability which will be accomplished by encouraging long term contracts and the implementation of the MWh breakpoint Additionally she mentioned that any price below the MWh benchmark will be presumed just and reasonable Comm Massey concurred but prefaced his remarks by expressing sympathy for California ratepayers stating that he felt that market power had been exercised that prices were not just and reasonable and that the marketers had profited too much at the expense of others in the market He warned that as he understood the legal precedents the Federal Courts were poised to grant cost recovery relief to the retailers which would then be passed on to consumers On the positive side he approved of the defederalization of of the market and the creation of long term contracts However he emphasized that California regulators must now take the responsibility of creating more generation and transmission In the long term Comm Massey hoped that solutions could be reached starting with a technical conference and that the market would have rules more like PJM Finally Comm Massey articulated what he would have liked to have done differently He stated that he disagreed with the fact that there is not enough evidence to show that market power existed and he pointed to the ongoing investigation He also disagreed with the MWh breakpoint preferring instead a hard price per generator The Commissioner said he would have set the long term benchmark for only two years instead of five and that he would have opened a section investigation in the West Finally he stated that he would have liked to address the issue of refunds Chairman Hoecker began his comments by saying that the Commission was forced to act and act quickly because the stakes are so high He feels that it is now time for the state regulators and markets to act He noted that by shrinking the Cal PX the responsibility is now with the CPUC to fashion the long term contracts and that hopefully we will exit this situation with the least amount of damage to the utilities In regards to suggestions for a regional price cap the Chairman stated that this would not work due to the fact that the Commission has no jurisdiction over Bonneville WAPA and the public power producers and that there is no spot market in the Northwest However he did urge Secretary Richardson to convene a conference in order to address regional issues Finally in conceptually addressing the California situation the Chairman stated that competition or deregulation did not fail in California but that there never was competition in California
