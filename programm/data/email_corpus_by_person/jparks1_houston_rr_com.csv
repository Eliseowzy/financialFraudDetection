Shares of Independent Power Producers and Traders Fall By Robert C Bellemare Vice President imagesspacergif News item from Reuters Renewed concerns over accounting irregularities an d heavy debt burdens took their toll on the power sector on Wednesday send ing shares of independent producers and traders falling The downturn was t riggered by disclosures in The Wall Street Journal WSJ of a financing arr angement used by Dynegy Inc NYSE DYN which prompted unwelcome compariso ns to Enron as well as an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC into energy trader and pipeline operator Williams Cos NYSE WMB Analysis Just when the market conditions appeared to be stabilizing for th e recently hardhit independent power producers IPPs more unwanted bad n ews has once again plagued this sector In addition to Dynegy and Williams companies such as Calpine Mirant and AES have had significant news in the past week as the companies make moves to weather the storm of business los ses lowered credit ratings softening energy commodity prices and questio ns of accounting practices Lets take a look at the latest developments fo r these companies Dynegy shares closed at per share down by about percent as the m arket reacted to a WSJ article concerning Dynegys use of offbalancesheet transactions designed to cut tax bills and address a growing gap between c ash flow and net income Project Alpha as it was called was blessed by Dy negys former auditor Andersen and current auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers Dynegy was quick to try and distinguish this transaction from the type of business practices that Enron engaged in Dynegy spokesman John Sousa emph asized The primary drivers of this transaction were that it provided us w ith a longterm source of physical gas supply and a significant tax benefit Sousa also pointed out that no related parties were involved Dynegy sto ck was not used to back the loans and the transaction was disclosed in Dyn egys financial reports last year In the company reported unrealized gains of million generated by valuing derivative contracts increasi ng the gap between its profit and cash flow Trading companies include the estimated value for derivative contracts they use for future buying and s elling of commodities in net income as unrealized gains A special purpos e entity SPE was formed in April of last year with a million loan fr om Citigroup Inc The SPE entered into gas trades with a partnership called DMT Supply LP in which Dynegy held a stake According to Dynegy during t he first nine months of operation DMT bought gas from the entity at below market prices and resold the gas at a profit But during future years of th e project scheduled to end in DMT will buy gas at abovemarket gas pr ices generating unrealized losses By arranging transactions in this manne r Dynegy was able to lower its tax bill by million But according to WSJ higher values were being assigned to derivative contracts than tho se assigned to cash transactions which creates a disconnect between repor ted net income and cash flow that investors could notice Williams shares also dropped by percent on Wednesday to close at per share on news from WSJ which reported that the SEC is looking into th e companys thirdquarter results In reaction Williams clarified that it had received a request in early February from the SEC for additional inform ation concerning the companys thirdquarter results but was told afte r a review that no financial adjustments were needed Williams spokesperso n Jim Gipson said We received an informal confidential request for infor mation by the SEC in early February about our thirdquarter Q They asked a couple of questions we responded in writing they called back in seven days and said no amendment to the thirdquarter results was required Gips on emphasized that We are not aware of any unresolved or open issues at t he SEC Williams reported a thirdquarter net income of million up from million or cents a share earned in the same quarter one y ear ago The quarter included a onetime charge of million for the comp anys investment in former subsidiary Williams Communications Group On Mar ch Williams announced it had taken a billion charge in the fourth q uarter to account for its contingent liability on Williams Communications Williams reported a loss of million for the fourth quarter Calpine shares were down percent yesterday apparently in reaction to n ews that Moodys had downgraded Calpines unsecured debt from Ba to B al ong with a negative ratings outlook Approximately billion of longte rm debt instruments are affected This follows a March report when the company disclosed that it will restate earnings after the company disc overed that emissionreduction credits it had purchased last year were not actually available In a press release Calpine said earnings would be lowered by million after tax from the million reported on Jan The restatement will drop diluted earnings per share after extra ordinary items by cents a share to Moodys sited several reasons for the ratings downgrades including Calpine s high leverage limited financial flexibility and substantial ongoing cap ital expenditure requirements to complete its reduced buildout program Ca lpines debt is expected to grow over the coming year as the company contin ues its development of committed projects While Calpines total electric s ales are expected to increase as it completes additional plants it is expe cted to be selling into unfavorable market conditions Moodys anticipated that lower spark spreads the difference between electric and fuel prices will lower in the near term Moodys warned that the negative outlook refle cts the possibility of additional downgrades should Calpines liquidity pos ition further deteriorate or its cash flow fall below expectations Calpine plans to fund completion of gasfired power projects and project expa nsions during and Moodys also assigned a Ba rating to Calpine s billion of senior secured credit facilities According to Moodys the Ba rating reflects the benefits and limitations of Calpines collateral p ackage A portion of the collateral package consists of Calpines equity in terests in Saltend and nine US power plants A principal part of the coll ateral package is Calpines naturalgas properties which may be subject to fluctuation in value based on changes in reserves and gas prices Moodys claims a portion of these gas reserves is not proven Mirant also continues to experience hard times Its shares were down p ercent to close at per share Although yesterdays downturn may have largely been driven by the overall downturn in the sector Mirant has been involved in several interesting announcements this week as it continues to try to shore up its balance sheet On April it was reported that Mirant has put its Kogan Creek power station and Wilkie Creel coal mine in Queensl and up for sale Queenslands governmentowned CS Energy currently perc ent owner of Kogan Creek is reported to be a potential buyer as are MIM a nd Macarthur Coal In a separate transaction announced on March Cleco a greed to buy Mirants percent interest in a megawatt power plant the companies are building in northeastern Louisiana The merchant power plant is owned by a joint venture between the two companies Cleco said it would assume Mirants million equity commitment and pay million to ret ire Mirants project debt Cleco said it would finance the buyout with a co mbination of new common stock and debt AES has also fallen on tough times Although the companys stock was up yes terday to close at per share the company continues to struggle Earl y this week AES sent a shockwave through the UK market when it announced its decision to put its MW Fifoots Point coalfired power plant locate d in Wales into receivership The recommissioning of Fifoots in late w as funded with a million loan arranged and underwritten by Deutsche Bank Richard Hill joint administrative receiver at KPMG in London who is charged with selling the asset says Fifoots has some GBP million of non recourse bank debt obligations as well as other liabilities that have yet to be fully determined Similar to the US market wholesale prices in the UK reportedly have collapsed by percent after the launch of last spri ngs new bilateral trading system Accordingly one report claims at least a dozen project loans are either in technical default have broken their co venants or are very close to not meeting their coverage ratio In other AESrelated news this week it was announced that GE would be purch asing AESGeners percent stake in the Servicios Integrales de Generacion de Energia Electrica Sigen services company for an undisclosed amount G E already owned percent of the joint venture AESGener controlled by AE S posted losses of Pesos mil in compared to a profit of Pesos mil in Operating results were down by percent to Pesos mil on sales declining percent to Pesos mil The performanc e of AES Argentinean subsidiaries TermoAndes and InterAndes and selling o ff the subsidiaries Central Puerto and Puerto Ventanas imposed losses Rece ntly appointed AESGener Chairman Roberto Morgan commented that the company will continue to divest in nonelectric assets and assets not based in Chil e The fallout of the Enron debacle lowered credit ratings and weak commodit y prices are providing a blow that has many energy companies on the r opes struggling to make the bell The companies are aggressively working to put up a defense by shoring up their balance sheets through asset sales p ostponing or canceling projects and taking necessary writeoffs But as qui ckly as these companies fortunes have nosedived they can
