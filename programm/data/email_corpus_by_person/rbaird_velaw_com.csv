know about but I thought Id share it with you Except for the clearing organization rules which appear to me to be a mess I think this should make life simpler for Sara and Jim in dealing with equity derivatives for Mark Taylor Sara and others in dealing with principaltoprincipal negotiated commodity derivatives and perhaps for EnronOnline Nora this will no doubt pose some interesting questions relative to DealBench And of course if and to the extent that Enron wants to set up or otherwise get involved in multiple participant BB Internet trading sites that involve transactions that will be completed online there will be some issues that need to be addressed This should be viewed as a very preliminary report because I have not had a chance to study the new rules carefully I will send more complete information later Last week the Commodities Futures Trading Commission adopted its new regulatory framework a series of rules that I believe will greatly expand the breadth depth height weight and size of the CFTCs bureaucracy and the scope of the CFTCs regulatory involvement in all sorts of things including financial guarantees that it has not attempted to regulate heretofore The CFTC described this rule making as a regulatory reinvention Indeed the CFTC has reinvented itself without Congressional authorization to do so In particular under the new rules for the first time the CFTCs board of trade regulation is not confined to markets in which speculators participate In effect it has extended its board of trade regulatory reach into a portion of the overthecounter market that involves only business participants Probably the biggest headache for all of us will be the new rules relating to Clearing Organizations defined as a person who provides credit enhancement functions with respect to certain transactions including transactions that rely on the new bilateral contract exemption discussed below In many cases it will be illegal for a company that does not register with and become regulated by the CFTC as a Recognized Clearing Organization RCO to provide credit enhancement functions I obviously need to study the rules further but my initial read is that the rules are a disaster in drafting For example I dont think that the CFTC intended to say that a parent company cannot guarantee a swap entered into by its subsidiary unless the parent company registers as an RCO but on my initial reading it appears to me that the rule is not at all clear and could be read that way So if you are working on any transaction that involves a guarantee of a swap or other transaction that is exempt under the new exemption for bilateral contracts you need to run this issue to ground before you close The rules dont become effective however until days after they are published in the Federal Register There are some good things about the new rules The new exemption for bilateral contracts greatly liberalizes the swaps exemption and expands it so that it covers contracts other than swaps It provides greater certainty regarding the enforceability of derivatives and in most cases of contracts for physical delivery of commodities The bilateral contracts exemption however is unavailable for contracts entered into through Multiple Transaction Execution Facilities or MTEFs Multiple participant BB Internet trading sites will be classified as MTEFs unless participants are required to go offline to complete the contracts as for example CheMatch requires its participants to do Under the new rules multiple participant BB Internet trading sites that involve swaps and other derivative contracts completed online must submit themselves to CFTC regulation as Derivatives Transaction Facilities or DTFs Moreover an MTEF that trades only in physical delivery contracts can achieve contract enforcement certainty of the type offered by the exemption for bilateral contracts only if it submits itself to regulation as a DTF The MTEF definition excludes any Internet trading site such as EnronOnline that involves a single party offering to enter into trades with multiple parties and therefore the sponsor of such a site can take advantage of the exemption for bilateral contracts without submitting itself to CFTC regulation DTFs must not permit any person other than an eligible commercial participant to trade The term eligible commercial participant is defined in the rule and includes generally commercial counterparties and financial intermediaries Although the CFTC promises that its regulation of DTFs will be more light handed that that historically applied to US futures exchanges the new regulatory framework is likely to result in significant regulatory oversight of multiple participant BB Internet trading sites that register as DTFs Under the new rules each sponsor must determine whether to restrict trading on its site to avoid CFTC regulation or to submit to regulation Robert S Baird Vinson Elkins LLP One American Center

know about but I thought Id share it with you Except for the clearing organization rules which appear to me to be a mess I think this should make life simpler for Sara and Jim in dealing with equity derivatives for Mark Taylor Sara and others in dealing with principaltoprincipal negotiated commodity derivatives and perhaps for EnronOnline Nora this will no doubt pose some interesting questions relative to DealBench And of course if and to the extent that Enron wants to set up or otherwise get involved in multiple participant BB Internet trading sites that involve transactions that will be completed online there will be some issues that need to be addressed This should be viewed as a very preliminary report because I have not had a chance to study the new rules carefully I will send more complete information later Last week the Commodities Futures Trading Commission adopted its new regulatory framework a series of rules that I believe will greatly expand the breadth depth height weight and size of the CFTCs bureaucracy and the scope of the CFTCs regulatory involvement in all sorts of things including financial guarantees that it has not attempted to regulate heretofore The CFTC described this rule making as a regulatory reinvention Indeed the CFTC has reinvented itself without Congressional authorization to do so In particular under the new rules for the first time the CFTCs board of trade regulation is not confined to markets in which speculators participate In effect it has extended its board of trade regulatory reach into a portion of the overthecounter market that involves only business participants Probably the biggest headache for all of us will be the new rules relating to Clearing Organizations defined as a person who provides credit enhancement functions with respect to certain transactions including transactions that rely on the new bilateral contract exemption discussed below In many cases it will be illegal for a company that does not register with and become regulated by the CFTC as a Recognized Clearing Organization RCO to provide credit enhancement functions I obviously need to study the rules further but my initial read is that the rules are a disaster in drafting For example I dont think that the CFTC intended to say that a parent company cannot guarantee a swap entered into by its subsidiary unless the parent company registers as an RCO but on my initial reading it appears to me that the rule is not at all clear and could be read that way So if you are working on any transaction that involves a guarantee of a swap or other transaction that is exempt under the new exemption for bilateral contracts you need to run this issue to ground before you close The rules dont become effective however until days after they are published in the Federal Register There are some good things about the new rules The new exemption for bilateral contracts greatly liberalizes the swaps exemption and expands it so that it covers contracts other than swaps It provides greater certainty regarding the enforceability of derivatives and in most cases of contracts for physical delivery of commodities The bilateral contracts exemption however is unavailable for contracts entered into through Multiple Transaction Execution Facilities or MTEFs Multiple participant BB Internet trading sites will be classified as MTEFs unless participants are required to go offline to complete the contracts as for example CheMatch requires its participants to do Under the new rules multiple participant BB Internet trading sites that involve swaps and other derivative contracts completed online must submit themselves to CFTC regulation as Derivatives Transaction Facilities or DTFs Moreover an MTEF that trades only in physical delivery contracts can achieve contract enforcement certainty of the type offered by the exemption for bilateral contracts only if it submits itself to regulation as a DTF The MTEF definition excludes any Internet trading site such as EnronOnline that involves a single party offering to enter into trades with multiple parties and therefore the sponsor of such a site can take advantage of the exemption for bilateral contracts without submitting itself to CFTC regulation DTFs must not permit any person other than an eligible commercial participant to trade The term eligible commercial participant is defined in the rule and includes generally commercial counterparties and financial intermediaries Although the CFTC promises that its regulation of DTFs will be more light handed that that historically applied to US futures exchanges the new regulatory framework is likely to result in significant regulatory oversight of multiple participant BB Internet trading sites that register as DTFs Under the new rules each sponsor must determine whether to restrict trading on its site to avoid CFTC regulation or to submit to regulation Robert S Baird Vinson Elkins LLP One American Center

To All Attorneys Domestic All Attorneys International Subject New CFTC Rules under the CFTCs New Regulatory Framework Summary of Email This email discusses the impact of the new rules on existing and pending swap transactions or other derivatives the new exemption for bilateral contracts which replaces the swaps exemption and some open questions relating to furnishing of guarantees or other credit support for transactions that rely on the new exemption for bilateral contracts As you know on November the Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC approved final rules that will implement a new regulatory framework The new rules will become effective days after their publication in the Federal Register which has not yet occurred Beth Ann Dranguet and I are monitoring that publication date and will update you with the effective date of the new rules as soon as we know it Existing and Pending Transactions Until the effective date of the new rules no changes are necessary to any swap or other derivative transaction closed before the effective date All nonexempt offexchange futures contracts remain illegal until the new rules take effect The new rules will in no way call into question any transaction undertaken before they become effective Swaps and Other Derivatives Under the New Rules Once the new rules become effective the swaps exemption will be replaced by the new Exemption for Bilateral Transactions attached Bilateral contracts can include any contract that is either individually negotiated or traded on a facility where a single party deals with multiple other parties eg EnronOnline Thus for the first time futures contracts can be traded overthecounter Eligibility Only Eligible Participants can take advantage of the Exemption for Bilateral Contracts The representation commonly made as to Eligible Swap Participant status should be changed to refer to status as an Eligible Participant Under contracts covered by the new rule each party should represent that It constitutes an eligible participant as such term is defined under the regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission currently at CFR b Since virtually every existing ISDA master agreement has the eligible swap participant representation confirmations for new transactions under old ISDAs should include the eligible participant representation Differences between Eligible Participant and Eligible Swap Participant The definition of eligible participant has changed slightly from the eligible swap participant definition Under the new rules Any eligible participant can trade for its own account or through another eligible participant This was previously permitted only by banks and trust companies In addition to banks and trust companies a foreign bank or a branch or agency of a foreign bank as defined in section b of the International Bank Act of USC b is included as an eligible participant The category for insurance companies has changed to an insurance company that is regulated by a State or that is regulated by a foreign government and is subject to comparable regulation including a regulated subsidiary or affiliate of such an insurance company Investment companies must have total assets exceeding million to be eligible Clearing To qualify for the Exemption for Bilateral Transactions a contract must be cleared through an authorized clearing organization if the contract is cleared Unfortunately the CFTC does not define what it means to be cleared It does define the term clearing organization as any person that provides a credit enhancement function in connection with the netting andor settling of payments and payment obligations This definition is so broad and vague that it could be read to say that any person who furnishes ordinary credit enhancement tools such as a corporate parents guarantee of a subsidiarys swap transactions must be an authorized clearing organization in order for the transactions to be eligible for the Exemption for Bilateral Contracts This is something that may need to be clarified by the CFTC because surely the CFTC did not mean to cover ordinary parent or affiliate guarantees Authorized clearinghouses are a recognized clearing organization ie registered as such with the CFTC a securities clearing agency subject to SEC supervision a clearing system organized as a bank or Edge Act corporation subject to jurisdiction under the Federal Reserve or Comptroller of the Currency or a foreign clearing organization subject to similar regulation Perhaps one way to get around the problem is to rely on the Swaps Policy Statement which the CFTC has left untouched and has now adopted as a rule One of the Swaps Policy Statement requirements is the absence of a clearing organization or margin system but in explaining what it means by that it states that The ability to impose individualized credit enhancement requirements to secure either changes in the credit risk of a counterparty or increases in the credit exposure between two counterparties would not be affected Clearly individualized credit enhancements such as a corporate parents guarantees are permitted for transactions relying on the Swaps Policy Statement I must confess that I am not sure we have wrestled this issue to ground but we do have some more time to study the rules before they take effect I will keep you posted and let you know if we run this issue to ground in a way that is more satisfactory MTEFs and DTFs We are still studying the rules for Exempt Multilateral Transaction Execution Facilities MTEFs

trade for its own account or through another eligible participant This was previously permitted only by banks and trust companies In addition to banks and trust companies a foreign bank or a branch or agency of a foreign bank as defined in section b of the International Bank Act of USC b is included as an eligible participant The category for insurance companies has changed to an insurance company that is regulated by a State or that is regulated by a foreign government and is subject to comparable regulation including a regulated subsidiary or affiliate of such an insurance company Investment companies must have total assets exceeding million to be eligible Clearing To qualify for the Exemption for Bilateral Transactions a contract must be cleared through an authorized clearing organization if the contract is cleared Unfortunately the CFTC does not define what it means to be cleared It does define the term clearing organization as any person that provides a credit enhancement function in connection with the netting andor settling of payments and payment obligations This definition is so broad and vague that it could be read to say that any person who furnishes ordinary credit enhancement tools such as a corporate parents guarantee of a subsidiarys swap transactions must be an authorized clearing organization in order for the transactions to be eligible for the Exemption for Bilateral Contracts This is something that may need to be clarified by the CFTC because surely the CFTC did not mean to cover ordinary parent or affiliate guarantees Authorized clearinghouses are a recognized clearing organization ie registered as such with the CFTC a securities clearing agency subject to SEC supervision a clearing system organized as a bank or Edge Act corporation subject to jurisdiction under the Federal Reserve or Comptroller of the Currency or a foreign clearing organization subject to similar regulation Perhaps one way to get around the problem is to rely on the Swaps Policy Statement which the CFTC has left untouched and has now adopted as a rule One of the Swaps Policy Statement requirements is the absence of a clearing organization or margin system but in explaining what it means by that it states that The ability to impose individualized credit enhancement requirements to secure either changes in the credit risk of a counterparty

<17540357.1075859973661.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,rbaird@velaw.com,2000-11-29 02:45:00,New CFTC rulesis a message I sent internally to all VE lawyers I know there is a lot in here that some of you already know about but I thought Id share it with you Except for the clearing organization rules which appear to me to be a mess I think this should make life simpler for Sara and Jim in dealing with equity derivatives for Mark Taylor Sara and others in dealing with principaltoprincipal negotiated commodity derivatives and perhaps for EnronOnline Nora this will no doubt pose some interesting questions relative to DealBench And of course if and to the extent that Enron wants to set up or otherwise get involved in multiple participant BB Internet trading sites that involve transactions that will be completed online there will be some issues that need to be addressed This should be viewed as a very preliminary report because I have not had a chance to study the new rules carefully I will send more complete information later Last week the Commodities Futures Trading Commission adopted its new regulatory framework a series of rules that I believe will greatly expand the breadth depth height weight and size of the CFTCs bureaucracy and the scope of the CFTCs regulatory involvement in all sorts of things including financial guarantees that it has not attempted to regulate heretofore The CFTC described this rule making as a regulatory reinvention Indeed the CFTC has reinvented itself without Congressional authorization to do so In particular under the new rules for the first time the CFTCs board of trade regulation is not confined to markets in which speculators participate In effect it has extended its board of trade regulatory reach into a portion of the overthecounter market that involves only business participants Probably the biggest headache for all of us will be the new rules relating to Clearing Organizations defined as a person who provides credit enhancement functions with respect to certain transactions including transactions that rely on the new bilateral contract exemption discussed below In many cases it will be illegal for a company that does not register with and become regulated by the CFTC as a Recognized Clearing Organization RCO to provide credit enhancement functions I obviously need to study the rules further but my initial read is that the rules are a disaster in drafting For example I dont think that the CFTC intended to say that a parent company cannot guarantee a swap entered into by its subsidiary unless the parent company registers as an RCO but on my initial reading it appears to me that the rule is not at all clear and could be read that way So if you are working on any transaction that involves a guarantee of a swap or other transaction that is exempt under the new exemption for bilateral contracts you need to run this issue to ground before you close The rules dont become effective however until days after they are published in the Federal Register There are some good things about the new rules The new exemption for bilateral contracts greatly liberalizes the swaps exemption and expands it so that it covers contracts other than swaps It provides greater certainty regarding the enforceability of derivatives and in most cases of contracts for physical delivery of commodities The bilateral contracts exemption however is unavailable for contracts entered into through Multiple Transaction Execution Facilities or MTEFs Multiple participant BB Internet trading sites will be classified as MTEFs unless participants are required to go offline to complete the contracts as for example CheMatch requires its participants to do Under the new rules multiple participant BB Internet trading sites that involve swaps and other derivative contracts completed online must submit themselves to CFTC regulation as Derivatives Transaction Facilities or DTFs Moreover an MTEF that trades only in physical delivery contracts can achieve contract enforcement certainty of the type offered by the exemption for bilateral contracts only if it submits itself to regulation as a DTF The MTEF definition excludes any Internet trading site such as EnronOnline that involves a single party offering to enter into trades with multiple parties and therefore the sponsor of such a site can take advantage of the exemption for bilateral contracts without submitting itself to CFTC regulation DTFs must not permit any person other than an eligible commercial participant to trade The term eligible commercial participant is defined in the rule and includes generally commercial counterparties and financial intermediaries Although the CFTC promises that its regulation of DTFs will be more light handed that that historically applied to US futures exchanges the new regulatory framework is likely to result in significant regulatory oversight of multiple participant BB Internet trading sites that register as DTFs Under the new rules each sponsor must determine whether to restrict trading on its site to avoid CFTC regulation or to submit to regulation Robert S Baird Vinson Elkins LLP One American Center
