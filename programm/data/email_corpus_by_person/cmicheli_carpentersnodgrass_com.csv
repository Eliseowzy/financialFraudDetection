Communications Director SubjectUpdate of Windfall Profits Tax Legislation The following is advance Caltaxletter coverage of the May California Legislatures actions on two bills that would impose windfall profits taxes on producers of electricity SENATE APPROVES WINDFALL PROFITS TAX AS ROLLING BLACKOUTS HIT Nearly coinciding with rolling blackouts plaguing California for the first time since midMarch the Senate on Monday approved a windfall profits tax on energy producers SB X Soto Critics said the measure establishes a perverse tax incentive not to sell power in California and will reduce electricity supply even further increasing prospects of future blackouts Twentyfive Democrats voted aye on SB X while Republicans vot ed against it Because the bill did not pass with votes or twothirds of the Senate as required by Proposition there will likely be a court challenge on this point Meanwhile just hours earlier the Assembly Revenue and Taxation Committee approved a slightly different version of a windfall profits tax A B X Corbett despite the fact that the bill was substantially amended at the hearing SB X imposes a percent excise tax on sales of electricity at a price above per megawatthour It also establishes a refundable tax credit equal to the amount of revenue generated by the tax AB X establishes a retroactive to January slidingscale tax o f percent of gross receipts on electricity sales over per megawatthour percent of the gross receipts of sales over per megawatthour and percent of gross receipts of sales over per megawatthour The rate of tax can be changed from time to time by the California Public Utilities Commission The bill will likely tax sales not made in California because it defines sales of electricity to a retail er in California to be the higher of the ratio of sales in California to the total sales or percentage of total electricity sales everywhere using a ratio of total sales everywhere in the year to sales in California in the year Debate in the Senate was hotter than the degree temperature outside Democrat Senator Steve Peace who is generally given credit for pushing th e electricity deregulation bill through the Legislature in became high ly emotional in denouncing energy producers Continuing to blame the California crisis on the Federal Energy Regulation Commission FERC as well as Harvey Rosenfields Proposition which sought to unravel deregulation in and caused a twoyear delay in construction of additional power plants Senator Peace called SB X the only reasonable alternative He said it will bring competition to the market with rules and a referee who will blow the whistle He descr ibed FERC as the proverbial cop in the donut shop who refuses to enforce th e law and limit what wholesalers can charge Republican Senator Ray Haynes said the tax would not bring additional electricity to Californians We are going to make sure by passing this bill that the lights will go out he said Democrat Senator Debra Bowen said the prospect of taxing excess profits will grab energy producers by the horns and their hearts and minds w ill follow Republican Senator Tom McClintock said the tax would cut supplies of electricity noting that other states such as Texas and Nevada are building or will build power plants to serve California with investments that benefit those states economies not Californias To make e lectricity cheap we have to make it plentiful This is a very wrong step in a very wrong direction he said At the Assembly committee hearing numerous speakers sought to testify for and against the bill However Democrat Assembly Member Helen Thomson chosen by Committee Chair Ellen Corbett to preside instead of the Republican vicechair which in itself was unusual limited testimony to tw o witnesses on each side Speaking for the tax were Jean Ross executive director of the California Budget Project and Lenny Goldberg of the California Tax Reform Association organizations funded largely by public employee unions or liberalleaning foundations that generally oppose tax relief and support increased government spending Ms Ross urged immediate action saying consumers will be paying percent of their income on power purchases in the next year Mr Goldberg called the proposal a viable and realistic solution which he said he hopes is constitutional Providing opposition testimony were CarrieLee Coke representing the California Manufacturers and Technology Association and Steven Kelly of t he Independent Energy Producers Ms Coke said the bill is a disincentive to more supply and will make the current crisis worse She said it also appli es to the cogeneration operations of California manufacturers Mr Kelly told the committee that the bill jeopardizes plans for as much as billion i n private capital investment in new California power plants A number of others were allowed to state their affiliations and their positions on the bill Among supporters were the California Labor Federati on and the California Public Interest Research Group Opposition included the California Chamber of Commerce InterGen and BPAmoco Committee Member Elaine Alquist asked to be a coauthor of the bill sayin g it is about time we did somethingAB X was approved by a vote with Republicans abstaining Assembly Member Mark Wyland said he abstained because he believes that while California is being gouged by high energy prices the bill is antifree market and incentives are needed to develop more power to avoid blackouts Meanwhile Governor Gray Davis is open to the idea of such a tax but has not endorsed either bill said his press secretary Steve Maviglio It just depends on the bill ealertgif

Communications Director SubjectUpdate of Windfall Profits Tax Legislation The following is advance Caltaxletter coverage of the May California Legislatures actions on two bills that would impose windfall profits taxes on producers of electricity SENATE APPROVES WINDFALL PROFITS TAX AS ROLLING BLACKOUTS HIT Nearly coinciding with rolling blackouts plaguing California for the first time since midMarch the Senate on Monday approved a windfall profits tax on energy producers SB X Soto Critics said the measure establishes a perverse tax incentive not to sell power in California and will reduce electricity supply even further increasing prospects of future blackouts Twentyfive Democrats voted aye on SB X while Republicans vot ed against it Because the bill did not pass with votes or twothirds of the Senate as required by Proposition there will likely be a court challenge on this point Meanwhile just hours earlier the Assembly Revenue and Taxation Committee approved a slightly different version of a windfall profits tax A B X Corbett despite the fact that the bill was substantially amended at the hearing SB X imposes a percent excise tax on sales of electricity at a price above per megawatthour It also establishes a refundable tax credit equal to the amount of revenue generated by the tax AB X establishes a retroactive to January slidingscale tax o f percent of gross receipts on electricity sales over per megawatthour percent of the gross receipts of sales over per megawatthour and percent of gross receipts of sales over per megawatthour The rate of tax can be changed from time to time by the California Public Utilities Commission The bill will likely tax sales not made in California because it defines sales of electricity to a retail er in California to be the higher of the ratio of sales in California to the total sales or percentage of total electricity sales everywhere using a ratio of total sales everywhere in the year to sales in California in the year Debate in the Senate was hotter than the degree temperature outside Democrat Senator Steve Peace who is generally given credit for pushing th e electricity deregulation bill through the Legislature in became high ly emotional in denouncing energy producers Continuing to blame the California crisis on the Federal Energy Regulation Commission FERC as well as Harvey Rosenfields Proposition which sought to unravel deregulation in and caused a twoyear delay in construction of additional power plants Senator Peace called SB X the only reasonable alternative He said it will bring competition to the market with rules and a referee who will blow the whistle He descr ibed FERC as the proverbial cop in the donut shop who refuses to enforce th e law and limit what wholesalers can charge Republican Senator Ray Haynes said the tax would not bring additional electricity to Californians We are going to make sure by passing this bill that the lights will go out he said Democrat Senator Debra Bowen said the prospect of taxing excess profits will grab energy producers by the horns and their hearts and minds w ill follow Republican Senator Tom McClintock said the tax would cut supplies of electricity noting that other states such as Texas and Nevada are building or will build power plants to serve California with investments that benefit those states economies not Californias To make e lectricity cheap we have to make it plentiful This is a very wrong step in a very wrong direction he said At the Assembly committee hearing numerous speakers sought to testify for and against the bill However Democrat Assembly Member Helen Thomson chosen by Committee Chair Ellen Corbett to preside instead of the Republican vicechair which in itself was unusual limited testimony to tw o witnesses on each side Speaking for the tax were Jean Ross executive director of the California Budget Project and Lenny Goldberg of the California Tax Reform Association organizations funded largely by public employee unions or liberalleaning foundations that generally oppose tax relief and support increased government spending Ms Ross urged immediate action saying consumers will be paying percent of their income on power purchases in the next year Mr Goldberg called the proposal a viable and realistic solution which he said he hopes is constitutional Providing opposition testimony were CarrieLee Coke representing the California Manufacturers and Technology Association and Steven Kelly of t he Independent Energy Producers Ms Coke said the bill is a disincentive to more supply and will make the current crisis worse She said it also appli es to the cogeneration operations of California manufacturers Mr Kelly told the committee that the bill jeopardizes plans for as much as billion i n private capital investment in new California power plants A number of others were allowed to state their affiliations and their positions on the bill Among supporters were the California Labor Federati on and the California Public Interest Research Group Opposition included the California Chamber of Commerce InterGen and BPAmoco Committee Member Elaine Alquist asked to be a coauthor of the bill sayin g it is about time we did somethingAB X was approved by a vote with Republicans abstaining Assembly Member Mark Wyland said he abstained because he believes that while California is being gouged by high energy prices the bill is antifree market and incentives are needed to develop more power to avoid blackouts Meanwhile Governor Gray Davis is open to the idea of such a tax but has not endorsed either bill said his press secretary Steve Maviglio It just depends on the bill ealertgif
