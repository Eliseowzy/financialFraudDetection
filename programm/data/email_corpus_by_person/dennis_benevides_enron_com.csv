with the low end coming up to meet the high Heavy load volume went way down but Im at a loss as to why offpeak demand continued to trade mumbled one bewildered player One analyst speculated that with daytime highs near comfortable levels heating demand should only be kicking in at night The market did indeed appear unusual throughout the West on Friday Contrary to norms power at Palo Verde and South Path sold at a premium to MidColumbia pieces One possible factor for this anomaly could be the derating of the CaliforniaOregon Intertie from between three and fourthousand megawatts to MW for scheduled maintenance which will last through October This could have effectively isolated the Pacific Northwest with lower load demands and nearnormal generating capacity only with nobody to whom to export one analyst postulated While NYMEX made up for Thursdays losses spot gas prices at the Southern California border fell by almost cents on Friday The Henry Hub natural gas contract for November climbed cents to close at mmBtu while December gas trailed along gaining cents on Friday s trades to close at mmBtu On Friday MidColumbia peak power traded at a discount to power in the Southwest Heavy load pieces traded in a tight range between to MWh on Friday and this included the usual premium that comes with trading three days out One player speculated that the lack of volatility at MidColumbia was due to the loss of transmission capacity at the CaliforniaOregon Intertie Temperatures were forecast to hover near normal in the Northwest through the weekend with reservoirbuilding

Thursday with offpeak prices edging up on the usual allday Sunday premium Light load energy costs at SP and NP climbed and MWh respectively SP prices were seen at a slight premium to NP in a light trading session as many players sat on the sidelines covering their loads but otherwise out of the spot market In political news Californias State Board of Equalization voted to switch tax jurisdiction of power plants from the local to the state level in The state reported it will tax the plants based on fair market share and predicted that more revenues will be raised under the new system Also in the news California will not build new transmission lines used to import power from neighboring states Nevada and Arizona until at least The generation landscape was little changed on Friday The Shasta hydro units MW were completely offline The reservoirs are probably too low to support any generation right now speculated one analyst Temperatures in California were expected to range from the lows to lows through Tuesday producing little weatherrelated electricity demand in the state Keeping hope for more demand in the near future down the latest sixtoten from the NWS called for normal temperatures from November to Southwest peak power was a hot commodity in the WSCC on Friday Peak goods for Monday delivery fluctuated between and MWh at Palo Verde which boasted a higher volume of trade than its neighboring hubs Some players speculated that the Palo premium was based on high natural gas prices that caused many California gasfired plants to remain dormant and buy power from outside the state Without the CaliforniaOregon Intertie nobody could access Northwest hydropower so everybody lined up at Palo Verde and SP commented one seasoned marketer Temperatures ranged

Southern California Border made more significant gains on Wednesday with trades heard from to mmBtu compared to Tuesdays range of to mmBtu NYMEX Henry Hub gas contracts were on the rise early Wednesday due to cool weather forecasts and some technical buying but ended sharply lower following the late release of a bearish AGA inventory report November Hub gas ended down cents at MWh after an

levels seen the past four out of five years Of the bcf injected last week bcf were injected in the Western Consuming Region Total inventories in the West stood at bcf compared to bcf a year ago and the fiveyear average of bcf Both peak and offpeak spot electricity prices in the Northwest rose by as much as MWh on Wednesday The increase in offpeak prices was largely blamed on longer and colder fall nights while the onpeak rise was attributed to lower hydro flows associated with the commencement of Vernita Bar Originally scheduled to begin on October Vernita Bar operations were slated to begin at midnight on Thursday The yearly operations involve curtailing flows during the daylight hours while increasing them during the nighttime hours to ensure that salmon eggs remained covered with water This is when we get into reverse load factoring said one Northwest hydro operator We will probably only be able to generate about half as much during the day as we can at night Historically Vernita Bar operations result in a narrowing of the peak and offpeak spread as heavy load prices rise and light load prices fall However as one marketer put it People overreact to the start of Vernita Bar operations every year but they need to remember that this is a shoulder month Vernita Bar operations are scheduled to be in place until November In unit news reports indicated that Wyomingbased

Friday on the usual weekend premium and hydroelectric curtailments in the Northwest The annual Vernita Bar fish operation commenced on Thursday reducing the amount of generation during the peak hours and increasing output over the light load hours During the heavy load hours we can roughly generate about half of what we can for the light load hours said one hydro operator Some traders however questioned the amount of impact the flow restrictions were having on the dailies Reduced hydroelectric output isnt the real marketmoving force gas is said one analyst While spot gas prices dipped slightly on Friday NYMEX Henry Hub futures contracts were sharply higher in moderate trade The gas contracts were propelled higher by some short covering ahead of the weekend a cooler sixtotenday

cents to close at mmBtu Total US storage stood at tcf or about full Some analysts believed that gas inventories could climb to a record tcf in the three remaining weeks of stockbuilding season Dayahead energy costs in the Northwest got a good boost Friday on the typical risk associated with trading three days out and on reduced hydroelectric output during the peak hours A few traders seemed a little surprised that offpeak prices rose by an average of MWh given that Vernita Bar operations allow for more generation during the light load hours but factor in allday Sunday and there is no surprise Peak power at the MidColumbia ranged from to MWh with the bulk of transactions occurring between and MWh The only unit of consequence remaining offline in the Northwest was Bridger MW but the Wyomingbased thermal unit was expected to return over the weekend Weather forecasts called for normal temperatures into the first part of the new week with the possibility of precipitation NOAA
