pool issue Thursday February the city will hold a public hearing at Creekside Intermediate School at pm This meeting will be a great chance for everyone to ask their questions and hear the answers firsthand I know that there are very strong opinions on this issue and I like to be informed before I vote If you have not been following the newspaper coverrage I have included several articles for you to skim Mary G Strickland League City to start hearings on center By JENNIFER THOMAS Citizen Staff December Three public hearings have been scheduled to discuss the League City Community Center referendum thats up for voter approval in a special election on Feb Voters will be asked to approve a million community center equipped with an indoor competitive pool outdoor recreational pool weight room gymnasium and other amenities Ian Powell of SHW Group Inc the architectural engineering firm designing the facility will be conducting the hearings along with representatives from the League City Parks Department The first hearing is scheduled for Wednesday Jan at the Clear Creek High School Ninth Grade Center located at E Main St at pm The second hearing will be Thursday Jan at Creekside Intermediate School E Main St at pm The last hearing will be held at the Johnny Arolfo Civic Center located on Walker just next to City Hall Tuesday Jan at pm The community center is the second phase of a project that started with the construction of the Sportsplex Two sites are under consideration for the proposed community center the land across from City Hall and Walter Hall Park off FM Funding for construction of the community center will come from the cent sales tax that was passed to help pay for the construction of the Sportsplex from Certificates of Obligation and from the citys General Fund Membership fees user fees and rental costs will pay for operations and maintenance Clear Lake Citizen Subj Pool Meeting and Vote Date PM Central Standard Time From A HREFmailtoCCVEVENTSCCVEVENTSA To A HREFmailtoCCVEVENTSCCVEVENTSA Questions abound about community center By Alicia Gooden The Daily News Published January If the publics overall impression of the first public hearing on a proposed community center is indicative of the February vote the measure might face an uphill battle I think it lacked sufficient information to have a good reasonable vote on the issue said JA Willhern a League City resident A good portion of the small vocal group that showed up Thursday night for the hearing sent an overt message to city leaders too many questions not enough answers From the onset of the meeting Mayor Tommy Frankovich asked that the hearing be one that set aside personal and political stances on the million project By the end of the hearing it was evident that the Feb election would come down to which wheel squeaked the loudest Most of the comments made during the minute hearing dealt with how the project would be funded who would use the facilities where the community center would be built and how much financial burden League City residents would be asked to shoulder Residents like Fred Lawrence Karl Silverman and Elaine Kosty hurled questions at City Administrator Nick Finan and project consultant Ian Powell about the specifics of the project The questions probed how realistic the citys estimation was that the yearly maintenance costs for the squarefoot center would cost just The total estimated cost of the project is million Of that amount million in certificate of obligation would have to be sold Other funding sources would come from property taxes B sales taxes and any grants the city could secure Also asked of city leaders was how much more outofarea swim teams would be charged as compared to those aquatic teams inside the city and how much the listed additions such as a child care center and second gymnasium would cost A shared concern among many who do not support the project or are undecided is that the center is really for the swim teams many of which are outside of League City and Galveston County Throughout the questioning however Finan and other city officials remained poised Yet some of the queries posed stumped city officials Those in attendance wanted to know how much of the included salaries and benefits for the staff needed to run the community center and how many people would be on staff Though city officials said they had the information it was not available at the meeting a point that many commented on afterward How can you have a public hearing and not have the information the public wants asked resident Jeff Mallios But the criticisms and negative intonations were buoyed somewhat by Teresa Toungate a parent with the swim team League City Barracudas Toungate to applause from park board members and those in support of the project told the crowd that the community center would bring an influx of economic development to the city There are more than families that come to these competitions sometimes she said These families are going to eat at our McDonalds Estebans a local restaurant and spend money at our little stores One of those expressing concern over the cost of the project said that League City had no major retailers only little stores to help offset the cost of the community center which will feature a meter Olympicsize swimming pool A chance to dive into the issue By Stephen Hadley The Daily News Published January Theres something about a swimming pool that stirs the proverbial political pot in a community In League City there is a plan to build a million community center that includes an Olympicsize swimming pool and meeting rooms The hitch is that voters have to approve the proposal before it becomes reality Theyll head to the polls on Feb But before they do the city plans to address questions and concerns about the project during three public hearings The first is tonight Some of the questions city leaders should answer concern where the proposed center is going to be built and how much its going to cost to use it Opponents of the deal have voiced both concerns Experts hired by the city say the center should be built closer to city hall not on countyowned land at Walter Hall Park as is now planned Some opponents have questioned whether the center would pose an environmental threat to Clear Creek if it were built at the park Thats a dialogue city leaders should have with citizens starting at tonights meeting Is Walter Hall Park the best site for a community center The intent of putting it there was so that it would be centrally located accessible to residents in League City and people who live in the burgeoning Clear Lake area How much it will cost to use the center has been a point of contention from the projects infancy Even the county commissioners when they agreed to allow the city to use the park for the center questioned whether the cost a year for a family of four or a day to use the pool was too much They worried whether those who cant afford such rates would be kept from using a public pool Thats another legitimate question city leaders should answer tonight If the early campaigning is any indication there probably will be many more questions this evening If you care about the issue this is one hearing not to miss Center election divides community By Alicia Gooden The Daily News Published January LEAGUE CITY In three weeks voters will head to the polls to decide whether to build a million community center in the city Supporters say the center could be a tool for economic development a nucleus for the League City community and the magnet that attracts national cheerleading and swimming competitions Those who oppose the project say that the city is trying to force all of League Citys residents to pay for a multimillion center that would be used by a select few most notably the areas swim leagues If Thursdays public hearing was any indication residents are divided over the project and have plenty of questions Whether the measure passes or fails on Feb could largely hinge on how well city officials explain the details of paying for the center and just who will be footing that bill Paying the Piper The cost of the squarefoot building which will include an Olympicsize swimming pool and several meeting rooms is estimated to be million The city has secured million for the project The rest of the money will come from the issuance of million in certificates of obligation The original bond amount was million but had to be raised to million in order to cover building costs Taxpayers will pay for the maintenance and operations cost of the center in its first three years through revenue from the general fund which includes property taxes franchise fees and possibly an increase in sales tax revenue from the B Corporation The city estimates that the center would generate a year in revenue after three years Its forecast for the actual expenditures after the three years is Earlier figures showed that the cost of operations would run between to But City Administrator Nick Finan said that after staff members took a harder look at the numbers the city was able to find ways to scale back costs by hiring contract custodial labor as opposed to paid labor If the community center gets a green light from voters the facility will have a staff of fulltime employees and parttime Their salaries which Finan said are included in the operations cost would total a year If we can meet our expectations then we expect for our revenues to be more than our expenditures he said But if the city does not meet its expectations Finan said that city council will have to decide how to handle the shortfall At that time maybe the operations of the facility will be scaled back he said There are a myriad of ways that can be addressed After the third year the city anticipates that the center will have between and full and partial memberships at an estimated yearly cost of to for aquatics memberships Fees alone after the third year are projected to generate in revenue The certicates on the community center would last years said Finan The payments on the bond note would be a year The citys current general fund debt is million The life of the pool is expected to be years to years because it is indoors and located in the southern part of the country Finan said if the referendum should pass the city would initiate the first issuance of certificates this summer Spreading the Word Teresa Toungate and the other members of the League City Barracudas swim team showcased a banner that urged residents to vote for the proposed community center during the citys holiday parade in December The group will soon begin work on fliers and letters sent to other swim teams asking them to become vocal supporters of the project The way I see it we have access to people through the swim teams and if each one of those people tells a friend and then goes to the polls well have one of the larger turnouts that League City has seen in a long time she said The way people like JA Willhern see it theres a lot more the city needs to get nailed down before he votes for the project Shiny brochures and colorful artist renderings arent enough You the city want us to give you a blank check he said to city officials at Thursdays first public hearing on the community center The city has not set fees for the center It has only estimated the amount the center would need to one day be selfsustaining That move would have been political said Mayor Tommy Frankovich We could make it look nice in order to get the issue passed and play around with numbers just to get it he said Thats why we kept the numbers general Frankovich said that future council would set the fees for the community center if the referendum passes The ballot language for Proposition is simple It asks only whether residents would or would not support a community center to be built in the city It says nothing of the cost of the facility and how it would be financed There was no legal requirement to do so said Finan The referendum also does not tell voters that the measure is binding As vehemently as Toungate is about supporting the project opponents of the community center are working to kill the deal Theyre asking questions requesting information and telling those they come in contact with their opinions No I will not support it said League City resident Fred Lawrence Right now I dont have enough information and I think the information that the city is giving us is bad for the vote At the top of his concern list is why the city hasnt decided on where to build the community center Two options exist the acres the county agreed to let the city lease in Walter Hall Park or the Arolfo site on acres of land adjacent to city hall Project consultants said geotechnical studies show the Arolfo site would be better suited for what the city wants to build They dont know what they want but they want the voters to make a decision said Elaine Kosty a former council member Opponents contend the project is a gift to the numerous area swim teams They said that if the swim teams want the facility the city should make them pay for it Conversely many of the community center supporters say that the swimming pool was promised to them during the quartercent sales tax election Revenue from that sales tax initiative was used to build the Sportsplex But Toungate said that the community center dialogue has been narrowed to focus in on only the swimming pool a portion of the project that the swim teams have tried to shy away from We understand that thats an ugly issue she said But the focus should be on the benefit the community center brings to the entire community The swim teams were told upfront said Toungate that they would have to pay for the firstclass facility if they wanted it She said that her team has decided that it would pay what was necessary to be able to use the facility Were not asking for any free rides or for the city to cut us any special deals she said The city estimates that teams will be charged an hour for use of the facility and that up to three teams can use the meter pool at one time Toungate said she understands the concerns of older residents and what impact the community center might have on some of them I understand that older people are not going to use the pool but by the same token Im not going to use the senior citizen room she said Winner and Losers Who will ultimately benefit from the center if it is built is debatable The city would have a topnotch facility the only one in the area with an indoor pool capable of attracting state and national swim meets It could also have the pull to get state and national cheerleading competitions in town supporters say Economic development would benefit said Finan Toungate and other supporters said such athletic meets attract thousands of people These people will come to our city and spend their money in our city said Toungate These same people could also cause overflow parking problems in the city Lawrence Close to parking spaces will be needed to accommodate a building the size of the proposed community center We dont have the restaurants to feed these thousands of people said Lawrence Theyre going to go down to Clear Lake and NASA Road If the center is built the city says that according to financial forecasts taxes would not have to be raised to support the facility But if the city does not make its goal of getting the to memberships the costs of running the facility could continue to come from the general fund or the operations might have to be scaled down said Finan That bothers Lawrence I just dont like the way the whole thing was set up he said Toungate is bothered that the project has been viewed so negatively People love to dwell on the negative she said Look at the whole picture This center will benefit every age and resident from little children to senior citizens Thats something positive for the city
