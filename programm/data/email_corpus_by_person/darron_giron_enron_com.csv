stitch sweatshop onto his shoes Heres the responses he got fun and games with Nike From Personalize NIKE iD To Jonah H Peretti Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Your NIKE iD order was cancelled for one or more of the following reasons Your Personal iD contains another partys trademark Your Personal iD contains the name of an athlete or team we do not have the legal right to use Your Personal iD was left blank Did you not want any personalization Your Personal iD contains profanity or inappropriate slang and besides your mother would slap us If you wish to reorder your NIKE iD product with a new personalization please visit us again at wwwnikecom Thank you NIKE iD From Jonah H Peretti To Personalize NIKE iD Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Greetings My order was canceled but my personal NIKE iD does not violate any of the criteria outlined in your message The Personal iD on my custom ZOOM XC USA running shoes was the word sweatshop Sweatshop is not anothers partys trademark the name of an athlete blank or profanity I choose the iD because I wanted to remember the toil and labor of the children that made my shoes Could you please ship them to me immediately Thanks and Happy New Year Jonah Peretti From Personalize NIKE iD To Jonah H Peretti Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Dear NIKE iD Customer Your NIKE iD order was cancelled because the iD you have chosen contains as stated in the previous email correspondence inappropriate slang If you wish to reorder your NIKE iD product with a new personalization please visit us again at nikecom Thank you NIKE iD From Jonah H Peretti To Personalize NIKE iD Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Dear NIKE iD Thank you for your quick response to my inquiry about my custom ZOOM XC USA running shoes Although I commend you for your prompt customer service I disagree with the claim that my personal iD was inappropriate slang After consulting Websters Dictionary I discovered that sweatshop is in fact part of standard English and not slang The word means a shop or factory in which workers are employed for long hours at low wages and under unhealthy conditions and its origin dates from So my personal iD does meet the criteria detailed in your first email Your web site advertises that the NIKE iD program is about freedom to choose and freedom to express who you are I share Nikes love of freedom and personal expression The site also says that If you want it done rightbuild it yourself I was thrilled to be able to build my own shoes and my personal iD was offered as a small token of appreciation for the sweatshop workers poised to help me realize my vision I hope that you will value my freedom of expression and reconsider your decision to reject my order Thank you Jonah Peretti From Personalize NIKE iD To Jonah H Peretti Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Dear NIKE iD Customer Regarding the rules for personalization it also states on the NIKE iD web site that Nike reserves the right to cancel any personal iD up to hours after it has been submitted In addition it further explains While we honor most personal iDs we cannot honor every one Some may be or contain others trademarks or the names of certain professional sports teams athletes or celebrities that Nike does not have the right to use Others may contain material that we consider inappropriate or simply do not want to place on our products Unfortunately at times this obliges us to decline personal iDs that may otherwise seem unobjectionable In any event we will let you know if we decline your personal iD and we will offer you the chance to submit another With these rules in mind we cannot accept your order as submitted If you wish to reorder your NIKE iD product with a new personalization please visit us again at wwwnikecom Thank you NIKE iD From Jonah H Peretti To Personalize NIKE iD Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Dear NIKE iD Thank you for the time and energy you have spent on my request I have decided to order the shoes with a different iD but I would like to make one small request Could you please send me a color snapshot of the tenyearold Vietnamese girl who makes my shoes Thanks Jonah Peretti As one forwarder writes this will now go round the world much farther and faster than any of the adverts they paid Michael Jordan more than the entire wage packet of all their sweatshop workers in the world to do I normally avoid

writer answers your questions about what went wrong against Stanford Coach Mack Browns respon se to the loss the continuing quarterback controversy UT players in the NFL and more Inside UT Football appears every Thursday Email questions to Chip Listen to Chip Brown talk about the Longhorns on dallasnewscoms Colleges site CHIP SHOTS Every year since Texas has lost or tied a game in its first four g ames of the season That means UT has had a blemish on its record each of the pa st years usually before TexasOU weekend Orangebloods spend winter spring and summer discussing the impact of n ew recruits the prowess of future opponents and the talents of its returning starters They spend money on season tickets airplane tickets and alumni luncheon tickets They dream big dreams and then by October the high hope s have usually come crashing down Only three times since has Texas opened the season and Those starts were then immediately followed by either a tie or losses and In each of those seasons Texas ended up with four losses In UTs two best seasons since a campaign in and a run in the Longhorns lost their second and third games of the season respectively Before Texas can dream about winning a national title the Longhorns have to show they can make it into October without a loss Longhorn Q A Q Judging from the Stanford game as well as the last three games of l ast season it looks like the trend of blitzing the Horns will continue There is also no respect for our running game from any team that we face I think th e best way to end this strategy against us is to become the aggressor on offense and not sit back passively and react to what the defense is giving us In order for us to achieve this I think it starts with us putting our b est athletes on the field on offense These guys may not be the most experience d players but they will gain experience with playing time and they have the ability to make a team pay for selling out with the blitz Its time to sta rt Roy Williams and BJ Johnson at receiver along with Montrell Flowers and play a oneback offensive set Our fullbacks are not a threat offensively a nd Hodges Mitchell is not an Iback who is adept at following the fullback through the hole Hodges strength is operating in space and making people miss in the open field I also think Chris Simms needs to get the bulk of the minutes at quarter back Major Applewhite has all the intangibles in the world but Simms could and probably does possess all of the same skills He just hasnt had the chanc e to display them We desperately need to have all playmakers on the field if we are going to turn this thing around If not I could see this season slipping to real quick What are your thoughts Chip The Jackson residence BROWN With any unexpected loss the tendency is to throw everyone out change coaches players even the bus driver You do that and you are telli ng this team that you have absolutely no confidence in them There cant be to o much change at any one time The big question is how the team responds to this Stanford loss emotionally Something tells me if Texas can find some resolve and perform really well youll see some solid performances at all the positions where problems currently exist In Texas was No and Notre Dame was No Texas had the game won in Austin and then lost UT th en lost three of its next four which included games against Oklahoma State Oklahoma and Colorado all teams Texas is about to face after this weeks opponent Houston That was a different coach and different players But the common thread was that Texas hit the top and then choked If Texas is hung over from its loss to Stanford trouble could be on the horizon If Texas can find resolv e to show everyone that Stanford truly was a game in which everything that could go wrong did then I think the Longhorns will bounce back and be a ha rd team to beat the rest of the way Tuesday night Mack Brown said the Longhor ns are not a very good football team right now The challenge has been made to his team If they come out and stink against Houston every position will b e scrutinized every coach even the bus driver There will be enough fire being thrown in Austin to serve up grilled fajitas for the entire state Bu t changes will have to be made constructively and gradually IMAGE Chris Simms Q Whats going on with the quarterbacks Mitch Golding BROWN As the QBs turn This week it appears Chris Simms will start because he was practicing with the first team on Tuesday That has been the trend Whoever practices with the first team gets the start Anyway well see how they respond after the Stanford game Major Applewhite was erratic in his play despite almost leading the Longhorns back from the dead to a miraculous victory Im sticking to my theory that the coaches want to see what Simms can do against Houston before picking one or the other to get solo duty in the Oklahoma and Colorado games Granted if one struggles along the way the other will come in But Mac k Brown said they primarily went with Applewhite against Stanford because of his experience and the fact that it was the teams first game on the road He said they still have all the faith in the world in Simms It would seem to me that it takes away the incentive to really take control of the offense lig ht it up and get on a roll when you are alternating but Ill continue to watc h like everyone else I keep trying to remind myself that Brown did this twice at North Caroli na with success Of course with those QBs Oscar Davenport and Chris Keldorf Brown had different styles and gained an advantage by forcing the defense t o prepare for Davenports scrambling and Keldorfs passing With Simms and Applewhite you pretty much get the same style With Keldorf and Davenport you also had injuries dictate a few starts Q Can you tell us what influenced Mack Browns decision regarding the quarterbacks against Stanford Nels Marshall BROWN Here are Browns exact words Experience We were in a tight football game and Major Applewhite has been around a long time I was pro ud even with as poorly as we played offensively in the third quarter that we didnt panic I thought that in the fourth quarter the kids did a great job of coming back and giving us a chance to win Sometimes youth doesnt look like it is trying because theyre nervous Instead they are trying too har d and get uptight Our team tried hard As negative as people make Saturday night it is one of those things that you have to grow from Q Im glad we have two great QBs My question is are the receivers ha ving any problem adjusting to the different spin on the balls coming from a lefthanded or righthanded QB Dave Stastny Austin BROWN The receivers say the varying spins are not a factor when catch ing the ball They do however say that Chris Simms ball will come a little faster and a little harder than Major Applewhites Q The Longhorns are obviously going to play a lot of freshmen this yea r What are the rules on redshirting a player after the season starts I know that a player can apply for a redshirt for medical reasons but can they al so apply for more eligibility or take a redshirt after playing a small amount of time Chad Graham BROWN No Once a freshman plays in a game even for one play and he d oes not suffer a seasonending injury the chance for a redshirt is out the window IMAGE Jermain Anderson Q Have the coaches given any consideration to moving Jermain Anderson b ack to linebacker If I remember correctly he played LB in high school at Texa s City He seems to still have good speed but also a problem putting on the necessary weight to play defensive end It just seems like he might be bett er suited for the outside linebacker rotation especially considering the progress made by young defensive ends like Kalen Thornton Cole Pittman and Adam Doiron Micah Hurt BROWN Coaches dont think Anderson has the speed to play linebacker They are pleased with the depth at linebacker as well They like Andersons instincts as a pass rusher They are still working on his ability to stop t he run Q My husband wanted me to write and request that you put the Longhorn football schedule in your letter each week My husband Mark is a diehard Texan who was transferred to Oklahoma in Through thick and thin he h as remained a loyal Longhorn fan and taken a lot of harassment from the Sooner fans Of course he does his fair share and probably more of bragging abo ut the Longhorns Barbara and Mark Harper BROWN As far as the schedule UTs remaining games are Sept home vs Houston at pm on Fox Sept home vs Oklahoma State at am on ABC Oct in Dallas vs Oklahoma TBA Oct at Colorado TBA Oct home vs Missouri TBA Oct home vs Baylor TBA Nov at Texas Tech TBA Nov at Kansas TBA Nov home vs Texas Aat pm on ABC Since you all have access to the Internet log onto UTs sports Web site texassportscom and learn what radio stations broadcast the game in your area And you can read The Dallas Morning News online every day at dallasnewscom Q This may take some research but I was wondering if you could tell me the number of UT players in the NFL and the status of some recent grads ie hows Cedric Woodard Aaron Humphrey Kwame Cavil Thanks BROWN The Big office just released a list of former Texas players in the NFL However it includes some players who have been released For example Aaron Humphrey was released after a freeagent tryout with Tampa Bay Chris Smith was released after a freeagent tryout with Washington and Dallas Jay Humphrey also was released after one year with the Minnesota Vikings Kwame Cavil made the Buffalo Bills after going undrafted Anyway here is the list as provided by the Big TEXAS Ben Adams OL Miami Taje Allen DB St Louis Tony Brackens DE Jacksonville Blake Brockermeyer OG Chicago Ricky Brown RB Cincinnati Chris Carter DB New England Kwame Cavil WR Buffalo Phil Dawson KS Cleveland Shane Dronett DL Atlanta Priest Holmes RB Baltimore Aaron Humphrey DE Tampa Bay Jay Humphrey OL Minnesota Derek Lewis TE St Louis Wane McGarity WR Dallas Eric Metcalf WR Carolina Dan Neil OL Denver Roger Roesler OL Cincinnati Chris Smith TE Dallas Winfred Tubbs LB San Francisco Bryant Westbrook DB Detroit Ricky Williams RB New Orleans Cedric Woodard DL Baltimore IMAGE Hodges Mitchell Q Dont know whether you can address any or all of these questions in y our column but Ive seen some unflattering trends in Mack Browns program and wanted your feedback Mack Brown is a great recruiter no argument there However can he motivate It seems like he cant get the team up sometime s and cant adjust the teams mood during a game About offensive coordinator Greg Davis I dont know who is responsible for the offensive line but since it is an offensive group in more ways than on e I put it under him With guys the size that UT has shouldnt even Hodges Mitchell be able to run Who tagged Leonard Davis as a pro Why does Davis love Mitchell Sure he gained plus yards last year but how many of those yards were move the chains type of runs that allowed UT to hold the ball on the ground and protect a lead I thought it was going to be running back by committee but all we have seen is the coaches continuing the same mistake abandoning th e run and using the wrong back for the wrong situations Mitchell can run to the outside but he cannot run through the defensive tackles And even if he does get holes he still will never break through t he linebackers for a TD Why not put Ivan Williams or Kenny Hayter back there with Mitchell and go with a twoback threewide offense You dont lose a receiver as Hodges is a nice smart receiver Other ramblings Is Quentin Jammer really a corner He got beat MANY tim e against Stanford I loved his hitting when he played safety but his injury may have forever changed his game if he cant play safety and cant keep up with opponents wideouts How is the defensive end position shaping up The defensive tackles were all over the field against Stanford but the DEs didnt make much noise What i s up with the blocked punts UT should be really really embarrassed Does Stockton take too long Is he too close to the line Can the line block Ca n anyone at UT block Does Brown ride the officials who are missing holding calls Several tim es the camera caught clear holds by Stanfords line Why on earth would you ru n up the middle on your own goal line against two of the best DTs youll pla y against Andrew Bowen BROWN I think your feelings are shared by many Texas fans who are incredibly pained shocked disappointed angered and hurt by last Saturday s events But in talking to Mack Brown on Tuesday he said its fair to beat the team up for not being able to run the ball But he said to jump on any other part of the team is to rip young inexperienced kids who are still learning what it takes to compete as a topranked team To be fair to Brown he did say repeatedly that his team was overrated a nd needed time to grow into some key positions receiver defensive end fullback and some positions on the offensive line and at corner It probabl y isnt fair to question whether Mack Brown can motivate because his teams di d beat Nebraska twice Oklahoma twice and Texas Aonce If a trend develop s and Texas falls apart the rest of the season there will be a fair question about whether Brown did a good enough job of keeping his teams head screwe d on straight But its typical after losses to want to shred every part of t he team Brown said before the season that as soon as something went wrong the quarterback situation would be blamed And he was right The QBs are still working hard and look for Simms to start this week against Houston There s no question that the Oline is struggling but so are the backs and so are the receivers Brown said only two of the five sacks were the fault of the line He said the other three were caused by miscommunication between Applewhite and the receivers causing Applewhite to hold the ball too long Mitchell was standing too deep in the backfield against Stanford so it was taking him too long to get to the holes The coaches were not happy about that They were yelling at him to move up He should only be yards deep But he was sometimes at yards Mitchell also struggled with some blitz pickup which is uncharacteristic of him So look for Victor Ike Hayter and possibly Williams to get a little time against Houston Coaches are still high on Jammer Again he hasnt played corner much in games after moving from safety But coaches are not thinking of moving him The defensive end position is a big concern with defensive coordinator Carl Reese He is willing to rifle through his whole pile until he finds a coupl e who can really play Cory Redding was better than usual against Stanford B ut that position still needs a lot of work The blocked punt occurred because one player who blocked perfectly on other punts Saturday night failed to block a player coming right up the middle which guarantees doom That play er has been chewed out every which way As far as the penalties there were several questionable calls But Brow n who did a lot of yelling at officials during the Stanford game couldnt sa y anything about it after the game because he would be fined Texas can still have a good season and perhaps having these problem areas pointed out so early will help in that direction Well see if Texas takes this loss constructively or destructively Q Last year at times I saw blazing speed and ability from Cory Redding I know he was considered by many to be the best high school defensive player in the country in Ive waited all offseason to see him explode against teams this year I havent seen it yet Maybe this week against Stanford M y question is why was he moved from his high school position of linebacker where he was dominant into the defensive end role where he seems undersized and average Is Texas that low on defensive line talent It seems our recruiting has been great Please help me understand Hook em Horns Ernie McAnally BROWN Redding told me recently that linebacker is still his first lov e But he said coaches came to him last year and said he could get on the fiel d right away as a defensive end Coaches also feel that his body i s perfect for the DE position Hes tall athletic fast and has long arms I n time coaches feel Redding will develop into an AllAmerica player But the re is no question that he has struggled against the run He made some big play s against Stanford recording six tackles three of them for losses and blocking an extra point attempt He is just a sophomore Over this season a nd the next two years he should only get better Q I was watching the regional telecast of the TCU game today and the announcers stated that TCU had anted up for the Heisman campaign f or LaDainian Tomlinson How much did UT spend on its campaign for Ricky Williams run for the Heisman BROWN Texas didnt spend that much money at all They produced a few postcards a video and a CDROM screen saver to send out to the national media detailing Rickys accomplishments But those costs totaled less than according to UT officials Q Did any of the freshman who did not play in the LouisianaLafayette game play in the Stanford game I am watching to see which ones might be redshirts Mike Smith Houston BROWN According to the participation chart provided at the StanfordT exas game Austin Sendlein was the only freshman to play against the Cardinal wh o did not play against LouisianaLafayette In addition to Sendlein here are the other freshmen who have played so far WRs Roy Williams BJ Johnson a nd Sloan Thomas TE Brock Edwards DE Kalen Thornton CB Nathan Vasher FS Phillip Geiggar and DT Stevie Lee Q Is it true that in Mack Browns four or five head coaching stops hi s teams have yet to win a single conference championship Since UT has lost four out of its last five games wouldnt a loss to Houston this week officially end Mack Browns honeymoon with the alumni notwithstanding his abundant PR program With Brown about to land his third national Top recruiting class I believe fans are going to expect more gridiron victorie s to go with those recruiting victories T Hough BROWN Its true that Brown has yet to win a conference championship i n stints at Appalachian State Tulane North Carolina and now Texas At Appalachian State Tulane and UNC he was taking over absolutely dead programs He took Tulane to a bowl and he had Florida State to deal with i n the Atlantic Coast Conference while at UNC But he took UNC to six bowl gam es in his years at UNC and won four of them A loss to Houston would certainly intensify the frustration of Texas faithful But I think anyone who would be looking to put Brown on the hot seat or rip him if Texas lost to Houston would be overlooking the job he ha s done beating Nebraska twice Oklahoma twice and Texas Aonce in hi s first two seasons here He has also turned Texas back into a destination school for top recruits and brought the UT community back together In addition to all that he has done more good for UT out of the limelight tha n probably most Texas fans realize Brown is now in the same spotlight as Bobby Bowden John Cooper Lloyd C arr Steve Spurrier and Phil Fulmer Any unexpected losses are unforgivable in t he eyes of fans It may take some time for Brown and his team to adjust to tha t UNC fans were pretty hohum about everything the Tar Heels did in football even when they won big Brown wanted to win at a school with huge expectations Hell have to adjust now that it appears Texas will be starti ng out the next few seasons in the Top Q Is Lee Jackson out for the Houston game Marty Bonner BROWN Jackson is out for the Houston game with a hamstring pull suffe red against Stanford He may also miss the Oklahoma State game Mack Brown said this is a bad week to be without Jackson because Houston can throw the ball really well Q Is Ricky Williams jersey being retired at the Oklahoma State game S ept Mark Wilson BROWN Yes Williams No will be retired at that game Williams ha s said he will be there because the New Orleans Saints are off that weekend Host Communications has also just finished a video biography on Williams th at will be available soon Q What did Mack Brown say about the expectations surrounding his team after the loss to Stanford Virginia Blair BROWN Again here are Macks words I said during the preseason tha t we were overrated I didnt see any reason with the youth the way we finished last year and the inexperience across the board that we should have been a Top football team One of the great things about Texas is that you receiv e a tremendous amount of attention and publicity but in some cases people wa nt to push you too fast to get to the top I think that we were in that positi on and expectations got out of hand I knew that we would have a difficult gam e at Stanford and that it would be a tough game to win I also didnt think that we deserved to be ranked fifth in the country Our current rank within the Top is much more fitting for where we are today If you received this newsletter from a friend and would like to subscri be sign up at Newsletter Registration To find or change your password modify your account or unsubscribe fro

looking at again Keep reading to the bottom of the page dont stop at the feetYoull see THINGS ARENT ALWAYS WHAT THEY SEEM Two traveling angels stopped to spend the night in the home of a wealthy family The family was rude and refused to let the angels stay in the mansions guest room Instead the angels were given a small space in the cold basement As they made their bed on the hard floor the older angel saw a hole in the wall and repaired it When the younger angel asked why the older angel replied Things arent always what they seem The next night the pair came to rest at the house of a very poor but very hospitable farmer and his wife After sharing what little food they had the couple let the angels sleep in their bed where they could have a good nights rest When the sun came up the next morning the angels found the farmer and his wife in tears Their only cow whose milk had been their sole income lay dead in the field The younger angel was infuriated and asked the older angel How could you have let this happen The first man had everything yet you helped him she accused The second family had little but was willing to share everything and you let the cow die Things arent always what they seem the older angel replied When we stayed in the basement of the mansion I noticed there was gold stored in that hole in the wall Since the owner was so obsessed with greed and unwilling to share his good fortune I sealed the wall so he wouldnt find it Then last night as we slept in the farmers bed the angel of death came for his wife I gave him the cow instead Things arent always what they seem Sometimes that is exactly what happens when things dont turn out the way they should If you have faith you just need to trust that every outcome is always to your advantage You might not know it until some time later Oooo Some people come into our lives and quickly go oooO Some people become friends and stay awhile leaving beautiful Oooo footprints on our hearts oooO and we are

around the world Nike now lets you personalize your shoes by submitting a word or phrase which they will stitch onto your shoes under the swoosh So Jonah Peretti filled out the form and sent them to stitch sweatshop onto his shoes Heres the responses he got fun and games with Nike From Personalize NIKE iD To Jonah H Peretti Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Your NIKE iD order was cancelled for one or more of the following reasons Your Personal iD contains another partys trademark Your Personal iD contains the name of an athlete or team we do not have the legal right to use Your Personal iD was left blank Did you not want any personalization Your Personal iD contains profanity or inappropriate slang and besides your mother would slap us If you wish to reorder your NIKE iD product with a new personalization please visit us again at wwwnikecom Thank you NIKE iD From Jonah H Peretti To Personalize NIKE iD Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Greetings My order was canceled but my personal NIKE iD does not violate any of the criteria outlined in your message The Personal iD on my custom ZOOM XC USA running shoes was the word sweatshop Sweatshop is not anothers partys trademark the name of an

Jonah Peretti From Personalize NIKE iD To Jonah H Peretti Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Dear NIKE iD Customer Your NIKE iD order was cancelled because the iD you have chosen contains as stated in the previous email correspondence inappropriate slang If you wish to reorder your NIKE iD product with a new personalization please visit us again at nikecom Thank you NIKE iD From Jonah H Peretti To Personalize NIKE iD Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Dear NIKE iD Thank you for your quick response to my inquiry about my custom ZOOM XC USA running shoes Although I commend you for your prompt customer service I disagree with the claim that my personal iD was inappropriate slang After consulting Websters Dictionary I discovered that sweatshop is in fact part of standard English and not slang The word means a shop or factory in which workers are employed for long hours at low wages and under unhealthy conditions and its origin dates from So my personal iD does meet the criteria detailed in your first email Your web site advertises that the NIKE iD program is about freedom to choose and freedom to express who you are I share Nikes love of freedom and personal expression The site also says that If you want it done rightbuild it yourself I was thrilled to be able to build my own shoes and my personal iD was offered as a small token of appreciation for the sweatshop workers poised to help me realize my vision I hope that you will value my freedom of expression and reconsider your decision to reject my order Thank you Jonah Peretti From Personalize NIKE iD To Jonah H Peretti Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Dear NIKE iD Customer Regarding the rules for personalization it also states on the NIKE iD web site that Nike reserves the right to cancel any personal iD up to hours after it has been submitted In addition it further explains While we honor most personal iDs we cannot honor every one Some may be or contain others trademarks or the names of certain professional sports teams athletes or celebrities that Nike does not have the right to use Others may contain material that we consider inappropriate or simply do not want to place on our products Unfortunately at times this obliges us to decline personal iDs that may otherwise seem unobjectionable In any event we will let you know if we decline your personal iD and we will offer you the chance to submit another With these rules in mind we cannot accept your order as submitted If you wish to reorder your NIKE iD product with a new personalization please visit us again at wwwnikecom Thank you NIKE iD From Jonah H Peretti To Personalize NIKE iD Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Dear NIKE iD Thank you for the time and energy you have spent on my request I have decided to order the shoes with a different iD but I would like to make one small request Could you please send me a color snapshot of the tenyearold Vietnamese girl who makes my shoes Thanks Jonah Peretti As one forwarder writes this will now go round the world much farther and faster than any of the adverts they paid Michael Jordan more than the entire wage packet of all their sweatshop workers in the world to do I normally avoid

writer answers your questions about what went wrong against Stanford Coach Mack Browns respon se to the loss the continuing quarterback controversy UT players in the NFL and more Inside UT Football appears every Thursday Email questions to Chip Listen to Chip Brown talk about the Longhorns on dallasnewscoms Colleges site CHIP SHOTS Every year since Texas has lost or tied a game in its first four g ames of the season That means UT has had a blemish on its record each of the pa st years usually before TexasOU weekend Orangebloods spend winter spring and summer discussing the impact of n ew recruits the prowess of future opponents and the talents of its returning starters They spend money on season tickets airplane tickets and alumni luncheon tickets They dream big dreams and then by October the high hope s have usually come crashing down Only three times since has Texas opened the season and Those starts were then immediately followed by either a tie or losses and In each of those seasons Texas ended up with four losses In UTs two best seasons since a campaign in and a run in the Longhorns lost their second and third games of the season respectively Before Texas can dream about winning a national title the Longhorns have to show they can make it into October without a loss Longhorn Q A Q Judging from the Stanford game as well as the last three games of l ast season it looks like the trend of blitzing the Horns will continue There is also no respect for our running game from any team that we face I think th e best way to end this strategy against us is to become the aggressor on offense and not sit back passively and react to what the defense is giving us In order for us to achieve this I think it starts with us putting our b est athletes on the field on offense These guys may not be the most experience d players but they will gain experience with playing time and they have the ability to make a team pay for selling out with the blitz Its time to sta rt Roy Williams and BJ Johnson at receiver along with Montrell Flowers and play a oneback offensive set Our fullbacks are not a threat offensively a nd Hodges Mitchell is not an Iback who is adept at following the fullback through the hole Hodges strength is operating in space and making people miss in the open field I also think Chris Simms needs to get the bulk of the minutes at quarter back Major Applewhite has all the intangibles in the world but Simms could and probably does possess all of the same skills He just hasnt had the chanc e to display them We desperately need to have all playmakers on the field if we are going to turn this thing around If not I could see this season slipping to real quick What are your thoughts Chip The Jackson residence BROWN With any unexpected loss the tendency is to throw everyone out change coaches players even the bus driver You do that and you are telli ng this team that you have absolutely no confidence in them There cant be to o much change at any one time The big question is how the team responds to this Stanford loss emotionally Something tells me if Texas can find some resolve and perform really well youll see some solid performances at all the positions where problems currently exist In Texas was No and Notre Dame was No Texas had the game won in Austin and then lost UT th en lost three of its next four which included games against Oklahoma State Oklahoma and Colorado all teams Texas is about to face after this weeks opponent Houston That was a different coach and different players But the common thread was that Texas hit the top and then choked If Texas is hung over from its loss to Stanford trouble could be on the horizon If Texas can find resolv e to show everyone that Stanford truly was a game in which everything that could go wrong did then I think the Longhorns will bounce back and be a ha rd team to beat the rest of the way Tuesday night Mack Brown said the Longhor ns are not a very good football team right now The challenge has been made to his team If they come out and stink against Houston every position will b e scrutinized every coach even the bus driver There will be enough fire being thrown in Austin to serve up grilled fajitas for the entire state Bu t changes will have to be made constructively and gradually IMAGE Chris Simms Q Whats going on with the quarterbacks Mitch Golding BROWN As the QBs turn This week it appears Chris Simms will start because he was practicing with the first team on Tuesday That has been the trend Whoever practices with the first team gets the start Anyway well see how they respond after the Stanford game Major Applewhite was erratic in his play despite almost leading the Longhorns back from the dead to a miraculous victory Im sticking to my theory that the coaches want to see what Simms can do against Houston before picking one or the other to get solo duty in the Oklahoma and Colorado games Granted if one struggles along the way the other will come in But Mac k Brown said they primarily went with Applewhite against Stanford because of his experience and the fact that it was the teams first game on the road He said they still have all the faith in the world in Simms It would seem to me that it takes away the incentive to really take control of the offense lig ht it up and get on a roll when you are alternating but Ill continue to watc h like everyone else I keep trying to remind myself that Brown did this twice at North Caroli na with success Of course with those QBs Oscar Davenport and Chris Keldorf Brown had different styles and gained an advantage by forcing the defense t o prepare for Davenports scrambling and Keldorfs passing With Simms and Applewhite you pretty much get the same style With Keldorf and Davenport you also had injuries dictate a few starts Q Can you tell us what influenced Mack Browns decision regarding the quarterbacks against Stanford Nels Marshall BROWN Here are Browns exact words Experience We were in a tight football game and Major Applewhite has been around a long time I was pro ud even with as poorly as we played offensively in the third quarter that we didnt panic I thought that in the fourth quarter the kids did a great job of coming back and giving us a chance to win Sometimes youth doesnt look like it is trying because theyre nervous Instead they are trying too har d and get uptight Our team tried hard As negative as people make Saturday night it is one of those things that you have to grow from Q Im glad we have two great QBs My question is are the receivers ha ving any problem adjusting to the different spin on the balls coming from a lefthanded or righthanded QB Dave Stastny Austin BROWN The receivers say the varying spins are not a factor when catch ing the ball They do however say that Chris Simms ball will come a little faster and a little harder than Major Applewhites Q The Longhorns are obviously going to play a lot of freshmen this yea r What are the rules on redshirting a player after the season starts I know that a player can apply for a redshirt for medical reasons but can they al so apply for more eligibility or take a redshirt after playing a small amount of time Chad Graham BROWN No Once a freshman plays in a game even for one play and he d oes not suffer a seasonending injury the chance for a redshirt is out the window IMAGE Jermain Anderson Q Have the coaches given any consideration to moving Jermain Anderson b ack to linebacker If I remember correctly he played LB in high school at Texa s City He seems to still have good speed but also a problem putting on the necessary weight to play defensive end It just seems like he might be bett er suited for the outside linebacker rotation especially considering the progress made by young defensive ends like Kalen Thornton Cole Pittman and Adam Doiron Micah Hurt BROWN Coaches dont think Anderson has the speed to play linebacker They are pleased with the depth at linebacker as well They like Andersons instincts as a pass rusher They are still working on his ability to stop t he run Q My husband wanted me to write and request that you put the Longhorn football schedule in your letter each week My husband Mark is a diehard Texan who was transferred to Oklahoma in Through thick and thin he h as remained a loyal Longhorn fan and taken a lot of harassment from the Sooner fans Of course he does his fair share and probably more of bragging abo ut the Longhorns Barbara and Mark Harper BROWN As far as the schedule UTs remaining games are Sept home vs Houston at pm on Fox Sept home vs Oklahoma State at am on ABC Oct in Dallas vs Oklahoma TBA Oct at Colorado TBA Oct home vs Missouri TBA Oct home vs Baylor TBA Nov at Texas Tech TBA Nov at Kansas TBA Nov home vs Texas Aat pm on ABC Since you all have access to the Internet log onto UTs sports Web site texassportscom and learn what radio stations broadcast the game in your area And you can read The Dallas Morning News online every day at dallasnewscom Q This may take some research but I was wondering if you could tell me the number of UT players in the NFL and the status of some recent grads ie hows Cedric Woodard Aaron Humphrey Kwame Cavil Thanks BROWN The Big office just released a list of former Texas players in the NFL However it includes some players who have been released For example Aaron Humphrey was released after a freeagent tryout with Tampa Bay Chris Smith was released after a freeagent tryout with Washington and Dallas Jay Humphrey also was released after one year with the Minnesota Vikings Kwame Cavil made the Buffalo Bills after going undrafted Anyway here is the list as provided by the Big TEXAS Ben Adams OL Miami Taje Allen DB St Louis Tony Brackens DE Jacksonville Blake Brockermeyer OG Chicago Ricky Brown RB Cincinnati Chris Carter DB New England Kwame Cavil WR Buffalo Phil Dawson KS Cleveland Shane Dronett DL Atlanta Priest Holmes RB Baltimore Aaron Humphrey DE Tampa Bay Jay Humphrey OL Minnesota Derek Lewis TE St Louis Wane McGarity WR Dallas Eric Metcalf WR Carolina Dan Neil OL Denver Roger Roesler OL Cincinnati Chris Smith TE Dallas Winfred Tubbs LB San Francisco Bryant Westbrook DB Detroit Ricky Williams RB New Orleans Cedric Woodard DL Baltimore IMAGE Hodges Mitchell Q Dont know whether you can address any or all of these questions in y our column but Ive seen some unflattering trends in Mack Browns program and wanted your feedback Mack Brown is a great recruiter no argument there However can he motivate It seems like he cant get the team up sometime s and cant adjust the teams mood during a game About offensive coordinator Greg Davis I dont know who is responsible for the offensive line but since it is an offensive group in more ways than on e I put it under him With guys the size that UT has shouldnt even Hodges Mitchell be able to run Who tagged Leonard Davis as a pro Why does Davis love Mitchell Sure he gained plus yards last year but how many of those yards were move the chains type of runs that allowed UT to hold the ball on the ground and protect a lead I thought it was going to be running back by committee but all we have seen is the coaches continuing the same mistake abandoning th e run and using the wrong back for the wrong situations Mitchell can run to the outside but he cannot run through the defensive tackles And even if he does get holes he still will never break through t he linebackers for a TD Why not put Ivan Williams or Kenny Hayter back there with Mitchell and go with a twoback threewide offense You dont lose a receiver as Hodges is a nice smart receiver Other ramblings Is Quentin Jammer really a corner He got beat MANY tim e against Stanford I loved his hitting when he played safety but his injury may have forever changed his game if he cant play safety and cant keep up with opponents wideouts How is the defensive end position shaping up The defensive tackles were all over the field against Stanford but the DEs didnt make much noise What i s up with the blocked punts UT should be really really embarrassed Does Stockton take too long Is he too close to the line Can the line block Ca n anyone at UT block Does Brown ride the officials who are missing holding calls Several tim es the camera caught clear holds by Stanfords line Why on earth would you ru n up the middle on your own goal line against two of the best DTs youll pla y against Andrew Bowen BROWN I think your feelings are shared by many Texas fans who are incredibly pained shocked disappointed angered and hurt by last Saturday s events But in talking to Mack Brown on Tuesday he said its fair to beat the team up for not being able to run the ball But he said to jump on any other part of the team is to rip young inexperienced kids who are still learning what it takes to compete as a topranked team To be fair to Brown he did say repeatedly that his team was overrated a nd needed time to grow into some key positions receiver defensive end fullback and some positions on the offensive line and at corner It probabl y isnt fair to question whether Mack Brown can motivate because his teams di d beat Nebraska twice Oklahoma twice and Texas Aonce If a trend develop s and Texas falls apart the rest of the season there will be a fair question about whether Brown did a good enough job of keeping his teams head screwe d on straight But its typical after losses to want to shred every part of t he team Brown said before the season that as soon as something went wrong the quarterback situation would be blamed And he was right The QBs are still working hard and look for Simms to start this week against Houston There s no question that the Oline is struggling but so are the backs and so are the receivers Brown said only two of the five sacks were the fault of the line He said the other three were caused by miscommunication between Applewhite and the receivers causing Applewhite to hold the ball too long Mitchell was standing too deep in the backfield against Stanford so it was taking him too long to get to the holes The coaches were not happy about that They were yelling at him to move up He should only be yards deep But he was sometimes at yards Mitchell also struggled with some blitz pickup which is uncharacteristic of him So look for Victor Ike Hayter and possibly Williams to get a little time against Houston Coaches are still high on Jammer Again he hasnt played corner much in games after moving from safety But coaches are not thinking of moving him The defensive end position is a big concern with defensive coordinator Carl Reese He is willing to rifle through his whole pile until he finds a coupl e who can really play Cory Redding was better than usual against Stanford B ut that position still needs a lot of work The blocked punt occurred because one player who blocked perfectly on other punts Saturday night failed to block a player coming right up the middle which guarantees doom That play er has been chewed out every which way As far as the penalties there were several questionable calls But Brow n who did a lot of yelling at officials during the Stanford game couldnt sa y anything about it after the game because he would be fined Texas can still have a good season and perhaps having these problem areas pointed out so early will help in that direction Well see if Texas takes this loss constructively or destructively Q Last year at times I saw blazing speed and ability from Cory Redding I know he was considered by many to be the best high school defensive player in the country in Ive waited all offseason to see him explode against teams this year I havent seen it yet Maybe this week against Stanford M y question is why was he moved from his high school position of linebacker where he was dominant into the defensive end role where he seems undersized and average Is Texas that low on defensive line talent It seems our recruiting has been great Please help me understand Hook em Horns Ernie McAnally BROWN Redding told me recently that linebacker is still his first lov e But he said coaches came to him last year and said he could get on the fiel d right away as a defensive end Coaches also feel that his body i s perfect for the DE position Hes tall athletic fast and has long arms I n time coaches feel Redding will develop into an AllAmerica player But the re is no question that he has struggled against the run He made some big play s against Stanford recording six tackles three of them for losses and blocking an extra point attempt He is just a sophomore Over this season a nd the next two years he should only get better Q I was watching the regional telecast of the TCU game today and the announcers stated that TCU had anted up for the Heisman campaign f or LaDainian Tomlinson How much did UT spend on its campaign for Ricky Williams run for the Heisman BROWN Texas didnt spend that much money at all They produced a few postcards a video and a CDROM screen saver to send out to the national media detailing Rickys accomplishments But those costs totaled less than according to UT officials Q Did any of the freshman who did not play in the LouisianaLafayette game play in the Stanford game I am watching to see which ones might be redshirts Mike Smith Houston BROWN According to the participation chart provided at the StanfordT exas game Austin Sendlein was the only freshman to play against the Cardinal wh o did not play against LouisianaLafayette In addition to Sendlein here are the other freshmen who have played so far WRs Roy Williams BJ Johnson a nd Sloan Thomas TE Brock Edwards DE Kalen Thornton CB Nathan Vasher FS Phillip Geiggar and DT Stevie Lee Q Is it true that in Mack Browns four or five head coaching stops hi s teams have yet to win a single conference championship Since UT has lost four out of its last five games wouldnt a loss to Houston this week officially end Mack Browns honeymoon with the alumni notwithstanding his abundant PR program With Brown about to land his third national Top recruiting class I believe fans are going to expect more gridiron victorie s to go with those recruiting victories T Hough BROWN Its true that Brown has yet to win a conference championship i n stints at Appalachian State Tulane North Carolina and now Texas At Appalachian State Tulane and UNC he was taking over absolutely dead programs He took Tulane to a bowl and he had Florida State to deal with i n the Atlantic Coast Conference while at UNC But he took UNC to six bowl gam es in his years at UNC and won four of them A loss to Houston would certainly intensify the frustration of Texas faithful But I think anyone who would be looking to put Brown on the hot seat or rip him if Texas lost to Houston would be overlooking the job he ha s done beating Nebraska twice Oklahoma twice and Texas Aonce in hi s first two seasons here He has also turned Texas back into a destination school for top recruits and brought the UT community back together In addition to all that he has done more good for UT out of the limelight tha n probably most Texas fans realize Brown is now in the same spotlight as Bobby Bowden John Cooper Lloyd C arr Steve Spurrier and Phil Fulmer Any unexpected losses are unforgivable in t he eyes of fans It may take some time for Brown and his team to adjust to tha t UNC fans were pretty hohum about everything the Tar Heels did in football even when they won big Brown wanted to win at a school with huge expectations Hell have to adjust now that it appears Texas will be starti ng out the next few seasons in the Top Q Is Lee Jackson out for the Houston game Marty Bonner BROWN Jackson is out for the Houston game with a hamstring pull suffe red against Stanford He may also miss the Oklahoma State game Mack Brown said this is a bad week to be without Jackson because Houston can throw the ball really well Q Is Ricky Williams jersey being retired at the Oklahoma State game S ept Mark Wilson BROWN Yes Williams No will be retired at that game Williams ha s said he will be there because the New Orleans Saints are off that weekend Host Communications has also just finished a video biography on Williams th at will be available soon Q What did Mack Brown say about the expectations surrounding his team after the loss to Stanford Virginia Blair BROWN Again here are Macks words I said during the preseason tha t we were overrated I didnt see any reason with the youth the way we finished last year and the inexperience across the board that we should have been a Top football team One of the great things about Texas is that you receiv e a tremendous amount of attention and publicity but in some cases people wa nt to push you too fast to get to the top I think that we were in that positi on and expectations got out of hand I knew that we would have a difficult gam e at Stanford and that it would be a tough game to win I also didnt think that we deserved to be ranked fifth in the country Our current rank within the Top is much more fitting for

thinks it is but is not Minnesota was but is no longer Wisconsin just discovered what the meaning of is is Rice never was and Temple will never ever be We have gathered here to establish what is required to be a college football program Mind you this is more than an empirical hashing of wins and losses Colorado won a national title in but is not a program Ohio State has not won one since but is Determining what constitutes a program is tricky business as much about feel and intuition as it is churning out NFL talent Can we whistle your fight song Can mere mention of your school start a bar fight Does your school consider it a moral imperative to keep expanding stadium capacity so as to annually lead the NCAA in attendance Do we need a tow truck to haul your media guide from the mailbox to the front door If you answered yes yes yes and yes to the above you are likely a program You have a far better chance of achieving program status if you tee it up in the South where the War

Athens It was as if we had a chance to go to Gettysburg again former Georgia coach Vince Dooley says of that victory in Tony Barnharts new book Southern Fried Football What does it take to make our

go for your program Will one of your players come off the bench to tackle an opponent running free down the sideline a la Alabamas Tommy Lewis against Rices Dickie Moegle in the Cotton Bowl Are you

Since for example Penn State has employed only Rip Engle and Joe Paterno who have amassed a combined record of Penn State is a program Lastly and this is very importantit can make or break a program Are you willing to accept NCAA sanctions as a reasonable condition for winning a national title This factor alone tipped the University of Washington off the program fence You are likely not a program

looking at again Keep reading to the bottom of the page dont stop at the feetYoull see THINGS ARENT ALWAYS WHAT THEY SEEM Two traveling angels stopped to spend the night in the home of a wealthy family The family was rude and refused to let the angels stay in the mansions guest room Instead the angels were given a small space in the cold basement As they made their bed on the hard floor the older angel saw a hole in the wall and repaired it When the younger angel asked why the older angel replied Things arent always what they seem The next night the pair came to rest at the house of a very poor but very hospitable farmer and his wife After sharing what little food they had the couple let the angels sleep in their bed where they could have a good nights rest When the sun came up the next morning the angels found the farmer and his wife in tears Their only cow whose milk had been their sole income lay dead in the field The younger angel was infuriated and asked the older angel How could you have let this happen The first man had everything yet you helped him she accused The second family had little but was willing to share everything and you let the cow die Things arent always what they seem the older angel replied When we stayed in the basement of the mansion I noticed there was gold stored in that hole in the wall Since the owner was so obsessed with greed and unwilling to share his good fortune I sealed the wall so he wouldnt find it Then last night as we slept in the farmers bed the angel of death came for his wife I gave him the cow instead Things arent always what they seem Sometimes that is exactly what happens when things dont turn out the way they should If you have faith you just need to trust that every outcome is always to your advantage You might

looking at again Keep reading to the bottom of the page dont stop at the feetYoull see THINGS ARENT ALWAYS WHAT THEY SEEM Two traveling angels stopped to spend the night in the home of a wealthy family The family was rude and refused to let the angels stay in the mansions guest room Instead the angels were given a small space in the cold basement As they made their bed on the hard floor the older angel saw a hole in the wall and repaired it When the younger angel asked why the older angel replied Things arent always what they seem The next night the pair came to rest at the house of a very poor but very hospitable farmer and his wife After sharing what little food they had the couple let the angels sleep in their bed where they could have a good nights rest When the sun came up the next morning the angels found the farmer and his wife in tears Their only cow whose milk had been their sole income lay dead in the field The younger angel was infuriated and asked the older angel How could you have let this happen The first man had everything yet you helped him she accused The second family had little but was willing to share everything and you let the cow die Things arent always what they seem the older angel replied When we stayed in the basement of the mansion I noticed there was gold stored in that hole in the wall Since the owner was so obsessed with greed and unwilling to share his good fortune I sealed the wall so he wouldnt find it Then last night as we slept in the farmers bed the angel of death came for his wife I gave him the cow instead Things arent always what they seem Sometimes that is exactly what happens when things dont turn out the way they should If you have faith you just need to trust that every outcome is always to your advantage You might not know it until some time later Oooo Some people come into our lives and quickly go oooO Some people become friends and stay awhile leaving beautiful Oooo footprints on our hearts oooO and we are

writer answers your questions about what went wrong against Stanford Coach Mack Browns respon se to the loss the continuing quarterback controversy UT players in the NFL and more Inside UT Football appears every Thursday Email questions to Chip Listen to Chip Brown talk about the Longhorns on dallasnewscoms Colleges site CHIP SHOTS Every year since Texas has lost or tied a game in its first four g ames of the season That means UT has had a blemish on its record each of the pa st years usually before TexasOU weekend Orangebloods spend winter spring and summer discussing the impact of n ew recruits the prowess of future opponents and the talents of its returning starters They spend money on season tickets airplane tickets and alumni luncheon tickets They dream big dreams and then by October the high hope s have usually come crashing down Only three times since has Texas opened the season and Those starts were then immediately followed by either a tie or losses and In each of those seasons Texas ended up with four losses In UTs two best seasons since a campaign in and a run in the Longhorns lost their second and third games of the season respectively Before Texas can dream about winning a national title the Longhorns have to show they can make it into October without a loss Longhorn Q A Q Judging from the Stanford game as well as the last three games of l ast season it looks like the trend of blitzing the Horns will continue There is also no respect for our running game from any team that we face I think th e best way to end this strategy against us is to become the aggressor on offense and not sit back passively and react to what the defense is giving us In order for us to achieve this I think it starts with us putting our b est athletes on the field on offense These guys may not be the most experience d players but they will gain experience with playing time and they have the ability to make a team pay for selling out with the blitz Its time to sta rt Roy Williams and BJ Johnson at receiver along with Montrell Flowers and play a oneback offensive set Our fullbacks are not a threat offensively a nd Hodges Mitchell is not an Iback who is adept at following the fullback through the hole Hodges strength is operating in space and making people miss in the open field I also think Chris Simms needs to get the bulk of the minutes at quarter back Major Applewhite has all the intangibles in the world but Simms could and probably does possess all of the same skills He just hasnt had the chanc e to display them We desperately need to have all playmakers on the field if we are going to turn this thing around If not I could see this season slipping to real quick What are your thoughts Chip The Jackson residence BROWN With any unexpected loss the tendency is to throw everyone out change coaches players even the bus driver You do that and you are telli ng this team that you have absolutely no confidence in them There cant be to o much change at any one time The big question is how the team responds to this Stanford loss emotionally Something tells me if Texas can find some resolve and perform really well youll see some solid performances at all the positions where problems currently exist In Texas was No and Notre Dame was No Texas had the game won in Austin and then lost UT th en lost three of its next four which included games against Oklahoma State Oklahoma and Colorado all teams Texas is about to face after this weeks opponent Houston That was a different coach and different players But the common thread was that Texas hit the top and then choked If Texas is hung over from its loss to Stanford trouble could be on the horizon If Texas can find resolv e to show everyone that Stanford truly was a game in which everything that could go wrong did then I think the Longhorns will bounce back and be a ha rd team to beat the rest of the way Tuesday night Mack Brown said the Longhor ns are not a very good football team right now The challenge has been made to his team If they come out and stink against Houston every position will b e scrutinized every coach even the bus driver There will be enough fire being thrown in Austin to serve up grilled fajitas for the entire state Bu t changes will have to be made constructively and gradually IMAGE Chris Simms Q Whats going on with the quarterbacks Mitch Golding BROWN As the QBs turn This week it appears Chris Simms will start because he was practicing with the first team on Tuesday That has been the trend Whoever practices with the first team gets the start Anyway well see how they respond after the Stanford game Major Applewhite was erratic in his play despite almost leading the Longhorns back from the dead to a miraculous victory Im sticking to my theory that the coaches want to see what Simms can do against Houston before picking one or the other to get solo duty in the Oklahoma and Colorado games Granted if one struggles along the way the other will come in But Mac k Brown said they primarily went with Applewhite against Stanford because of his experience and the fact that it was the teams first game on the road He said they still have all the faith in the world in Simms It would seem to me that it takes away the incentive to really take control of the offense lig ht it up and get on a roll when you are alternating but Ill continue to watc h like everyone else I keep trying to remind myself that Brown did this twice at North Caroli na with success Of course with those QBs Oscar Davenport and Chris Keldorf Brown had different styles and gained an advantage by forcing the defense t o prepare for Davenports scrambling and Keldorfs passing With Simms and Applewhite you pretty much get the same style With Keldorf and Davenport you also had injuries dictate a few starts Q Can you tell us what influenced Mack Browns decision regarding the quarterbacks against Stanford Nels Marshall BROWN Here are Browns exact words Experience We were in a tight football game and Major Applewhite has been around a long time I was pro ud even with as poorly as we played offensively in the third quarter that we didnt panic I thought that in the fourth quarter the kids did a great job of coming back and giving us a chance to win Sometimes youth doesnt look like it is trying because theyre nervous Instead they are trying too har d and get uptight Our team tried hard As negative as people make Saturday night it is one of those things that you have to grow from Q Im glad we have two great QBs My question is are the receivers ha ving any problem adjusting to the different spin on the balls coming from a lefthanded or righthanded QB Dave Stastny Austin BROWN The receivers say the varying spins are not a factor when catch ing the ball They do however say that Chris Simms ball will come a little faster and a little harder than Major Applewhites Q The Longhorns are obviously going to play a lot of freshmen this yea r What are the rules on redshirting a player after the season starts I know that a player can apply for a redshirt for medical reasons but can they al so apply for more eligibility or take a redshirt after playing a small amount of time Chad Graham BROWN No Once a freshman plays in a game even for one play and he d oes not suffer a seasonending injury the chance for a redshirt is out the window IMAGE Jermain Anderson Q Have the coaches given any consideration to moving Jermain Anderson b ack to linebacker If I remember correctly he played LB in high school at Texa s City He seems to still have good speed but also a problem putting on the necessary weight to play defensive end It just seems like he might be bett er suited for the outside linebacker rotation especially considering the progress made by young defensive ends like Kalen Thornton Cole Pittman and Adam Doiron Micah Hurt BROWN Coaches dont think Anderson has the speed to play linebacker They are pleased with the depth at linebacker as well They like Andersons instincts as a pass rusher They are still working on his ability to stop t he run Q My husband wanted me to write and request that you put the Longhorn football schedule in your letter each week My husband Mark is a diehard Texan who was transferred to Oklahoma in Through thick and thin he h as remained a loyal Longhorn fan and taken a lot of harassment from the Sooner fans Of course he does his fair share and probably more of bragging abo ut the Longhorns Barbara and Mark Harper BROWN As far as the schedule UTs remaining games are Sept home vs Houston at pm on Fox Sept home vs Oklahoma State at am on ABC Oct in Dallas vs Oklahoma TBA Oct at Colorado TBA Oct home vs Missouri TBA Oct home vs Baylor TBA Nov at Texas Tech TBA Nov at Kansas TBA Nov home vs Texas Aat pm on ABC Since you all have access to the Internet log onto UTs sports Web site texassportscom and learn what radio stations broadcast the game in your area And you can read The Dallas Morning News online every day at dallasnewscom Q This may take some research but I was wondering if you could tell me the number of UT players in the NFL and the status of some recent grads ie hows Cedric Woodard Aaron Humphrey Kwame Cavil Thanks BROWN The Big office just released a list of former Texas players in the NFL However it includes some players who have been

Dallas Winfred Tubbs LB San Francisco Bryant Westbrook DB Detroit Ricky Williams RB New Orleans Cedric Woodard DL Baltimore IMAGE Hodges Mitchell Q Dont know whether you can address any or all of these questions in y our column but Ive seen some unflattering trends in Mack Browns program and wanted your feedback Mack Brown is a great recruiter no argument there However can he motivate It seems like he cant get the team up sometime s and cant adjust the teams mood during a game About offensive coordinator Greg Davis I dont know who is responsible for the offensive line but since it is an offensive group in more ways than on e I put it under him With guys the size that UT has shouldnt even Hodges Mitchell be able to run Who tagged Leonard Davis as a pro Why does Davis love Mitchell Sure he gained plus yards last year but how many of those yards were move the chains type of runs that allowed UT to hold the ball on the ground and protect a lead I thought it was going to be running back by committee but all we have seen is the coaches continuing the same mistake abandoning th e run and using the wrong back for the wrong situations Mitchell can run to the outside but he cannot run through the defensive tackles And even if he does get holes he still will never break through t he linebackers for a TD Why not put Ivan Williams or Kenny Hayter back there with Mitchell and go with a twoback threewide offense You dont lose a receiver as Hodges is a nice smart receiver Other ramblings Is Quentin Jammer really a corner He got beat MANY tim e against Stanford I loved his hitting when he played safety but his injury may have forever changed his game if he cant play safety and cant keep up with opponents wideouts How is the defensive end position shaping up The defensive tackles were all over the field against Stanford but the DEs didnt make much noise What i s up with the blocked punts UT should be really really embarrassed Does Stockton take too long Is he too close to the line Can the line block Ca n anyone at UT block Does Brown ride the officials who are missing holding calls Several tim es the camera caught clear holds by Stanfords line Why on earth would you ru n up the middle on your own goal line against two of the best DTs youll pla y against Andrew Bowen BROWN I think your feelings are shared by many Texas fans who are incredibly pained shocked disappointed angered and hurt by last Saturday s events But in talking to Mack Brown on Tuesday he said its fair to beat the team up for not being able to run the ball But he said to jump on any other part of the team is to rip young inexperienced kids who are still learning what it takes to compete as a topranked team To be fair to Brown he did say repeatedly that his team was overrated a nd needed time to grow into some key positions receiver defensive end fullback and some positions on the offensive line and at corner It probabl y isnt fair to question whether Mack Brown can motivate because his teams di d beat Nebraska twice Oklahoma twice and Texas Aonce If a trend develop s and Texas falls apart the rest of the season there will be a fair question about whether Brown did a good enough job of keeping his teams head screwe d on straight But its typical after losses to want to shred every part of t he team Brown said before the season that as soon as something went wrong the quarterback situation would be blamed And he was right The QBs are still working hard and look for Simms to start this week against Houston There s no question that the Oline is struggling but so are the backs and so are the receivers Brown said only two of the five sacks were the fault of the line He said the other three were caused by miscommunication between Applewhite and the receivers causing Applewhite to hold the ball too long Mitchell was standing too deep in the backfield against Stanford so it was taking him too long to get to the holes The coaches were not happy about that They were yelling at him to move up He should only be yards deep But he was sometimes at yards Mitchell also struggled with some blitz pickup which is uncharacteristic of him So look for Victor Ike Hayter and possibly Williams to get a little time against Houston Coaches are still high on Jammer Again he hasnt played corner much in games after moving from safety But coaches are not thinking of moving him The defensive end position is a big concern with defensive coordinator Carl Reese He is willing to rifle through his whole pile until he finds a coupl e who can really play Cory Redding was better than usual against Stanford B ut that position still needs a lot of work The blocked punt occurred because one player who blocked perfectly on other punts Saturday night failed to block a player coming right up the middle which guarantees doom That play er has been chewed out every which way As far as the penalties there were several questionable calls But Brow n who did a lot of yelling at officials during the Stanford game couldnt sa y anything about it after the game because he would be fined Texas can still have a good season and perhaps having these problem areas pointed out so early will help in that direction Well see if Texas takes this loss constructively or destructively Q Last year at times I saw blazing speed and ability from Cory Redding I know he was considered by many to be the best high school defensive player in the country in Ive waited all offseason to see him explode against teams this year I havent seen it yet Maybe this week against Stanford M y question is why was he moved from his high school position of linebacker where he was dominant into the defensive end role where he seems undersized and average Is Texas that low on defensive line talent It seems our recruiting has been great Please help me understand Hook em Horns Ernie McAnally BROWN Redding told me recently that linebacker is still his first lov e But he said coaches came to him last year and said he could get on the fiel d right away as a defensive end Coaches also feel that his body i s perfect for the DE position Hes tall athletic fast and has long arms I n time coaches feel Redding will develop into an AllAmerica player But the re is no question that he has struggled against the run He made some big play s against Stanford recording six tackles three of them for losses and blocking an extra point attempt He is just a sophomore Over this season a nd the next two years he should only get better Q I was watching the regional telecast of the TCU game today and the announcers stated that TCU had anted up for the Heisman campaign f or LaDainian Tomlinson How much did UT spend on its campaign for Ricky Williams run for the Heisman BROWN Texas didnt spend that much money at all They produced a few postcards a video and a CDROM screen saver to send out to the national media detailing Rickys accomplishments But those costs totaled less than according to UT officials Q Did any of the freshman who did not play in the LouisianaLafayette game play in the Stanford game I am watching to see which ones might be redshirts Mike Smith Houston BROWN According to the participation chart provided at the StanfordT exas game Austin Sendlein was the only freshman to play against the Cardinal wh o did not play against LouisianaLafayette In addition to Sendlein here are the other freshmen who have played so far WRs Roy Williams BJ Johnson a nd Sloan Thomas TE Brock Edwards DE Kalen Thornton CB Nathan Vasher FS Phillip Geiggar and DT Stevie Lee Q Is it true that in Mack Browns four or five head coaching stops hi s teams have yet to win a single conference championship Since UT has lost four out of its last five games wouldnt a loss to Houston this week officially end Mack Browns honeymoon with the alumni notwithstanding his abundant PR program With Brown about to land his third national Top recruiting class I believe fans are going to expect more gridiron victorie s to go with those recruiting victories T Hough BROWN Its true that Brown has yet to win a conference championship i n stints at Appalachian State Tulane North Carolina and now Texas At Appalachian State Tulane and UNC he was taking over absolutely dead programs He took Tulane to a bowl and he had Florida State to deal with i n the Atlantic Coast Conference while at UNC But he took UNC to six bowl gam es in his years at UNC and won four of them A loss to Houston would certainly intensify the frustration of Texas faithful But I think anyone who would be looking to put Brown on the hot seat or rip him if Texas lost to Houston would be overlooking the job he ha s done beating Nebraska twice Oklahoma twice and Texas Aonce in hi s first two seasons here He has also turned Texas back into a destination school for top recruits and brought the UT community back together In addition to all that he has done more good for UT out of the limelight tha n probably most Texas fans realize Brown is now in the same spotlight as Bobby Bowden John Cooper Lloyd C arr Steve Spurrier and Phil Fulmer Any unexpected losses are unforgivable in t he eyes of fans It may take some time for Brown and his team to adjust to tha t UNC fans were pretty hohum about everything the Tar Heels did in football even when they won big Brown wanted to win at a school with huge expectations Hell have to adjust now that it appears Texas will be starti ng out the next few seasons in the Top Q Is Lee Jackson out for the Houston game Marty Bonner BROWN Jackson is out for the Houston game with a hamstring pull suffe red against Stanford He may also miss the Oklahoma State game Mack Brown said this is a bad week to be without Jackson because Houston can throw the ball really well Q Is Ricky Williams jersey being retired at the Oklahoma State game S ept Mark Wilson BROWN Yes Williams No will be retired at that game Williams ha s said he will be there because the New Orleans Saints are off that weekend Host Communications has also just finished a video biography on Williams th at will be available soon Q What did Mack Brown say about the expectations surrounding his team after the loss to Stanford Virginia Blair BROWN Again here are Macks words I said during the preseason tha t we were overrated I didnt see any reason with the youth the way we finished last year and the inexperience across the board that we should have been a Top football team One of the great things about Texas is that you receiv e a tremendous amount of attention and publicity but in some cases people wa nt to push you too fast to get to the top I think that we were in that positi on and expectations got out of hand I knew that we would have a difficult gam e at Stanford and that it would be a tough game to win I also didnt think that we deserved to be ranked fifth in the country Our current rank within the Top is much more fitting for

or more of the following reasons Your Personal iD contains another partys trademark Your Personal iD contains the name of an athlete or team we do not have the legal right to use Your Personal iD was left blank Did you not want any personalization Your Personal iD contains profanity or inappropriate slang and besides your mother would slap us If you wish to reorder your NIKE iD product with a new

iD does not violate any of the criteria outlined in your message The Personal iD on my custom ZOOM XC USA running shoes was the word sweatshop Sweatshop is not anothers partys trademark the name of an

Jonah Peretti From Personalize NIKE iD To Jonah H Peretti Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Dear NIKE iD Customer Your NIKE iD order was cancelled because the iD you have chosen contains as stated in

Personalize NIKE iD Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Dear NIKE iD Thank you for your quick response to my inquiry about my custom ZOOM XC USA running shoes Although I commend you for your prompt customer service I disagree with the claim that my personal iD was inappropriate slang After consulting Websters Dictionary I discovered that sweatshop is in fact part of standard English and not slang The word means a shop or factory in which workers are employed for long hours at low wages and under unhealthy conditions and its origin dates from So my personal iD does meet the criteria detailed in your first email Your web site advertises that the NIKE iD program is about freedom to choose and freedom to express who you are I share Nikes love of freedom and personal expression The site also says that If you want it done rightbuild it yourself I was thrilled to be able to build my own shoes and my personal iD was offered as a small token of appreciation for the sweatshop workers poised to help me realize my vision I hope that you will value my freedom of expression and reconsider your decision to reject my order Thank you Jonah Peretti From Personalize NIKE iD To Jonah H Peretti Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Dear NIKE iD Customer Regarding the rules for personalization it also states on the NIKE iD web site that Nike reserves the right to cancel any personal iD up to hours after it has been submitted In addition it further explains While we honor most personal iDs we cannot honor every one Some may be or contain others trademarks or the names of certain professional sports teams athletes or celebrities that Nike does not have the right to use Others may contain material that we consider inappropriate or simply do not want to place on our products Unfortunately at times this obliges us to decline personal iDs that may otherwise seem unobjectionable In any event we will let you know if we decline your personal iD and we will offer you the chance to submit another With these rules in mind we cannot accept your order as submitted If you wish to reorder your NIKE iD product with a new personalization please visit us again at wwwnikecom Thank you NIKE iD From Jonah H Peretti To Personalize NIKE iD Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Dear NIKE iD Thank you for the time and energy you have spent on my request I have decided to order the shoes with a different iD but I would like to make one small request Could you please send me a color snapshot of the tenyearold Vietnamese girl who makes my shoes Thanks Jonah Peretti As one forwarder writes this

around the world Nike now lets you personalize your shoes by submitting a word or phrase which they will stitch onto your shoes under the swoosh So Jonah Peretti filled out the form and sent them to stitch sweatshop onto his shoes Heres the responses he got fun and games with Nike From Personalize NIKE iD To Jonah H Peretti Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Your NIKE iD order was cancelled for one or more of the following reasons Your Personal iD contains another partys trademark Your Personal iD contains the name of an athlete or team we do not have the legal right to use Your Personal iD was left blank Did you not want any personalization Your Personal iD contains profanity or inappropriate slang and besides your mother would slap us If you wish to reorder your NIKE iD product with a new personalization please visit us again at wwwnikecom Thank you NIKE iD From Jonah H Peretti To Personalize NIKE iD Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Greetings My order was canceled but my personal NIKE iD does not violate any of the criteria outlined in your message The Personal iD on my custom ZOOM XC USA running shoes was the word sweatshop Sweatshop is not anothers partys trademark the name of an athlete blank or profanity I choose the iD because I wanted to remember the toil and labor of the children that made my shoes Could you please ship them to me immediately Thanks and Happy New Year Jonah Peretti From Personalize NIKE iD To Jonah H Peretti Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Dear NIKE iD Customer Your NIKE iD order was cancelled because the iD you have chosen contains as stated in the previous email correspondence inappropriate slang If you wish to reorder your NIKE iD product with a new personalization please visit us again at nikecom Thank you NIKE iD From Jonah H Peretti To Personalize NIKE iD Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Dear NIKE iD Thank you for your quick response to my inquiry about my custom ZOOM XC USA running shoes Although I commend you for your prompt customer service I disagree with the claim that my personal iD was inappropriate slang After consulting Websters Dictionary I discovered that sweatshop is in fact part of standard English and not slang The word means a shop or factory in which workers are employed for long hours at low wages and under unhealthy conditions and its origin dates from So my personal iD does meet the criteria detailed in your first email Your web site advertises that the NIKE iD program is about freedom to choose and freedom to express who you are I share Nikes love of freedom and personal expression The site also says that If you want it done rightbuild it yourself I was thrilled to be able to build my own shoes and my personal iD was offered as a small token of appreciation for the sweatshop workers poised to help me realize my vision I hope that you will value my freedom of expression and reconsider your decision to reject my order Thank you Jonah Peretti From Personalize NIKE iD To Jonah H Peretti Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Dear NIKE iD Customer Regarding the rules for personalization it also states on the NIKE iD web site that Nike reserves the right to cancel any personal iD up to hours after it has been submitted In addition it further explains While we honor most personal iDs we cannot honor every one Some may be or contain others trademarks or the names of certain professional sports teams athletes or celebrities that Nike does not have the right to use Others may contain material that we consider inappropriate or simply do not want to place on our products Unfortunately at times this obliges us to decline personal iDs that may otherwise seem unobjectionable In any event we will let you know if we decline your personal iD and we will offer you the chance to submit another With these rules in mind we cannot accept your order as submitted If you wish to reorder your NIKE iD product with a new personalization please visit us again at wwwnikecom Thank you NIKE iD From Jonah H Peretti To Personalize NIKE iD Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Dear NIKE iD Thank you for the time and energy you have spent on my request I have decided to order the shoes with a different iD but I would like to make one small request Could you please send me a color snapshot of the tenyearold Vietnamese girl who makes my shoes Thanks Jonah Peretti As one forwarder writes this will now go round the world much farther and faster than any of the adverts they paid Michael Jordan more than the entire wage packet of all their sweatshop workers in the world to do I normally avoid

writer answers your questions about what went wrong against Stanford Coach Mack Browns respon se to the loss the continuing quarterback controversy UT players in the NFL and more Inside UT Football appears every Thursday Email questions to Chip Listen to Chip Brown talk about the Longhorns on dallasnewscoms Colleges site CHIP SHOTS Every year since Texas has lost or tied a game in its first four g ames of the season That means UT has had a blemish on its record each of the pa st years usually before TexasOU weekend Orangebloods spend winter spring and summer discussing the impact of n ew recruits the prowess of future opponents and the talents of its returning starters They spend money on season tickets airplane tickets and alumni luncheon tickets They dream big dreams and then by October the high hope s have usually come crashing down Only three times since has Texas opened the season and Those starts were then immediately followed by either a tie or losses and In each of those seasons Texas ended up with four losses In UTs two best seasons since a campaign in and a run in the Longhorns lost their second and third games of the season respectively Before Texas can dream about winning a national title the Longhorns have to show they can make it into October without a loss Longhorn Q A Q Judging from the Stanford game as well as the last three games of l ast season it looks like the trend of blitzing the Horns will continue There is also no respect for our running game from any team that we face I think th e best way to end this strategy against us is to become the aggressor on offense and not sit back passively and react to what the defense is giving us In order for us to achieve this I think it starts with us putting our b est athletes on the field on offense These guys may not be the most experience d players but they will gain experience with playing time and they have the ability to make a team pay for selling out with the blitz Its time to sta rt Roy Williams and BJ Johnson at receiver along with Montrell Flowers and play a oneback offensive set Our fullbacks are not a threat offensively a nd Hodges Mitchell is not an Iback who is adept at following the fullback through the hole Hodges strength is operating in space and making people miss in the open field I also think Chris Simms needs to get the bulk of the minutes at quarter back Major Applewhite has all the intangibles in the world but Simms could and probably does possess all of the same skills He just hasnt had the chanc e to display them We desperately need to have all playmakers on the field if we are going to turn this thing around If not I could see this season slipping to real quick What are your thoughts Chip The Jackson residence BROWN With any unexpected loss the tendency is to throw everyone out change coaches players even the bus driver You do that and you are telli ng this team that you have absolutely no confidence in them There cant be to o much change at any one time The big question is how the team responds to this Stanford loss emotionally Something tells me if Texas can find some resolve and perform really well youll see some solid performances at all the positions where problems currently exist In Texas was No and Notre Dame was No Texas had the game won in Austin and then lost UT th en lost three of its next four which included games against Oklahoma State Oklahoma and Colorado all teams Texas is about to face after this weeks opponent Houston That was a different coach and different players But the common thread was that Texas hit the top and then choked If Texas is hung over from its loss to Stanford trouble could be on the horizon If Texas can find resolv e to show everyone that Stanford truly was a game in which everything that could go wrong did then I think the Longhorns will bounce back and be a ha rd team to beat the rest of the way Tuesday night Mack Brown said the Longhor ns are not a very good football team right now The challenge has been made to his team If they come out and stink against Houston every position will b e scrutinized every coach even the bus driver There will be enough fire being thrown in Austin to serve up grilled fajitas for the entire state Bu t changes will have to be made constructively and gradually IMAGE Chris Simms Q Whats going on with the quarterbacks Mitch Golding BROWN As the QBs turn This week it appears Chris Simms will start because he was practicing with the first team on Tuesday That has been the trend Whoever practices with the first team gets the start Anyway well see how they respond after the Stanford game Major Applewhite was erratic in his play despite almost leading the Longhorns back from the dead to a miraculous victory Im sticking to my theory that the coaches want to see what Simms can do against Houston before picking one or the other to get solo duty in the Oklahoma and Colorado games Granted if one struggles along the way the other will come in But Mac k Brown said they primarily went with Applewhite against Stanford because of his experience and the fact that it was the teams first game on the road He said they still have all the faith in the world in Simms It would seem to me that it takes away the incentive to really take control of the offense lig ht it up and get on a roll when you are alternating but Ill continue to watc h like everyone else I keep trying to remind myself that Brown did this twice at North Caroli na with success Of course with those QBs Oscar Davenport and Chris Keldorf Brown had different styles and gained an advantage by forcing the defense t o prepare for Davenports scrambling and Keldorfs passing With Simms and Applewhite you pretty much get the same style With Keldorf and Davenport you also had injuries dictate a few starts Q Can you tell us what influenced Mack Browns decision regarding the quarterbacks against Stanford Nels Marshall BROWN Here are Browns exact words Experience We were in a tight football game and Major Applewhite has been around a long time I was pro ud even with as poorly as we played offensively in the third quarter that we didnt panic I thought that in the fourth quarter the kids did a great job of coming back and giving us a chance to win Sometimes youth doesnt look like it is trying because theyre nervous Instead they are trying too har d and get uptight Our team tried hard As negative as people make Saturday night it is one of those things that you have to grow from Q Im glad we have two great QBs My question is are the receivers ha ving any problem adjusting to the different spin on the balls coming from a lefthanded or righthanded QB Dave Stastny Austin BROWN The receivers say the varying spins are not a factor when catch ing the ball They do however say that Chris Simms ball will come a little faster and a little harder than Major Applewhites Q The Longhorns are obviously going to play a lot of freshmen this yea r What are the rules on redshirting a player after the season starts I know that a player can apply for a redshirt for medical reasons but can they al so apply for more eligibility or take a redshirt after playing a small amount of time Chad Graham BROWN No Once a freshman plays in a game even for one play and he d oes not suffer a seasonending injury the chance for a redshirt is out the window IMAGE Jermain Anderson Q Have the coaches given any consideration to moving Jermain Anderson b ack to linebacker If I remember correctly he played LB in high school at Texa s City He seems to still have good speed but also a problem putting on the necessary weight to play defensive end It just seems like he might be bett er suited for the outside linebacker rotation especially considering the progress made by young defensive ends like Kalen Thornton Cole Pittman and Adam Doiron Micah Hurt BROWN Coaches dont think Anderson has the speed to play linebacker They are pleased with the depth at linebacker as well They like Andersons instincts as a pass rusher They are still working on his ability to stop t he run Q My husband wanted me to write and request that you put the Longhorn football schedule in your letter each week My husband Mark is a diehard Texan who was transferred to Oklahoma in Through thick and thin he h as remained a loyal Longhorn fan and taken a lot of harassment from the Sooner fans Of course he does his fair share and probably more of bragging abo ut the Longhorns Barbara and Mark Harper BROWN As far as the schedule UTs remaining games are Sept home vs Houston at pm on Fox Sept home vs Oklahoma State at am on ABC Oct in Dallas vs Oklahoma TBA Oct at Colorado TBA Oct home vs Missouri TBA Oct home vs Baylor TBA Nov at Texas Tech TBA Nov at Kansas TBA Nov home vs Texas Aat pm on ABC Since you all have access to the Internet log onto UTs sports Web site texassportscom and learn what radio stations broadcast the game in your area And you can read The Dallas Morning News online every day at dallasnewscom Q This may take some research but I was wondering if you could tell me the number of UT players in the NFL and the status of some recent grads ie hows Cedric Woodard Aaron Humphrey Kwame Cavil Thanks BROWN The Big office just released a list of former Texas players in the NFL However it includes some players who have been released For example Aaron Humphrey was released after a freeagent tryout with Tampa Bay Chris Smith was released after a freeagent tryout with Washington and Dallas Jay Humphrey also was released after one year with the Minnesota Vikings Kwame Cavil made the Buffalo Bills after going undrafted Anyway here is the list as provided by the Big TEXAS Ben Adams OL Miami Taje Allen DB St Louis Tony Brackens DE Jacksonville Blake Brockermeyer OG Chicago Ricky Brown RB Cincinnati Chris Carter DB New England Kwame Cavil WR Buffalo Phil Dawson KS Cleveland Shane Dronett DL Atlanta Priest Holmes RB Baltimore Aaron Humphrey DE Tampa Bay Jay Humphrey OL Minnesota Derek Lewis TE St Louis Wane McGarity WR Dallas Eric Metcalf WR Carolina Dan Neil OL Denver Roger Roesler OL Cincinnati Chris Smith TE Dallas Winfred Tubbs LB San Francisco Bryant Westbrook DB Detroit Ricky Williams RB New Orleans Cedric Woodard DL Baltimore IMAGE Hodges Mitchell Q Dont know whether you can address any or all of these questions in y our column but Ive seen some unflattering trends in Mack Browns program and wanted your feedback Mack Brown is a great recruiter no argument there However can he motivate It seems like he cant get the team up sometime s and cant adjust the teams mood during a game About offensive coordinator Greg Davis I dont know who is responsible for the offensive line but since it is an offensive group in more ways than on e I put it under him With guys the size that UT has shouldnt even Hodges Mitchell be able to run Who tagged Leonard Davis as a pro Why does Davis love Mitchell Sure he gained plus yards last year but how many of those yards were move the chains type of runs that allowed UT to hold the ball on the ground and protect a lead I thought it was going to be running back by committee but all we have seen is the coaches continuing the same mistake abandoning th e run and using the wrong back for the wrong situations Mitchell can run to the outside but he cannot run through the defensive tackles And even if he does get holes he still will never break through t he linebackers for a TD Why not put Ivan Williams or Kenny Hayter back there with Mitchell and go with a twoback threewide offense You dont lose a receiver as Hodges is a nice smart receiver Other ramblings Is Quentin Jammer really a corner He got beat MANY tim e against Stanford I loved his hitting when he played safety but his injury may have forever changed his game if he cant play safety and cant keep up with opponents wideouts How is the defensive end position shaping up The defensive tackles were all over the field against Stanford but the DEs didnt make much noise What i s up with the blocked punts UT should be really really embarrassed Does Stockton take too long Is he too close to the line Can the line block Ca n anyone at UT block Does Brown ride the officials who are missing holding calls Several tim es the camera caught clear holds by Stanfords line Why on earth would you ru n up the middle on your own goal line against two of the best DTs youll pla y against Andrew Bowen BROWN I think your feelings are shared by many Texas fans who are incredibly pained shocked disappointed angered and hurt by last Saturday s events But in talking to Mack Brown on Tuesday he said its fair to beat the team up for not being able to run the ball But he said to jump on any other part of the team is to rip young inexperienced kids who are still learning what it takes to compete as a topranked team To be fair to Brown he did say repeatedly that his team was overrated a nd needed time to grow into some key positions receiver defensive end fullback and some positions on the offensive line and at corner It probabl y isnt fair to question whether Mack Brown can motivate because his teams di d beat Nebraska twice Oklahoma twice and Texas Aonce If a trend develop s and Texas falls apart the rest of the season there will be a fair question about whether Brown did a good enough job of keeping his teams head screwe d on straight But its typical after losses to want to shred every part of t he team Brown said before the season that as soon as something went wrong the quarterback situation would be blamed And he was right The QBs are still working hard and look for Simms to start this week against Houston There s no question that the Oline is struggling but so are the backs and so are the receivers Brown said only two of the five sacks were the fault of the line He said the other three were caused by miscommunication between Applewhite and the receivers causing Applewhite to hold the ball too long Mitchell was standing too deep in the backfield against Stanford so it was taking him too long to get to the holes The coaches were not happy about that They were yelling at him to move up He should only be yards deep But he was sometimes at yards Mitchell also struggled with some blitz pickup which is uncharacteristic of him So look for Victor Ike Hayter and possibly Williams to get a little time against Houston Coaches are still high on Jammer Again he hasnt played corner much in games after moving from safety But coaches are not thinking of moving him The defensive end position is a big concern with defensive coordinator Carl Reese He is willing to rifle through his whole pile until he finds a coupl e who can really play Cory Redding was better than usual against Stanford B ut that position still needs a lot of work The blocked punt occurred because one player who blocked perfectly on other punts Saturday night failed to block a player coming right up the middle which guarantees doom That play er has been chewed out every which way As far as the penalties there were several questionable calls But Brow n who did a lot of yelling at officials during the Stanford game couldnt sa y anything about it after the game because he would be fined Texas can still have a good season and perhaps having these problem areas pointed out so early will help in that direction Well see if Texas takes this loss constructively or destructively Q Last year at times I saw blazing speed and ability from Cory Redding I know he was considered by many to be the best high school defensive player in the country in Ive waited all offseason to see him explode against teams this year I havent seen it yet Maybe this week against Stanford M y question is why was he moved from his high school position of linebacker where he was dominant into the defensive end role where he seems undersized and average Is Texas that low on defensive line talent It seems our recruiting has been great Please help me understand Hook em Horns Ernie McAnally BROWN Redding told me recently that linebacker is still his first lov e But he said coaches came to him last year and said he could get on the fiel d right away as a defensive end Coaches also feel that his body i s perfect for the DE position Hes tall athletic fast and has long arms I n time coaches feel Redding will develop into an AllAmerica player But the re is no question that he has struggled against the run He made some big play s against Stanford recording six tackles three of them for losses and blocking an extra point attempt He is just a sophomore Over this season a nd the next two years he should only get better Q I was watching the regional telecast of the TCU game today and the announcers stated that TCU had anted up for the Heisman campaign f or LaDainian Tomlinson How much did UT spend on its campaign for Ricky Williams run for the Heisman BROWN Texas didnt spend that much money at all They produced a few postcards a video and a CDROM screen saver to send out to the national media detailing Rickys accomplishments But those costs totaled less than according to UT officials Q Did any of the freshman who did not play in the LouisianaLafayette game play in the Stanford game I am watching to see which ones might be redshirts Mike Smith Houston BROWN According to the participation chart provided at the StanfordT exas game Austin Sendlein was the only freshman to play against the Cardinal wh o did not play against LouisianaLafayette In addition to Sendlein here are the other freshmen who have played so far WRs Roy Williams BJ Johnson a nd Sloan Thomas TE Brock Edwards DE Kalen Thornton CB Nathan Vasher FS Phillip Geiggar and DT Stevie Lee Q Is it true that in Mack Browns four or five head coaching stops hi s teams have yet to win a single conference championship Since UT has lost four out of its last five games wouldnt a loss to Houston this week officially end Mack Browns honeymoon with the alumni notwithstanding his abundant PR program With Brown about to land his third national Top recruiting class I believe fans are going to expect more gridiron victorie s to go with those recruiting victories T Hough BROWN Its true that Brown has yet to win a conference championship i n stints at Appalachian State Tulane North Carolina and now Texas At Appalachian State Tulane and UNC he was taking over absolutely dead programs He took Tulane to a bowl and he had Florida State to deal with i n the Atlantic Coast Conference while at UNC But he took UNC to six bowl gam es in his years at UNC and won four of them A loss to Houston would certainly intensify the frustration of Texas faithful But I think anyone who would be looking to put Brown on the hot seat or rip him if Texas lost to Houston would be overlooking the job he ha s done beating Nebraska twice Oklahoma twice and Texas Aonce in hi s first two seasons here He has also turned Texas back into a destination school for top recruits and brought the UT community back together In addition to all that he has done more good for UT out of the limelight tha n probably most Texas fans realize Brown is now in the same spotlight as Bobby Bowden John Cooper Lloyd C arr Steve Spurrier and Phil Fulmer Any unexpected losses are unforgivable in t he eyes of fans It may take some time for Brown and his team to adjust to tha t UNC fans were pretty hohum about everything the Tar Heels did in football even when they won big Brown wanted to win at a school with huge expectations Hell have to adjust now that it appears Texas will be starti ng out the next few seasons in the Top Q Is Lee Jackson out for the Houston game Marty Bonner BROWN Jackson is out for the Houston game with a hamstring pull suffe red against Stanford He may also miss the Oklahoma State game Mack Brown said this is a bad week to be without Jackson because Houston can throw the ball really well Q Is Ricky Williams jersey being retired at the Oklahoma State game S ept Mark Wilson BROWN Yes Williams No will be retired at that game Williams ha s said he will be there because the New Orleans Saints are off that weekend Host Communications has also just finished a video biography on Williams th at will be available soon Q What did Mack Brown say about the expectations surrounding his team after the loss to Stanford Virginia Blair BROWN Again here are Macks words I said during the preseason tha t we were overrated I didnt see any reason with the youth the way we finished last year and the inexperience across the board that we should have been a Top football team One of the great things about Texas is that you receiv e a tremendous amount of attention and publicity but in some cases people wa nt to push you too fast to get to the top I think that we were in that positi on and expectations got out of hand I knew that we would have a difficult gam e at Stanford and that it would be a tough game to win I also didnt think that we deserved to be ranked fifth in the country Our current rank within the Top is much more fitting for where we are today If you received this newsletter from a friend and would like to subscri be sign up at Newsletter Registration To find or change your password modify your account or unsubscribe fro

looking at again Keep reading to the bottom of the page dont stop at the feetYoull see THINGS ARENT ALWAYS WHAT THEY SEEM Two traveling angels stopped to spend the night in the home of a wealthy family The family was rude and refused to let the angels stay in the mansions guest room Instead the angels were given a small space in the cold basement As they made their bed on the hard floor the older angel saw a hole in the wall and repaired it When the younger angel asked why the older angel replied Things arent always what they seem The next night the pair came to rest at the house of a very poor but very hospitable farmer and his wife After sharing what little food they had the couple let the angels sleep in their bed where they could have a good nights rest When the sun came up the next morning the angels found the farmer and his wife in tears Their only cow whose milk had been their sole income lay dead in the field The younger angel was infuriated and asked the older angel How could you have let this happen The first man had everything yet you helped him she accused The second family had little but was willing to share everything and you let the cow die Things arent always what they seem the older angel replied When we stayed in the basement of the mansion I noticed there was gold stored in that hole in the wall Since the owner was so obsessed with greed and unwilling to share his good fortune I sealed the wall so he wouldnt find it Then last night as we slept in the farmers bed the angel of death came for his wife I gave him the cow instead Things arent always what they seem Sometimes that is exactly what happens when things dont turn out the way they should If you have faith you just need to trust that every outcome is always to your advantage You might not know it until some time later Oooo Some people come into our lives and quickly go oooO Some people become friends and stay awhile leaving beautiful Oooo footprints on our hearts oooO and we are
