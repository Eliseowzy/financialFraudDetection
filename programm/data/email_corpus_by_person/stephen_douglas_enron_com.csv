number is a product of collective judgment The Tax Department was influenced in in creasing the reserve by a desire to be conservative with respect to this pa rticular tax risk on this particular

nronXgate ccLouise CT SubjectFW Tax reserve on Allegheny Peakers Wes attached is the explanation for the Allegheny tax reserve I do not k now why it was increased when it was It was my understanding that the res erve had been quantified by Matt Gockerman in my group and requested some t ime ago and that Don and the commercial leads were aware of this This may be coming across as an increase when in reality it is simply properly book ing currently that which was previously expected said differently without the disposition we would have spread the tax over time and with the dispos ition it became necessary to accelerate it as reflected in the tax reserve As always I have asked that only the absolutely necessary amount be res erved Please call me at ext to further discuss this matter Best regards Steve Original Message From Douglas Stephen H SentMonday April PM ToKitchen Louise SubjectRE Tax reserve on Allegheny Peakers The reserve referred to relates to Sales and Use tax SalesUse tax liab ility related to the purchase and use by the Peaker project companies of va rious equipment ie turbines in Illinois and transformers in Tennessee a nd Indiana used to construct the Peaker facilities in Illinois Indiana an d Tennessee Enron bears this tax obligation under the Sales Agreement pur suant to which we sold the Peakers to Allegheny effectively this tax liab ility is a preacquisition date tax liability that we as the seller are responsible for Typically the equipment used to construct the Peakers would be assessed SalesUse tax when purchased by the Project company that built the respective Peaker and that tax would effectively be passed on to the buyer in a sale such as that to Allegheny The EWS Tax Department stru ctured the acquisition of the respective equipment to either avoid the Sale sUse tax or to spread the cost of such tax over time for example a sales leaseback strategy was employed in Illinois to spread the cost of the Sale sUse tax over many years as lease payments are made rather than pay it up front Ultimately we benefitted from this since we did not use as much c ash in constructing the Peakers and earned more from the disposition of the Peakers than we otherwise would have since the counterparty would have an d we believe did in the specific case of Allegheny modelled the cost of th e Peakers as including the full current payment of such SalesUse tax Tha t said we have requested that a portion of the disposition proceeds from t he sale of the Peakers be reserved until the applicable statute of limitati ons related to the types of strategies that were employed to achieve the ab ove described results expires since there is risk that our position could b e challenged and if challenged there is a risk that we would
