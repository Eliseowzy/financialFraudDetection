Cherry Brian Sent Thursday October PM To Williams Ray Johnson Kirk Thomas Dan CGT Dir Katz Michael Campbell Benjamin Bellenger Geoffrey Berkovitz Trista Gee Dennis Buchner Les Lindh Frank Law Litteneker Randall Law Niven Andrew Law Cc Guliasi Les Hapner Dede Subject Commissioner Lynch Comments at the CCPUC Meeting on Monday At Mondays CCPUC conference Commissioner Lynch outlined objectives and priorities as President of the Commission I thought you might be interested in her remarks especially as they relate to our Gas Accord II settlement efforts Commissioner Lynch identified several general objectives she would pursue as Commission President Decisionmaking under her leadership will be arrived at based upon well developed facts and arguments not theories The Commission will rely on legal principles for guidance not ideology Future decisions must recognize the diversity of society interests not just those of the applicants and interveners The Commission will take proactive steps to generate community support especially among those groups who have been overlooked in the past The Commission must understand and account for their decisions in the real world Therefore decisions will not be voted out until the Commission has evaluated their impact in the broader sense on the community on the state on the general welfare The Commissions priorities described below need to be better articulated and communicated to all of Californias citizens With those objectives stated Commissioner Lynch went on to describe her personal priorities at the Commission The public interest is the paramount and guiding principle of her administration Commissioner Lynch emphasized that decisions must benefit all Californians and stated that recent decisions havent reflected this She noted that many groups are underrepresented such as environmentalists and stated that decisionmakers bear a responsibility to inject the public interest into the decisions of those not represented before the Commission Taking a swipe at the Republican majority she noted that recent Commissions have been enamored with competition To her competition is merely a tool not an end unto itself Had the impact of electric competition been better understood decisions would have been made differently Certain practices at the Commission must change especially those involving a utilities right to withdraw an Advice Letter after submittal Without mentioning names although many concluded she was aiming at Sempras withdrawal of a number of ALs over the last few months Commissioner Lynch stated that utilities should not be allowed to withdraw an AL to avoid a draft resolution they dont like She stated that draft resolutions must be voted out and not be subject to veto by the utilities She stated that the Commission was looking at changing the General Order allowing utilities their right to withdraw ALs Settlement rules do not allow the Commission to make sure that the public interest is considered sufficiently According to Commissioner Lynch under the current settlement rules nonsettling parties have the burden of proving that a settlement is not in the public interest She wants to change the settlement rules to reverse that concept applicants must bear the burden of proving settlements truly are in the public interest Specifically she does not like the fact that the settlement rules bar the public or nonsettling parties from settlement conferences As such she believes settlements halt the development of an evidentiary record and present facts to the Commission that cannot be tested Going further Commissioner Lynch stated that she was not interested in maintaining the peace and would reverse settlements contrary to the public interest without defining the public interest She also stated that her staff was currently working on revisions to the settlement rules The Commission will be less reactive and more proactive That is the Commission cannot rely upon parties to articulate pressing issues nor can the Commission rely on parties to resolve issues on a piecemeal basis Commissioner Lynchs recommended solution is that there needs to be more consolidated dockets and decisions to prevent disjointed choppy decisions from being made In an effort to make the Commission be more proactive Commissioner Lynch stated that we will see more OII and OIRs coming out of her administration The Commission will follow the law as written period Commissioner Lynch stated that there was no need for the Commission to interpret the law Her discussion here focused on mergers and acquisitions She stated that out of the last mergeracquisition decisions voted by the Commission approved the mergeracquisition request She believes that this proves the Commission is relying upon expediency at the expense of the law with regards to transfers of control My notes are fuzzy here so perhaps someone else who attended can better articulate her position Decisions must be based upon facts not theories or convictions Electric restructuring was again held out as the prime example of a Commission decision focused on convictions based upon ideological theories not factbased thinking Commissioner Lynch stated that she wanted to hear reasoned arguments not excuses or vague claims of financial distress She stated that she will take real claims of financial distress seriously but they must be backed up by concrete evidence not rhetoric and anecdotes although Billion seems pretty concrete to meeditors note She also stated that she would not tolerate an absence of a sufficient evidentiary record nor would she allow lobbying to interfere with the process Robust records and clearly articulated briefs must be the norm if parties want the Commission to act upon their claims Consumer protection is PARAMOUNT Commissioner Lynch stated that she supports the Telco Bill of Rights and would like to see it applied across industries She once again stated that competition can never assure that customers will get what they really need Therefore the Commission needs to extend its hand to local communitybased organizations for input into the decisionmaking process She also stated that consumer abuse in any form should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law by the Commission and the Courts Its a lot to think about especially as we move forward in our Gas Accord II settlement discussions

summary is helpful in giving you a sense of the FERC proceedings as of now CPUC The CPUC strongly supports SDGEs Emergency Request The CPUC says It is critical that the FERC act immediately to address this natural gas crisis before California consumers are subjected to further unjust and unreasonable natural gas rates CPUC Intervention p The CPUC notes the snowballing effect of high gas prices on electricity prices in California and also asks FERC to take action against the El Paso Merchant Energy capacity deal referring to the CPUCs related complaint in FERC Docket No RP The CPUC asks FERC to act immediately on SDGEs Emergency Request before the coming winter heating season SoCalGas SoCalGas supports SDGEs Emergency Request According to SoCalGas market developments occurring since SDGEs Request was filed last week document a worsening of the already severe conditions cited by SDGE SoCalGas Intervention p Leprino Foods Leprino a large dairy processor cheese maker located in PGEs northern California service area supports SDGEs Emergency Request Like the CPUC comments above the Leprino intervention asks FERC to act soon on the pending CPUC complaint regarding the El Paso Merchant Energy transaction Enron Enron asks FERC to deny SDGEs request claiming that the alleged connection between recent high prices for delivered gas and secondary market prices for released capacity is demonstrably false Enron Intervention p Enron argues that there has been a low level of activity in capacity release markets lately and that prices for releases have been at or below the pipelines asbilled rates Id at Enron accuses SDGE of attempting to deflect blame that rightfully attaches to SDGEs own supply acquisition strategy Id at Enron accuses SDGE of failing to take advantage of storage opportunities and hedging instruments and says that SDGE as on the electric side has been guilty of reckless reliance on the spot market too little hedging through forward contracting and inadequate development of priceresponsive demand Id at Enron challenges SDGEs conclusion that markets are not workably competitive Id pp Enron submits that the best remedy is to let the markets work Id p Finally Enron says the remedy SDGE has proposed wont work in any event One of two things will occur if SDGE prevails The commodity will go to other markets that place a higher value on gas or the California markets will find ways to circumvent the new caps which is easily accomplished Id p Price caps simply do not work Id p Enron also questions whether FERC has legal authority to impose price caps Id pp Duke Energy Trading DETM asks FERC to postpone any action on price caps for capacity release at least until after the current winter heating season DETM asserts there is a lack of evidentiary support for SDGEs position regarding market disfunction According to DETM high prices do not necessarily equate with market disfunction DETM Intervention p DETM also suggests that if price caps are imposed on the pipelines serving California marketers will simply sell their gas in other markets where price caps do not exist which could lead to gas shortages in California Dynegy Although expressing some sympathy for SDGEs position Dynegy opposes the Emergency Request According to Dynegy Contrary to the rhetoric that continues to swirl around these markets this is not a situation where marketers are simply getting rich gouging customers Dynegy Intervention p Dynegy contends that Changing market rules again and again has not solved the problem in power in the Western markets and will not solve the problem with respect to gas Id p Squeezing balloons does not work Id p Dynegy encourages a slow approach and asks FERC not to engage in a rush to judgment in response to SDGEs Emergency Request Id p NYMEX Like the marketers whose comments are summarized above NYMEX opposes SDGEs Emergency Request and argues that FERC should allow the market to work freely NYMEX says that nowhere does SDGE attempt to produce any any empirical or anecdotal evidence of anticompetitive actions on the part of any market participant NYMEX Intervention p NYMEX urges that before starting down the road of reregulation of the natural gas market the Commission should consider carefully the dangers that lay ahead as evidenced by the California electric experience Id According to NYMEX if FERC were to grant SDGEs Emergency Request it would drastically and dramatically reverse FERCs long standing commitment to competition as the determinant of prices for natural gas on a commodity basis Id p Indicated Producers Exxon Texaco et al Producers oppose SDGEs Emergency Petition They protest the filing arguing that The Commission should resist calls for hasty politically expedient actions to do something about the energy problem in California and instead embark on a course to adopt fair and effective solutions to the real problems that exist regarding pipeline capacity serving California Producers Comments p Reliant Gas Marketing Like the other marketers Reliant Marketing protests SDGEs Request and asks FERC to reject it According to Reliant Prevailing natural gas prices in California and for SDGE at this time appear to be a function of market dynamics inadequate supply for a growing demand Reliant Protest p Reliant cites the lack of infrastructure to serve California gas demand and faults the California gas utilities for opposing FERC interstate pipeline projects to the State Id p Reliant urges FERC not to abandon its decision in Order to remove price caps on shortterm capacity releases Id pp cpucintervenpdf SoCalGas Interventiondoc enroncommentspdf dukeintervenpdf dynegyintervenpdf nymexintervenpdf reliantintervenpdf cpucintervenpdf SoCalGas Interventiondoc

News February Here is todays FERC Daily News Electronic versions of the entries are available by sending me an email For utility employees note that a copy of this document is automatically sent to the PGE Document RetentionCPUC central repository on behalf of the sender and all recipients SPECIAL NOTE o Chairman Hebert Testimony Attached is the Testimony of FERC Chairman Curt Hebert before the House of Representatives Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality of the Energy and Commerce Committee His testimon y focused on natural gas issues and the role of natural gas in national ener gy policy The Chairman states that one of his top priorities is to ensure that needed energy infrastructure is built He pledges that he will do everything in his power to ensure that the Commission quickly processes certificate applications for new pipeline projects that bring newly developed gas supplies to market and which eliminate gas transportation bottlenecks He does though indicate that to the extent transportation bottlenecks reside within state jurisdiction the states must similarly undertake to improve their infrastructure With respect to California he indicated that the Commission is responding as quickly as possible to any applications to construct new capacity noting three certificate approvals in the last seven months for Mcfday On the same page he exhort s California officials to expedite considerations of proposals to remove gas transportation bottlenecks within the state which he believes contributed to recent high prices in the Southern California area Touching on his bos s theme the Chairman also speaks to the need for constructing a natural gas pipeline from the North Slope of Alaska to the lower states SUBSTANTIVE ISSUANCES o Kern River Gas Transmission Company and Northwest Pipeline Docket No RP and RP not consolidated ORDERs ON COMPLIANCE FILINGs Issued February The Commission issued an Ord er in each of the Williams Pipeline Companies proceedings limiting their proposals to restrict customers to a pro rata distribution of partial capacity turnbacks The Commission had required in an earlier Order th at the pipelines file support for their requirement that a shipper reducing i ts capacity in part do so on a pro rata basis across all delivery points Shippers had objected and in the Order issued in response to the Complian ce filings the Commission firmly rejected the pro rata reduction requirement The Commission agreed with the intervenors comments however finding that Kerns requirement for pro rata reductions of receipt and delivery poin t entitlements in capacity reduction situations could lead to unreasonable results and is contrary to flexibility in Kerns existing tariff and Commission policy The Commission specifically rejected the pipelines claim that allowing varied reductions would result in cherry picking and distinguished this issue from the FERCs decision not to enhance shipper ROFR rights by allowing geographic segmentation in Order No In the Northwest Pipeline Order the Commission made a similar finding rejecting the pro rata restrictions proposed also for capacity reductions The Commission also rejected the argument that allowing shippers greater flexibility would result in lost revenues and cost shifts Although Northwest may find it more challenging to market turnedback capacity and unused capacity rather than allowing customers to maximize their use of existing contracts Northwest cannot show that it would face any immediate loss of revenue FERC stated FERC did acknowledge that operational problems might provide a valid objection by the pipeline In both cases because the pipelines employed a postage stamp rate structure the custome r s use of flexibility in distributing partial reductions would not reduce pipeline revenues the Commission concluded In both dockets FERC supported the pipelines retention of pro rata reductions in aggregate maximum daily delivery obligations accepting the explanation that the requirement is to maintain historic contract relationships in reductio ns situations and to prevent shippers from increasing flexibility under specific contracts at the expense of other shippers OTHER PROCEDURAL NOTICES and ORDERS o Sempra Energy Docket No ER NOTICE OF FILING February On February Sempra Energy filed a request for withdrawal of its February Petition for Waivers and Blanket approvals in its filing for market based rate authority for the wholesale sale of electric power and ancillary services for of the output of the El Dorado generating

announced POR from this weeks Natural Gas Week Article credits PGE with a plan that pays all valid creditors and questions if SCE and Davis can actually push through a political bailout for SCE by way of another special session as requested by Gov Davis Shawn Cooper Natural Gas Week PGE Files Reorganization Plan Edison Further Toward the Brink September Page California utility Pacific Gas Electric PGE announced their reorganization plan last week to the applause of its creditors Such applause may prove to be an annoying buzz to Gov Gray Davis who was unable to coerce a bailout plan for Southern California Edison SCE from the state legislature Pacific Gas Electrics announcement is likely to undermine his efforts to do so Under the plan the PGE utility will be separated from PGE Corp the parent corporation into a standalone company that will not be affiliated with the parent The utility will still run its retail electric and natural gas operations but the parent company will take control of electric generation electric transmission and natural gas transmission operations Those three sectors will be operated by PGE as three distinct businesses The electric transmission business will own and operate some miles of transmission assets The gas transmission business will operate the former utility gas operations including miles of transmission pipelines and three gas storage facilities The generation company will control MW including the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant Once the utility assets are reorganized PGE said that it will be able to issue debt that it will use to combine with new financing at Pacific Gas Electric to pay its creditor claims of some billion The plan will also restructure some existing debt and use about billion in onhand cash to meet its obligations PGE said that all of its creditor claims will be met under the plan through a combination of billion cash and billion longterm debt notes Creditors with claims of or less will receive cash payments for the full amount of their claims on the effective date of the plan along with most secured creditors Unsecured creditors with allowed claims in excess of the threshold will be paid cash and in notes The division of the utility will still result in PGE being regulated by the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC but the new businesses under parent PGE will be under the oversight of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC The move is likely a conscious decision to get as much of the company from under the thumb of the state PGE has been chastised by Davis for its refusal to follow the path of SCE which opted for a stateled restructuring plan Instead they filed for bankruptcy protection with the courts Both PGE and SCE racked up enormous debts under Californias deregulation plan since they were forced to cover high spot market power purchases that they could not recover through their retail rates which the state froze However PGE refused to play along with Daviss electricity plans which is starting to look like the smart decision SCE signed a memorandum of understanding with Gov Davis that said the state legislature would create a viable bailout plan for the utility which has some billion in debt Unfortunately after much political wrangling the legislature was unable to pass a bill before the end of its session on Sept Davis has said that he will call them back for a special session of the legislature at the beginning of October but that may not be in time for the ailing utility Published reports from last week said that two SCE creditors Reliant Energy and Mirant may try to force the company into involuntary bankruptcy A spokesman for Reliant said that he could not comment on the report SCE is refusing to go down the bankruptcy path however We do not intend to file voluntary bankruptcy said Ted Craver chief financial officer for SECs parent company Edison International during a conference call last week We ask our creditors to continue to forbear and work with us We will vigorously oppose any involuntary bankruptcy petition he said Craver however did admit that the chances the company would have to declare bankruptcy had grown much higher Christian Schmollinger

POR The story of the companys announced POR from this weeks Natural Gas Week Article credits PGE with a plan that pays all valid creditors and questions if SCE and Davis can actually push through a political bailout for SCE by way of another special session as requested by Gov Davis Shawn Cooper Natural Gas Week PGE Files Reorganization Plan Edison Further Toward the Brink September Page California utility Pacific Gas Electric PGE announced their reorganization plan last week to the applause of its creditors Such applause may prove to be an annoying buzz to Gov Gray Davis who was unable to coerce a bailout plan for Southern California Edison SCE from the state legislature Pacific Gas Electrics announcement is likely to undermine his efforts to do so Under the plan the PGE utility will be separated from PGE Corp the parent corporation into a standalone company that will not be affiliated with the parent The utility will still run its retail electric and natural gas operations but the parent company will take control of electric generation electric transmission and natural gas transmission operations Those three sectors will be operated by PGE as three distinct businesses The electric transmission business will own and operate some miles of transmission assets The gas transmission business will operate the former utility gas operations including miles of transmission pipelines and three gas storage facilities The generation company will control MW including the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant Once the utility assets are reorganized PGE said that it will be able to issue debt that it will use to combine with new financing at Pacific Gas Electric to pay its creditor claims of some billion The plan will also restructure some existing debt and use about billion in onhand cash to meet its obligations PGE said that all of its creditor claims will be met under the plan through a combination of billion cash and billion longterm debt notes Creditors with claims of or less will receive cash payments for the full amount of their claims on the effective date of the plan along with most secured creditors Unsecured creditors with allowed claims in excess of the threshold will be paid cash and in notes The division of the utility will still result in PGE being regulated by the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC but the new businesses under parent PGE will be under the oversight of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC The move is likely a conscious decision to get as much of the company from under the thumb of the state PGE has been chastised by Davis for its refusal to follow the path of SCE which opted for a stateled restructuring plan Instead they filed for bankruptcy protection with the courts Both PGE and SCE racked up enormous debts under Californias deregulation plan since they were forced to cover high spot market power purchases that they could not recover through their retail rates which the state froze However PGE refused to play along with Daviss electricity plans which is starting to look like the smart decision SCE signed a memorandum of understanding with Gov Davis that said the state legislature would create a viable bailout plan for the utility which has some billion in debt Unfortunately after much political wrangling the legislature was unable to pass a bill before the end of its session on Sept Davis has said that he will call them back for a special session of the legislature at the beginning of October but that may not be in time for the ailing utility Published reports from last week said that two SCE creditors Reliant Energy and Mirant may try to force the company into involuntary bankruptcy A spokesman for Reliant said that he could not comment on the report SCE is refusing to go down the bankruptcy path however We do not intend to file voluntary bankruptcy said Ted Craver chief financial officer for SECs parent company Edison International during a conference call last week We ask our creditors to continue to forbear and work with us We will vigorously oppose any involuntary bankruptcy petition he said Craver however did admit that the chances the company would have to declare bankruptcy had grown much higher Christian Schmollinger

Stelling Terry Swanson Brian Tremayne Jon Woo Linda Subject Elec Daily PGEs brilliant reorganization Editorial on the companys announced POR is the lead story in todays Electricity Daily Shawn Cooper Original Message Electricity Daily Tuesday September Analysis PGEs Brilliant Reorganization The reorganization plan that PGE Corp and Pacific Gas and Electric filed in US Bankruptcy Court last week ED Sept is brilliant in its simplicity It essentially moves as much of the companys hard assets as possible away from Californias notoriously businessaverse politicians and regulators and to the more predictable feds That step itself makes the businesses creditworthy because it creates a predictable revenue stream The one element of the business that cant be severed from the jurisdiction of the rapacious California Public Utilities Commission the retail electricity and gas distribution utility will be so fenced in by federallyapproved wholesale contracts that the CPUC will have no choice but to pass through costs preordained as just and reasonable or face certain loss in the courts In the meantime PGEs filed rate case continues in court with every likelihood of success further limiting the damage that the demented regulators can impose PGEs hydro system is already subject to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulation although many consumer groups in the state dont seem to understand that fact Under the reorganization plan the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant would become a wholesale provider with a FERCapproved tariff PGEs pipeline system historically a Hinshaw pipeline not subject to federal jurisdiction would become a traditional interstate system under FERC jurisdiction The politicians and regulators quickly recognized what PGE would do and have been gnashing their teeth furiously since the announcement But it appears there is little they can do other than lament The plan would not raise rates so the court has no reason to consult with the CPUC And federal law clearly trumps state law when it comes to protecting creditors The fact that the creditors are lined up behind the reorganization plan is the worst news the state could hear According to bankruptcy experts it is highly unlikely that the court would reject a plan that the creditors endorse Because they get all their money paid with interest the creditors are largely made whole the largest will have to take some notes as part of the repayment Will the bankruptcy reorganization plan lead Southern California Edison into bankruptcy There are two lines of argument on this question both valid One suggests that the plan will lead Gov Gray Davis and the backers of his Edison bailout to push harder for quick action lest Edison decide it can do better in court than it can in the Legislature The other line argues that PGEs plan will lead Edisons creditors to put the utility quickly into Chapter involuntarily The Reuters news service last week reported that power generators Mirant Corp and Reliant Energy are looking for a third creditor to push the company into involuntary bankruptcy Sources indicate that the city of Long Beach may be the third creditor needed to push the states second largest utility into bankruptcy Ted Craver chief financial officer of Edison International the utilitys parent told a conference call to creditors last week that the company would not voluntarily seek bankruptcy protection and would vigorously oppose any involuntary bankruptcy petition But under bankruptcy law according to legal experts once the creditors file there is little Edison could do In addition the unveiling of the PGE plan last Thursday will embolden Republicans in the Legislature and perhaps some Democrats to put a rescue package for SCE on hold The PGE filing has much to recommend itself to both Republican and Democratic legislators It does not raise retail rates It does not involve any form of a state bailout of the utility It provides a clear path for the state to get out of the energy procurement business Kennedy Maize

and priorities as President of the Commission I thought you might be interested in her remarks especially as they relate to our Gas Accord II settlement efforts Commissioner Lynch identified several general objectives she would pursue as Commission President Decisionmaking under her leadership will be arrived at based upon well developed facts and arguments not theories The Commission will rely on legal principles for guidance not ideology Future decisions must recognize the diversity of society interests not just those of the applicants and interveners The Commission will take proactive steps to generate community support especially among those groups who have been overlooked in the past The Commission must understand and account for their decisions in the real world Therefore decisions will not be voted out until the Commission has evaluated their impact in the broader sense on the community on the state on the general welfare The Commissions priorities described below need to be better articulated and communicated to all of Californias citizens With those objectives stated Commissioner Lynch went on to describe her personal priorities at the Commission The public interest is the paramount and guiding principle of her administration Commissioner Lynch emphasized that decisions must benefit all Californians and stated that recent decisions havent reflected this She noted that many groups are underrepresented such as environmentalists and stated that decisionmakers bear a responsibility to inject the public interest into the decisions of those not represented before the Commission Taking a swipe at the Republican majority she noted that recent Commissions have been enamored with competition To her competition is merely a tool not an end unto itself Had the impact of electric competition been better understood decisions would have been made differently Certain practices at the Commission must change especially those involving a utilities right to withdraw an Advice Letter after submittal Without mentioning names although many concluded she was aiming at Sempras withdrawal of a number of ALs over the last few months Commissioner Lynch stated that utilities should not be allowed to withdraw an AL to avoid a draft resolution they dont like She stated that draft resolutions must be voted out and not be subject to veto by the utilities She stated that the Commission was looking at changing the General Order allowing utilities their right to withdraw ALs Settlement rules do not allow the Commission to make sure that the public interest is considered sufficiently According to Commissioner Lynch under the current settlement rules nonsettling parties have the burden of proving that a settlement is not in the public interest She wants to change the settlement rules to reverse that concept applicants must bear the burden of proving settlements truly are in the public interest Specifically she does not like the fact that the settlement rules bar the public or nonsettling parties from settlement conferences As such she believes settlements halt the development of an evidentiary record and present facts to the Commission that cannot be tested Going further Commissioner Lynch stated that she was not interested in maintaining the peace and would reverse settlements contrary to the public interest without defining the public interest She also stated that her staff was currently working on revisions to the settlement rules The Commission will be less reactive and more proactive That is the Commission cannot rely upon parties to articulate pressing issues nor can the Commission rely on parties to resolve issues on a piecemeal basis Commissioner Lynchs recommended solution is that there needs to be more consolidated dockets and decisions to prevent disjointed choppy decisions from being made In an effort to make the Commission be more proactive Commissioner Lynch stated that we will see more OII and OIRs coming out of her administration The Commission will follow the law as written period Commissioner Lynch stated that there was no need for the Commission to interpret the law Her discussion here focused on mergers and acquisitions She stated that out of the last mergeracquisition decisions voted by the Commission approved the mergeracquisition request She believes that this proves the Commission is relying upon expediency at the expense of the law with regards to transfers of control My notes are fuzzy here so perhaps someone else who attended can better articulate her position Decisions must be based upon facts not theories or convictions Electric restructuring was again held out as the prime example of a Commission decision focused on convictions based upon ideological theories not factbased thinking Commissioner Lynch stated that she wanted to hear reasoned arguments not excuses or vague claims of financial distress She stated that she will take real claims of financial distress seriously but they must be backed up by concrete evidence not rhetoric and anecdotes although Billion seems pretty concrete to meeditors note She also stated that she would not tolerate an absence of a sufficient evidentiary record nor would she allow lobbying to interfere with the process Robust records and clearly articulated briefs must be the norm if parties want the Commission to act upon their claims Consumer protection is PARAMOUNT Commissioner Lynch stated that she supports the Telco Bill of Rights and would like to see it applied across industries She once again stated that competition can never assure that customers will get what they really need Therefore the Commission needs to extend its hand to local communitybased organizations for input into the decisionmaking process She also stated that consumer abuse in any form should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law by the Commission and the Courts Its a lot to think about especially as we move forward in our Gas Accord II settlement discussions

the PGE Document RetentionCPUC central repository on behalf of the sender and all recipients SPECIAL NOTE o Chairman Hebert Testimony Attached is the Testimony of FERC Chairman Curt Hebert before the House of Representatives Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality of the Energy and Commerce Committee His testimon y focused on natural gas issues and the role of natural gas in national ener gy policy The Chairman states that one of his top priorities is to ensure that needed energy infrastructure is built He pledges that he will do everything in his power to ensure that the Commission quickly processes certificate applications for new pipeline projects that bring newly developed gas supplies to market and which eliminate gas transportation bottlenecks He does though indicate that to the extent transportation bottlenecks reside within state jurisdiction the states must similarly undertake to improve their infrastructure With respect to California he indicated that the Commission is responding as quickly as possible to any applications to construct new capacity noting three certificate approvals in the last seven months for Mcfday On the same page he exhort s California officials to expedite considerations of proposals to remove gas transportation bottlenecks within the state which he believes contributed to recent high prices in the Southern California area Touching on his bos s theme the Chairman also speaks to the need for constructing a natural gas pipeline from the North Slope of Alaska to the lower states SUBSTANTIVE ISSUANCES o Kern River Gas Transmission Company and Northwest Pipeline Docket No RP and RP not consolidated ORDERs ON COMPLIANCE FILINGs Issued February The Commission issued an Ord er in each of the Williams Pipeline Companies proceedings limiting their proposals to restrict customers to a pro rata distribution of partial capacity turnbacks The Commission had required in an earlier Order th at the pipelines file support for their requirement that a shipper reducing i ts capacity in part do so on a pro rata basis across all delivery points Shippers had objected and in the Order issued in response to the Complian ce filings the Commission firmly rejected the pro rata reduction requirement The Commission agreed with the intervenors comments however finding that Kerns requirement for pro rata reductions of receipt and delivery poin t entitlements in capacity reduction situations could lead to unreasonable results and is contrary to flexibility in Kerns existing tariff and Commission policy The Commission specifically rejected the pipelines claim that allowing varied reductions would result in cherry picking and distinguished this issue from the FERCs decision not to enhance shipper ROFR rights by allowing geographic segmentation in Order No In the Northwest Pipeline Order the Commission made a similar finding rejecting the pro rata restrictions proposed also for capacity reductions The Commission also rejected the argument that allowing shippers greater flexibility would result in lost revenues and cost shifts Although Northwest may find it more challenging to market turnedback capacity and unused capacity rather than allowing customers to maximize their use of existing contracts Northwest cannot show that it would face any immediate loss of revenue FERC stated FERC did acknowledge that operational problems might provide a valid objection by the pipeline In both cases because the pipelines employed a postage stamp rate structure the custome r s use of flexibility in distributing partial reductions would not reduce pipeline revenues the Commission concluded In both dockets FERC supported the pipelines retention of pro rata reductions in aggregate maximum daily delivery obligations accepting the explanation that the requirement is to maintain historic contract relationships in reductio ns situations and to prevent shippers from increasing flexibility under specific contracts at the expense of other shippers OTHER PROCEDURAL NOTICES and ORDERS o Sempra Energy Docket No ER NOTICE OF FILING February On February Sempra Energy filed a request for withdrawal of its February

<1148967.1075843769059.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,bkc7@pge.com,2000-12-19 02:54:00,FW SDGE Price Cap Reqst Parties Commentsdont delete it this timethought it might be helpful Its entertaining to see all those who were once behind deregulation at the utilities and Commission run for the exits and switch religions The conversions seem to be overwhelming At least Enron believes what it believes despite its reputation as the antiChrist of the energy industry Original Message From Cherry Brian Sent Tuesday December AM To Dasovich Jeff Subject FW SDGE Price Cap Reqst Parties Comments FYI I hope this summary is helpful in giving you a sense of the FERC proceedings as of now CPUC The CPUC strongly supports SDGEs Emergency Request The CPUC says It is critical that the FERC act immediately to address this natural gas crisis before California consumers are subjected to further unjust and unreasonable natural gas rates CPUC Intervention p The CPUC notes the snowballing effect of high gas prices on electricity prices in California and also asks FERC to take action against the El Paso Merchant Energy capacity deal referring to the CPUCs related complaint in FERC Docket No RP The CPUC asks FERC to act immediately on SDGEs Emergency Request before the coming winter heating season SoCalGas SoCalGas supports SDGEs Emergency Request According to SoCalGas market developments occurring since SDGEs Request was filed last week document a worsening of the already severe conditions cited by SDGE SoCalGas Intervention p Leprino Foods Leprino a large dairy processor cheese maker located in PGEs northern California service area supports SDGEs Emergency Request Like the CPUC comments above the Leprino intervention asks FERC to act soon on the pending CPUC complaint regarding the El Paso Merchant Energy transaction Enron Enron asks FERC to deny SDGEs request claiming that the alleged connection between recent high prices for delivered gas and secondary market prices for released capacity is demonstrably false Enron Intervention p Enron argues that there has been a low level of activity in capacity release markets lately and that prices for releases have been at or below the pipelines asbilled rates Id at Enron accuses SDGE of attempting to deflect blame that rightfully attaches to SDGEs own supply acquisition strategy Id at Enron accuses SDGE of failing to take advantage of storage opportunities and hedging instruments and says that SDGE as on the electric side has been guilty of reckless reliance on the spot market too little hedging through forward contracting and inadequate development of priceresponsive demand Id at Enron challenges SDGEs conclusion that markets are not workably competitive Id pp Enron submits that the best remedy is to let the markets work Id p Finally Enron says the remedy SDGE has proposed wont work in any event One of two things will occur if SDGE prevails The commodity will go to other markets that place a higher value on gas or the California markets will find ways to circumvent the new caps which is easily accomplished Id p Price caps simply do not work Id p Enron also questions whether FERC has legal authority to impose price caps Id pp Duke Energy Trading DETM asks FERC to postpone any action on price caps for capacity release at least until after the current winter heating season DETM asserts there is a lack of evidentiary support for SDGEs position regarding market disfunction According to DETM high prices do not necessarily equate with market disfunction DETM Intervention p DETM also suggests that if price caps are imposed on the pipelines serving California marketers will simply sell their gas in other markets where price caps do not exist which could lead to gas shortages in California Dynegy Although expressing some sympathy for SDGEs position Dynegy opposes the Emergency Request According to Dynegy Contrary to the rhetoric that continues to swirl around these markets this is not a situation where marketers are simply getting rich gouging customers Dynegy Intervention p Dynegy contends that Changing market rules again and again has not solved the problem in power in the Western markets and will not solve the problem with respect to gas Id p Squeezing balloons does not work Id p Dynegy encourages a slow approach and asks FERC not to engage in a rush to judgment in response to SDGEs Emergency Request Id p NYMEX Like the marketers whose comments are summarized above NYMEX opposes SDGEs Emergency Request and argues that FERC should allow the market to work freely NYMEX says that nowhere does SDGE attempt to produce any any empirical or anecdotal evidence of anticompetitive actions on the part of any market participant NYMEX Intervention p NYMEX urges that before starting down the road of reregulation of the natural gas market the Commission should consider carefully the dangers that lay ahead as evidenced by the California electric experience Id According to NYMEX if FERC were to grant SDGEs Emergency Request it would drastically and dramatically reverse FERCs long standing commitment to competition as the determinant of prices for natural gas on a commodity basis Id p Indicated Producers Exxon Texaco et al Producers oppose SDGEs Emergency Petition They protest the filing arguing that The Commission should resist calls for hasty politically expedient actions to do something about the energy problem in California and instead embark on a course to adopt fair and effective solutions to the real problems that exist regarding pipeline capacity serving California Producers Comments p Reliant Gas Marketing Like the other marketers Reliant Marketing protests SDGEs Request and asks FERC to reject it According to Reliant Prevailing natural gas prices in California and for SDGE at this time appear to be a function of market dynamics inadequate supply for a growing demand Reliant Protest p Reliant cites the lack of infrastructure to serve California gas demand and faults the California gas utilities for opposing FERC interstate pipeline projects to the State Id p Reliant urges FERC not to abandon its decision in Order to remove price caps on shortterm capacity releases Id pp cpucintervenpdf SoCalGas Interventiondoc enroncommentspdf dukeintervenpdf dynegyintervenpdf nymexintervenpdf reliantintervenpdf cpucintervenpdf SoCalGas Interventiondoc
