Asian Women Dont get offended its only a jokeobviously written by some bitter Asian guy Caucasian women First date You get to kiss her good night Second date You get to grope all over and make out Third date You get to have sex in the missionary position Then you promise to marry her but will probably abandon the idea Indian women First date You meet the girl Second date You set the wedding date Thrid date The wedding night Chinese women First date You get to buy her an expensive dinner but nothing happens Second date You buy her an even more expensive dinner but nothing happens too Third date You dont even get to the third date and you have already realized nothing is going to happen Vietnamese girls First date What first date no such thing Second date You get married to some girl youve never seen before from overseas Third date You divorce get paid from her family minus a percentage from the guy that set you upbut only after youve helped them all immigrate to Canada or US take your pick Filipino girls First date It took you forever to get a date with this really hot chick of your dreams that has a killer bod but she wont let you even kiss her Second date She takes you to church and everyone thinks youre really cute and such a nice guy but you still havent even kissed her because shes a proper girl Third date You kiss for the first time but miraculously she ends up pregnant and you have to marry her or her cousins brothers uncles etc will cut your penis off and you keep wondering what happened Even more miraculous the kid IS yours Korean girls First date She only went out with you cause she hates the steroidpumped chauvinistic Korean guys that are always after her Second date She flirts with all your friends but ignores you Third date Shes dumped you and is going out with a black guy that is times your size in every way She doesnt even remember who you are neither do her friends so you have no chance of ever going out again with a Korean chick cause

She smiles and says hi as she passes you while shes on her way over to the table with all the ChineseVietnamese gangsters Shell spend the rest of the night lapdancingsmokingtalking with them Youre afraid to look over cause you think youll get shot or jumped in the parking lot You vow to never go there again at least till your friend tells you about this really hot chick he saw there And finally ABC American Born Chinese girls First date She met you in a group of people and you were the only Asian guy in the group In fact you two are the only Asians in the group cause youre both bananas People think you two should go out cause youre both Chinese Second date You go to dim sum but neither of you can order because neither of you speak Chinese The waiters give you really bad service and you dont get any specials Third date It doesnt work out cause youre not Asian enough and she goes back out with some white guy she dated years ago Eventually they get married and the Asian population diminishes Or she decides shes a lesbian and goes out with some really Bohemian white chick thats into alternative music and ends up fighting for some social cause for the rest of her life You marry

RTFPM Date Wed May HOW TO POOP AT WORK Weve all been there but dont like to admit it Weve all kicked back in our cubicles and suddenly felt something brew down below As much as we try to convince ourselves otherwise the WORK POOP is inevitable For those who hate pooping at work following is the Survival Guide for taking a dump at work Memorize these definitions and pooping at work will become a pure pleasure ESCAPEE Definition a fart that slips out while taking a leak at the urinal or forcing a poop in a stall This is usually accompanied by a sudden wave of panic embarrassment This is similar to the hot flash you receive when passing an unseen police car and speeding If you release an escapee do not acknowledge it Pretend it did not happen If you are standing next to the farter in the urinal pretend you did not hear it No one likes an escapee it is uncomfortable for all involved Making a joke or laughing makes both parties feel uneasy JAILBREAK Used in conjunction with ESCAPEE Definition When forcing poop several farts slip out at a machine gun pace This is usually a side effect of diarrhea or a hangover If this should happen do not panic Remain in the stall until everyone has left the bathroom so to spare everyone the awkwardness of what just occurred COURTESY FLUSH Definition The act of flushing the toilet the instant the nose cone of the poop log hits the water and the poop is whisked away to an undisclosed location This reduces the amount of air time the poop has to stink up the bathroom This can help you avoid being caught doing the WALK OF SHAME WALK OF SHAME Definition Walking from the stall to the sink to the door after you have just stunk up the bathroom This can be a very uncomfortable moment if someone walks in and busts you As with all farts it is best to pretend that the smell does not exist Can be avoided with the use of the COURTESY FLUSH OUT OF THE CLOSET POOPER Definition A colleague who poops at work and damn proud of it You will often

most shocking and vulnerable moments that can occur when taking a dump at work If this occurs remain in the stall until the Turd Burglar leaves This way you will avoid all uncomfortable eye contact CAMOCOUGH Definition A phony cough that alerts all new entrants into the bathroom that you are in a stall This can be used to coverup a WATERMELON or to alert potential Turd Burglars Very effective when used in conjunction with an ASTAIRE ASTAIRE Definition A subtle toetap that is used to alert potential Turd Burglars that you are occupying a stall This will remove all doubt that the stall is
