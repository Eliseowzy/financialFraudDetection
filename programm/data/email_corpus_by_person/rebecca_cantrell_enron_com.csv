launches formal hearing in El Paso case A collection of highpowered attorneys crowded a FERC hearing room yesterday for the launch of a formal hearing into allegations of market power abuse by El Paso and its affiliates While a decision is still a way off the presiding judge in the case made it clear that FERC must find a precise way to measure market share in California before ruling on the case The hearing also marked the public release of a controversial market power study by The Brattle Group which was commissioned by Southern California Edison to find evidence of market power abuse by El Paso marketing affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy The Brattle Group said that it found substantial evidence that El Paso manipulated Californias gas market a claim that remains strongly in dispute see story page In an opening statement FERC Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner laid down the parameters for the hearing The burden of proof he said is on the California Public Utilities Commission which filed the original Section complaint against El Paso But once a case is made Wagner added the burden of going forward with evidence to rebut that case shifts to El Paso Merchant and the parties on its side of the table The case originated last year when the CPUC asked FERC to abrogate a series of transportation contracts between El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant The California regulators claimed the capacity award was rigged and further complained of a conspiracy to drive up the delivered price of gas into California In March FERC dismissed the CPUCs claim that there was favoritism in the bidding process for El Paso pipeline capacity GD But the commission also sent the case before an ALJ saying the case raised larger questions of market power According to FERC certain disputed issues of fact need to be examined at a hearing before a decision can be rendered One of the biggest issues will be determining whether the affected market is the entire state of California or whether it is just Southern California The CPUC and Southern California Edison maintain that only the Southern California market is at issue while El Paso argues that the case applies to the entire state The outcome of the case could hinge on that distinction As Wagner noted in his opening remarks The question of the geographic market makes a tremendous difference in how El Paso Merchants market share will be measured and the results If the entire state is considered as a single market said Wagner then El Paso Merchant would have a market share that depending on methodology would range between and But if the CPUCs contention that the market is Southern California holds up he added then El Paso Merchants market share would be between and Finding out whether market power exists also depends on how many players are involved in a particular market Wagner said that the parties need to reach a stipulation among counsel on the number of players In addition he said that he would need a better geographic description of El Paso Merchants capacity holdings and information on the price differential of gas between Northern and Southern California Finally Wagner directed a number of questions to El Paso El Paso Merchant he said should answer the CPUCs question as to why it subscribed for the involved billion cfd for months when it had no market for that amount In addition said Wagner El Paso should show whether it sold in the secondary market shortterm releases of the excess capacity at a price higher than it paid Wagner also heard arguments over the admissibility of certain evidence Given the volume of testimony involved the case will require some legal heavy lifting before a preliminary decision is reached Noting that he received a nearly twofoot high stack of testimony last week Wagner said that reading prehearing briefs and prepared testimony consumed a very beautiful Sunday in Washington RP NH El Paso takes aim at Calif Assembly study In an effort to clear its name in the ongoing California market power controversy El Paso is going on the offensive The company yesterday issued a riposte to claims publicized by California Assembly members and major newspapers that it manipulated California gas prices And it took close aim at The Brattle Group a consultancy that has figured prominently in various investigations into the matter According to El Paso The Brattle Group worked handinhand with a California Assembly subcommittee to pin the blame on El Paso and its subsidiaries for the runup in gas prices in the Golden State El Paso furnished copies of internal Assembly emails as proof that the subcommittee did not seek to conduct an objective investigation As reported in Gas Daily The Brattle Groups study of alleged market power abuse by El Paso marketing arm El Paso Merchant Energy has been exhibit A in California pipeline litigation GD In a study commissioned by Southern California Edison The Brattle Group concluded that El Paso had deliberately manipulated Californiabound pipeline capacity in an effort to drive up the price differential between production basins and the California border Drawing in large part on The Brattle Groups opinion the California Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight recently concluded that El Paso caused the price runup GD Representatives of the Assemblys Democratic majority said The Brattle Group study proved conclusively that the rise in gas prices at the California border was greater than could be accounted for through normal market forces But according to El Paso the subcommittee majority was deliberately wrong The inquiry conducted by the subcommittee said El Paso was a charade that was orchestrated from the beginning to shore up SoCalEds case El Paso has recently obtained through discovery in a proceeding before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission correspondence between the staff for the subcommittee and the paid litigation consultant The Brattle Group for Southern California Edison said El Paso in a statement This communication reveals that the subcommittee majoritys conclusions were predetermined to blame El Paso for Californias failed energy policies The correspondence included apparent requests from subcommittee staff members for help in rebutting El Pasos testimony before the Assembly El Paso interpreted those requests as proof that the subcommittee majority never intended to write an objective report on the matter We are shocked that the subcommittee delegated its responsibilities to SoCalEds consultants said Norma Dunn El Paso senior vice president of communications and government affairs We voluntarily met with subcommittee staff and testified before the subcommittee in good faith under the false premise that the subcommittee was interested in seeking the truth Now we learn that the subcommittee was working at the direction of SoCalEds litigation consultants to support SCEs litigation position Litigation pitting SoCalEd and the California Public Utilities Commission against El Paso is currently under way at FERC see story page Following yesterdays hearing Dunn told Gas Daily that SoCalEd and the CPUC were also waging their campaign against El Paso in the national press The New York Times for instance has published articles that relied on The Brattle Group study and other sealed documents Dunn said it was clear that SoCalEd and the CPUC were using the selective leak of documents to take the case against El Paso to the public Prior to recess in yesterdays hearing FERC Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner issued a reminder of the need to restrict access to protected documents NH NGIs Daily Gas Price Index published May El Paso Calls California Subcommittee Hearing a Sham El Paso Corp claims it was set up by California Assembly members to take the blame for high gas prices in the state It said recent hearings before a subcommittee were a sham and that it was predetermined that El Paso would be accused on wrongdoing in a report approved by the subcommittee majority yesterday While El Paso battled similar accusations at the opening of hearings yesterday before a FERC administrative law judge the company publicly contested the results of the majority report approved of the California Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight which placed the blame on the energy company for skyrocketing gas prices in the state The majority report says El Paso drove up gas prices by withholding pipeline capacity from the market focusing on the same yearold capacity contract between El Pasos pipeline and marketing affiliate that is the subject of FERCs investigation Contrary to the majority report however are the conclusions of a report prepared for the two Republican members of the fivemember subcommittee That document said the hearings produced no conclusive evidence of price manipulation Although the majority report has not been made public it is clear based on accounts of the report and recently uncovered documents that the subcommittee hearing was a sham El Paso said in a statement El Paso released to the public yesterday documents containing email correspondence between staff members of the subcommittee and members of the Brattle Group a paid consulting firm for Southern California Edison The Brattle Group is one of El Pasos main opponents at the hearings this week before FERCs Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner Jr Brattle accuses the company of costing Californians an additional billion in gas costs over the past year The correspondence El Paso released reveals a close relationship between the consulting firm and the subcommittee staff For example a staff member said to Brattle Groups Matthew OLoughlin I cant thank you and Paul enough for your testimony It was beyond expectations the members were highly impressed The chairman asked me if you guys could stay and help us with a second day We could have used it El Paso said the communication reveals that the subcommittee majoritys conclusions were predetermined to blame El Paso for Californias failed energy policies The subcommittee majority was working handinhand with and relying on SCEs consultant the Brattle Group in their socalled analysis El Paso said In communications between the subcommittee staff and SCEs consultant it is clear that SCEs consultant assisted in preparing questions for the hearing and that the subcommittee staff requested assistance from SCEs consultant in preparing the final report That the subcommittee majority never intended to conduct an objective investigation is clear Rather than write an objective report based on the testimony the staff went on to ask SCEs consultant for help in rebutting El Pasos testimony We are shocked that the subcommittee delegated its responsibilities to SCEs consultants said Norma Dunn senior vice president of Communications and Government Affairs for El Paso We voluntarily met with subcommittee staff and testified before the subcommittee in good faith under the false premise that the subcommittee was interested in seeking the truth Now we learn that the subcommittee was working at the direction of SCEs litigation consultants to support SCEs litigation position We are particularly concerned that after coordinating the questions to be asked the Brattle Group testified before the subcommittee as if it were an independent group It is obvious that the subcommittee hearings were a charade that was orchestrated from the beginning Final conclusions were drawn before we had an opportunity to testify and then the final report was leaked to the press instead of provided to us so that we would not have an opportunity to react Dunn said El Paso is confident that once the facts are presented to FERC in hearings this week it will be vindicated However El Paso also faces an uphill battle in Washington The FERC hearings pit El Paso and its subsidiaries against the California Public Utilities Commission and the states two largest investorowned utilities Pacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edison The regulators and the utilities also allege El Paso withheld capacity on its pipelines into the state which in turn pushed prices up If the charges are substantiated FERC Judge Wagner could order the company to refund any money it earned due to price or supply manipulation Such a ruling could have even broader implications because skyrocketing prices for natural gas the single biggest source of fuel for power plants in California obviously contributed to the financial calamity that brought Southern California Edison to its knees and sent Pacific Gas Electric into bankruptcy The details of the charges are well known at this point Critics alleged that El Paso Merchant Energy Gas LP and El Paso Merchant Energy Co received inside information on a discount transportation rate that enabled them to end up the big winners in an open season in February of last year The open season involved Bcfd of firm capacity on El Paso to the California border But in an order on complaint FERC found no merit in the allegations It cleared El Paso of charges that it rigged the bidding for capacity to favor its affiliates Moreover it said there was no evidence that El Paso violated its standards of conduct However the Commission did not dismiss the allegations that El Paso engaged in market and price manipulation It set the market power issue for hearing in March before Judge Wagner and ordered him to provide an initial decision within days see Daily GPI March FERC staff also appears to be hot on El Pasos tracks In testimony submitted last week before Judge Wagner FERC staffs expert witness concluded that El Paso probably exercised market power in the Southern California gas market and drove up gas prices over the past year when pipeline capacity constraints existed FERC Economist Dr Jonathan D Ogur concluded that under certain circumstances El Paso was able to wield market power in the Southern California gas market see Daily GPI May The rise in California natural gas prices is not attributable to El Paso the company said in its statement yesterday but is attributable to the fact that demand for gas has far outstripped supply Evidence presented at the California subcommittee hearings shows that El Paso has consistently utilized its pipeline capacity to ship natural gas to California and has never restricted supply Constraints on gas infrastructure in the state have limited the supply of gas during a time in which demand has risen dramatically the company said

launches formal hearing in El Paso case A collection of highpowered attorneys crowded a FERC hearing room yesterday for the launch of a formal hearing into allegations of market power abuse by El Paso and its affiliates While a decision is still a way off the presiding judge in the case made it clear that FERC must find a precise way to measure market share in California before ruling on the case The hearing also marked the public release of a controversial market power study by The Brattle Group which was commissioned by Southern California Edison to find evidence of market power abuse by El Paso marketing affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy The Brattle Group said that it found substantial evidence that El Paso manipulated Californias gas market a claim that remains strongly in dispute see story page In an opening statement FERC Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner laid down the parameters for the hearing The burden of proof he said is on the California Public Utilities Commission which filed the original Section complaint against El Paso But once a case is made Wagner added the burden of going forward with evidence to rebut that case shifts to El Paso Merchant and the parties on its side of the table The case originated last year when the CPUC asked FERC to abrogate a series of transportation contracts between El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant The California regulators claimed the capacity award was rigged and further complained of a conspiracy to drive up the delivered price of gas into California In March FERC dismissed the CPUCs claim that there was favoritism in the bidding process for El Paso pipeline capacity GD But the commission also sent the case before an ALJ saying the case raised larger questions of market power According to FERC certain disputed issues of fact need to be examined at a hearing before a decision can be rendered One of the biggest issues will be determining whether the affected market is the entire state of California or whether it is just Southern California The CPUC and Southern California Edison maintain that only the Southern California market is at issue while El Paso argues that the case applies to the entire state The outcome of the case could hinge on that distinction As Wagner noted in his opening remarks The question of the geographic market makes a tremendous difference in how El Paso Merchants market share will be measured and the results If the entire state is considered as a single market said Wagner then El Paso Merchant would have a market share that depending on methodology would range between and But if the CPUCs contention that the market is Southern California holds up he added then El Paso Merchants market share would be between and Finding out whether market power exists also depends on how many players are involved in a particular market Wagner said that the parties need to reach a stipulation among counsel on the number of players In addition he said that he would need a better geographic description of El Paso Merchants capacity holdings and information on the price differential of gas between Northern and Southern California Finally Wagner directed a number of questions to El Paso El Paso Merchant he said should answer the CPUCs question as to why it subscribed for the involved billion cfd for months when it had no market for that amount In addition said Wagner El Paso should show whether it sold in the secondary market shortterm releases of the excess capacity at a price higher than it paid Wagner also heard arguments over the admissibility of certain evidence Given the volume of testimony involved the case will require some legal heavy lifting before a preliminary decision is reached Noting that he received a nearly twofoot high stack of testimony last week Wagner said that reading prehearing briefs and prepared testimony consumed a very beautiful Sunday in Washington RP NH El Paso takes aim at Calif Assembly study In an effort to clear its name in the ongoing California market power controversy El Paso is going on the offensive The company yesterday issued a riposte to claims publicized by California Assembly members and major newspapers that it manipulated California gas prices And it took close aim at The Brattle Group a consultancy that has figured prominently in various investigations into the matter According to El Paso The Brattle Group worked handinhand with a California Assembly subcommittee to pin the blame on El Paso and its subsidiaries for the runup in gas prices in the Golden State El Paso furnished copies of internal Assembly emails as proof that the subcommittee did not seek to conduct an objective investigation As reported in Gas Daily The Brattle Groups study of alleged market power abuse by El Paso marketing arm El Paso Merchant Energy has been exhibit A in California pipeline litigation GD In a study commissioned by Southern California Edison The Brattle Group concluded that El Paso had deliberately manipulated Californiabound pipeline capacity in an effort to drive up the price differential between production basins and the California border Drawing in large part on The Brattle Groups opinion the California Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight recently concluded that El Paso caused the price runup GD Representatives of the Assemblys Democratic majority said The Brattle Group study proved conclusively that the rise in gas prices at the California border was greater than could be accounted for through normal market forces But according to El Paso the subcommittee majority was deliberately wrong The inquiry conducted by the subcommittee said El Paso was a charade that was orchestrated from the beginning to shore up SoCalEds case El Paso has recently obtained through discovery in a proceeding before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission correspondence between the staff for the subcommittee and the paid litigation consultant The Brattle Group for Southern California Edison said El Paso in a statement This communication reveals that the subcommittee majoritys conclusions were predetermined to blame El Paso for Californias failed energy policies The correspondence included apparent requests from subcommittee staff members for help in rebutting El Pasos testimony before the Assembly El Paso interpreted those requests as proof that the subcommittee majority never intended to write an objective report on the matter We are shocked that the subcommittee delegated its responsibilities to SoCalEds consultants said Norma Dunn El Paso senior vice president of communications and government affairs We voluntarily met with subcommittee staff and testified before the subcommittee in good faith under the false premise that the subcommittee was interested in seeking the truth Now we learn that the subcommittee was working at the direction of SoCalEds litigation consultants to support SCEs litigation position Litigation pitting SoCalEd and the California Public Utilities Commission against El Paso is currently under way at FERC see story page Following yesterdays hearing Dunn told Gas Daily that SoCalEd and the CPUC were also waging their campaign against El Paso in the national press The New York Times for instance has published articles that relied on The Brattle Group study and other sealed documents Dunn said it was clear that SoCalEd and the CPUC were using the selective leak of documents to take the case against El Paso to the public Prior to recess in yesterdays hearing FERC Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner issued a reminder of the need to restrict access to protected documents NH NGIs Daily Gas Price Index published May El Paso Calls California Subcommittee Hearing a Sham El Paso Corp claims it was set up by California Assembly members to take the blame for high gas prices in the state It said recent hearings before a subcommittee were a sham and that it was predetermined that El Paso would be accused on wrongdoing in a report approved by the subcommittee majority yesterday While El Paso battled similar accusations at the opening of hearings yesterday before a FERC administrative law judge the company publicly contested the results of the majority report approved of the California Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight which placed the blame on the energy company for skyrocketing gas prices in the state The majority report says El Paso drove up gas prices by withholding pipeline capacity from the market focusing on the same yearold capacity contract between El Pasos pipeline and marketing affiliate that is the subject of FERCs investigation Contrary to the majority report however are the conclusions of a report prepared for the two Republican members of the fivemember subcommittee That document said the hearings produced no conclusive evidence of price manipulation Although the majority report has not been made public it is clear based on accounts of the report and recently uncovered documents that the subcommittee hearing was a sham El Paso said in a statement El Paso released to the public yesterday documents containing email correspondence between staff members of the subcommittee and members of the Brattle Group a paid consulting firm for Southern California Edison The Brattle Group is one of El Pasos main opponents at the hearings this week before FERCs Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner Jr Brattle accuses the company of costing Californians an additional billion in gas costs over the past year The correspondence El Paso released reveals a close relationship between the consulting firm and the subcommittee staff For example a staff member said to Brattle Groups Matthew OLoughlin I cant thank you and Paul enough for your testimony It was beyond expectations the members were highly impressed The chairman asked me if you guys could stay and help us with a second day We could have used it El Paso said the communication reveals that the subcommittee majoritys conclusions were predetermined to blame El Paso for Californias failed energy policies The subcommittee majority was working handinhand with and relying on SCEs consultant the Brattle Group in their socalled analysis El Paso said In communications between the subcommittee staff and SCEs consultant it is clear that SCEs consultant assisted in preparing questions for the hearing and that the subcommittee staff requested assistance from SCEs consultant in preparing the final report That the subcommittee majority never intended to conduct an objective investigation is clear Rather than write an objective report based on the testimony the staff went on to ask SCEs consultant for help in rebutting El Pasos testimony We are shocked that the subcommittee delegated its responsibilities to SCEs consultants said Norma Dunn senior vice president of Communications and Government Affairs for El Paso We voluntarily met with subcommittee staff and testified before the subcommittee in good faith under the false premise that the subcommittee was interested in seeking the truth Now we learn that the subcommittee was working at the direction of SCEs litigation consultants to support SCEs litigation position We are particularly concerned that after coordinating the questions to be asked the Brattle Group testified before the subcommittee as if it were an independent group It is obvious that the subcommittee hearings were a charade that was orchestrated from the beginning Final conclusions were drawn before we had an opportunity to testify and then the final report was leaked to the press instead of provided to us so that we would not have an opportunity to react Dunn said El Paso is confident that once the facts are presented to FERC in hearings this week it will be vindicated However El Paso also faces an uphill battle in Washington The FERC hearings pit El Paso and its subsidiaries against the California Public Utilities Commission and the states two largest investorowned utilities Pacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edison The regulators and the utilities also allege El Paso withheld capacity on its pipelines into the state which in turn pushed prices up If the charges are substantiated FERC Judge Wagner could order the company to refund any money it earned due to price or supply manipulation Such a ruling could have even broader implications because skyrocketing prices for natural gas the single biggest source of fuel for power plants in California obviously contributed to the financial calamity that brought Southern California Edison to its knees and sent Pacific Gas Electric into bankruptcy The details of the charges are well known at this point Critics alleged that El Paso Merchant Energy Gas LP and El Paso Merchant Energy Co received inside information on a discount transportation rate that enabled them to end up the big winners in an open season in February of last year The open season involved Bcfd of firm capacity on El Paso to the California border But in an order on complaint FERC found no merit in the allegations It cleared El Paso of charges that it rigged the bidding for capacity to favor its affiliates Moreover it said there was no evidence that El Paso violated its standards of conduct However the Commission did not dismiss the allegations that El Paso engaged in market and price manipulation It set the market power issue for hearing in March before Judge Wagner and ordered him to provide an initial decision within days see Daily GPI March FERC staff also appears to be hot on El Pasos tracks In testimony submitted last week before Judge Wagner FERC staffs expert witness concluded that El Paso probably exercised market power in the Southern California gas market and drove up gas prices over the past year when pipeline capacity constraints existed FERC Economist Dr Jonathan D Ogur concluded that under certain circumstances El Paso was able to wield market power in the Southern California gas market see Daily GPI May The rise in California natural gas prices is not attributable to El Paso the company said in its statement yesterday but is attributable to the fact that demand for gas has far outstripped supply Evidence presented at the California subcommittee hearings shows that El Paso has consistently utilized its pipeline capacity to ship natural gas to California and has never restricted supply Constraints on gas infrastructure in the state have limited the supply of gas during a time in which demand has risen dramatically the company said

agreement to settle the RP proceeding on El Pasos capacity allocation proposal at the conference in San Francisco last week The parties have agreed to proceed on a dual track because of Burlingtons concerns about timing We will reconvene for settlement discussions July and at Southwest Gass offices in Las Vegas after comments and reply comments are filed as permitted under the procedures agreed to at the May technical conference at FERC Comments are due June and reply comments on July Amoco and Burlington filed the original complaint on September and requested fasttrack processing under the Commissions new complaint procedures Burlington is pushing to have the Commission adhere to the fasttrack processing of the complaint maintaining that an order should have been issued within days I dont know where they got that from I cant find any such requirement and vehemently opposed any attempts to extend the procedural schedule The tone of the meeting was set when Harvey Morris representing the CPUC was allowed to make a statement because he had to leave by the meeting started about He started by saying that the CPUC was in complete opposition to the Settlement Proposal circulated by El Paso on June and then outlined all the reasons it was unfair to California shippers and was in violation of the Settlement After Harvey spoke El Paso then reviewed its June settlement proposal which you received by email and provided some additional explanations of assumptions etc Then the parties met in individual groups to caucus on their positions and reconvened as a group to discuss Of particular note was the allocation of the MMd of San Juanonly capacity that El Paso proposed to take back from Burlington J and Amoco JB El Paso said that it had been allocated MM to the Havasu shippers MM to the EOC shippers and MM to all others California CD shippers This was a major point of contention in most of the ensuing discussions California shippers objected to EOC getting the lions share of the additional San Juan capacity Under El Pasos proposal EOC shippers would get of their rights from San Juan and from Permian based on BDs CD shippers on the other hand get and respectively EOC shippers pointed out that the BDs were not actually representative of their load BDs were simply a number negotiated among the EOC shippers to allocate the costs that were allocated between EOC and California in the settlement Certain EOC shippers suggested that their specified rights should be based on some other calculation such as noncoincident peak day usage rather than BD Another major issue was the proposal that full requirements shippers FR shippers be given systemwide receipt point rights in addition to the specified rights they would get based on their billing determinants BD El Paso proposed that these systemwide rights would have a scheduling priority superior to that of a CD shipper using its capacity on an alternate firm basis either alternate receiptprimary delivery or alternate receiptalternate delivery Of course the FR shippers approved of the proposal but most other parties objected to it Several suggestions were advanced to try to reach a compromise for instance limiting FR shippers to primary specified receipt point rights during Cycle nominations but none were accepted Most nonFR shippers stated concerns about the practical impact of giving FR shippers such a scheduling priority particularly since El Pasos interpretation was that the FR shippers would not have to nominate any of their Permian specified rights in order to come back to the San Juan with the systemwide rights Everyone pretty much agreed that El Pasos proposal for capacity release of receipt point rights in their writeup was a nonstarter It was put on the table to address an earlier suggestion by EOC shippers that if they could be made economically neutral to using nonSan Juan points they might be more receptive to some restrictions on their specified rights What they were looking for was some discount for using Permian and there was some further discussion along those lines but El Paso was not receptive stating that such would mean opening the allocation of costs in the rate case A third issue was who gets what rights at SoCalTopock SoCal Gas doesnt consider El Pasos proposal not to sell Block II turnedback capacity to its Topock point to be of much value since FERC has said they cant anyway SoCal Gas is looking for a right to get out of any of its contract for which it cannot get a specified delivery point of SoCalTopock However SoCal Gas cant at this point commit to the group a number that it could live with as a specified right at Topock Conversely all the other CD shippers who think they bought firm rights at SoCalTopock are not willing to see SoCal Gas get all the rights unless they too can get out of their contracts Fuel was the other contentious issue that seems to be a key sticking point for certain parties some insist it has to remain in the settlement others say there cant be a settlement if it stays in El Pasos proposal would move the fuel rate back to effective by changing the way they eliminate fuel used in facilities that have been refunctionalized as gathering In the filing to be effective the rate would go down to approximately and then to on Burlington insists they will opt out of the settlement if they dont get relief on fuel Apparently to the extent El Paso doesnt include the costs of compressors that Burlingtons gas utilizes in systemwide fuel they have to pay a higher fuel rate to El Pasos gathering affiliate They say it has already cost them several million dollars I heard numbers between and million no hard data and they will not settle without getting something in return After the full group discussion and statements of position on Monday afternoon Rick Miles the FERC ADR facilitator pushed for individual meetings between the various segments EOC California producers marketers El Paso based on several parties representations that they were willing to continue talking A schedule was worked out and the individual meetings took up the morning on Tuesday Just before lunch the entire group got back together and accepted Mr Miles suggestion that each segment select three or four representatives who would then engage in a full discussion of the issues He felt that with a smaller group it might be easier to reach some understandings However it apparently didnt work because he called us all back late in the afternoon for a full group discussion where the positions outlined above were stated and restated Certain parties when pressed could not agree to certain basic principles because they said they would have to get input from others in their organization Mr Miles expressed his frustration that parties were at the table who didnt know what their bottom line position was eg SoCal Gas Southwest Gas Following discussion by the producers particularly Burlington as noted above that they would not agree to an extension of the date for filing comments the next settlement meeting was scheduled after the filing dates Mr Miles requested that parties send him an email note that would state their bottom line settlement position which he would keep confidential He would review all the positions and to the extent possible put then together and float a settlement package of his own He assured all that no one would be able to identify the individual positions from his package One positive note at this meeting was that there was no conflict over the pooling committees report No one registered any complaints although a few parties who had not been at the last settlement conference indicated that they would like to participate This is how I see our bottomline position I would like to send it to Rick late this week if everyone agrees A pooling procedure that will follow assigned priority rankings for both market and supply with no restrictions on pooltopool transfers loops allowed Only San Juan receipt point rights on our Havasu contract or preferably termination of the contract so that the San Juan rights could be allocated to others as part of a settlement Full requirements shippers systemwide rights above their specified point rights would not have a higher priority than CD shippers using alternate delivery points although no objection to using some allocation method other than billing determinants such as peak day volume to establish those specified point rights Do you have any opinion about the allocation of SoCalTopock rights Please give me a call when youve had a chance to look this over Im sure youll have some questions Also well need to talk about what kind of comments we want to file

come back to the San Juan with the systemwide rights Everyone pretty much agreed that El Pasos proposal for capacity release of receipt point rights in their writeup was a nonstarter It was put on the table to address an earlier suggestion by EOC shippers that if they could be made economically neutral to using nonSan Juan points they might be more receptive to some restrictions on their specified rights What they were looking for was some discount for using Permian and there was some further discussion along those lines but El Paso was not receptive stating that such would mean opening the allocation of costs in the rate case A third issue was who gets what rights at SoCalTopock SoCal Gas doesnt consider El Pasos proposal not to sell Block II turnedback capacity to its Topock point to be of much value since FERC has said they cant anyway SoCal Gas is looking for a right to get out of any of its contract for which it cannot get a specified delivery point of SoCalTopock However SoCal Gas cant at this point commit to the group a number that it could live with as a specified right at Topock Conversely all the other CD shippers who think they bought firm rights at SoCalTopock are not willing to see SoCal Gas get all the rights unless they too can get out of their contracts Fuel was the other contentious issue that seems to be a key sticking point for certain parties some insist it has to remain in the settlement others say there cant be a settlement if it stays in El Pasos proposal would move the fuel rate back to effective by changing the way they eliminate fuel used in facilities that have been refunctionalized as gathering In the filing to be effective the rate would go down to approximately and then to on Burlington insists they will opt out of the settlement if they dont get relief on fuel Apparently to the extent El Paso doesnt include the costs of compressors that Burlingtons gas utilizes in systemwide fuel they have to pay a higher fuel rate to El Pasos gathering affiliate They say it has already cost them several million dollars I heard numbers between and million no hard data and they will not settle without getting something in return After the full group discussion and statements of position on Monday afternoon Rick Miles the FERC ADR facilitator pushed for individual meetings between the various segments EOC California producers marketers El Paso based on several parties representations that they were willing to continue talking A schedule was worked out and the individual meetings took up the morning on Tuesday Just before lunch the entire group got back together and accepted Mr Miles suggestion that each segment select three or four representatives who would then engage in a full discussion of the issues He felt that with a smaller group it might be easier to reach some understandings However it apparently didnt work because he called us all back late in the afternoon for a full group discussion where the positions outlined above were stated and restated Certain parties when pressed could not agree to certain basic principles because they said they would have to get input from others in their organization Mr Miles expressed his frustration that parties were at the table who didnt know what their bottom line position was eg SoCal Gas Southwest Gas Following discussion by the producers particularly Burlington as noted above that they would not agree to an extension of the date for filing comments the next settlement meeting was scheduled after the filing dates Mr Miles requested that parties send him an email note that would state their bottom line settlement position which he would keep confidential He would review all the positions and to the extent possible put then together and float a settlement package of his own He assured all that no one would be able to identify the individual positions from his package One positive note at this meeting was that there was no conflict over the pooling committees report No one registered any complaints although a few parties who had not been at the last settlement conference indicated that they would like to participate This is how I see our bottomline position I would like to send it to Rick late this week if everyone agrees A pooling procedure that will follow assigned priority rankings for both market and supply with no restrictions on pooltopool transfers loops allowed Only San Juan receipt point rights on our Havasu contract or preferably termination of the contract so that the San Juan rights could be allocated to others as part of a settlement Full requirements shippers systemwide rights above their specified point rights would not have a higher priority than CD shippers using alternate delivery points although no objection to using some allocation method other than billing determinants such as peak day volume to establish those specified point rights Do you have any opinion about the allocation of SoCalTopock rights Please give me a call when youve had a chance to look this over Im sure youll have some questions Also well need to talk about what kind of comments we want to file

beyond shortterm fixes parading as potential solutions and there is no turning back for deregulation in the state according to a report released yesterday by consulting firm Andersen California has no choice but to forge ahead in repairing the damage that illplanned deregulation measures have caused the Energy Crisis in the Western US Lessons for navigating regulatory and market minefields report says Theres a common wisdom that knows you cant unscramble the egg said Matt Smith head of Andersens North American energy consulting practice All that can be done is correct the mistakes he added In addition steps must be implemented to prevent the spread of the California virus to other states electricity marketplaces Smith said To begin in our view the energy crisis in the western US has produced formidable challenges for utility industry regulators state and federal policymakers and industry executives Smith said The virus spawned in California requires new strategies to contain and reverse the damage The implications for the development of competitive energy markets go far beyond the western United States Unfortunately California has taught the nation that regulatory and political barriers can create and sustain an energy crisis The proposed solutions put in motion by federal and state regulators as well as California policymakers have only led to an increasingly uncertain market and tension among those working for a viable resolution the report says In reaction to the breakdown many of Californias political leaders now prefer to abandon deregulation the report says The report concludes that power shortages and blackouts are inevitable this summer The deregulated marketplace which took a year to throw off track will more than likely take a number of years to put right the report says MCM Competing evidence clouds Calif investigation Prompted in part by the California Public Utilities Commission the California Assembly has been scrutinizing the role that interstate pipelines have played in the states current energy crisis In the efforts to find a smoking gun legislators have leane d heavily on a report prepared by The Brattle Group a consultancy commissioned by utility Southern California Edison to dig up evidence of market power abuse But the states biggest transporter of gas to California El Paso Natu ral Gas is not ready to take the rap The pipeline has commissioned its own study which i t recently presented as evidence that it has not circumvented any laws or regulation As reported in both the trade press and national media SoCal Ed and the CP UC are pointing the finger of blame at El Paso for alleged manipulation of California borde r prices through affiliate deals and capacity hoarding And exhibit A in their case against El Paso is The Brattle Groups study of the California market Richard Zeiger a spokesman for Assembly Member Darrell Steinberg chairman of the California Assembly Judiciary Committee told Gas Daily that The Brattle Groups market study proved that the surge in gas prices at the California border was not caused by normal market forces GD His remarks followed an oversight hearing during which Assembly members questioned Dynegy and El Paso officials about their involvement in the California market El Paso presented a different version of events to the Assembly In a repor t presented to legislators a research group hired by El Paso concluded that a convergence of factors not a conspiracy caused the price runup Lukens Consulting Group a Houstonbased consultancy was retained by El Pa so to conduct work on several fronts In its study of the California market Lukens concluded that the increasing convergence of the gas and electricity businesses was one of the main culprits in the California gas price imbroglio Assemblyman John Campbell a Republican member of the oversight committee said he didnt see any smoking gun in either report We had our committee hearing and we certainly had a lot on the Brattle Study and a little on the Lukens study To some degree Im not sure that the California legislature is the best place to adjudicate the differences between these two studies Campbell said I believe FERC is looking at this situation and it would seem to me that thats the appropriate place Campbell said that the CPUC had been prodding the California legislature to give support to its claims of market power abuse by pipelines Its being pushed basically by the Public Utilities Commission here which believes that there was collusion by pipeline companies to push up gas prices in California he said The CPUC Campbell suggested sought satisfaction before the California assembly when it had failed on the federal level Theres a concerted effort not jus t on natural gas but on other things here in California for entities and organizations here to point the finger elsewhere for the problems that were having in this state and I think youre seein g some of that with the public utilities commission Whether either report wins over the public incensed by high natural gas prices is a different matter entirely In the meanwhile the dueling California market studies se em to have taken on a life of their own The Brattle Group Study for instance has become the center of a heavily litigated effort to force FERC to compel the release of market data by California market participants Following on a request by SoCal Ed which said it needed additional data to round out The Brattle Group report FERC Chief ALJ Curtis Wagner issued subpoenas to the other three major pipelines that serve the state as well as to Sempra Energy Trading Several parties resisted FERCs call for market information saying the requested data contained commercially sensitive information FERC allowed the discovery process to move forward but only after attaching strict data protection rules restricting access to evidence GD Critics of the pipeline industry have already suffered one setback in their case The commission recently dismissed the CPUCs claim that El Paso rigged the auction of a large block of pipeline capacity in favor of affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy In addressing the California Assembly representatives of Dynegy said that FERCs recent ruling on th e California border controversy obviated the need for more investigation The controversy however is far from over FERC last month also ordered a hearing into whether El Paso Natural Gas and its affiliates manipulated capacity to driv e up the price of gas delivered into California GD That hearing is likely to take place this summer RP et al NH

Calif gas and power prices Joined at the hip When gas reaches the California border something happens to the price The same goes for the power market But how closely are the prices of gas and power linked Over the past several months it has become fashionable to declare that power prices and gas prices are dependent on one another rising and falling in sync In a recent FERC public meeting for instance transportation differentials were fingered as the main culprits for the cost of wholesale power in California GD At first glance the evidence seems to support this point From one perspective it does appear that the two markets do indeed reach bottoms and ceilings at the same time But on closer examination power and gas prices over the last year were often out of sync even in California When we view prices in major wholesale power markets relative to prices in major producing areas serving California we also find little or no relationship especially in terms of the magnitude of the change in price For the last six months the price of gas in California has generally stayed above the cost of gas in the major producing basins supplying gas to California The resulting difference in price the basis between California gas and producing area gas most often exceeded the cost of transporting the gas to California severalfold On Dec the cost of gas in California was about times as great as the cost in every producing area from which it receives gas And it was very similar to the cost of power at Palo Verde a major wholesale power market serving California The average index price of gas at Gas Daily SoCal Gas large pkgs major wholesale market on Dec was mmBtu Measured in Btu equivalent the power market was almost the same Using a heat rate of mmBtuMWh to make the conversion from megawatt hours to mmBtu the average or index price of power at Megawatt Daily Palo Verde major wholesale power market on the same day was mmBtu The power and gas prices on Dec followed a steep uplift in price for both power and gas begun on Nov Those peak prices have not been exceeded since By comparison power prices on Nov were mmBtu while gas prices were mmBtu Thus gas prices at mmBtu on Dec had increased by a factor of in a little more than a month Even though gas prices increased in the major producing regions as well and behaved in interesting ways GD GD the increase in California gas prices was so great it was as if they had not changed at all see figure below On of the trading days between the price trough on Nov and the peak on Dec gas and power prices were stepping up in sync Increases or decreases in power prices were coupled with increases decreases in power prices Yet the initial rate of increase was much greater for power than for gas Between Nov and Nov power prices increased from mmBtu to mmBtu while gas prices only increased from mmBtu to mmBtu After Nov gas prices began to take off It was as if the initial large increase in power prices in the first trading days following Nov had served as a catalyst for the subsequent large increase in gas prices On Nov the spark spread was mmBtu or MWh suggesting huge profits for companies obtaining gas for generating power for sale on the wholesale market As wholesale gas prices caught up to wholesale power prices however the spark spread declined significantly By Nov the spark spread was only MmBtu From a selective view of price such as the rise in Nov it appears that power prices and gas prices are dependent on one another that is when power prices increased gas prices increased as well and visa versa But the variability of the spark spread for California markets reveals the lack of a simple relationship between power and gas prices see figure below The large volatility of the spark spread apparent from the price plot is largely determined by the volatility of the power price Interestingly enough it is not always clear why power and gas are well connected when they are well connected or even why they behave the way they do at these times Most recent statistics available from the Energy Information Administration indicate that net generation of power from utility and merchant plants in California between September and October declined by Gas consumption at these power plants also declined by It is not surprising then that power prices declined in October from September levels As consumption of gas at power generators fell by an additional billion cf between October and November prices of both gas and power not only rose but also rose in sync Thus while gas consumption for power generation was billion cf or about below its September level prices were significantly higher Did gas prices rise in November because of an overall significant increase in gas demand by all sectors in November from October levels According to the most recent EIA statistics this was not the case Deliveries to all sectors were almost even in October and November differing by only billion cf An understanding of observed price behavior of wholesale gas and power never comes easy but one lesson is abundantly clear those who either hold firm rights for transportation of gas into California or are managing these rights are sitting pretty while those who dont have such rights and need gas are skating on thin ice John H Herbert James D NRON AM To Phillip K CT Tim CT Ray

<7021034.1075843486787.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,rebecca.cantrell@enron.com,2001-05-15 02:37:00,Gas Daily and Natural Gas Intelligence Articles on El Paso Case Hearing Cc DAILY ONLINE EDITION May FERC launches formal hearing in El Paso case A collection of highpowered attorneys crowded a FERC hearing room yesterday for the launch of a formal hearing into allegations of market power abuse by El Paso and its affiliates While a decision is still a way off the presiding judge in the case made it clear that FERC must find a precise way to measure market share in California before ruling on the case The hearing also marked the public release of a controversial market power study by The Brattle Group which was commissioned by Southern California Edison to find evidence of market power abuse by El Paso marketing affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy The Brattle Group said that it found substantial evidence that El Paso manipulated Californias gas market a claim that remains strongly in dispute see story page In an opening statement FERC Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner laid down the parameters for the hearing The burden of proof he said is on the California Public Utilities Commission which filed the original Section complaint against El Paso But once a case is made Wagner added the burden of going forward with evidence to rebut that case shifts to El Paso Merchant and the parties on its side of the table The case originated last year when the CPUC asked FERC to abrogate a series of transportation contracts between El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant The California regulators claimed the capacity award was rigged and further complained of a conspiracy to drive up the delivered price of gas into California In March FERC dismissed the CPUCs claim that there was favoritism in the bidding process for El Paso pipeline capacity GD But the commission also sent the case before an ALJ saying the case raised larger questions of market power According to FERC certain disputed issues of fact need to be examined at a hearing before a decision can be rendered One of the biggest issues will be determining whether the affected market is the entire state of California or whether it is just Southern California The CPUC and Southern California Edison maintain that only the Southern California market is at issue while El Paso argues that the case applies to the entire state The outcome of the case could hinge on that distinction As Wagner noted in his opening remarks The question of the geographic market makes a tremendous difference in how El Paso Merchants market share will be measured and the results If the entire state is considered as a single market said Wagner then El Paso Merchant would have a market share that depending on methodology would range between and But if the CPUCs contention that the market is Southern California holds up he added then El Paso Merchants market share would be between and Finding out whether market power exists also depends on how many players are involved in a particular market Wagner said that the parties need to reach a stipulation among counsel on the number of players In addition he said that he would need a better geographic description of El Paso Merchants capacity holdings and information on the price differential of gas between Northern and Southern California Finally Wagner directed a number of questions to El Paso El Paso Merchant he said should answer the CPUCs question as to why it subscribed for the involved billion cfd for months when it had no market for that amount In addition said Wagner El Paso should show whether it sold in the secondary market shortterm releases of the excess capacity at a price higher than it paid Wagner also heard arguments over the admissibility of certain evidence Given the volume of testimony involved the case will require some legal heavy lifting before a preliminary decision is reached Noting that he received a nearly twofoot high stack of testimony last week Wagner said that reading prehearing briefs and prepared testimony consumed a very beautiful Sunday in Washington RP NH El Paso takes aim at Calif Assembly study In an effort to clear its name in the ongoing California market power controversy El Paso is going on the offensive The company yesterday issued a riposte to claims publicized by California Assembly members and major newspapers that it manipulated California gas prices And it took close aim at The Brattle Group a consultancy that has figured prominently in various investigations into the matter According to El Paso The Brattle Group worked handinhand with a California Assembly subcommittee to pin the blame on El Paso and its subsidiaries for the runup in gas prices in the Golden State El Paso furnished copies of internal Assembly emails as proof that the subcommittee did not seek to conduct an objective investigation As reported in Gas Daily The Brattle Groups study of alleged market power abuse by El Paso marketing arm El Paso Merchant Energy has been exhibit A in California pipeline litigation GD In a study commissioned by Southern California Edison The Brattle Group concluded that El Paso had deliberately manipulated Californiabound pipeline capacity in an effort to drive up the price differential between production basins and the California border Drawing in large part on The Brattle Groups opinion the California Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight recently concluded that El Paso caused the price runup GD Representatives of the Assemblys Democratic majority said The Brattle Group study proved conclusively that the rise in gas prices at the California border was greater than could be accounted for through normal market forces But according to El Paso the subcommittee majority was deliberately wrong The inquiry conducted by the subcommittee said El Paso was a charade that was orchestrated from the beginning to shore up SoCalEds case El Paso has recently obtained through discovery in a proceeding before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission correspondence between the staff for the subcommittee and the paid litigation consultant The Brattle Group for Southern California Edison said El Paso in a statement This communication reveals that the subcommittee majoritys conclusions were predetermined to blame El Paso for Californias failed energy policies The correspondence included apparent requests from subcommittee staff members for help in rebutting El Pasos testimony before the Assembly El Paso interpreted those requests as proof that the subcommittee majority never intended to write an objective report on the matter We are shocked that the subcommittee delegated its responsibilities to SoCalEds consultants said Norma Dunn El Paso senior vice president of communications and government affairs We voluntarily met with subcommittee staff and testified before the subcommittee in good faith under the false premise that the subcommittee was interested in seeking the truth Now we learn that the subcommittee was working at the direction of SoCalEds litigation consultants to support SCEs litigation position Litigation pitting SoCalEd and the California Public Utilities Commission against El Paso is currently under way at FERC see story page Following yesterdays hearing Dunn told Gas Daily that SoCalEd and the CPUC were also waging their campaign against El Paso in the national press The New York Times for instance has published articles that relied on The Brattle Group study and other sealed documents Dunn said it was clear that SoCalEd and the CPUC were using the selective leak of documents to take the case against El Paso to the public Prior to recess in yesterdays hearing FERC Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner issued a reminder of the need to restrict access to protected documents NH NGIs Daily Gas Price Index published May El Paso Calls California Subcommittee Hearing a Sham El Paso Corp claims it was set up by California Assembly members to take the blame for high gas prices in the state It said recent hearings before a subcommittee were a sham and that it was predetermined that El Paso would be accused on wrongdoing in a report approved by the subcommittee majority yesterday While El Paso battled similar accusations at the opening of hearings yesterday before a FERC administrative law judge the company publicly contested the results of the majority report approved of the California Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight which placed the blame on the energy company for skyrocketing gas prices in the state The majority report says El Paso drove up gas prices by withholding pipeline capacity from the market focusing on the same yearold capacity contract between El Pasos pipeline and marketing affiliate that is the subject of FERCs investigation Contrary to the majority report however are the conclusions of a report prepared for the two Republican members of the fivemember subcommittee That document said the hearings produced no conclusive evidence of price manipulation Although the majority report has not been made public it is clear based on accounts of the report and recently uncovered documents that the subcommittee hearing was a sham El Paso said in a statement El Paso released to the public yesterday documents containing email correspondence between staff members of the subcommittee and members of the Brattle Group a paid consulting firm for Southern California Edison The Brattle Group is one of El Pasos main opponents at the hearings this week before FERCs Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner Jr Brattle accuses the company of costing Californians an additional billion in gas costs over the past year The correspondence El Paso released reveals a close relationship between the consulting firm and the subcommittee staff For example a staff member said to Brattle Groups Matthew OLoughlin I cant thank you and Paul enough for your testimony It was beyond expectations the members were highly impressed The chairman asked me if you guys could stay and help us with a second day We could have used it El Paso said the communication reveals that the subcommittee majoritys conclusions were predetermined to blame El Paso for Californias failed energy policies The subcommittee majority was working handinhand with and relying on SCEs consultant the Brattle Group in their socalled analysis El Paso said In communications between the subcommittee staff and SCEs consultant it is clear that SCEs consultant assisted in preparing questions for the hearing and that the subcommittee staff requested assistance from SCEs consultant in preparing the final report That the subcommittee majority never intended to conduct an objective investigation is clear Rather than write an objective report based on the testimony the staff went on to ask SCEs consultant for help in rebutting El Pasos testimony We are shocked that the subcommittee delegated its responsibilities to SCEs consultants said Norma Dunn senior vice president of Communications and Government Affairs for El Paso We voluntarily met with subcommittee staff and testified before the subcommittee in good faith under the false premise that the subcommittee was interested in seeking the truth Now we learn that the subcommittee was working at the direction of SCEs litigation consultants to support SCEs litigation position We are particularly concerned that after coordinating the questions to be asked the Brattle Group testified before the subcommittee as if it were an independent group It is obvious that the subcommittee hearings were a charade that was orchestrated from the beginning Final conclusions were drawn before we had an opportunity to testify and then the final report was leaked to the press instead of provided to us so that we would not have an opportunity to react Dunn said El Paso is confident that once the facts are presented to FERC in hearings this week it will be vindicated However El Paso also faces an uphill battle in Washington The FERC hearings pit El Paso and its subsidiaries against the California Public Utilities Commission and the states two largest investorowned utilities Pacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edison The regulators and the utilities also allege El Paso withheld capacity on its pipelines into the state which in turn pushed prices up If the charges are substantiated FERC Judge Wagner could order the company to refund any money it earned due to price or supply manipulation Such a ruling could have even broader implications because skyrocketing prices for natural gas the single biggest source of fuel for power plants in California obviously contributed to the financial calamity that brought Southern California Edison to its knees and sent Pacific Gas Electric into bankruptcy The details of the charges are well known at this point Critics alleged that El Paso Merchant Energy Gas LP and El Paso Merchant Energy Co received inside information on a discount transportation rate that enabled them to end up the big winners in an open season in February of last year The open season involved Bcfd of firm capacity on El Paso to the California border But in an order on complaint FERC found no merit in the allegations It cleared El Paso of charges that it rigged the bidding for capacity to favor its affiliates Moreover it said there was no evidence that El Paso violated its standards of conduct However the Commission did not dismiss the allegations that El Paso engaged in market and price manipulation It set the market power issue for hearing in March before Judge Wagner and ordered him to provide an initial decision within days see Daily GPI March FERC staff also appears to be hot on El Pasos tracks In testimony submitted last week before Judge Wagner FERC staffs expert witness concluded that El Paso probably exercised market power in the Southern California gas market and drove up gas prices over the past year when pipeline capacity constraints existed FERC Economist Dr Jonathan D Ogur concluded that under certain circumstances El Paso was able to wield market power in the Southern California gas market see Daily GPI May The rise in California natural gas prices is not attributable to El Paso the company said in its statement yesterday but is attributable to the fact that demand for gas has far outstripped supply Evidence presented at the California subcommittee hearings shows that El Paso has consistently utilized its pipeline capacity to ship natural gas to California and has never restricted supply Constraints on gas infrastructure in the state have limited the supply of gas during a time in which demand has risen dramatically the company said

Vorman WASHINGTON May Reuters Natural gas supplies will be stretched to the limit this summer in California but demand will ease during the next four years as utilities become more efficient and hydropower supplies resume a state regulator told the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Thursday FERC staff held a technical conference to gather information about Californias natural gas demand outlook from state officials intrastate pipelines interstate pipelines marketers and others A spike in wholesale electricity prices in the nations most populous state has been blamed partly on a bottleneck in natural gas pipelines Many of Californias electricity generation plants are fueled with natural gas Bill Wood the chief natural gas forecaster for the California Energy Commission said demand would be about billion cubic feet bcf per day this year That compares with bcf per day last year and bcf in he said The states thirst for natural gas will fall slightly in and remain flat for four years as utilities become more efficient at squeezing electricity out of gas he said Hydropower imported from the Pacific Northwest should also return to normal levels after this years drought and displace some of the gas now being used Wood told the conference NATGAS STRANDED AT BORDER Forecast demand of bcf this year means interstate pipelines bringing natural gas supplies into California will be pushed to their limit The interstate pipelines feeding the state with gas from the Rocky Mountains New Mexico and other outofstate fields have a capacity of bcf per day Wood said But Californias intrastate pipelines that pick up the gas can receive a maximum of bcf per day leaving million cubic feet of gas stranded at the border he said Wood and other officials said Sempra Energys NYSESRE news Southern California Gas Co which serves San Diego and the southern portion of the state had especially tight supplies Lad Lorenz director of SoCal Gas capacity and operations told the FERC conference the company had adequate transmission capacity for its customers Although the lack of hydropower imports from the Northwest has increased gas demand by million cubic feet per day on SoCal Gas system the firm still has enough capacity to handle it he said We dont anticipate any problems meeting electricity generation demand this summer Lorenz said We dont project any curtailments To help cope with this summers tightness SoCal Gas is awaiting state approval of its plan to add capacity of more than million cubic feet per day by salvaging its Montebellow storage field Lorenz said It also plans to convert about bcf of cushion gas which is used to maintain adequate pressure in a storage facility into working gas The company also has up to million cubic feet per day of interruptible capacity he said SoCal Gas is spending million on four projects to expand capacity by a total of million cubic feet of firm backbone transmission capacity to its system he said The projects should be completed by yearend if they received quick environmental approvals INTERSTATE PIPELINES HURRY TO EXPAND Interstate pipelines said they were planning ways to get more natural gas to the California border through upgraded compression equipment and brandnew pipelines El Paso Pipeline is planning to convert the AllAmerica oil pipeline to natural gas said Patricia Shelton president of El Pasos western pipeline group That line which was recently approved by FERC will ship about million cubic feet per day of natural gas from Texas to the California border by autumn Were doing this on our dime to loosen up our system Shelton said A major new interstate line the Sonoran Pipeline has been proposed in a joint venture by Calpine Corp and Kinder Morgan The mile pipeline would ship billion cubic feet of gas each day from Blanco New Mexico to the San Francisco Bay area The companies are trying to get year contract commitments from customers to determine if the nearly billion pipeline is economically feasible said Craig Chancellor of Calpine Kern River Gas Transmission a unit of the Williams Cos NYSEWMB news is planning an expansion of its interstate pipeline to add

CantrellHOUECT on AM Tracey Bradley on AM To Aryeh Fishman Andrea Settanni Charles Shoneman Kimberly Curry Paul Fox Ronald Carroll Randall Rich cc Duscha Brown Subject FERC expands El Paso Pipeline hearing on Calif A copy of FERCs order reopening the investigation into affiliate abuse is attached Monday June pm Eastern Time FERC expands El Paso Pipeline hearing on Calif UPDATE adds NYMEX closing price By Julie Vorman WASHINGTON June Reuters US regulators on Monday expanded a legal proceeding into whether El Paso Corp NYSEEPG news affiliates improperly shared information to boost the price of natural gas deliveries into energystarved California The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC reversed an earlier decision and granted a request by the California Public Utilities Commission for a hearing on the activities of El Paso Pipeline El Paso Merchant EnergyGas LP and Mojave Pipeline Co All are involved in shipping natural gas into California where utilities depend on the fuel to run electricity generating plants The California Public Utilities Commission alleged that the El Paso affiliates three shipping contracts for million cubic feet per day of guaranteed capacity to California were rigged to boost prices during much of last year Utilities and state regulators claim the high prices cost Californians an extra billion a figure disputed by El Paso AFFILIATE ABUSE AT ISSUE FERC which regulates interstate pipelines and electricity markets had said in March that it found no sign of what is known in the industry as affiliate abuse The agency has rules requiring armslength deals within a corporate family The commission now sets for hearing the issue of whether El Paso Pipeline andor El Paso Merchant engaged in affiliate abuse or violated the affiliate standards in bidding for or awarding the El Paso contracts including the transportation discount granted by Mojave FERC said in the Monday order The new hearing will become part of an ongoing case in which FERC Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner is trying to determine if El Paso deliberately curbed gas shipments to boost prices Although California prices eased in recent days they have soared as much as times higher than other states El Paso has denied any wrongdoing The bottom line is that FERC had all the evidence before them when they made their initial decision in March that there was no affiliate abuse And that evidence has not changed said Norma Dunn a spokeswoman for El Paso Were very confident that they will rule in the same fashion again she added In late March FERC ordered the first El Paso proceeding to determine if the company exercised market power to drive up the price of natural gas in California But FERC also rejected at that time allegations that El Paso Pipeline had improperly favored its affiliates during the socalled open season when pipelines accept bids for contract deliveries The new FERC action came after California regulators alleged that El Paso Merchant received secret information from Mojave during the open season The commission now believes these allegations raise factual issues that are best resolved in an evidentiary hearing the FERC order said Separately Judge Wagner asked FERC for guidance on whether he should gather evidence on possible violations of the affiliate standards which could have influenced prices PUNISHMENT REMAINS UNCLEAR On the New York Merchantile Exchange NYMEX Hub gas prices for July rallied cents or almost seven percent to close at per million British thermal units mmBtu on Monday Under the FERC order Judge Wagner has until June to set a date for a hearing on the new issue The agency also said it was premature to identify what punishment is available if Judge Wagner determines that El Paso improperly exercised market power The expanded proceeding means that a Sept deadline for a decision by Judge Wagner has been suspended FERC said The FERC order was endorsed by new FERC commissioner Pat Wood a former Texas utilities regulator and confidant of President George W Bush Wood joined FERC earlier this month and is widely rumored to be in line to head the agency Current FERC chairman Curtis Hebert a Mississippi Republican took over the leadership role in January at the insistence of thenSenate Majority Leader Trent Lott In a concurring opinion filed with the new FERC order Wood wrote that the agency must act expeditiously on complaints The El Paso allegations were first raised in April but FERC did not move on the case until nearly one year later In overseeing competitive energy markets as a joint effort with our colleagues at state commissions it is critical that the FERC be seen as a watchful and vigilant partner Wood wrote Expeditious referral and action on filed complaints is a central tool in our market oversight toolbox Hebert also wrote a concurring opinion in which he said he was committed to a speedy resolution of the case rppdf

published June Marketers FERC DataCollection Effort in CA a Fishing Expedition A proposed initiative by FERC to collect an inordinate amount of price and volume information from transporters and sellers of natural gas into the California market is nothing more than a fishing expedition by the agency marketers charge The Commission proposed the reporting requirement last month in response to mounting pressure from Capitol Hill for regulatory action in the volatile gas market The Electric Power Supply Association EPSA Occidental Energy Marketing Inc and Tractebel Energy Marketing Inc contend that FERCs effort would duplicate ongoing state investigations into gas prices impose an extremely burdensome requirement on pipelines marketers and local distribution companies LDCs for information and force companies to turn over proprietary and confidential data that could expose them to potential financial harm They urged the Commission to narrow the scope of its proposed informationcollection effort considerably Moreover the marketers questioned whether FERC had the authority under the Natural Gas Act NGA to demand data from companies over which it lacked jurisdiction and to investigate natural gas prices But the American Public Gas Association APGA which represents municipal gas distributors is fully behind the Commissions effort In California natural gas prices have been consistently and substantially higher than the national average The Commission has correctly noted that market forces have not alleviated the high natural gas prices in California in a timely or predictable manner This suggests among other things that the fundamental marketplace principle of supply invariably increasing to meet demand is being frustrated the group said RM President Bush has said the California gas market warranted further review and designated new Commissioner Pat Wood last month to head up the effort the APGA noted Wood and Commissioner Nora M Brownell will travel to California next week to confer with Gov Gray Davis about the states gas market Wood on at least two occasions has acknowledged that something doesnt appear to be quite right with the market and Commissioner William Massey this week told a Senate committee that FERC needed to do a lot more work with the California gas market FERC currently is exploring allegations that El Paso Natural Gas and its merchant power generation affiliates engaged in illegal practices to drive up gas prices at the Southern California border during see Daily GPI June Occidental Energy Marketing Inc which markets gas produced by its affiliates within California doesnt dispute that a price investigation may be warranted Its objection primarily is with the manner in which FERC proposes to gather information Not only does the Commission take a shotgun approach to data gathering it has admitted that it may not have the authority to do anything about the information it receives Occidental said Moreover while much of the information it may receive under this rule may provide guidance as to what is happening it may not give FERC any clue about why Occidental suggested that the Commission take a more limited approach and focus on examining issues that are subject to its jurisdiction such as capacityrelease transactions on interstate pipelines that serve the California market Not only would such an inquiry clearly be within the purview of the Commissions jurisdiction it would also lend itself to a much more focused approach FERC already has proposed reinstituting the rate cap on capacityrelease transportation to the state border see Daily GPI May The Commissions decision to remove the cap as part of Order last year contributed at least in part to the significant runup in gas prices in California last year critics claim The EPSA which represents independent energy marketers also recommended that FERC limit its actions in California to those that are within its jurisdiction such as approving new interstate pipeline projects The addition of new pipeline capacity and improvements in the natural gas transmission system will often limit or alleviate existing higher pricesSince these factors are under the jurisdiction of the Commission a continued examination of these issues would better prepare the Commission to respond to any future price volatility Also the group proposed that FERC rather than initiate its own informationcollection effort use the data from the California investigations that are already in progress If FERC should decide that it needs to pursue additional data through a reporting requirement it should provide for a more narrowly focused set of data and specify a sunset date for market participants the EPSA noted Companies are reluctant to turn over such an enormous amount of information to FERC since it has not provided any specific guarantees of confidentiality the EPSA said The politically charged California environment heightens the potential for abuse of this information by way of manipulation and misrepresentation Tractebel Energy objected to a reporting requirement for marketers that are unaffiliated with interstate pipelines as well as other nonjurisdictional companies Unaffiliated gas marketers in California move prices closer to competitive levels Moreover these marketers serve a positive role in enhancing liquidity and competitiveness through their arbitrage role Accordingly there is no basis on policy or analytical grounds to collect data from unaffiliated gas marketers it said If FERC should decide otherwise Tractebel Energy called for it to establish a volume threshold for reporting under which only large sellers would report The reporting requirements as proposed by FERC in late May would target all sellers of natural gas and interstate pipelines and LDCs that serve the California market FERC is seeking to gauge what percentage of the volumes destined for California is domestically produced gas sold by marketing affiliates of pipelines and LDCs in saleforresale transactions These are the only sales over which FERC has jurisdiction under the NGA see Daily GPI May Although LDCs and other sellers are not directly subject to FERCs NGA authority the Commission noted that the law does give it extensive authority to collect information from all parties to determine whether there has been a violation of the NGA and to serve as a basis for proposing legislation to Congress The Commission proposes to collect the data on a quarterly basis days after the end of a quarter in a standardized format It then will aggregate the data submitted and analyze it promptly to determine what action if any is warranted with respect to the California gas prices Prices in Southern California have been especially volatile in the last couple of weeks falling to below the MMBtu mark in early June from MMBtu at the start of April They have since rebounded to more than MMBtu In addition to getting a handle on the level of gas sales by pipe marketing affiliates and LDCs in California FERC is seeking to obtain an accurate picture of the overall average gas costs being incurred by all purchases of natural gas moving into the California market as well as the extent to which the cost of interstate transportationaffects the price for the gas commodity at the California border

published June Marketers FERC DataCollection Effort in CA a Fishing Expedition A proposed initiative by FERC to collect an inordinate amount of price and volume information from transporters and sellers of natural gas into the California market is nothing more than a fishing expedition by the agency marketers charge The Commission proposed the reporting requirement last month in response to mounting pressure from Capitol Hill for regulatory action in the volatile gas market The Electric Power Supply Association EPSA Occidental Energy Marketing Inc and Tractebel Energy Marketing Inc contend that FERCs effort would duplicate ongoing state investigations into gas prices impose an extremely burdensome requirement on pipelines marketers and local distribution companies LDCs for information and force companies to turn over proprietary and confidential data that could expose them to potential financial harm They urged the Commission to narrow the scope of its proposed informationcollection effort considerably Moreover the marketers questioned whether FERC had the authority under the Natural Gas Act NGA to demand data from companies over which it lacked jurisdiction and to investigate natural gas prices But the American Public Gas Association APGA which represents municipal gas distributors is fully behind the Commissions effort In California natural gas prices have been consistently and substantially higher than the national average The Commission has correctly noted that market forces have not alleviated the high natural gas prices in California in a timely or predictable manner This suggests among other things that the fundamental marketplace principle of supply invariably increasing to meet demand is being frustrated the group said RM President Bush has said the California gas market warranted further review and designated new Commissioner Pat Wood last month to head up the effort the APGA noted Wood and Commissioner Nora M Brownell will travel to California next week to confer with Gov Gray Davis about the states gas market Wood on at least two occasions has acknowledged that something doesnt appear to be quite right with the market and Commissioner William Massey this week told a Senate committee that FERC needed to do a lot more work with the California gas market FERC currently is exploring allegations that El Paso Natural Gas and its merchant power generation affiliates engaged in illegal practices to drive up gas prices at the Southern California border during see Daily GPI June Occidental Energy Marketing Inc which markets gas produced by its affiliates within California doesnt dispute that a price investigation may be warranted Its objection primarily is with the manner in which FERC proposes to gather information Not only does the Commission take a shotgun approach to data gathering it has admitted that it may not have the authority to do anything about the information it receives Occidental said Moreover while much of the information it may receive under this rule may provide guidance as to what is happening it may not give FERC any clue about why Occidental suggested that the Commission take a more limited approach and focus on examining issues that are subject to its jurisdiction such as capacityrelease transactions on interstate pipelines that serve the California market Not only would such an inquiry clearly be within the purview of the Commissions jurisdiction it would also lend itself to a much more focused approach FERC already has proposed reinstituting the rate cap on capacityrelease transportation to the state border see Daily GPI May The Commissions decision to remove the cap as part of Order last year contributed at least in part to the significant runup in gas prices in California last year critics claim The EPSA which represents independent energy marketers also recommended that FERC limit its actions in California to those that are within its jurisdiction such as approving new interstate pipeline projects The addition of new pipeline capacity and improvements in the natural gas transmission system will often limit or alleviate existing higher pricesSince these factors are under the jurisdiction of the Commission a continued examination of these issues would better prepare the Commission to respond to any future price volatility Also the group proposed that FERC rather than initiate its own informationcollection effort use the data from the California investigations that are already in progress If FERC should decide that it needs to pursue additional data through a reporting requirement it should provide for a more narrowly focused set of data and specify a sunset date for market participants the EPSA noted Companies are reluctant to turn over such an enormous amount of information to FERC since it has not provided any specific guarantees of confidentiality the EPSA said The politically charged California environment heightens the potential for abuse of this information by way of manipulation and misrepresentation Tractebel Energy objected to a reporting requirement for marketers that are unaffiliated with interstate pipelines as well as other nonjurisdictional companies Unaffiliated gas marketers in California move prices closer to competitive levels Moreover these marketers serve a positive role in enhancing liquidity and competitiveness through their arbitrage role Accordingly there is no basis on policy or analytical grounds to collect data from unaffiliated gas marketers it said If FERC should decide otherwise Tractebel Energy called for it to establish a volume threshold for reporting under which only large sellers would report The reporting requirements as proposed by FERC in late May would target all sellers of natural gas and interstate pipelines and LDCs that serve the California market FERC is seeking to gauge what percentage of the volumes destined for California is domestically produced gas sold by marketing affiliates of pipelines and LDCs in saleforresale transactions These are the only sales over which FERC has jurisdiction under the NGA see Daily GPI May Although LDCs and other sellers are not directly subject to FERCs NGA authority the Commission noted that the law does give it extensive authority to collect information from all parties to determine whether there has been a violation of the NGA and to serve as a basis for proposing legislation to Congress The Commission proposes to collect the data on a quarterly basis days after the end of a quarter in a standardized format It then will aggregate the data submitted and analyze it promptly to determine what action if any is warranted with respect to the California gas prices Prices in Southern California have been especially volatile in the last couple of weeks falling to below the MMBtu mark in early June from MMBtu at the start of April They have since rebounded to more than MMBtu In addition to getting a handle on the level of gas sales by pipe marketing affiliates and LDCs in California FERC is seeking to obtain an accurate picture of the overall average gas costs being incurred by all purchases of natural gas moving into the California market as well as the extent to which the cost of interstate transportationaffects the price for the gas commodity at the California border

CantrellHOUECT on AM Tracey Bradley on AM To Aryeh Fishman Andrea Settanni Charles Shoneman Kimberly Curry Paul Fox Ronald Carroll Randall Rich cc Duscha Brown Subject FERC expands El Paso Pipeline hearing on Calif A copy of FERCs order reopening the investigation into affiliate abuse is attached Monday June pm Eastern Time FERC expands El Paso Pipeline hearing on Calif UPDATE adds NYMEX closing price By Julie Vorman WASHINGTON June Reuters US regulators on Monday expanded a legal proceeding into whether El Paso Corp NYSEEPG news affiliates improperly shared information to boost the price of natural gas deliveries into energystarved California The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC reversed an earlier decision and granted a request by the California Public Utilities Commission for a hearing on the activities of El Paso Pipeline El Paso Merchant EnergyGas LP and Mojave Pipeline Co All are involved in shipping natural gas into California where utilities depend on the fuel to run electricity generating plants The California Public Utilities Commission alleged that the El Paso affiliates three shipping contracts for million cubic feet per day of guaranteed capacity to California were rigged to boost prices during much of last year Utilities and state regulators claim the high prices cost Californians an extra billion a figure disputed by El Paso AFFILIATE ABUSE AT ISSUE FERC which regulates interstate pipelines and electricity markets had said in March that it found no sign of what is known in the industry as affiliate abuse The agency has rules requiring armslength deals within a corporate family The commission now sets for hearing the issue of whether El Paso Pipeline andor El Paso Merchant engaged in affiliate abuse or violated the affiliate standards in bidding for or awarding the El Paso contracts including the transportation discount granted by Mojave FERC said in the Monday order The new hearing will become part of an ongoing case in which FERC Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner is trying to determine if El Paso deliberately curbed gas shipments to boost prices Although California prices eased in recent days they have soared as much as times higher than other states El Paso has denied any wrongdoing The bottom line is that FERC had all the evidence before them when they made their initial decision in March that there was no affiliate abuse And that evidence has not changed said Norma Dunn a spokeswoman for El Paso Were very confident that they will rule in the same fashion again she added In late March FERC ordered the first El Paso proceeding to determine if the company exercised market power to drive up the price of natural gas in California But FERC also rejected at that time allegations that El Paso Pipeline had improperly favored its affiliates during the socalled open season when pipelines accept bids for contract deliveries The new FERC action came after California regulators alleged that El Paso Merchant received secret information from Mojave during the open season The commission now believes these allegations raise factual issues that are best resolved in an evidentiary hearing the FERC order said Separately Judge Wagner asked FERC for guidance on whether he should gather evidence on possible violations of the affiliate standards which could have influenced prices PUNISHMENT REMAINS UNCLEAR On the New York Merchantile Exchange NYMEX Hub gas prices for July rallied cents or almost seven percent to close at per million British thermal units mmBtu on Monday Under the FERC order Judge Wagner has until June to set a date for a hearing on the new issue The agency also said it was premature to identify what punishment is available if Judge Wagner determines that El Paso improperly exercised market power The expanded proceeding means that a Sept deadline for a decision by Judge Wagner has been suspended FERC said The FERC order was endorsed by new FERC commissioner Pat Wood a former Texas utilities regulator and confidant of President George W Bush Wood joined FERC earlier this month and is widely rumored to be in line to head the agency Current FERC chairman Curtis Hebert a Mississippi Republican took over the leadership role in January at the insistence of thenSenate Majority Leader Trent Lott In a concurring opinion filed with the new FERC order Wood wrote that the agency must act expeditiously on complaints The El Paso allegations were first raised in April but FERC did not move on the case until nearly one year later In overseeing competitive energy markets as a joint effort with our colleagues at state commissions it is critical that the FERC be seen as a watchful and vigilant partner Wood wrote Expeditious referral and action on filed complaints is a central tool in our market oversight toolbox Hebert also wrote a concurring opinion in which he said he was committed to a speedy resolution of the case rppdf

Vorman WASHINGTON May Reuters Natural gas supplies will be stretched to the limit this summer in California but demand will ease during the next four years as utilities become more efficient and hydropower supplies resume a state regulator told the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Thursday FERC staff held a technical conference to gather information about Californias natural gas demand outlook from state officials intrastate pipelines interstate pipelines marketers and others A spike in wholesale electricity prices in the nations most populous state has been blamed partly on a bottleneck in natural gas pipelines Many of Californias electricity generation plants are fueled with natural gas Bill Wood the chief natural gas forecaster for the California Energy Commission said demand would be about billion cubic feet bcf per day this year That compares with bcf per day last year and bcf in he said The states thirst for natural gas will fall slightly in and remain flat for four years as utilities become more efficient at squeezing electricity out of gas he said Hydropower imported from the Pacific Northwest should also return to normal levels after this years drought and displace some of the gas now being used Wood told the conference NATGAS STRANDED AT BORDER Forecast demand of bcf this year means interstate pipelines bringing natural gas supplies into California will be pushed to their limit The interstate pipelines feeding the state with gas from the Rocky Mountains New Mexico and other outofstate fields have a capacity of bcf per day Wood said But Californias intrastate pipelines that pick up the gas can receive a maximum of bcf per day leaving million cubic feet of gas stranded at the border he said Wood and other officials said Sempra Energys NYSESRE news Southern California Gas Co which serves San Diego and the southern portion of the state had especially tight supplies Lad Lorenz director of SoCal Gas capacity and operations told the FERC conference the company had adequate transmission capacity for its customers Although the lack of hydropower imports from the Northwest has increased gas demand by million cubic feet per day on SoCal Gas system the firm still has enough capacity to handle it he said We dont anticipate any problems meeting electricity generation demand this summer Lorenz said We dont project any curtailments To help cope with this summers tightness SoCal Gas is awaiting state approval of its plan to add capacity of more than million cubic feet per day by salvaging its Montebellow storage field Lorenz said It also plans to convert about bcf of cushion gas which is used to maintain adequate pressure in a storage facility into working gas The company also has up to million cubic feet per day of

launches formal hearing in El Paso case A collection of highpowered attorneys crowded a FERC hearing room yesterday for the launch of a formal hearing into allegations of market power abuse by El Paso and its affiliates While a decision is still a way off the presiding judge in the case made it clear that FERC must find a precise way to measure market share in California before ruling on the case The hearing also marked the public release of a controversial market power study by The Brattle Group which was commissioned by Southern California Edison to find evidence of market power abuse by El Paso marketing affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy The Brattle Group said that it found substantial evidence that El Paso manipulated Californias gas market a claim that remains strongly in dispute see story page In an opening statement FERC Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner laid down the parameters for the hearing The burden of proof he said is on the California Public Utilities Commission which filed the original Section complaint against El Paso But once a case is made Wagner added the burden of going forward with evidence to rebut that case shifts to El Paso Merchant and the parties on its side of the table The case originated last year when the CPUC asked FERC to abrogate a series of transportation contracts between El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant The California regulators claimed the capacity award was rigged and further complained of a conspiracy to drive up the delivered price of gas into California In March FERC dismissed the CPUCs claim that there was favoritism in the bidding process for El Paso pipeline capacity GD But the commission also sent the case before an ALJ saying the case raised larger questions of market power According to FERC certain disputed issues of fact need to be examined at a hearing before a decision can be rendered One of the biggest issues will be determining whether the affected market is the entire state of California or whether it is just Southern California The CPUC and Southern California Edison maintain that only the Southern California market is at issue while El Paso argues that the case applies to the entire state The outcome of the case could hinge on that distinction As Wagner noted in his opening remarks The question of the geographic market makes a tremendous difference in how El Paso Merchants market share will be measured and the results If the entire state is considered as a single market said Wagner then El Paso Merchant would have a market share that depending on methodology would range between and But if the CPUCs contention that the market is Southern California holds up he added then El Paso Merchants market share would be between and Finding out whether market power exists also depends on how many players are involved in a particular market Wagner said that the parties need to reach a stipulation among counsel on the number of players In addition he said that he would need a better geographic description of El Paso Merchants capacity holdings and information on the price differential of gas between Northern and Southern California Finally Wagner directed a number of questions to El Paso El Paso Merchant he said should answer the CPUCs question as to why it subscribed for the involved billion cfd for months when it had no market for that amount In addition said Wagner El Paso should show whether it sold in the secondary market shortterm releases of the excess capacity at a price higher than it paid Wagner also heard arguments over the admissibility of certain evidence Given the volume of testimony involved the case will require some legal heavy lifting before a preliminary decision is reached Noting that he received a nearly twofoot high stack of testimony last week Wagner said that reading prehearing briefs and prepared testimony consumed a very beautiful Sunday in Washington RP NH El Paso takes aim at Calif Assembly study In an effort to clear its name in the ongoing California market power controversy El Paso is going on the offensive The company yesterday issued a riposte to claims publicized by California Assembly members and major newspapers that it manipulated California gas prices And it took close aim at The Brattle Group a consultancy that has figured prominently in various investigations into the matter According to El Paso The Brattle Group worked handinhand with a California Assembly subcommittee to pin the blame on El Paso and its subsidiaries for the runup in gas prices in the Golden State El Paso furnished copies of internal Assembly emails as proof that the subcommittee did not seek to conduct an objective investigation As reported in Gas Daily The Brattle Groups study of alleged market power abuse by El Paso marketing arm El Paso Merchant Energy has been exhibit A in California pipeline litigation GD In a study commissioned by Southern California Edison The Brattle Group concluded that El Paso had deliberately manipulated Californiabound pipeline capacity in an effort to drive up the price differential between production basins and the California border Drawing in large part on The Brattle Groups opinion the California Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight recently concluded that El Paso caused the price runup GD Representatives of the Assemblys Democratic majority said The Brattle Group study proved conclusively that the rise in gas prices at the California border was greater than could be accounted for through normal market forces But according to El Paso the subcommittee majority was deliberately wrong The inquiry conducted by the subcommittee said El Paso was a charade that was orchestrated from the beginning to shore up SoCalEds case El Paso has recently obtained through discovery in a proceeding before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission correspondence between the staff for the subcommittee and the paid litigation consultant The Brattle Group for Southern California Edison said El Paso in a statement This communication reveals that the subcommittee majoritys conclusions were predetermined to blame El Paso for Californias failed energy policies The correspondence included apparent requests from subcommittee staff members for help in rebutting El Pasos testimony before the Assembly El Paso interpreted those requests as proof that the subcommittee majority never intended to write an objective report on the matter We are shocked that the subcommittee delegated its responsibilities to SoCalEds consultants said Norma Dunn El Paso senior vice president of communications and government affairs We voluntarily met with subcommittee staff and testified before the subcommittee in good faith under the false premise that the subcommittee was interested in seeking the truth Now we learn that the subcommittee was working at the direction of SoCalEds litigation consultants to support SCEs litigation position Litigation pitting SoCalEd and the California Public Utilities Commission against El Paso is currently under way at FERC see story page Following yesterdays hearing Dunn told Gas Daily that SoCalEd and the CPUC were also waging their campaign against El Paso in the national press The New York Times for instance has published articles that relied on The Brattle Group study and other sealed documents Dunn said it was clear that SoCalEd and the CPUC were using the selective leak of documents to take the case against El Paso to the public Prior to recess in yesterdays hearing FERC Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner issued a reminder of the need to restrict access to protected documents NH NGIs Daily Gas Price Index published May El Paso Calls California Subcommittee Hearing a Sham El Paso Corp claims it was set up by California Assembly members to take the blame for high gas prices in the state It said recent hearings before a subcommittee were a sham and that it was predetermined that El Paso would be accused on wrongdoing in a report approved by the subcommittee majority yesterday While El Paso battled similar accusations at the opening of hearings yesterday before a FERC administrative law judge the company publicly contested the results of the majority report approved of the California Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight which placed the blame on the energy company for skyrocketing gas prices in the state The majority report says El Paso drove up gas prices by withholding pipeline capacity from the market focusing on the same yearold capacity contract between El Pasos pipeline and marketing affiliate that is the subject of FERCs investigation Contrary to the majority report however are the conclusions of a report prepared for the two Republican members of the fivemember subcommittee That document said the hearings produced no conclusive evidence of price manipulation Although the majority report has not been made public it is clear based on accounts of the report and recently uncovered documents that the subcommittee hearing was a sham El Paso said in a statement El Paso released to the public yesterday documents containing email correspondence between staff members of the subcommittee and members of the Brattle Group a paid consulting firm for Southern California Edison The Brattle Group is one of El Pasos main opponents at the hearings this week before FERCs Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner Jr Brattle accuses the company of costing Californians an additional billion in gas costs over the past year The correspondence El Paso released reveals a close relationship between the consulting firm and the subcommittee staff For example a staff member said to Brattle Groups Matthew OLoughlin I cant thank you and Paul enough for your testimony It was beyond expectations the members were highly impressed The chairman asked me if you guys could stay and help us with a second day We could have used it El Paso said the communication reveals that the subcommittee majoritys conclusions were predetermined to blame El Paso for Californias failed energy policies The subcommittee majority was working handinhand with and relying on SCEs consultant the Brattle Group in their socalled analysis El Paso said In communications between the subcommittee staff and SCEs consultant it is clear that SCEs consultant assisted in preparing questions for the hearing and that the subcommittee staff requested assistance from SCEs consultant in preparing the final report That the subcommittee majority never intended to conduct an objective investigation is clear Rather than write an objective report based on the testimony the staff went on to ask SCEs consultant for help in rebutting El Pasos testimony We are shocked that the subcommittee delegated its responsibilities to SCEs consultants said Norma Dunn senior vice president of Communications and Government Affairs for El Paso We voluntarily met with subcommittee staff and testified before the subcommittee in good faith under the false premise that the subcommittee was interested in seeking the truth Now we learn that the subcommittee was working at the direction of SCEs litigation consultants to support SCEs litigation position We are particularly concerned that after coordinating the questions to be asked the Brattle Group testified before the subcommittee as if it were an independent group It is obvious that the subcommittee hearings were a charade that was orchestrated from the beginning Final conclusions were drawn before we had an opportunity to testify and then the final report was leaked to the press instead of provided to us so that we would not have an opportunity to react Dunn said El Paso is confident that once the facts are presented to FERC in hearings this week it will be vindicated However El Paso also faces an uphill battle in Washington The FERC hearings pit El Paso and its subsidiaries against the California Public Utilities Commission and the states two largest investorowned utilities Pacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edison The regulators and the utilities also allege El Paso withheld capacity on its pipelines into the state which in turn pushed prices up If the charges are substantiated FERC Judge Wagner could order the company to refund any money it earned due to price or supply manipulation Such a ruling could have even broader implications because skyrocketing prices for natural gas the single biggest source of fuel for power plants in California obviously contributed to the financial calamity that brought Southern California Edison to its knees and sent Pacific Gas Electric into bankruptcy The details of the charges are well known at this point Critics alleged that El Paso Merchant Energy Gas LP and El Paso Merchant Energy Co received inside information on a discount transportation rate that enabled them to end up the big winners in an open season in February of last year The open season involved Bcfd of firm capacity on El Paso to the California border But in an order on complaint FERC found no merit in the allegations It cleared El Paso of charges that it rigged the bidding for capacity to favor its affiliates Moreover it said there was no evidence that El Paso violated its standards of conduct However the Commission did not dismiss the allegations that El Paso engaged in market and price manipulation It set the market power issue for hearing in March before Judge Wagner and ordered him to provide an initial decision within days see Daily GPI March FERC staff also appears to be hot on El Pasos tracks In testimony submitted last week before Judge Wagner FERC staffs expert witness concluded that El Paso probably exercised market power in the Southern California gas market and drove up gas prices over the past year when pipeline capacity constraints existed FERC Economist Dr Jonathan D Ogur concluded that under certain circumstances El Paso was able to wield market power in the Southern California gas market see Daily GPI May The rise in California natural gas prices is not attributable to El Paso the company said in its statement yesterday but is attributable to the fact that demand for gas has far outstripped supply Evidence presented at the California subcommittee hearings shows that El Paso has consistently utilized its pipeline capacity to ship natural gas to California and has never restricted supply Constraints on gas infrastructure in the state have limited the supply of gas during a time in which demand has risen dramatically the company said

Calif gas and power prices Joined at the hip When gas reaches the California border something happens to the price The same goes for the power market But how closely are the prices of gas and power linked Over the past several months it has become fashionable to declare that power prices and gas prices are dependent on one another rising and falling in sync In a recent FERC public meeting for instance transportation differentials were fingered as the main culprits for the cost of wholesale power in California GD At first glance the evidence seems to support this point From one perspective it does appear that the two markets do indeed reach bottoms and ceilings at the same time But on closer examination power and gas prices over the last year were often out of sync even in California When we view prices in major wholesale power markets relative to prices in major producing areas serving California we also find little or no relationship especially in terms of the magnitude of the change in price For the last six months the price of gas in California has generally stayed above the cost of gas in the major producing basins supplying gas to California The resulting difference in price the basis between California gas and producing area gas most often exceeded the cost of transporting the gas to California severalfold On Dec the cost of gas in California was about times as great as the cost in every producing area from which it receives gas And it was very similar to the cost of power at Palo Verde a major wholesale power market serving California The average index price of gas at Gas Daily SoCal Gas large pkgs major wholesale market on Dec was mmBtu Measured in Btu equivalent the power market was almost the same Using a heat rate of mmBtuMWh to make the conversion from megawatt hours to mmBtu the average or index price of power at Megawatt Daily Palo Verde major wholesale power market on the same day was mmBtu The power and gas prices on Dec followed a steep uplift in price for both power and gas begun on Nov Those peak prices have not been exceeded since By comparison power prices on Nov were mmBtu while gas prices were mmBtu Thus gas prices at mmBtu on Dec had increased by a factor of in a little more than a month Even though gas prices increased in the major producing regions as well and behaved in interesting ways GD GD the increase in California gas prices was so great it was as if they had not changed at all see figure below On of the trading days between the price trough on Nov and the peak on Dec gas and power prices were stepping up in sync Increases or decreases in power prices were coupled with increases decreases in power prices Yet the initial rate of increase was much greater for power than for gas Between Nov and Nov power prices increased from mmBtu to mmBtu while gas prices only increased from mmBtu to mmBtu After Nov gas prices began to take off It was as if the initial large increase in power prices in the first trading days following Nov had served as a catalyst for the subsequent large increase in gas prices On Nov the spark spread was mmBtu or MWh suggesting huge profits for companies obtaining gas for generating power for sale on the wholesale market As wholesale gas prices caught up to wholesale power prices however the spark spread declined significantly By Nov the spark spread was only MmBtu From a selective view of price such as the rise in Nov it appears that power prices and gas prices are dependent on one another that is when power prices increased gas prices increased as well and visa versa But the variability of the spark spread for California markets reveals the lack of a simple relationship between power and gas prices see figure below The large volatility of the spark spread apparent from the price plot is largely determined by the volatility of the power price Interestingly enough it is not always clear why power and gas are well connected when they are well connected or even why they behave the way they do at these times Most recent statistics available from the Energy Information Administration indicate that net generation of power from utility and merchant plants in California between September and October declined by Gas consumption at these power plants also declined by It is not surprising then that power prices declined in October from September levels As consumption of gas at power generators fell by an additional billion cf between October and November prices of both gas and power not only rose but also rose in sync Thus while gas consumption for power generation was billion cf or about below its September level prices were significantly higher Did gas prices rise in November because of an overall significant increase in gas demand by all sectors in November from October levels According to the most recent EIA statistics this was not the case Deliveries to all sectors were almost even in October and November differing by only billion cf An understanding of observed price behavior of wholesale gas and power never comes easy but one lesson is abundantly clear those who either hold firm rights for transportation of gas into California or are managing these rights are sitting pretty while those who dont have such rights and need gas are skating on thin ice John H Herbert James D NRON AM To Phillip K CT Tim CT Ray

Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza a Democrat will introduce a bill today that will make it a felony for any energy supplier in California to engage in a conspiracy to drive up prices or manipulate the market The bill would apply to any company selling gas or electricity into the state or to any of the states utilities said a spokesman for Cardoza Under terms of the proposed legislation offenders would be subject to Californias three strikes law which sentences convicted felons to jail for life after three offenses Directors officers or any other employees associated with market manipulation of a company would be subject to this bill the spokesman said Cardoza will introduce the bill at a press conference today at pm Pacific time CD No easy solutions to crisis The crisis in California is far beyond shortterm fixes parading as potential solutions and there is no turning back for deregulation in the state according to a report released yesterday by consulting firm Andersen California has no choice but to forge ahead in repairing the damage that illplanned deregulation measures have caused the Energy Crisis in the Western US Lessons for navigating regulatory and market minefields report says Theres a common wisdom that knows you cant unscramble the egg said Matt Smith head of Andersens North American energy consulting practice All that can be done is correct the mistakes he added In addition steps must be implemented to prevent the spread of the California virus to other states electricity marketplaces Smith said To begin in our view the energy crisis in the western US has produced formidable challenges for utility industry regulators state and federal policymakers and industry executives Smith said The virus spawned in California requires new strategies to contain and reverse the damage The implications for the development of competitive energy markets go far beyond the western United States Unfortunately California has taught the nation that regulatory and political barriers can create and sustain an energy crisis The proposed solutions put in motion by federal and state regulators as well as California policymakers have only led to an increasingly uncertain market and tension among those working for a viable resolution the report says In reaction to the breakdown many of Californias political leaders now prefer to abandon deregulation the report says The report concludes that power shortages and blackouts are inevitable this summer The deregulated marketplace which took a year to throw off track will more than likely take a number of years to put right the report says MCM Competing evidence clouds Calif investigation Prompted in part by the California Public Utilities Commission the California Assembly has been scrutinizing the role that interstate pipelines have played in the states current energy crisis In the efforts to find a smoking gun legislators have leane d heavily on a report prepared by The Brattle Group a consultancy commissioned by utility Southern California Edison to dig up evidence of market power abuse But the states biggest transporter of gas to California El Paso Natu ral Gas is not ready to take the rap The pipeline has commissioned its own study which i t recently presented as evidence that it has not circumvented any laws or regulation As reported in both the trade press and national media SoCal Ed and the CP UC are pointing the finger of blame at El Paso for alleged manipulation of California borde r prices through affiliate deals and capacity hoarding And exhibit A in their case against El Paso is The Brattle Groups study of the California market Richard Zeiger a spokesman for Assembly Member Darrell Steinberg chairman of the California Assembly Judiciary Committee told Gas Daily that The Brattle Groups market study proved that the surge in gas prices at the California border was not caused by normal market forces GD His remarks followed an oversight hearing during which Assembly members questioned Dynegy and El Paso officials about their involvement in the California market El Paso presented a different version of events to the Assembly In a repor t presented to legislators a research group hired by El Paso concluded that a convergence of factors not a conspiracy caused the price runup Lukens Consulting Group a Houstonbased consultancy was retained by El Pa so to conduct work on several fronts In its study of the California market Lukens concluded that the increasing convergence of the gas and electricity businesses was one of the main culprits in the California gas price imbroglio Assemblyman John Campbell a Republican member of the oversight committee said he didnt see any smoking gun in either report We had our committee hearing and we certainly had a lot on the Brattle Study and a little on the Lukens study To some degree Im not sure that the California legislature is the best place to adjudicate the differences between these two studies Campbell said I believe FERC is looking at this situation and it would seem to me that thats the appropriate place Campbell said that the CPUC had been prodding the California legislature to give support to its claims of market power abuse by pipelines Its being pushed basically by the Public Utilities Commission here which believes that there was collusion by pipeline companies to push up gas prices in California he said The CPUC Campbell suggested sought satisfaction before the California assembly when it had failed on the federal level Theres a concerted effort not jus t on natural gas but on other things here in California for entities and organizations here to point the finger elsewhere for the problems that were having in this state and I think youre seein g some of that with the public utilities commission Whether either report wins over the public incensed by high natural gas prices is a different matter entirely In the meanwhile the dueling California market studies se em to have taken on a life of their own The Brattle Group Study for instance has become the center of a heavily litigated effort to force FERC to compel the release of market data by California market participants Following on a request by SoCal Ed which said it needed additional data to round out The Brattle Group report FERC Chief ALJ Curtis Wagner issued subpoenas to the other three major pipelines that serve the state as well as to Sempra Energy Trading Several parties resisted FERCs call for market information saying the requested data contained commercially sensitive information FERC allowed the discovery process to move forward but only after attaching strict data protection rules restricting access to evidence GD Critics of the pipeline industry have already suffered one setback in their case The commission recently dismissed the CPUCs claim that El Paso rigged the auction of a large block of pipeline capacity in favor of affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy In addressing the California Assembly representatives of Dynegy said that FERCs recent ruling on th e California border controversy obviated the need for more investigation The controversy however is far from over FERC last month also ordered a hearing into whether El Paso Natural Gas and its affiliates manipulated capacity to driv e up the price of gas delivered into California GD That hearing is likely to take place this summer RP et al NH
