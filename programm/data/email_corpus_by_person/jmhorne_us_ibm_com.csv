<19381335.1075852786571.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,jmhorne@us.ibm.com,2001-09-13 11:32:37,Gut CheckI would like to offer a different perspective on the attacks that occurred last Tuesday Its view of the forest that I dont think the press has not gotten to in its coverage so far The American reaction to this has been healthy and accurate After reading books on Normandy Iwo Jima I always wondered if the US still possessed a fire in its belly to stoke if someone should ever deliver a blow like this So far so good but can it be sustained to go the distance While the media focuses on the personal tragedy and how to cope with what HAS happen maybe we should get in touch with our courage as well as our emotions to deal with what MAY happen In my opinion is that the US has been provoked into a larger scheme Whoever did this not only expects the US to launch counter attacks they are betting on it And they are betting that the US wont go it alone They are betting that Western intervention in the Mid East will destabilize the region possibly the world and that will ultimately bring the demise of Israel That is what these fanatics are ultimately after As you know weve fought in the mid east before but this time it will be different in many ways If the West opts for a militarily engagement and I would be shocked if they didnt they will not have the coalition they did for the Gulf War Many of the Arab countries that were on board during Desert Storm will not be able to internally support Western counter attacks that will be frequent massive and multinational Of course we should expect that these terrorist factions to volley their own counter attacks back against the US Retaliatory strikes from terrorist may not be as spectacular as what happened last Tuesday but they will be just as ugly They have many unspeakable options The terrorists that perpetrated the attacks on Tuesday have calculated that we the American people can not stomach a long drawn out ugly conflict Sadam Hussein made this assumption in the past and it was the overwhelming support from the American people that ultimately gave us the strength to exact our mission and bring our troops home so soon your truly included But the Gulf War was neither long or drawn out A campaign through the mountains of Persia probably will be long difficult and ugly If you recall this region was the labeled the Russian Vietnam I think the perpetrators have already assumed that American public support will dissolve quickly for a conflict with TWO fronts The main front in the Southwest Asia AND A DOMESTIC front that will feature psychological and physical violence that American has never had to deal with before Really think about that and ask yourself have they calculated correctly I personally think they have made a grave error America may have a broken nose but its arms legs and spirit stand ready and waiting I offer these opinions to get folks thinking and preparing for what might happen next And if it does we have to examine our reaction and RESOLVE now The war that the President says that we are now in will surely last longer than the hundred day Gulf War I think it will probably take years with uncomfortable lulls between attacks and skirmishes And a final point I can definitely understand why Americans would want to postpone regular activities out of respect for the Americans that lost their lives Its a natural reactive response What most people dont understand however is that you do not let terrorist dictate what you do When that happens you living your life by their rules May I suggest a proactive response Return to normal life as closely as you can That is the best immediate defiant message we can send back to them The first of manyummessages we will be sending them Mike
