fortune cookie and at least as accurate Everyone is getting into the act When I started this gig I was the only guy in town writing to folks like you about the power industry in California I wrote about whats new whats happening and all the important stuff This week Governor Gray Davis decided to write his own Burrito His epistle got more press than mine but why is he muscling in on my turf Not to be outdone PUC President Loretta Lynch released a report which looks into every facet of Californias power business No stone left unturned Im telling you there isnt enough room in this business for all of us They need to clear out With people like Herr Hair Peace Governor ImNot MrRogers Davis and Lets Do Lynch who needs a Friday Burrito They redefine our reality each week with mindnumbing aplomb For example starting in early June the PX was ordered to compete for business against other Qualified Trading Vehicles Then two weeks later the Energy Fhrer legislated that idea to an early death which kept the status quo for at least one year This week the PUC approved year bilateral deals for PGE and SCE thereby opening the PX to competition and emasculating the PXs Block Forward Market Zip bam boom I cant wait to see what next week will bring I hear Senator Bowen is holding Committee hearings on re regulating the industry and the Governors new Energy Security Council will meet to decide six things Whats for lunch Who will sit at the head of the table Does anyone have good seats for next weeks Democratic convention Is there anyone we havent indicted yet in the power industry Who will crank up the air conditioning in this room Its getting too warm Then they will collect data from innocent businesses under subpoena ignore the facts and publish a report It makes one want to take a deep breath and inhale the scented fumes of democracy You know I cant think about where to begin so lets start somewhere Things on the Island of California Is there anyone left at SDGE with a brain The PUC issues its scathing report The ISO invokes price caps Duh Things at the throne of FERC Amen for the Morgan Stanley Order Odds and Ends Things on the Island of California Is there anyone left at SDGE with a brain Well the answer very clearly is no I have been astounded by repeated attempts of SDGEs most senior people to ape humans but instead they mimic apes Consider the following First they waltz their default customers into the summer with little of no protection from price spikes in the wholesale market Forgivable in that it is human to err The prices skyrocket in June and they start looking for who to blame Must be them damn independent generatorsO say their managers Gary Cotton informs the ISO Governing Board that hedging SDGEs position in the Block Forward Market wouldnt have made any difference Theres one nobel laureate who missed his prime Next under pressure they ask for help from suppliers and anyone else who will assist the utility and their customers Nine offers show up at their table and they cant choose any of them Again Mr Cotton tells his fellow ISO Governing Board members that these things take time and we dont to rush since there are many legislative barriers and well the surfing was good this week so why spoil it Now they are in a panic because the Energy Fhrer is visiting old ladies living in trailer parks advising them not to pay their SDGE electricity bill and to continue to operate their air conditioners SDGE puts a full page ad in the local newspaper telling everyone that SDGE is doing everything it can to lower their electric bills including asking the ISO for a price cap but the public can help by calling the ISO address and phone number provided in the ad and urging them to lower the cap I always thought the location of the ISO was a State secret for security reasons No secrets in San Diego But we are not done No sir we are not Those buffalo heads who run that company decide they will win a gold star on their collective foreheads and implement one of the four resolutions passed by the Electric Oversight Board The one they pick is to petition FERC on an expedited basis to cap at the price at which sellers may bid energy or ancillary services into the ISO and the PX The primary reason is that Western power markets are not workably competitive In other words they want FERC to set a max price on what generators can sell in addition to the price limit at which the ISO can buy What I find most astounding about this double talk is that SDGE continues to collect tons of money from the sales of regulatory must run energy into the PX These are sales from their stranded assets Their grief hasnt abated their greed So to recap SDGE missed the boat on price hedging failed to win consumer confidence in public meetings asked for help from suppliers and did nothing in response then filed at FERC to cap the sale price because the wholesale market into which they sell overpriced energy is not workably competitive Too much time in the direct sun light Things on the Island of California The PUC issues its scathing report The PUC report released yesterday is a gem with which I have not spent enough time I only read the Executive Summary and that only because our counsel Dan Douglass forwarded me a copy Let me pick out some of the gems in President Lets Do Lynchs burrito I would recommend reading the whole text if you have time and if you seek perverse entertainment California is experiencing major problems with electricity supply and pricing caused by policies and procedures adopted over the past ten years Since June wholesale prices for electrical power in California have increased on average over the same period in resulting in over billion in excess payments for electricity Hot weather aging power plant and transmission infrastructure and dysfunctional bidding behavior in the wholesale power markets combined to drive prices up Because of serious market defects and tight supply of electricity purchasers of California power will likely pay billions more in electricity costs this year Moreover these price increases do not necessarily fund new investments in electricity supply or delivery reliability they may flow solely to power producer profit margins Despite the Electricity Oversight Boards legislative mandate to oversee those institutions we have been unable to obtain bid data Nevertheless we believe enough evidence of questionable behavior exists that the Attorney General should conduct an investigation into these statewide market practices coordinating with other State agencies including the PUC and the EOB Such an investigation would provide the factual foundation that California policy makers and regulators need to recover any illegally obtained profits A momentous consequence of Californias attempt to create a market in electricity is that the federal government now regulates Californias electric system Washington DC now controls pricing decisions directly at the wholesale level and indirectly at the retail level and to the extent that supply incentives are correlated to prices Washington DC now affects Californias ability to attract new investment in power plants Past administrations willingness to cede the States authority to the federal government combined with the legislative creation of two nonpublic supervisory organizations that have no duty to protect the public or consider the retail customer The Independent System Operator ISO and the Power Exchange PX the nonprofit private corporations that operate the States transmission system and control wholesale pricing policies are governed by boards whose members can have serious conflicts of interest Some of these board members or their companies financially benefit from higher prices in electricity markets Neither of these private organizations is accountable to the State or its consumers Despite the federalization and the fragmentation of the States electric services the State of California should protect its businesses and consumers from cartel pricing collusive behavior inadequate power plant maintenance and lack of market planning for adequate electricity supplies California consumers and businesses deserve to know in advance as San Diegans did not this summer how and when the price of an essential service like electricity will double California is now largely constrained by federal mandates from providing comprehensive retail price relief as long as wholesale prices remain so high If California tried to reimpose a price freeze in San Diego now federal regulators would likely prevent that action Shortterm price relief however cannot resolve market gaming or fundamental wholesale pricing problems controlled by federal regulators We have been precluded from obtaining the data necessary to know if the ISO and PX failed to detect manipulation and gaming on several fronts We do not know how market players acted in price offering and bidding and scheduling The FERC has just announced an inquiry into national pricing and energy market issues California should not wait for national findings before it investigates California market practices We recommend that the California Attorney General immediately subpoena relevant records and data to determine the pricing and offering behavior of market participants the actions of the ISO and its board members and the actions of generators in supplying Californias energy needs Ten Actions to Consider or Act Upon to Prevent Current Electricity Problems From Spreading in Create a California Energy Council modeled on the National Security Council to unify State action to resolve energy problems and to perform integrated energy planning Ask FERC for extended wholesale price cap authority to moderate California wholesale market pricing Ask FERC to recognize the defects in the California and western regional markets and find that no competitive market exists in California power markets Eliminate potential conflicts of interest in ISOPX stakeholder boards Improve Californias ability to obtain ISO and generator data and enhance the States enforcement capability for power plant maintenance price manipulation and generation gaming consistent with protection of proprietary business information Provide the EOB with effective enforcement ability and additional oversight authority for the ISO and PX Ten Issues to Consider or Act Upon Within the Next Six Months Streamline state power plant siting procedures consistent with environmental requirements and prioritize applications to advance clean BACT power plant proposals Institute useit or loseit permitting power plant licensing and emissions credits rules to ensure power plants get built Reform PX pricing protocols and structures to lower wholesale and retail prices and reduce excess profitsO I told you I dont need to write a Burrito anymore The Democrats in Sacramento are doing that for me Welcome comrade Things on the Island of California The ISO invokes price caps Duh It is really hard to describe the drama of an ISO Governing Board meeting especially when our favorite topic arises It seems the only time the Board becomes animated is when one of three issues are on the agenda price caps FTRs and priorities for software enhancements Otherwise its pretty much humdrum Round and round we went once again A few more forced votes tipped the scale in favor of the cap There were yes votes which included a forced yes vote from our friend Jerry Toenyes by order of Secretary of Energy Mr Richardson Jerry did you realize that the last letters of your name could be rearranged to spell NO ET YESO Kind of a french thing Im sorry about that vote Jerry You still go in my book as one of the brave and bold for standing up to that sort of intimidation for so long Your picture in the SF Chron said it all The brave souls who stood tall and voted NO included David Parquet Enron Jan SmutnyJones IEP Barbara Barkovich CLECA Caolyn Kehrein CMA Dan Kirshner EDF and Stacy Roscoe Procter Gamble Now I must admit that Dynegys Greg Blue did help by voting a Texas No spelled ABSTAINO I have instructed Dynegy trader Dave Francis in Houston to work with Greg to correct that problem Were going to work things out The Energy Fhrer addressed the Board again I didnt mind that I only had a few brief very brief moments to address the Board and Herr Hair Peace got over minutes That didnt bother me at all He did more damage to himself in than I could do in He blasted away at everyone who opposed him He pined about Camden quitting the Board He said he knew how prices and markets work that it isnt the way those academic egghead FERCloving economists tell you who pray to the gods of competition He lambasted WAPA for withholding generation to protect fish and wildlife what was that all about He predicted that on Thursdays PUC meeting he and all the other powerful Democrats Republicans and angry citizens of San Diego would demand that the PUC impose a rate cap on retail electric rates in San Diego that are just and reasonable it didnt happen And on and on and on This man is very delusional He believes that Steve and only Steve Peace can save the world He believes that political will trumps judicial quasijudicial or independent Board actions This man makes relevant all the abstract musings of the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche The will to power the bermensch the transvaluation of values etc But we are getting under uber his skin with the help of the press Wednesday afternoon I called Commissioner Dick Bilas to see if he thought whether the next days PUC meeting was going to be a roll over Dick said he got a call from Peace and that Peace said he would not come to the meeting Apparently Peace had received a lot of press and all of it bad Thats the thin line of freedom which keeps tyranny at least one step away from our front door Things at the throne of FERC Amen for the Morgan Stanley Order And now the good news You deserve this FERC gave the California market a little wiggle room last Friday FERC issued a last minute reply to the complaint by Morgan Stanley Capital Group relating to the ISOs intent to lower the price cap FERC denied the complaint but they didnt waste time with an Order to simply deny a complaint FERC danced on the head of the ISO and pulled the bite out of the price cap Here are some excerpts We accepted this Amendment not because it was a cap on sellers prices but because it would promote order and transparency in the market by clearly telling sellers of the maximum price the ISO was willing to pay and allowing sellers to make informed economic choices on whether to sell in the ISO market or to sell elsewhere The ISO has no more or less ability to procure capacity and energy than any other buyer of these services If the ISO is unable to elicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced purchase price ceiling because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they choose it will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to meet its needs Therefore an increase in outofmarket OOM calls for generation may be necessary to maintain system reliability Because the current payment for OOM is not subject to a maximum purchase price the resulting overall payments may be higher To the extent the ISO Board resolution contemplates implementing a directive that generators must bid their capacity into the ISO markets under any circumstances eg when system load exceeds MW such a requirement is not permitted by our Order and the ISO tariff Future implementation of the ISO Board resolution with regard to a requirement to sell would require significant revisions to the ISO market rules Such market changes could not become effective absent a corresponding amendment to the ISO tariff which would have to be filed under section of the FPAO Well What do you think about that Just wait Here is what the sleeping bear Commissioner Hebert said in his concurring remarks Getting to the bottom of the problem in my view requires us to begin a proceeding to rescind our approval of the ISO as the operator of the California grid The record supports such a move A memorandum to the ISO from a stakeholder who resigned from the governing board eloquently brings to our attention repeated attempts to undermine the independence of the ISO The memorandum also thoughtfully outlines consequences to the markets of a return to command and control Because these allegations come from a nonmarket participant especially should we take heed We must also take notice of the public pressure on the Board to compromise its independenceO Amen brother amen Odds and Ends As you can imagine this week like an endless string of weeks before this has been interminable I get about three phone calls a day from press reporters very little of which ever sees print My shtick is just too complex for casual readers But I do notice that the reporters are asking better questions The public is becoming more savvy The information flow is moving in our favor and will disarm the forces of evil in about years I have other problems on my mind I am working on a new computer system Really its just an upgrade of an older computer that is a bit faster than the laptop I tried to upgrade very unsuccessfully As a result of the all the new hardware and software I purchased my office looks like a war zone with an odd mix of PUC service copies computer documentation and diskettes laying all around Quite a mess Prepare for the future Our next general meeting is scheduled for Thursday and Friday October and at Moro Bay Barb Ennis will prepare a blurb for us in next weeks Burrito about room reservations timing golf etc Our guest speakers will include MSC Chairman Professor Frank Wolak who will talk on the subject of his choice Ms Irene Moosen of Grueneich Resource Advocates who will make a presentation on the distributed generation case before the PUC and William Freddo of PGE National Energy Group who will give us some education on operating a power plant inside the New England ISO Now for your daily bread provided this week by Dan Douglass Last week we had a joke about Catholics This week its agnostics An atheist was taking a walk thru the woods admiring all that the accident of evolution had created What majestic trees What powerful rivers What beautiful animals he said to himself As he was walking alongside the river he heard a rustling in the bushes behind him As he turned to look he saw a foot grizzly bear charging towards him He ran as fast as he could up the path He looked over his shoulder and saw that the bear was closing in on him He tried to run even faster so scared that tears were coming to his eyes His heart was pumping frantically as he tried to run even faster but he tripped and fell on the ground He rolled over to pick himself up and saw the bear right on top of him raising its paw to kill him At that instant he cried out Oh my God And time stopped The bear froze The forest was silent The river even stopped flowing A bright light shone upon the man and a voice out of the sky said You deny my existence all these years teach others I dont exist and even credit my creation to a cosmic accident and now do you expect me to help you out of this predicament Am I to count you as a believer The atheist ever so proud looked into the light and said It would be rather hypocritical to ask to be counted as a believer after all these years but could you make the bear a believer Very well said the voice And the light went out the river flowed the sounds of the forest continued and the bear brought both paws together bowed his head and said Lord I thank you for this food which I am about to receive Amen And have a great weekend Oh and thanks to all of you who sent me happy birthday wishes It was very much appreciated KSB gba atthtm

hint of Autumn in the air I donFt know if itFs wishful thinking or if the seasons are really beginning to turn from our pale summer into a Bay Area glorious Fall ItFs premature I know A few fallen leaves the start of schools slightly longer afternoon shadows IFm jumping the gun I canFt wait for this summer to be over especially this summer The pounding never stops and as I hear the din of the cash register ringing with each climb in Southwest temperature I can barely keep track of all the hiccups which drive prices up fires in Montana restricting transmission paths blown up interstate gas pipeline in New Mexico diminishing NOx credits for instate power plants depleted inventory of hours of voluntary load interruptions for commercial and industrial customers credit limits restricting imports of Canadian power into the Northwest and California and BPA buying about MW to cover its short hydro position I also get the willies every time another politician lambastes the California restructured power industry I just want to end to the summer now and start a two week Fall vacation anywhere even in Cleveland There are seven count them seven investigations into some aspect of the wholesale power market out here Two days ago there were only six but FERC just added another yesterday in response to the PrezFs request That means FERC has two the PUC has two the State Attorneys General has two one on the ISO Governing Board and one on the instate generators and one by the Electric Oversight Board If you donFt have an ongoing study of the California Market then youFre not hip All of these investigations save FERCFs Section Investigation are going to amount to near nothing A lot of wasted time and paper The PUC and EOB studies have their conclusion sections all finished Now they need some evidence to support their assertions And how are we holding up under all of this How are you doing I talk to many of you throughout the week and I know how frustrated you are I share your frustration You want to tell the public the press and anyone in between the truth You want to lay out the facts You want to show anyone who will listen that each interference into the market is making things worse not better The price caps for example are damnable and screwing up the prices much to the detriment of those people for who price caps were supposed to be a protection against price shocks Now they are receiving higher average prices The public isnFt going to listen to anything longer than a sound bite And letFs face it when it comes to stellar public relations our industry is not known for turning in A performances except for SCE Those guys seem to get their story in front of the public at every turn I heard SCE is putting on their customersF bill FHere is what you would have paid if the rate freeze ended F But many of us in the new power industry borne from the loins of either the naturalgas industry or nuclearpower business learned the hard way that the best response to a public inquiry is a twoblock head start in front of an angry mob Keep your head down shut your mouth and this too shall pass I donFt buy that approach at least not anymore That is I donFt believe we have anything to hide or of which to be ashamed What electric restructuring is about is correct beneficial to the public and in everyoneFs best interests Look at it this way when they pat the last shovelful of dirt on your final resting place for what do you most want to be remembered That you caved in to the political will of others or at a moment when you had the chance you did what was right instead of what was expedient I think the choice is easy albeit laced with sheer terror Those bland homilies I so diligently teach my kids eg tell the truth do what is right think of the big picture and not just yourself are a lot easier to speak than to live by So join me and stand up for what you believe They canFt take away your pride not yet Here is this weekFs line up Things in the PeopleFs Republic of California Excerpts from FERCFs Order on SDGE Complaint The Development of a SuperPeak Block Energy Product The Mailbag A Letter from My Friend and A Response Odds and Ends Finish the Story Contest October General Meeting What Makes Houston Houston Things in the PeopleFs Republic of California Excerpts from FERCFs Order on SDGE Complaint President Clinton commented from the Rose Garden that good folks in San Diego retired fixedincome likely to vote for a Democrat are making choices between buying medicine or air conditioning their homes I call this the Del Monica Beach lecture The Prez instructed the FERC to investigate the situation in California and FERC wasted no time In response to SDGEFs August complaint whereby the utility asked FERC to impose a price cap on generators in the region the FERC responded in a way that I was hoping to see several months ago The FERC slammed SDGE on their complaint for lack of merit and the FERC also initiated an FPA Section Investigation into the wholesale power market in California Here are some of the juicy excerpts from FERCFs Order FIn this order we are denying SDGEs requested immediate imposition of a price cap on all sellers in California However we are instituting consolidated hearing proceedings pursuant to section of the Federal Power Act to investigate the justness and reasonableness of the rates and charges of public utilities that sell energy and ancillary services to or through the California ISO and PX and to also investigate whether the tariffs and institutional structures and bylaws of the California ISO and PX are adversely affecting the efficient operation of competitive wholesale electric power markets in California and need to be modified FSDGE concludes that the markets cannot be workably competitive if sellers are able to exact prices that are considerably above levels that would prevail in open competition ie sellers are able to bid and receive prices significantly above their marginal costs SDGE also argues that the hourtohour volatility in imbalance energy prices and the erratic clearing price for ancillary services is an indication that the market is breaking down when it is moderately stressed FWhile we find it appropriate to institute a section hearing on these issues we cannot implement an immediate price cap of MWh as requested by SDGE because there is no record before us to support such an action While the issues raised by this complaint are important the Commission has no basis to conclude that SDGEs proposal to place an immediate arbitrary MWh cap on the price that every public utility seller of energy and ancillary services may bid into the PX and ISO markets would satisfy this standard SDGE has provided no evidence to demonstrate that all potential sellers are able to exercise market power has not documented a single instance of a seller exercising market power during times of scarcity and did not attempt to show that the conditions underlying the Commissions approval of marketbased rates for public utility sellers of energy and ancillary services have changed Nor did it address specific market or institutional factors that may be causing rates to be unjust or unreasonable FSDGE asserts that the ISOs congestion management and market structures are flawed and in need of overhaul Furthermore SDGE expresses its concern that for a number of reasons the congestion management and market reform efforts being pursued by ISO stakeholders will not produce meaningful results SDGE indicates that it is prepared to work with the ISO to develop alternative reform proposals however SDGEs complains that the ISO stakeholder process has in SDGEs judgment been ineffective with respect to these issues FVarious interveners contend that SDGEs arguments are premature We agree with Interveners The reform efforts have been the subject of extensive public review and comment and are nearing completion Accordingly we reject SDGEs arguments at this time FIt is unclear whether SDGEs failure to purchase hedging instruments for its retail operations is due to state regulatory policies or its business decisions A retail rate design that exposes consumers to the volatility of commodity prices would be extraordinary particularly when consumers do not have the ability to receive or respond to price signals FWe are concerned that increasing level of market activity in the realtime market raises significant reliability and economical concerns Historically the ISO procures on a daily basis only the resources needed for the operating day Not only does this procurement practice put pressure on the grid operator to secure needed resources at the last minute but the practice is uneconomical Such spotmarket purchases are not subject to the ISOs buyers cap Furthermore because the ISO is the supplier of last resort for these services when OOM calls are made suppliers realize that the ISO is in a mustbuy situation FIn an effort to address this problem we direct the ISO to immediately institute a more forward approach to procuring the resources necessary to reliably operate the grid Specifically the ISO should anticipate the need for such additional resources based on forecasted peak periods We direct the ISO to factor these reforms into an analysis of the need for and level of purchase price caps and to include this analysis as support for any filing it makes to extend its purchase price cap authorityF In closing WPTF is an intervenor in the case and we hope to be very active in the case through testimony cross examination the filing of briefs and reply briefs Things in the PeopleFs Republic of California The Development of a SuperPeak Block Energy Product Several weeks ago I discussed with the ISO their interest in developing a new market for a block energy product that would be purchased in the morning of a trade day and be dispatched during the superpeak hours I challenged them to let the market participants develop this market instead of the ISO doing the same At the August ISO Governing Board meeting I stated as the WPTF position that we oppose price caps but if the ISO Governing Board insisted on going down the MWH price cap route we would do what ever we could to help the situation and avoid the occurrences of Stage alerts Whereas I didnFt think about the conversation on superpeak block markets as being relevant to the remarks before the Governing Board it became painfully clear soon after that we could and should work with the ISO to develop a new market through either APX or the California PX or both to bring some order to the otherwise chaotic Out of Market system This week WPTF and the ISO had a joint meeting whereby both sides discussed the merits of a superpeak block firmenergy product and how it could be instituted The meeting at the ISO at which WPTF had many of its members who either have generation in the State or import power into California was for market participants and the ISO to discuss how to bring more order and price transparency to the ISOs out of market calls The ISO reported that this summer to date the amount of money spent on Out of Market purchases was about million Last year the total cost of Out of Market purchases was million APX and CalPX in response to our earlier discussions with them presented their proposals at the meeting The discussions which ensued during the course of the presentations focused on how the ISO might utilize a productservice to reduce the manpower requirements currently needed to satisfy its out of market telephone calls typically on short notice and the interest on the part of market participants to make bids into either the APX or CalPXs proposed system for a superpeak firmenergy product There were no commitments made by any party simply a willingness to work together to alleviate the problems associated with finding sufficient electric power during high demand periods with greater transparency more participants and greater market efficiency WeFll keep you posted on our development of this market The Mailbag A Letter from My Friend and A Response Sometimes I share bites of our Burrito with fellow travellers much as I did last week when I sent my friend Mike Florio a copy of the story called the Trial of Gow Jing Mike sent me a note that I would like to share He said I could I want you to read it and appreciate that there are other people who share his view I also copied the response I sent to Michael aka Old Deuteronomy Michael wrote FIm not going to attempt to complete your little melodrama the GowJing story but I did want to offer an observation In simpler times people knew the other people that they did business with and they typically lived in the same community If a merchant tried to charge exorbitant prices for his products even if he was the only one in town who had the product in stock he would face the wrath of his fellow citizens This undoubtedly served as a constraint on such behavior even in the absence of a CPUC or FERC Telling Mrs Jones that the loaf of bread she needs to feed her kids will cost her would not be a pleasant way to do business and such things ordinarily did not happen FIn the modern global economy of course this personal aspect of doing business has been almost completely lost And so has the restraint I have no doubt that the folks who sell electricity are good people jeez I know many of them but they work in an environment where the end results of their business decisions are invisible If Mrs Jones cant afford to run her refrigerator any more that fact is at best dimly perceived and if so it is viewed as cause for some sort of social program not a reason why a merchant would alter his behavior FThis is clearly not a case of socialism versus capitalism because both scenarios occur within the overall context of a capitalist system But certainly something fundamental has changed and not for the better in my view Now everyone feels compelled to squeeze the last dollar out of every transaction their jobs may even depend upon it and no one is responsible for the end result Is this the kind of world we want to live in FPUT THAT IN YOUR BURRITO AND SEE WHAT YOUR READERS SAY YOU CAN EVEN BLAME ME SO THAT YOU ARE NOT ACCUSED OF TURNING PINK IN YOUR MIDDLE AGE DeutF Okay ItFs in the Burrito And here is what I think You allude to the change in a world that was once Fmore personalF and is now institutional You make the point that things are not better off if for no other reason then the lack of personal accountability But I donFt think that in all cases the more personal world is lost It is ever present as I will argue below Second your group embraces the impersonal FefficienciesF when it is convenient Finally and most importantly where will your socialminded and like minded counterparts be when competitive forces leap supply ahead of demand which might happen in a handful of years However your essential point is not lost on me I do believe that there are ways for generators and consumers to be good neighbors in California I have a proposal below to which I would like to hear your response First though the personal business touch is present in our economy I exercise the restraint to which your story pines in many of my consulting engagements which require financial give and take between client and vendor It is simply smart business to do so I have been the beneficiary of the same with my local bank when errors occurred in my checking accounts or when loan payments were made absent mindedly late etc and the late fee forgiven However much of our economy and certainly the trade of a commodity such as electricity requires the use of markets Nameless and faceless they do squeeze out all the efficiencies which lead to lower prices more innovation and a sharing of price risk with parties who are neither the ultimate consumer nor the initial producer The producer and consumer get out of the risk arbitrage and leave it to others who are more skilled and monied I find it ironic that TURN then is so insistent on arguing as it has done on many many occasions for the relaxation of market separation in the ISOFs congestion management reform Elimination of market separation is nothing more than the impersonal forcing of parties to execute trades on either side of a congested transmission path in the name of market efficiency Lower prices for consumers Does it really matter if it is done through person to person transactions or through markets Third your story can be used to make an alternative point What happens to the merchant in town when WalMart moves into the next town down the road All the faithful customers that your Merchant of Vengeance was protecting suddenly migrate to a competitor with greater inventory more choice and lower prices What do you say then The corollary for us is direct The new generation owners moved literally billions of dollars into California at risk and took a chance It paid off They succeeded as we all know this year and probably will next year and so on But the MW of new power plants under construction in California and the MW under construction in Arizona and the over MW of combined power projects in California Arizona and Southern Nevada that are in line for permits will change the financial landscape in a hurry once energized The prices will soften returns will be less cherry and I really want to know where will todayFs accusers be when there is a shake out Consumers will reap that benefit oh you best believe it But the alliances to which your opening story alludes simply misses that point You gotta make hay while the sun shines Now to my proposal Michael I would be willing to work with you to develop some kind of loan program for residential and small commercial customers that would in effect reduce the economic hardship of higher electricity prices I could imagine although I havenFt tested the idea with any parties that a significant program could be crafted possibly secured by the credit of participating generating companies and executed by a commercial lending institution such as Bank of America Borrowers would pay a fair interest rate and the administrative fees ItFs simply smart business not charity ItFs one way to amortize th e earnings which came about due to a circumstance of short supply relative to the sudden growth of demand for power Maybe that is a step in the right direction I donFt know One could argue that it is no different than SDGE implementing a level payment plan for itFs consumers True it is no different because in either case the customer is paying for the loan interest and administrative fees and I consistently believe that a market for credit is more efficient am I getting impersonal than one instituted by a monopoly Second the security for these loans is provided by parties other than the utilityFs customers Further we wouldnFt have to wor ry about PUC oversight and prudence reviews We could make this work quickly I will be very interested to hear your thoughts and the comments of my members Thanks for sending us your letter Odds and Ends Finish the Story Contest Well there was only one response and that was from Carl Imparato Here is what Carl said FAm I missing something Who is GowJing supposed to represent Yes I get the pun in the name But is he also just an anonymous everyman or is there someone in particular FMy first response to your question is that GowJing simply replies FItaiF You could look it up I think its Chinese for Fit hurt sF Then he takes out a concealed axe goes on a rampage and kills everyone But thats too realistic so dont use that ending Instead FEnding Just as he was about to reply a giant foot wall of water swept through the room drowning everyone And they lived happily ever after The end I havenFt decided whether to name this response CarlFs Gilgamesh Epic Ie Noah and the flood or CarlFs Hydro Dream WeFll leave the contest open for another week CanFt let bucks go the only entry WhereFs the competition Odds and Ends October General Meeting Barb Ennis our

Douglass of Arter and Hadden sent us the following item Houston the unofficial home of the electric power industry is a town you either love or hate Here are some guiding principles offered by the Chamber of Commerce of the th largest city to enable their many visitors to cope F First you must learn to pronounce the city name It is YEWSTUN a nd it does not matter how people pronounce it in other places F Forget the traffic rules you learned elsewhere Houston has its ow n version of traffic rules Never forget that downtown Houston is composed entirely of one way streets The only way to get out of center of town is to turn around and start over when you reach Dallas Texas F All directions start with Go down Westheimer F Westheimer has no beginning and no end F Its impossible to go around a block and wind up on the street yo u started on The Chamber of Commerce calls this a scenic drive F The am rush hour is from to am The pm rush hour is from to pm Fridays rush hour starts on Thursday morning F If you actually stop at a yellow light you cannot be from Houston F Kuykendahl Road can only be pronounced by a native so do not attempt the phonetic pronunciation People will simply tilt their heads to the right and stare at you F Construction on the Gulf Freeway is a way of life and a permanent form of entertainment F Many bizarre sights can be explained simply by uttering the phrase Oh were in Montrose F Construction crews arent doing their job properly unless they close down all lanes except one during rush hour F If someone actually has their turn signal on it was probably lef t on at the factory where the car was made F White haired men driving red or silver sports cars will not obey a ny known traffic rule and cannot be expected to stop for red lights or stop signs F All ladies with blue hair who drive Cadillacs or Lincoln Continentals have the right of way F The above mentioned blue haired ladies also have a legal right to turn right from a left lane or to turn left from a right lane YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED F Buying a Houston street map is a waste of money since there is absolutely no way that you can route yourself in such a manner as to avoid major road construction F Houston natives are so rare that they are listed on the endangered species list The few remaining specimens are kept in a controlled environment for their own safety F Sir and Maam are used by the person speaking to you if theres a remote possibility that youre at least minutes older than they are F Sugar is a more common form of address than Miss So is Honey Do not take offense This is how southerners address grown women F In Houston we drink CocaCola and Dr Pepper It is rumored that other soft drinks are sold here but no one will admit to knowing anyone who actually drinks them So dont ask for any other soft drink F What you need to know when arriving at Bush Intercontinental Airport Your arrival gate is at least miles away from the Main Concourse of any terminal Walking heels on your boots or walking shoes are advised F Never honk your horn at another car in Houston traffic The bumper sticker that reads Keep honking Im reloading is considered fair warning DDDDDDDDDDDDD Have a great weekend yFall gba

You donFt believe in marketsF I retorted FOh I believe in them but I remember when I was short on a MW trade and without any notice or advanced warning the price in the Midwest market went against meF Dave recalled FI called everyone who I tra ded with and they had nothing I finally called XXXXX and I asked what will it cost for MWF FWhy didnFt you ask for F I wondered FI didnFt want to show him my

asked I took that and he priced the next MW at F lamented Dave FHe just wanted to see how far he could push me ThatFs what I mean when I say the traders are jigging itF FBut Dave you old communist your forgetting the trading function is what mitigates the risk The traders are the in between people who guess at the price Sometimes they guess right and sometimes they guess wrong But the damage or the reward is on their book not passed on to the ultimate consumer It has nothing to do with the marginal cost of a generating plantF And there you have it Put in a price cap and the traders have a

prices the whole country has seen over the last few months No effort is made by the government to shield the consumer from how much it costs to fill their gas tank No mention is made of those who cant afford to drive to the grocery store because they cant afford the extra or cents a gallon The costs are passed along to the consumer without pause Granted there are differences between the unleaded market and the electricity market in terms of demandside responsiveness but then again is it that much different to say FI cant drive today because gas is too expensiveF vs FI cant turn up the AC

PUCEOB report was very good I decided to excerpt the best sections of it for the Burrito The full document can be found on the ISOFs website F the PUCEOB Report asserts that the suspected activities of certain generators on June created frequency instability leading to the Bay Area blackouts the following day In fact the events of June and June were completely independent of one another The voltage instability on June was caused by system conditions on that day alone exceptionally high loads insufficient generation in the specific local area and transmission constraints that prevented the import of generation from outside the area FThe Report states that the ISO Fnever triedF to call upon consume rs to reduce demand in order to avoid the Bay Area blackouts In fact the ISO had in place on June a number of demand response programs designed to reduce load including the Summer Demand Response Program under which customers have agreed through a prior solicitation to curtail energy use in exchange for a fee FThe Report makes a number of assertions concerning the prices paid by FpurchasersF of energy as a result of the recent price spikes eg billion in the month of June alone These assertions leave one with the mistaken impression that these prices reflect amounts actually paid by the UDCs andor passed through to customers However in determining the total cost of energy one must determine the impact of any forward contracts entered into by the UDCs in advance of the wholesale energy markets These contracts which are designed to FlockinF a specific price in advance of realtime or near realtime market activities are specifically designed to mitigate the impact of price volatility and are standard in all commodities markets We have reason to believe that some of the UDCs were substantially hedged during the period of the recent price spikes FIn a similar vein the reports asserts that California Fmight well F have saved million dollars had a price cap been in place in May and June This assertion assumes that all energy purchases would have been made at or below the bid cap In fact during times of peak demand when all of the stateFs generation has been exhausted the ISO competes with neighboring regions for available generation In order to secure the necessary power the ISO must purchase on a bilateral basis this energy from resources located outside of the ISOFs control area FThe Report asserts that California power markets Fare not now competitiveF and implies erroneously in our view that this is the normal state of affairs It is not The Market Surveillance Committee has noted that Fmarket power in the California energy market appears to arise primarily during periods of peak demandF and warned that demand growth would increase the incidence of market power during the summer of FThe Report asserts that the ISO is answerable only to a selfinterested board and not to the citizens of California This simply is not the case The ISO is subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act and to the rules and regulations of FERC which dictate in part that wholesale energy rates must be just and reasonable and in the public interest

California supply conditions have been affected by restructuring and that somehow the restructuring choices have made California more vulnerable to supply shortages This assertion is unfounded Significant load growth in California and neighboring states coupled with a lack of significant infrastructure investment in both generation and transmission have caused this vulnerability

her precocious preteen child Stevie Wonderboy They are searching for electric power plants in the dessert which by the grace of God have been shipped to other countries which have more liberal returns on investment Being the first speaker Mr Keese took at least half the heat storm of the day The rage of the Energy Fuhrer was palpable Last week San Diegans shed MW of load last week to save the entire system and did not receive one penny of compensation IFm not making that up He said it He is sick of hearing about demand management as being a solution for the problem over the last five years and he is about done listening People in San Diego are depressed by the sudden price hikes Yikes Keese did mention that the California reserve margin has sunk to but in neighboring Arizona the reserve margin is or Mr Keese correctly pointed out that electric power is not solely a California problem it is a regional problem One member of the Committee asked what the legislature could do to speed up

PUC Things in the PeopleFs Republic of California PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market Well the official title is FOrder Instituting Investigation into the Functioning of the Wholesale Electric Market and Associated Impact on Retail Electric Rates in the Services Territory of San Diego Gas Electric CompanyF I like my title better This Order or OII was issued at the last business meeting of the Commission on August It calls for an investigation of the wholesale markets responses from the three UDCs and a prehearing conference in San Diego on August at the San Diego Convention Center Here are the questions the PUC wishes us to address F What bill payment options should be provided to assist residential a nd small commercial customers What does this have to do with the functioning of the wholesale market F Should SDGE be authorized to participate in bilateral contracts or other supply procurement activities How should the Commission assess reasonableness Are SDGEFs purchasing activities serving its customers on just and reasonable terms F What is SDGEFs obligation to minimize energy costs for its curre nt customers F How should the Commission Attorney General EOB ISO and PX coordinate to investigate wholesale market events behaviors and irregularities How should statefederal concerns be addressed F What are the causes of the price increases Are anticompeititve practices causing some of the price increases Are there mechanisms the Commission can employ to make ratepayers whole Odds Ends As promised last week I have a message from our event

Electric Market and Associated Impact on Retail Electric Rates in the Services Territory of San Diego Gas Electric CompanyF I like my title better This Order or OII was issued at the last business meeting of the Commission on August It calls for an investigation of the wholesale markets responses from the three UDCs and a prehearing conference in San Diego on August at the San Diego Convention Center Here are the questions the PUC wishes us to address F What bill payment options should be provided to assist residential a nd small commercial customers What does this have to do with the functioning of the wholesale market F Should SDGE be authorized to participate in bilateral contracts or other supply procurement activities How should the Commission assess reasonableness Are SDGEFs purchasing activities serving its customers on just and reasonable terms F What is SDGEFs obligation to minimize energy costs for its curre nt customers F How should the Commission Attorney General EOB ISO and PX coordinate to investigate wholesale market events behaviors and irregularities How should statefederal concerns be addressed F What are the causes of the price increases Are anticompeititve practices causing some of the price increases Are there mechanisms the Commission can employ to make ratepayers whole Odds Ends As promised last week I have a message from our event

fortune cookie and at least as accurate Everyone is getting into the act When I started this gig I was the only guy in town writing to folks like you about the power industry in California I wrote about whats new whats happening and all the important stuff This week Governor Gray Davis decided to write his own Burrito His epistle got more press than mine but why is he muscling in on my turf Not to be outdone PUC President Loretta Lynch released a report which looks into every facet of Californias power business No stone left unturned Im telling you there isnt enough room in this business for all of us They need to clear out With people like Herr Hair Peace Governor ImNot MrRogers Davis and Lets Do Lynch who needs a Friday Burrito They redefine our reality each week with mindnumbing aplomb For example starting in early June the PX was ordered to compete for business against other Qualified Trading Vehicles Then two weeks later the Energy Fhrer legislated that idea to an early death which kept the status quo for at least one year This week the PUC approved year bilateral deals for PGE and SCE thereby opening the PX to competition and emasculating the PXs Block Forward Market Zip bam boom I cant wait to see what next week will bring I hear Senator Bowen is holding Committee hearings on re regulating the industry and the Governors new Energy Security Council will meet to decide six things Whats for lunch Who will sit at the head of the table Does anyone have good seats for next weeks Democratic convention Is there anyone we havent indicted yet in the power industry Who will crank up the air conditioning in this room Its getting too warm Then they will collect data from innocent businesses under subpoena ignore the facts and publish a report It makes one want to take a deep breath and inhale the scented fumes of democracy You know I cant think about where to begin so lets start somewhere Things on the Island of California Is there anyone left at SDGE with a brain The PUC issues its scathing report The ISO invokes price caps Duh Things at the throne of FERC Amen for the Morgan Stanley Order Odds and Ends Things on the Island of California Is there anyone left at SDGE with a brain Well the answer very clearly is no I have been astounded by repeated attempts of SDGEs most senior people to ape humans but instead they mimic apes Consider the following First they waltz their default customers into the summer with little of no protection from price spikes in the wholesale market Forgivable in that it is human to err The prices skyrocket in June and they start looking for who to blame Must be them damn independent generatorsO say their managers Gary Cotton informs the ISO Governing Board that hedging SDGEs position in the Block Forward Market wouldnt have made any difference Theres one nobel laureate who missed his prime Next under pressure they ask for help from suppliers and anyone else who will assist the utility and their customers Nine offers show up at their table and they cant choose any of them Again Mr Cotton tells his fellow ISO Governing Board members that these things take time and we dont to rush since there are many legislative barriers and well the surfing was good this week so why spoil it Now they are in a panic because the Energy Fhrer is visiting old ladies living in trailer parks advising them not to pay their SDGE electricity bill and to continue to operate their air conditioners SDGE puts a full page ad in the local newspaper telling everyone that SDGE is doing everything it can to lower their electric bills including asking the ISO for a price cap but the public can help by calling the ISO address and phone number provided in the ad and urging them to lower the cap I always thought the location of the ISO was a State secret for security reasons No secrets in San Diego But we are not done No sir we are not Those buffalo heads who run that company decide they will win a gold star on their collective foreheads and implement one of the four resolutions passed by the Electric Oversight Board The one they pick is to petition FERC on an expedited basis to cap at the price at which sellers may bid energy or ancillary services into the ISO and the PX The primary reason is that Western power markets are not workably competitive In other words they want FERC to set a max price on what generators can sell in addition to the price limit at which the ISO can buy What I find most astounding about this double talk is that SDGE continues to collect tons of money from the sales of regulatory must run energy into the PX These are sales from their stranded assets Their grief hasnt abated their greed So to recap SDGE missed the boat on price hedging failed to win consumer confidence in public meetings asked for help from suppliers and did nothing in response then filed at FERC to cap the sale price because the wholesale market into which they sell overpriced energy is not workably competitive Too much time in the direct sun light Things on the Island of California The PUC issues its scathing report The PUC report released yesterday is a gem with which I have not spent enough time I only read the Executive Summary and that only because our counsel Dan Douglass forwarded me a copy Let me pick out some of the gems in President Lets Do Lynchs burrito I would recommend reading the whole text if you have time and if you seek perverse entertainment California is experiencing major problems with electricity supply and pricing caused by policies and procedures adopted over the past ten years Since June wholesale prices for electrical power in California have increased on average over the same period in resulting in over billion in excess payments for electricity Hot weather aging power plant and transmission infrastructure and dysfunctional bidding behavior in the wholesale power markets combined to drive prices up Because of serious market defects and tight supply of electricity purchasers of California power will likely pay billions more in electricity costs this year Moreover these price increases do not necessarily fund new investments in electricity supply or delivery reliability they may flow solely to power producer profit margins Despite the Electricity Oversight Boards legislative mandate to oversee those institutions we have been unable to obtain bid data Nevertheless we believe enough evidence of questionable behavior exists that the Attorney General should conduct an investigation into these statewide market practices coordinating with other State agencies including the PUC and the EOB Such an investigation would provide the factual foundation that California policy makers and regulators need to recover any illegally obtained profits A momentous consequence of Californias attempt to create a market in electricity is that the federal government now regulates Californias electric system Washington DC now controls pricing decisions directly at the wholesale level and indirectly at the retail level and to the extent that supply incentives are correlated to prices Washington DC now affects Californias ability to attract new investment in power plants Past administrations willingness to cede the States authority to the federal government combined with the legislative creation of two nonpublic supervisory organizations that have no duty to protect the public or consider the retail customer The Independent System Operator ISO and the Power Exchange PX the nonprofit private corporations that operate the States transmission system and control wholesale pricing policies are governed by boards whose members can have serious conflicts of interest Some of these board members or their companies financially benefit from higher prices in electricity markets Neither of these private organizations is accountable to the State or its consumers Despite the federalization and the fragmentation of the States electric services the State of California should protect its businesses and consumers from cartel pricing collusive behavior inadequate power plant maintenance and lack of market planning for adequate electricity supplies California consumers and businesses deserve to know in advance as San Diegans did not this summer how and when the price of an essential service like electricity will double California is now largely constrained by federal mandates from providing comprehensive retail price relief as long as wholesale prices remain so high If California tried to reimpose a price freeze in San Diego now federal regulators would likely prevent that action Shortterm price relief however cannot resolve market gaming or fundamental wholesale pricing problems controlled by federal regulators We have been precluded from obtaining the data necessary to know if the ISO and PX failed to detect manipulation and gaming on several fronts We do not know how market players acted in price offering and bidding and scheduling The FERC has just announced an inquiry into national pricing and energy market issues California should not wait for national findings before it investigates California market practices We recommend that the California Attorney General immediately subpoena relevant records and data to determine the pricing and offering behavior of market participants the actions of the ISO and its board members and the actions of generators in supplying Californias energy needs Ten Actions to Consider or Act Upon to Prevent Current Electricity Problems From Spreading in Create a California Energy Council modeled on the National Security Council to unify State action to resolve energy problems and to perform integrated energy planning Ask FERC for extended wholesale price cap authority to moderate California wholesale market pricing Ask FERC to recognize the defects in the California and western regional markets and find that no competitive market exists in California power markets Eliminate potential conflicts of interest in ISOPX stakeholder boards Improve Californias ability to obtain ISO and generator data and enhance the States enforcement capability for power plant maintenance price manipulation and generation gaming consistent with protection of proprietary business information Provide the EOB with effective enforcement ability and additional oversight authority for the ISO and PX Ten Issues to Consider or Act Upon Within the Next Six Months Streamline state power plant siting procedures consistent with environmental requirements and prioritize applications to advance clean BACT power plant proposals Institute useit or loseit permitting power plant licensing and emissions credits rules to ensure power plants get built Reform PX pricing protocols and structures to lower wholesale and retail prices and reduce excess profitsO I told you I dont need to write a Burrito anymore The Democrats in Sacramento are doing that for me Welcome comrade Things on the Island of California The ISO invokes price caps Duh It is really hard to describe the drama of an ISO Governing Board meeting especially when our favorite topic arises It seems the only time the Board becomes animated is when one of three issues are on the agenda price caps FTRs and priorities for software enhancements Otherwise its pretty much humdrum Round and round we went once again A few more forced votes tipped the scale in favor of the cap There were yes votes which included a forced yes vote from our friend Jerry Toenyes by order of Secretary of Energy Mr Richardson Jerry did you realize that the last letters of your name could be rearranged to spell NO ET YESO Kind of a french thing Im sorry about that vote Jerry You still go in my book as one of the brave and bold for standing up to that sort of intimidation for so long Your picture in the SF Chron said it all The brave souls who stood tall and voted NO included David Parquet Enron Jan SmutnyJones IEP Barbara Barkovich CLECA Caolyn Kehrein CMA Dan Kirshner EDF and Stacy Roscoe Procter Gamble Now I must admit that Dynegys Greg Blue did help by voting a Texas No spelled ABSTAINO I have instructed Dynegy trader Dave Francis in Houston to work with Greg to correct that problem Were going to work things out The Energy Fhrer addressed the Board again I didnt mind that I only had a few brief very brief moments to address the Board and Herr Hair Peace got over minutes That didnt bother me at all He did more damage to himself in than I could do in He blasted away at everyone who opposed him He pined about Camden quitting the Board He said he knew how prices and markets work that it isnt the way those academic egghead FERCloving economists tell you who pray to the gods of competition He lambasted WAPA for withholding generation to protect fish and wildlife what was that all about He predicted that on Thursdays PUC meeting he and all the other powerful Democrats Republicans and angry citizens of San Diego would demand that the PUC impose a rate cap on retail electric rates in San Diego that are just and reasonable it didnt happen And on and on and on This man is very delusional He believes that Steve and only Steve Peace can save the world He believes that political will trumps judicial quasijudicial or independent Board actions This man makes relevant all the abstract musings of the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche The will to power the bermensch the transvaluation of values etc But we are getting under uber his skin with the help of the press Wednesday afternoon I called Commissioner Dick Bilas to see if he thought whether the next days PUC meeting was going to be a roll over Dick said he got a call from Peace and that Peace said he would not come to the meeting Apparently Peace had received a lot of press and all of it bad Thats the thin line of freedom which keeps tyranny at least one step away from our front door Things at the throne of FERC Amen for the Morgan Stanley Order And now the good news You deserve this FERC gave the California market a little wiggle room last Friday FERC issued a last minute reply to the complaint by Morgan Stanley Capital Group relating to the ISOs intent to lower the price cap FERC denied the complaint but they didnt waste time with an Order to simply deny a complaint FERC danced on the head of the ISO and pulled the bite out of the price cap Here are some excerpts We accepted this Amendment not because it was a cap on sellers prices but because it would promote order and transparency in the market by clearly telling sellers of the maximum price the ISO was willing to pay and allowing sellers to make informed economic choices on whether to sell in the ISO market or to sell elsewhere The ISO has no more or less ability to procure capacity and energy than any other buyer of these services If the ISO is unable to elicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced purchase price ceiling because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they choose it will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to meet its needs Therefore an increase in outofmarket OOM calls for generation may be necessary to maintain system reliability Because the current payment for OOM is not subject to a maximum purchase price the resulting overall payments may be higher To the extent the ISO Board resolution contemplates implementing a directive that generators must bid their capacity into the ISO markets under any circumstances eg when system load exceeds MW such a requirement is not permitted by our Order and the ISO tariff Future implementation of the ISO Board resolution with regard to a requirement to sell would require significant revisions to the ISO market rules Such market changes could not become effective absent a corresponding amendment to the ISO tariff which would have to be filed under section of the FPAO Well What do you think about that Just wait Here is what the sleeping bear Commissioner Hebert said in his concurring remarks Getting to the bottom of the problem in my view requires us to begin a proceeding to rescind our approval of the ISO as the operator of the California grid The record supports such a move A memorandum to the ISO from a stakeholder who resigned from the governing board eloquently brings to our attention repeated attempts to undermine the independence of the ISO The memorandum also thoughtfully outlines consequences to the markets of a return to command and control Because these allegations come from a nonmarket participant especially should we take heed We must also take notice of the public pressure on the Board to compromise its independenceO Amen brother amen Odds and Ends As you can imagine this week like an endless string of weeks before this has been interminable I get about three phone calls a day from press reporters very little of which ever sees print My shtick is just too complex for casual readers But I do notice that the reporters are asking better questions The public is becoming more savvy The information flow is moving in our favor and will disarm the forces of evil in about years I have other problems on my mind I am working on a new computer system Really its just an upgrade of an older computer that is a bit faster than the laptop I tried to upgrade very unsuccessfully As a result of the all the new hardware and software I purchased my office looks like a war zone with an odd mix of PUC service copies computer documentation and diskettes laying all around Quite a mess Prepare for the future Our next general meeting is scheduled for Thursday and Friday October and at Moro Bay Barb Ennis will prepare a blurb for us in next weeks Burrito about room reservations timing golf etc Our guest speakers will include MSC Chairman Professor Frank Wolak who will talk on the subject of his choice Ms Irene Moosen of Grueneich Resource Advocates who will make a presentation on the distributed generation case before the PUC and William Freddo of PGE National Energy Group who will give us some education on operating a power plant inside the New England ISO Now for your daily bread provided this week by Dan Douglass Last week we had a joke about Catholics This week its agnostics An atheist was taking a walk thru the woods admiring all that the accident of evolution had created What majestic trees What powerful rivers What beautiful animals he said to himself As he was walking alongside the river he heard a rustling in the bushes behind him As he turned to look he saw a foot grizzly bear charging towards him He ran as fast as he could up the path He looked over his shoulder and saw that the bear was closing in on him He tried to run even faster so scared that tears were coming to his eyes His heart was pumping frantically as he tried to run even faster but he tripped and fell on the ground He rolled over to pick himself up and saw the bear right on top of him raising its paw to kill him At that instant he cried out Oh my God And time stopped The bear froze The forest was silent The river even stopped flowing A bright light shone upon the man and a voice out of the sky said You deny my existence all these years teach others I dont exist and even credit my creation to a cosmic accident and now do you expect me to help you out of this predicament Am I to count you as a believer The atheist ever so proud looked into the light and said It would be rather hypocritical to ask to be counted as a believer after all these years but could you make the bear a believer Very well said the voice And the light went out the river flowed the sounds of the forest continued and the bear brought both paws together bowed his head and said Lord I thank you for this food which I am about to receive Amen And have a great weekend Oh and thanks to all of you who sent me happy birthday wishes It was very much appreciated KSB gba atthtm

those folks smoking crackF he asked in an outrage My friend OlF Dave in Houston has trouble understanding the workings of our power business here in California In fact so do I YesterdayFs Joint SenateAssembly Committee on Energy and Natural Resources did nothing to improve either DaveFs or my understanding of the national embarrassment California is perpetrating with electricity deregulation FThe next thing you know they will be taking property and forcing utilities to build power plants and transmissionF he mused between sips of Dixie longneck beer and chomps of jalapeno peppers FCome to think of it Dave they did say something about that YeahF I recalled FSenator Peace was expounding on his favorite idea which is forcing the ISO or the utilities to build peakers and not let the market build them I canFt remember if that was before or after he suggested to EOB Chairman Kahn that the ISO and the PX should be folded into State agencies under the direction of the Electric Oversight BoardF I know what you are thinking right now The next thing you know California will have regulated retail rates That recipe should be out of the PUCFs oven sometime next week FWell the power marketers are jigging the system bidding up to the ISOFs bid cap There is no way you can tell me that a generator planned to make MWH in its pro formaF Dave added FSo you agree with Herr Hair Peace You donFt believe in marketsF I retorted FOh I believe in them but I remember when I was short on a MW trade and without any notice or advanced warning the price in the Midwest market went against meF Dave recalled FI called everyone who I tra ded with and they had nothing I finally called XXXXX and I asked what will it cost for MWF FWhy didnFt you ask for F I wondered FI didnFt want to show him my position You get hosed when you show the buyer your position Ask for firstF Dave chided FWhat happenedF FOh they offered to sell for MWH I said I Fd take it and then said I needed another fifty He asked I took that and he priced the next MW at F lamented Dave FHe just wanted to see how far he could push me ThatFs what I mean when I say the traders are jigging itF FBut Dave you old communist your forgetting the trading function is what mitigates the risk The traders are the in between people who guess at the price Sometimes they guess right and sometimes they guess wrong But the damage or the reward is on their book not passed on to the ultimate consumer It has nothing to do with the marginal cost of a generating plantF And there you have it Put in a price cap and the traders have a target for which to shoot I canFt prove the following yet but IFl l wager with any of you that as the price cap level dips down the average trading price climbs even as the socalled FdysfunctionalF price spik es are eliminated Consumers get hosed and the fundamental economic principle is upheld which is one can never be made better off with the imposition of an additional constraint I feel better already Here is what is on our short agenda this week Things in the Mailbag Things in the PeopleFs Republic of California The ISO Replies to the EOB Report Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market Odds Ends Things in the Mailbag It has been awhile since we put the mail feedbag on and had a munch Here is what my friends have been writing me FPL EnergyFs Steve Ponder was only too quick to tell me FPlease Gary no more whining about your computer How old are you Is this the year you get the AARP letter A very depressing moment Do you really not know how to spell Morro Bay Please let us know what is going on with your sons hockey team Dont forget the cigars for Moron BayF It is good to have friends like Steve They make the pain of separation so much easier And Steve when you FPL guys get that Entergy merger sorted out in a dozen years or so you let us know I want to participate in the name selection for the new entity How about Fentergy PLus Next from the PXFs Mark Hoppe who writes FAs youve heard from others I dont know quite how you manage to knock out all this material each week The burrito is informative humorous and usually contains a sprinkle of irony tragedy ISO Drama Though you are usually neutral regarding the PX you are not unduly negative which I appreciate I think we do a pretty good job over here and so often people in the industry forget the amount effort and challenge it took the PX to successfully open this marketF Thanks Mark I just want you to know that my ability to write this stuff every week is not constrained by the facts or evidence I have learned from watching Herr Hair Peace that as long as you can talk write too fast and have conviction in your statements regardless of how groundless they may be you will have a willing and eager audience A few weeks ago I received from the PXFs Jennifer Sherwood a note which she wants you to know are her opinions not necessarily the PXFs ItFs okay Jennifer I paid Georgeyesterday the I owed him for that sham Rose Bowl bet remember Stanford lost and your opinions are cool with us FJust curious has anyone been comparing high unleaded prices to high CA electricity prices What I mean is we are up in arms about how we should protect the unfortunate San Diego consumer who cant afford to keep the AC on But what about the inflated unleaded gas prices the whole country has seen over the last few months No effort is made by the government to shield the consumer from how much it costs to fill their gas tank No mention is made of those who cant afford to drive to the grocery store because they cant afford the extra or cents a gallon The costs are passed along to the consumer without pause Granted there are differences between the unleaded market and the electricity market in terms of demandside responsiveness but then again is it that much different to say FI cant drive today because gas is too expensiveF vs FI cant turn up the AC today because its too expensiveFF Finally from one of our secret Washington readers and I am not telling who I received the following FI broke down and listened to the ISO Governing Board discussion and vote Ugh I too noted that the speak fast was applied to everyone but Herr Peace My goodness what a mess we have I loved Jerrys picture in USA Today it spoke volumes My sources at FERC tell me though that we should keep an eye out for FERC Chairman Hoecker to do something really Censored for political reasons Given no Commission meetings til September the only way to act is by unanimous consent so I would hope he cant do all that muchF Things in the PeopleFs Republic of California The ISO Replies to the EOB Report Several of you people commented to me that the ISOFs reply to the PUCEOB report was very good I decided to excerpt the best sections of it for the Burrito The full document can be found on the ISOFs website F the PUCEOB Report asserts that the suspected activities of certain generators on June created frequency instability leading to the Bay Area blackouts the following day In fact the events of June and June were completely independent of one another The voltage instability on June was caused by system conditions on that day alone exceptionally high loads insufficient generation in the specific local area and transmission constraints that prevented the import of generation from outside the area FThe Report states that the ISO Fnever triedF to call upon consume rs to reduce demand in order to avoid the Bay Area blackouts In fact the ISO had in place on June a number of demand response programs designed to reduce load including the Summer Demand Response Program under which customers have agreed through a prior solicitation to curtail energy use in exchange for a fee FThe Report makes a number of assertions concerning the prices paid by FpurchasersF of energy as a result of the recent price spikes eg billion in the month of June alone These assertions leave one with the mistaken impression that these prices reflect amounts actually paid by the UDCs andor passed through to customers However in determining the total cost of energy one must determine the impact of any forward contracts entered into by the UDCs in advance of the wholesale energy markets These contracts which are designed to FlockinF a specific price in advance of realtime or near realtime market activities are specifically designed to mitigate the impact of price volatility and are standard in all commodities markets We have reason to believe that some of the UDCs were substantially hedged during the period of the recent price spikes FIn a similar vein the reports asserts that California Fmight well F have saved million dollars had a price cap been in place in May and June This assertion assumes that all energy purchases would have been made at or below the bid cap In fact during times of peak demand when all of the stateFs generation has been exhausted the ISO competes with neighboring regions for available generation In order to secure the necessary power the ISO must purchase on a bilateral basis this energy from resources located outside of the ISOFs control area FThe Report asserts that California power markets Fare not now competitiveF and implies erroneously in our view that this is the normal state of affairs It is not The Market Surveillance Committee has noted that Fmarket power in the California energy market appears to arise primarily during periods of peak demandF and warned that demand growth would increase the incidence of market power during the summer of FThe Report asserts that the ISO is answerable only to a selfinterested board and not to the citizens of California This simply is not the case The ISO is subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act and to the rules and regulations of FERC which dictate in part that wholesale energy rates must be just and reasonable and in the public interest The ISO further operates under a detailed tariff reviewed and approved by FERC Every change to our market design and virtually every aspect of the ISOFs business is subject to review and scrutiny by FERC The FERC process provides substantial opportunities for input by the state agencies and such agencies have in fact been active participants in the FERC proceedings FThe Report asserts that California supply conditions have been affected by restructuring and that somehow the restructuring choices have made California more vulnerable to supply shortages This assertion is unfounded Significant load growth in California and neighboring states coupled with a lack of significant infrastructure investment in both generation and transmission have caused this vulnerability Restructuring has increased proposed power plant applications many fold Only by immediate and sustained attention to streamlining approval and siting processes for both of these critical infrastructure elements will this significant shortage be addressedF Things in the PeopleFs Republic of California Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings If you want to imagine a scary sight imagine then twelve California legislators gathering together in one hearing room to rectify the wrongs of electric restructuring Also imagine as if you are in the Twilight Zone witnesses that are slow on their feet and reckless in their facts Then you get a glimpse of what yesterdayFs Joint SenateAssembly hearing was like It started over two hours late The Senate was busy congratulating one of their own who is termlimited out next session and they wanted to heap on the glory That said the show began with CEC Commissioner Bill Keese Mr Keese has one story and regardless how well he tells it and he does it is always the same story It is the heat storm story One can imagine in the heat storm story a lead character who is a singlemom call her LadyBird Bowen who travels across an angry land with her precocious preteen child Stevie Wonderboy They are searching for electric power plants in the dessert which by the grace of God have been shipped to other countries which have more liberal returns on investment Being the first speaker Mr Keese took at least half the heat storm of the day The rage of the Energy Fuhrer was palpable Last week San Diegans shed MW of load last week to save the entire system and did not receive one penny of compensation IFm not making that up He said it He is sick of hearing about demand management as being a solution for the problem over the last five years and he is about done listening People in San Diego are depressed by the sudden price hikes Yikes Keese did mention that the California reserve margin has sunk to but in neighboring Arizona the reserve margin is or Mr Keese correctly pointed out that electric power is not solely a California problem it is a regional problem One member of the Committee asked what the legislature could do to speed up the power plant siting and construction process Keese referred to Governor Gray DavisF Executive Order issued last week to which the CEC plans to respond soon date uncertain that lays out a month permitting time line The six months are enough if the applicant has the land secured zoning okayed transmission access and air offsets Hmmmmmm That alone might take six months before you get to the CEC The next panel included Mr Kahn of the EOB and Ms Lynch I went too hard on her last week calling her LetFs Do Lynch That was a TPC Sorry I promise to be nicer starting now The Energy Fuhrer instructed Ms Lynch to use her authority to order SDGE to divert the pass through of funds from the customers to the PX until the dysfunction of the market is cured Put it in an escrow account Ms Lynch promised to review this option at her August PUC Meeting where she will enact SDGE rate caps told you The star of the day I thought was FERC General Counsel Doug Smith Mr Smith comes to Sacramento IsnFt that a switch Mr Smith came in place of Mr Hoecker thank the Lord Mr Smith put into FERCeese what these legislators could not get through their heads any other way The angry legislators were looking for a way for FERC to declare the wholesale market as noncompetitive and then ask the generators to give back the money they over collected When can we do that Mr Smith answered as only a FERC attorney can answer There is a process It takes time You must have evidence FERC uses a threepart criteria for assessing whether or not market based rates are allowable ItFs based on market concentration and dominance not the existence of high prices You would have to sue FERC in federal court and the best you could hope for is for FERC to reconsider its decision upon remand from the US Court of Appeals Slowly the wind came out of the sails of the gang of They were stumped Herr Hair Peace screamed couldnFt you Mr Smith of FERC today use your authority to declare the markets noncompetitive that generators who had market based rates have exercised market power and retroactively implement a rate cap across the Western region Like a wheezing accordion Mr Smith played back and forth the familiar strains of music like a solo street musician on the corner Back and forth the process the process the process There have been times in the past I hated the process at FERC Today I have a renewed respect for what process affords me and you Freedom from the tyranny of a mob For the remainder of the hearing they focused on remedies that could be undertaken by the PUC Things in the PeopleFs Republic of California PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market Well the official title is FOrder Instituting Investigation into the Functioning of the Wholesale Electric Market and Associated Impact on Retail Electric Rates in the Services Territory of San Diego Gas Electric CompanyF I like my title better This Order or OII was issued at the last business meeting of the Commission on August It calls for an investigation of the wholesale markets responses from the three UDCs and a prehearing conference in San Diego on August at the San Diego Convention Center Here are the questions the PUC wishes us to address F What bill payment options should be provided to assist residential a nd small commercial customers What does this have to do with the functioning of the wholesale market F Should SDGE be authorized to participate in bilateral contracts or other supply procurement activities How should the Commission assess reasonableness Are SDGEFs purchasing activities serving its customers on just and reasonable terms F What is SDGEFs obligation to minimize energy costs for its curre nt customers F How should the Commission Attorney General EOB ISO and PX coordinate to investigate wholesale market events behaviors and irregularities How should statefederal concerns be addressed F What are the causes of the price increases Are anticompeititve practices causing some of the price increases Are there mechanisms the Commission can employ to make ratepayers whole Odds Ends As promised last week I have a message from our event

hint of Autumn in the air I donFt know if itFs wishful thinking or if the seasons are really beginning to turn from our pale summer into a Bay Area glorious Fall ItFs premature I know A few fallen leaves the start of schools slightly longer afternoon shadows IFm jumping the gun I canFt wait for this summer to be over especially this summer The pounding never stops and as I hear the din of the cash register ringing with each climb in Southwest temperature I can barely keep track of all the hiccups which drive prices up fires in Montana restricting transmission paths blown up interstate gas pipeline in New Mexico diminishing NOx credits for instate power plants depleted inventory of hours of voluntary load interruptions for commercial and industrial customers credit limits restricting imports of Canadian power into the Northwest and California and BPA buying about MW to cover its short hydro position I also get the willies every time another politician lambastes the California restructured power industry I just want to end to the summer now and start a two week Fall vacation anywhere even in Cleveland There are seven count them seven investigations into some aspect of the wholesale power market out here Two days ago there were only six but FERC just added another yesterday in response to the PrezFs request That means FERC has two the PUC has two the State Attorneys General has two one on the ISO Governing Board and one on the instate generators and one by the Electric Oversight Board If you donFt have an ongoing study of the California Market then youFre not hip All of these investigations save FERCFs Section Investigation are going to amount to near nothing A lot of wasted time and paper The PUC and EOB studies have their conclusion sections all finished Now they need some evidence to support their assertions And how are we holding up under all of this How are you doing I talk to many of you throughout the week and I know how frustrated you are I share your frustration You want to tell the public the press and anyone in between the truth You want to lay out the facts You want to show anyone who will listen that each interference into the market is making things worse not better The price caps for example are damnable and screwing up the prices much to the detriment of those people for who price caps were supposed to be a protection against price shocks Now they are receiving higher average prices The public isnFt going to listen to anything longer than a sound bite And letFs face it when it comes to stellar public relations our industry is not known for turning in A performances except for SCE Those guys seem to get their story in front of the public at every turn I heard SCE is putting on their customersF bill FHere is what you would have paid if the rate freeze ended F But many of us in the new power industry borne from the loins of either the naturalgas industry or nuclearpower business learned the hard way that the best response to a public inquiry is a twoblock head start in front of an angry mob Keep your head down shut your mouth and this too shall pass I donFt buy that approach at least not anymore That is I donFt believe we have anything to hide or of which to be ashamed What electric restructuring is about is correct beneficial to the public and in everyoneFs best interests Look at it this way when they pat the last shovelful of dirt on your final resting place for what do you most want to be remembered That you caved in to the political will of others or at a moment when you had the chance you did what was right instead of what was expedient I think the choice is easy albeit laced with sheer terror Those bland homilies I so diligently teach my kids eg tell the truth do what is right think of the big picture and not just yourself are a lot easier to speak than to live by So join me and stand up for what you believe They canFt take away your pride not yet Here is this weekFs line up Things in the PeopleFs Republic of California Excerpts from FERCFs Order on SDGE Complaint The Development of a SuperPeak Block Energy Product The Mailbag A Letter from My Friend and A Response Odds and Ends Finish the Story Contest October General Meeting What Makes Houston Houston Things in the PeopleFs Republic of California Excerpts from FERCFs Order on SDGE Complaint President Clinton commented from the Rose Garden that good folks in San Diego retired fixedincome likely to vote for a Democrat are making choices between buying medicine or air conditioning their homes I call this the Del Monica Beach lecture The Prez instructed the FERC to investigate the situation in California and FERC wasted no time In response to SDGEFs August complaint whereby the utility asked FERC to impose a price cap on generators in the region the FERC responded in a way that I was hoping to see several months ago The FERC slammed SDGE on their complaint for lack of merit and the FERC also initiated an FPA Section Investigation into the wholesale power market in California Here are some of the juicy excerpts from FERCFs Order FIn this order we are denying SDGEs requested immediate imposition of a price cap on all sellers in California However we are instituting consolidated hearing proceedings pursuant to section of the Federal Power Act to investigate the justness and reasonableness of the rates and charges of public utilities that sell energy and ancillary services to or through the California ISO and PX and to also investigate whether the tariffs and institutional structures and bylaws of the California ISO and PX are adversely affecting the efficient operation of competitive wholesale electric power markets in California and need to be modified FSDGE concludes that the markets cannot be workably competitive if sellers are able to exact prices that are considerably above levels that would prevail in open competition ie sellers are able to bid and receive prices significantly above their marginal costs SDGE also argues that the hourtohour volatility in imbalance energy prices and the erratic clearing price for ancillary services is an indication that the market is breaking down when it is moderately stressed FWhile we find it appropriate to institute a section hearing on these issues we cannot implement an immediate price cap of MWh as requested by SDGE because there is no record before us to support such an action While the issues raised by this complaint are important the Commission has no basis to conclude that SDGEs proposal to place an immediate arbitrary MWh cap on the price that every public utility seller of energy and ancillary services may bid into the PX and ISO markets would satisfy this standard SDGE has provided no evidence to demonstrate that all potential sellers are able to exercise market power has not documented a single instance of a seller exercising market power during times of scarcity and did not attempt to show that the conditions underlying the Commissions approval of marketbased rates for public utility sellers of energy and ancillary services have changed Nor did it address specific market or institutional factors that may be causing rates to be unjust or unreasonable FSDGE asserts that the ISOs congestion management and market structures are flawed and in need of overhaul Furthermore SDGE expresses its concern that for a number of reasons the congestion management and market reform efforts being pursued by ISO stakeholders will not produce meaningful results SDGE indicates that it is prepared to work with the ISO to develop alternative reform proposals however SDGEs complains that the ISO stakeholder process has in SDGEs judgment been ineffective with respect to these issues FVarious interveners contend that SDGEs arguments are premature We agree with Interveners The reform efforts have been the subject of extensive public review and comment and are nearing completion Accordingly we reject SDGEs arguments at this time FIt is unclear whether SDGEs failure to purchase hedging instruments for its retail operations is due to state regulatory policies or its business decisions A retail rate design that exposes consumers to the volatility of commodity prices would be extraordinary particularly when consumers do not have the ability to receive or respond to price signals FWe are concerned that increasing level of market activity in the realtime market raises significant reliability and economical concerns Historically the ISO procures on a daily basis only the resources needed for the operating day Not only does this procurement practice put pressure on the grid operator to secure needed resources at the last minute but the practice is uneconomical Such spotmarket purchases are not subject to the ISOs buyers cap Furthermore because the ISO is the supplier of last resort for these services when OOM calls are made suppliers realize that the ISO is in a mustbuy situation FIn an effort to address this problem we direct the ISO to immediately institute a more forward approach to procuring the resources necessary to reliably operate the grid Specifically the ISO should anticipate the need for such additional resources based on forecasted peak periods We direct the ISO to factor these reforms into an analysis of the need for and level of purchase price caps and to include this analysis as support for any filing it makes to extend its purchase price cap authorityF In closing WPTF is an intervenor in the case and we hope to be very active in the case through testimony cross examination the filing of briefs and reply briefs Things in the PeopleFs Republic of California The Development of a SuperPeak Block Energy Product Several weeks ago I discussed with the ISO their interest in developing a new market for a block energy product that would be purchased in the morning of a trade day and be dispatched during the superpeak hours I challenged them to let the market participants develop this market instead of the ISO doing the same At the August ISO Governing Board meeting I stated as the WPTF position that we oppose price caps but if the ISO Governing Board insisted on going down the MWH price cap route we would do what ever we could to help the situation and avoid the occurrences of Stage alerts Whereas I didnFt think about the conversation on superpeak block markets as being relevant to the remarks before the Governing Board it became painfully clear soon after that we could and should work with the ISO to develop a new market through either APX or the California PX or both to bring some order to the otherwise chaotic Out of Market system This week WPTF and the ISO had a joint meeting whereby both sides discussed the merits of a superpeak block firmenergy product and how it could be instituted The meeting at the ISO at which WPTF had many of its members who either have generation in the State or import power into California was for market participants and the ISO to discuss how to bring more order and price transparency to the ISOs out of market calls The ISO reported that this summer to date the amount of money spent on Out of Market purchases was about million Last year the total cost of Out of Market purchases was million APX and CalPX in response to our earlier discussions with them presented their proposals at the meeting The discussions which ensued during the course of the presentations focused on how the ISO might utilize a productservice to reduce the manpower requirements currently needed to satisfy its out of market telephone calls typically on short notice and the interest on the part of market participants to make bids into either the APX or CalPXs proposed system for a superpeak firmenergy product There were no commitments made by any party simply a willingness to work together to alleviate the problems associated with finding sufficient electric power during high demand periods with greater transparency more participants and greater market efficiency WeFll keep you posted on our development of this market The Mailbag A Letter from My Friend and A Response Sometimes I share bites of our Burrito with fellow travellers much as I did last week when I sent my friend Mike Florio a copy of the story called the Trial of Gow Jing Mike sent me a note that I would like to share He said I could I want you to read it and appreciate that there are other people who share his view I also copied the response I sent to Michael aka Old Deuteronomy Michael wrote FIm not going to attempt to complete your little melodrama the GowJing story but I did want to offer an observation In simpler times people knew the other people that they did business with and they typically lived in the same community If a merchant tried to charge exorbitant prices for his products even if he was the only one in town who had the product in stock he would face the wrath of his fellow citizens This undoubtedly served as a constraint on such behavior even in the absence of a CPUC or FERC Telling Mrs Jones that the loaf of bread she needs to feed her kids will cost her would not be a pleasant way to do business and such things ordinarily did not happen FIn the modern global economy of course this personal aspect of doing business has been almost completely lost And so has the restraint I have no doubt that the folks who sell electricity are good people jeez I know many of them but they work in an environment where the end results of their business decisions are invisible If Mrs Jones cant afford to run her refrigerator any more that fact is at best dimly perceived and if so it is viewed as cause for some sort of social program not a reason why a merchant would alter his behavior FThis is clearly not a case of socialism versus capitalism because both scenarios occur within the overall context of a capitalist system But certainly something fundamental has changed and not for the better in my view Now everyone feels compelled to squeeze the last dollar out of every transaction their jobs may even depend upon it and no one is responsible for the end result Is this the kind of world we want to live in FPUT THAT IN YOUR BURRITO AND SEE WHAT YOUR READERS SAY YOU CAN EVEN BLAME ME SO THAT YOU ARE NOT ACCUSED OF TURNING PINK IN YOUR MIDDLE AGE DeutF Okay ItFs in the Burrito And here is what I think You allude to the change in a world that was once Fmore personalF and is now institutional You make the point that things are not better off if for no other reason then the lack of personal accountability But I donFt think that in all cases the more personal world is lost It is ever present as I will argue below Second your group embraces the impersonal FefficienciesF when it is convenient Finally and most importantly where will your socialminded and like minded counterparts be when competitive forces leap supply ahead of demand which might happen in a handful of years However your essential point is not lost on me I do believe that there are ways for generators and consumers to be good neighbors in California I have a proposal below to which I would like to hear your response First though the personal business touch is present in our economy I exercise the restraint to which your story pines in many of my consulting engagements which require financial give and take between client and vendor It is simply smart business to do so I have been the beneficiary of the same with my local bank when errors occurred in my checking accounts or when loan payments were made absent mindedly late etc and the late fee forgiven However much of our economy and certainly the trade of a commodity such as electricity requires the use of markets Nameless and faceless they do squeeze out all the efficiencies which lead to lower prices more innovation and a sharing of price risk with parties who are neither the ultimate consumer nor the initial producer The producer and consumer get out of the risk arbitrage and leave it to others who are more skilled and monied I find it ironic that TURN then is so insistent on arguing as it has done on many many occasions for the relaxation of market separation in the ISOFs congestion management reform Elimination of market separation is nothing more than the impersonal forcing of parties to execute trades on either side of a congested transmission path in the name of market efficiency Lower prices for consumers Does it really matter if it is done through person to person transactions or through markets Third your story can be used to make an alternative point What happens to the merchant in town when WalMart moves into the next town down the road All the faithful customers that your Merchant of Vengeance was protecting suddenly migrate to a competitor with greater inventory more choice and lower prices What do you say then The corollary for us is direct The new generation owners moved literally billions of dollars into California at risk and took a chance It paid off They succeeded as we all know this year and probably will next year and so on But the MW of new power plants under construction in California and the MW under construction in Arizona and the over MW of combined power projects in California Arizona and Southern Nevada that are in line for permits will change the financial landscape in a hurry once energized The prices will soften returns will be less cherry and I really want to know where will todayFs accusers be when there is a shake out Consumers will reap that benefit oh you best believe it But the alliances to which your opening story alludes simply misses that point You gotta make hay while the sun shines Now to my proposal Michael I would be willing to work with you to develop some kind of loan program for residential and small commercial customers that would in effect reduce the economic hardship of higher electricity prices I could imagine although I havenFt tested the idea with any parties that a significant program could be crafted possibly secured by the credit of participating generating companies and executed by a commercial lending institution such as Bank of America Borrowers would pay a fair interest rate and the administrative fees ItFs simply smart business not charity ItFs one way to amortize th e earnings which came about due to a circumstance of short supply relative to the sudden growth of demand for power Maybe that is a step in the right direction I donFt know One could argue that it is no different than SDGE implementing a level payment plan for itFs consumers True it is no different because in either case the customer is paying for the loan interest and administrative fees and I consistently believe that a market for credit is more efficient am I getting impersonal than one instituted by a monopoly Second the security for these loans is provided by parties other than the utilityFs customers Further we wouldnFt have to wor ry about PUC oversight and prudence reviews We could make this work quickly I will be very interested to hear your thoughts and the comments of my members Thanks for sending us your letter Odds and Ends Finish the Story Contest Well there was only one response and that was from Carl Imparato Here is what Carl said FAm I missing something Who is GowJing supposed to represent Yes I get the pun in the name But is he also just an anonymous everyman or is there someone in particular FMy first response to your question is that GowJing simply replies FItaiF You could look it up I think its Chinese for Fit hurt sF Then he takes out a concealed axe goes on a rampage and kills everyone But thats too realistic so dont use that ending Instead FEnding Just as he was about to reply a giant foot wall of water swept through the room drowning everyone And they lived happily ever after The end I havenFt decided whether to name this response CarlFs Gilgamesh Epic Ie Noah and the flood or CarlFs Hydro Dream WeFll leave the contest open for another week CanFt let bucks go the only entry WhereFs the competition Odds and Ends October General Meeting Barb Ennis our

Douglass of Arter and Hadden sent us the following item Houston the unofficial home of the electric power industry is a town you either love or hate Here are some guiding principles offered by the Chamber of Commerce of the th largest city to enable their many visitors to cope F First you must learn to pronounce the city name It is YEWSTUN a nd it does not matter how people pronounce it in other places F Forget the traffic rules you learned elsewhere Houston has its ow n version of traffic rules Never forget that downtown Houston is composed entirely of one way streets The only way to get out of center of town is to turn around and start over when you reach Dallas Texas F All directions start with Go down Westheimer F Westheimer has no beginning and no end F Its impossible to go around a block and wind up on the street yo u started on The Chamber of Commerce calls this a scenic drive F The am rush hour is from to am The pm rush hour is from to pm Fridays rush hour starts on Thursday morning F If you actually stop at a yellow light you cannot be from Houston F Kuykendahl Road can only be pronounced by a native so do not attempt the phonetic pronunciation People will simply tilt their heads to the right and stare at you F Construction on the Gulf Freeway is a way of life and a permanent form of entertainment F Many bizarre sights can be explained simply by uttering the phrase Oh were in Montrose F Construction crews arent doing their job properly unless they close down all lanes except one during rush hour F If someone actually has their turn signal on it was probably lef t on at the factory where the car was made F White haired men driving red or silver sports cars will not obey a ny known traffic rule and cannot be expected to stop for red lights or stop signs F All ladies with blue hair who drive Cadillacs or Lincoln Continentals have the right of way F The above mentioned blue haired ladies also have a legal right to turn right from a left lane or to turn left from a right lane YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED F Buying a Houston street map is a waste of money since there is absolutely no way that you can route yourself in such a manner as to avoid major road construction F Houston natives are so rare that they are listed on the endangered species list The few remaining specimens are kept in a controlled environment for their own safety F Sir and Maam are used by the person speaking to you if theres a remote possibility that youre at least minutes older than they are F Sugar is a more common form of address than Miss So is Honey Do not take offense This is how southerners address grown women F In Houston we drink CocaCola and Dr Pepper It is rumored that other soft drinks are sold here but no one will admit to knowing anyone who actually drinks them So dont ask for any other soft drink F What you need to know when arriving at Bush Intercontinental Airport Your arrival gate is at least miles away from the Main Concourse of any terminal Walking heels on your boots or walking shoes are advised F Never honk your horn at another car in Houston traffic The bumper sticker that reads Keep honking Im reloading is considered fair

fortune cookie and at least as accurate Everyone is getting into the act When I started this gig I was the only guy in town writing to folks like you about the power industry in California I wrote about whats new whats happening and all the important stuff This week Governor Gray Davis decided to write his own Burrito His epistle got more press than mine but why is he muscling in on my turf Not to be outdone PUC President Loretta Lynch released a report which looks into every facet of Californias power business No stone left unturned Im telling you there isnt enough room in this business for all of us They need to clear out With people like Herr Hair Peace Governor ImNot MrRogers Davis and Lets Do Lynch who needs a Friday Burrito They redefine our reality each week with mindnumbing aplomb For example starting in early June the PX was ordered to compete for business against other Qualified Trading Vehicles Then two weeks later the Energy Fhrer legislated that idea to an early death which kept the status quo for at least one year This week the PUC approved year bilateral deals for PGE and SCE thereby opening the PX to competition and emasculating the PXs Block Forward Market Zip bam boom I cant wait to see what next week will bring I hear Senator Bowen is holding Committee hearings on re regulating the industry and the Governors new Energy Security Council will meet to decide six things Whats for lunch Who will sit at the head of the table Does anyone have good seats for next weeks Democratic convention Is there anyone we havent indicted yet in the power industry Who will crank up the air conditioning in this room Its getting too warm Then they will collect data from innocent businesses under subpoena ignore the facts and publish a report It makes one want to take a deep breath and inhale the scented fumes of democracy You know I cant think about where to begin so lets start somewhere Things on the Island of California Is there anyone left at SDGE with a brain The PUC issues its scathing report The ISO invokes price caps Duh Things at the throne of FERC Amen for the Morgan Stanley Order Odds and Ends Things on the Island of California Is there anyone left at SDGE with a brain Well the answer very clearly is no I have been astounded by repeated attempts of SDGEs most senior people to ape humans but instead they mimic apes Consider the following First they waltz their default customers into the summer with little of no protection from price spikes in the wholesale market Forgivable in that it is human to err The prices skyrocket in June and they start looking for who to blame Must be them damn independent generatorsO say their managers Gary Cotton informs the ISO Governing Board that hedging SDGEs position in the Block Forward Market wouldnt have made any difference Theres one nobel laureate who missed his prime Next under pressure they ask for help from suppliers and anyone else who will assist the utility and their customers Nine offers show up at their table and they cant choose any of them Again Mr Cotton tells his fellow ISO Governing Board members that these things take time and we dont to rush since there are many legislative barriers and well the surfing was good this week so why spoil it Now they are in a panic because the Energy Fhrer is visiting old ladies living in trailer parks advising them not to pay their SDGE electricity bill and to continue to operate their air conditioners SDGE puts a full page ad in the local newspaper telling everyone that SDGE is doing everything it can to lower their electric bills including asking the ISO for a price cap but the public can help by calling the ISO address and phone number provided in the ad and urging them to lower the cap I always thought the location of the ISO was a State secret for security reasons No secrets in San Diego But we are not done No sir we are not Those buffalo heads who run that company decide they will win a gold star on their collective foreheads and implement one of the four resolutions passed by the Electric Oversight Board The one they pick is to petition FERC on an expedited basis to cap at the price at which sellers may bid energy or ancillary services into the ISO and the PX The primary reason is that Western power markets are not workably competitive In other words they want FERC to set a max price on what generators can sell in addition to the price limit at which the ISO can buy What I find most astounding about this double talk is that SDGE continues to collect tons of money from the sales of regulatory must run energy into the PX These are sales from their stranded assets Their grief hasnt abated their greed So to recap SDGE missed the boat on price hedging failed to win consumer confidence in public meetings asked for help from suppliers and did nothing in response then filed at FERC to cap the sale price because the wholesale market into which they sell overpriced energy is not workably competitive Too much time in the direct sun light Things on the Island of California The PUC issues its scathing report The PUC report released yesterday is a gem with which I have not spent enough time I only read the Executive Summary and that only because our counsel Dan Douglass forwarded me a copy Let me pick out some of the gems in President Lets Do Lynchs burrito I would recommend reading the whole text if you have time and if you seek perverse entertainment California is experiencing major problems with electricity supply and pricing caused by policies and procedures adopted over the past ten years Since June wholesale prices for electrical power in California have increased on average over the same period in resulting in over billion in excess payments for electricity Hot weather aging power plant and transmission infrastructure and dysfunctional bidding behavior in the wholesale power markets combined to drive prices up Because of serious market defects and tight supply of electricity purchasers of California power will likely pay billions more in electricity costs this year Moreover these price increases do not necessarily fund new investments in electricity supply or delivery reliability they may flow solely to power producer profit margins Despite the Electricity Oversight Boards legislative mandate to oversee those institutions we have been unable to obtain bid data Nevertheless we believe enough evidence of questionable behavior exists that the Attorney General should conduct an investigation into these statewide market practices coordinating with other State agencies including the PUC and the EOB Such an investigation would provide the factual foundation that California policy makers and regulators need to recover any illegally obtained profits A momentous consequence of Californias attempt to create a market in electricity is that the federal government now regulates Californias electric system Washington DC now controls pricing decisions directly at the wholesale level and indirectly at the retail level and to the extent that supply incentives are correlated to prices Washington DC now affects Californias ability to attract new investment in power plants Past administrations willingness to cede the States authority to the federal government combined with the legislative creation of two nonpublic supervisory organizations that have no duty to protect the public or consider the retail customer The Independent System Operator ISO and the Power Exchange PX the nonprofit private corporations that operate the States transmission system and control wholesale pricing policies are governed by boards whose members can have serious conflicts of interest Some of these board members or their companies financially benefit from higher prices in electricity markets Neither of these private organizations is accountable to the State or its consumers Despite the federalization and the fragmentation of the States electric services the State of California should protect its businesses and consumers from cartel pricing collusive behavior inadequate power plant maintenance and lack of market planning for adequate electricity supplies California consumers and businesses deserve to know in advance as San Diegans did not this summer how and when the price of an essential service like electricity will double California is now largely constrained by federal mandates from providing comprehensive retail price relief as long as wholesale prices remain so high If California tried to reimpose a price freeze in San Diego now federal regulators would likely prevent that action Shortterm price relief however cannot resolve market gaming or fundamental wholesale pricing problems controlled by federal regulators We have been precluded from obtaining the data necessary to know if the ISO and PX failed to detect manipulation and gaming on several fronts We do not know how market players acted in price offering and bidding and scheduling The FERC has just announced an inquiry into national pricing and energy market issues California should not wait for national findings before it investigates California market practices We recommend that the California Attorney General immediately subpoena relevant records and data to determine the pricing and offering behavior of market participants the actions of the ISO and its board members and the actions of generators in supplying Californias energy needs Ten Actions to Consider or Act Upon to Prevent Current Electricity Problems From Spreading in Create a California Energy Council modeled on the National Security Council to unify State action to resolve energy problems and to perform integrated energy planning Ask FERC for extended wholesale price cap authority to moderate California wholesale market pricing Ask FERC to recognize the defects in the California and western regional markets and find that no competitive market exists in California power markets Eliminate potential conflicts of interest in ISOPX stakeholder boards Improve Californias ability to obtain ISO and generator data and enhance the States enforcement capability for power plant maintenance price manipulation and generation gaming consistent with protection of proprietary business information Provide the EOB with effective enforcement ability and additional oversight authority for the ISO and PX Ten Issues to Consider or Act Upon Within the Next Six Months Streamline state power plant siting procedures consistent with environmental requirements and prioritize applications to advance clean BACT power plant proposals Institute useit or loseit permitting power plant licensing and emissions credits rules to ensure power plants get built Reform PX pricing protocols and structures to lower wholesale and retail prices and reduce excess profitsO I told you I dont need to write a Burrito anymore The Democrats in Sacramento are doing that for me Welcome comrade Things on the Island of California The ISO invokes price caps Duh It is really hard to describe the drama of an ISO Governing Board meeting especially when our favorite topic arises It seems the only time the Board becomes animated is when one of three issues are on the agenda price caps FTRs and priorities for software enhancements Otherwise its pretty much humdrum Round and round we went once again A few more forced votes tipped the scale in favor of the cap There were yes votes which included a forced yes vote from our friend Jerry Toenyes by order of Secretary of Energy Mr Richardson Jerry did you realize that the last letters of your name could be rearranged to spell NO ET YESO Kind of a french thing Im sorry about that vote Jerry You still go in my book as one of the brave and bold for standing up to that sort of intimidation for so long Your picture in the SF Chron said it all The brave souls who stood tall and voted NO included David Parquet Enron Jan SmutnyJones IEP Barbara Barkovich CLECA Caolyn Kehrein CMA Dan Kirshner EDF and Stacy Roscoe Procter Gamble Now I must admit that Dynegys Greg Blue did help by voting a Texas No spelled ABSTAINO I have instructed Dynegy trader Dave Francis in Houston to work with Greg to correct that problem Were going to work things out The Energy Fhrer addressed the Board again I didnt mind that I only had a few brief very brief moments to address the Board and Herr Hair Peace got over minutes That didnt bother me at all He did more damage to himself in than I could do in He blasted away at everyone who opposed him He pined about Camden quitting the Board He said he knew how prices and markets work that it isnt the way those academic egghead FERCloving economists tell you who pray to the gods of competition He lambasted WAPA for withholding generation to protect fish and wildlife what was that all about He predicted that on Thursdays PUC meeting he and all the other powerful Democrats Republicans and angry citizens of San Diego would demand that the PUC impose a rate cap on retail electric rates in San Diego that are just and reasonable it didnt happen And on and on and on This man is very delusional He believes that Steve and only Steve Peace can save the world He believes that political will trumps judicial quasijudicial or independent Board actions This man makes relevant all the abstract musings of the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche The will to power the bermensch the transvaluation of values etc But we are getting under uber his skin with the help of the press Wednesday afternoon I called Commissioner Dick Bilas to see if he thought whether the next days PUC meeting was going to be a roll over Dick said he got a call from Peace and that Peace said he would not come to the meeting Apparently Peace had received a lot of press and all of it bad Thats the thin line of freedom which keeps tyranny at least one step away from our front door Things at the throne of FERC Amen for the Morgan Stanley Order And now the good news You deserve this FERC gave the California market a little wiggle room last Friday FERC issued a last minute reply to the complaint by Morgan Stanley Capital Group relating to the ISOs intent to lower the price cap FERC denied the complaint but they didnt waste time with an Order to simply deny a complaint FERC danced on the head of the ISO and pulled the bite out of the price cap Here are some excerpts We accepted this Amendment not because it was a cap on sellers prices but because it would promote order and transparency in the market by clearly telling sellers of the maximum price the ISO was willing to pay and allowing sellers to make informed economic choices on whether to sell in the ISO market or to sell elsewhere The ISO has no more or less ability to procure capacity and energy than any other buyer of these services If the ISO is unable to elicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced purchase price ceiling because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they choose it will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to meet its needs Therefore an increase in outofmarket OOM calls for generation may be necessary to maintain system reliability Because the current payment for OOM is not subject to a maximum purchase price the resulting overall payments may be higher To the extent the ISO Board resolution contemplates implementing a directive that generators must bid their capacity into the ISO markets under any circumstances eg when system load exceeds MW such a requirement is not permitted by our Order and the ISO tariff Future implementation of the ISO Board resolution with regard to a requirement to sell would require significant revisions to the ISO market rules Such market changes could not become effective absent a corresponding amendment to the ISO tariff which would have to be filed under section of the FPAO Well What do you think about that Just wait Here is what the sleeping bear Commissioner Hebert said in his concurring remarks Getting to the bottom of the problem in my view requires us to begin a proceeding to rescind our approval of the ISO as the operator of the California grid The record supports such a move A memorandum to the ISO from a stakeholder who resigned from the governing board eloquently brings to our attention repeated attempts to undermine the independence of the ISO The memorandum also thoughtfully outlines consequences to the markets of a return to command and control Because these allegations come from a nonmarket participant especially should we take heed We must also take notice of the public pressure on the Board to compromise its independenceO Amen brother amen Odds and Ends As you can imagine this week like an endless string of weeks before this has been interminable I get about three phone calls a day from press reporters very little of which ever sees print My shtick is just too complex for casual readers But I do notice that the reporters are asking better questions The public is becoming more savvy The information flow is moving in our favor and will disarm the forces of evil in about years I have other problems on my mind I am working on a new computer system Really its just an upgrade of an older computer that is a bit faster than the laptop I tried to upgrade very unsuccessfully As a result of the all the new hardware and software I purchased my office looks like a war zone with an odd mix of PUC service copies computer documentation and diskettes laying all around Quite a mess Prepare for the future Our next general meeting is scheduled for Thursday and Friday October and at Moro Bay Barb Ennis will prepare a blurb for us in next weeks Burrito about room reservations timing golf etc Our guest speakers will include MSC Chairman Professor Frank Wolak who will talk on the subject of his choice Ms Irene Moosen of Grueneich Resource Advocates who will make a presentation on the distributed generation case before the PUC and William Freddo of PGE National Energy Group who will give us some education on operating a power plant inside the New England ISO Now for your daily bread provided this week by Dan Douglass Last week we had a joke about Catholics This week its agnostics An atheist was taking a walk thru the woods admiring all that the accident of evolution had created What majestic trees What powerful rivers What beautiful animals he said to himself As he was walking alongside the river he heard a rustling in the bushes behind him As he turned to look he saw a foot grizzly bear charging towards him He ran as fast as he could up the path He looked over his shoulder and saw that the bear was closing in on him He tried to run even faster so scared that tears were coming to his eyes His heart was pumping frantically as he tried to run even faster but he tripped and fell on the ground He rolled over to pick himself up and saw the bear right on top of him raising its paw to kill him At that instant he cried out Oh my God And time stopped The bear froze The forest was silent The river even stopped flowing A bright light shone upon the man and a voice out of the sky said You deny my existence all these years teach others I dont exist and even credit my creation to a cosmic accident and now do you expect me to help you out of this predicament Am I to count you as a believer The atheist ever so proud looked into the light and said It would be rather hypocritical to ask to be counted as a believer after all these years but could you make the bear a believer Very well said the voice And the light went out the river flowed the sounds of the forest continued and the bear brought both paws together bowed his head and said Lord I thank you for this food which I am about to receive Amen And have a great weekend Oh and thanks to all of you who sent me happy birthday wishes It was very much appreciated KSB gba atthtm

hint of Autumn in the air I donFt know if itFs wishful thinking or if the seasons are really beginning to turn from our pale summer into a Bay Area glorious Fall ItFs premature I know A few fallen leaves the start of schools slightly longer afternoon shadows IFm jumping the gun I canFt wait for this summer to be over especially this summer The pounding never stops and as I hear the din of the cash register ringing with each climb in Southwest temperature I can barely keep track of all the hiccups which drive prices up fires in Montana restricting transmission paths blown up interstate gas pipeline in New Mexico diminishing NOx credits for instate power plants depleted inventory of hours of voluntary load interruptions for commercial and industrial customers credit limits restricting imports of Canadian power into the Northwest and California and BPA buying about MW to cover its short hydro position I also get the willies every time another politician lambastes the California restructured power industry I just want to end to the summer now and start a two week Fall vacation anywhere even in Cleveland There are seven count them seven investigations into some aspect of the wholesale power market out here Two days ago there were only six but FERC just added another yesterday in response to the PrezFs request That means FERC has two the PUC has two the State Attorneys General has two one on the ISO Governing Board and one on the instate generators and one by the Electric Oversight Board If you donFt have an ongoing study of the California Market then youFre not hip All of these investigations save FERCFs Section Investigation are going to amount to near nothing A lot of wasted time and paper The PUC and EOB studies have their conclusion sections all finished Now they need some evidence to support their assertions And how are we holding up under all of this How are you doing I talk to many of you throughout the week and I know how frustrated you are I share your frustration You want to tell the public the press and anyone in between the truth You want to lay out the facts You want to show anyone who will listen that each interference into the market is making things worse not better The price caps for example are damnable and screwing up the prices much to the detriment of those people for who price caps were supposed to be a protection against price shocks Now they are receiving higher average prices The public isnFt going to listen to anything longer than a sound bite And letFs face it when it comes to stellar public relations our industry is not known for turning in A performances except for SCE Those guys seem to get their story in front of the public at every turn I heard SCE is putting on their customersF bill FHere is what you would have paid if the rate freeze ended F But many of us in the new power industry borne from the loins of either the naturalgas industry or nuclearpower business learned the hard way that the best response to a public inquiry is a twoblock head start in front of an angry mob Keep your head down shut your mouth and this too shall pass I donFt buy that approach at least not anymore That is I donFt believe we have anything to hide or of which to be ashamed What electric restructuring is about is correct beneficial to the public and in everyoneFs best interests Look at it this way when they pat the last shovelful of dirt on your final resting place for what do you most want to be remembered That you caved in to the political will of others or at a moment when you had the chance you did what was right instead of what was expedient I think the choice is easy albeit laced with sheer terror Those bland homilies I so diligently teach my kids eg tell the truth do what is right think of the big picture and not just yourself are a lot easier to speak than to live by So join me and stand up for what you believe They canFt take away your pride not yet Here is this weekFs line up Things in the PeopleFs Republic of California Excerpts from FERCFs Order on SDGE Complaint The Development of a SuperPeak Block Energy Product The Mailbag A Letter from My Friend and A Response Odds and Ends Finish the Story Contest October General Meeting What Makes Houston Houston Things in the PeopleFs Republic of California Excerpts from FERCFs Order on SDGE Complaint President Clinton commented from the Rose Garden that good folks in San Diego retired fixedincome likely to vote for a Democrat are making choices between buying medicine or air conditioning their homes I call this the Del Monica Beach lecture The Prez instructed the FERC to investigate the situation in California and FERC wasted no time In response to SDGEFs August complaint whereby the utility asked FERC to impose a price cap on generators in the region the FERC responded in a way that I was hoping to see several months ago The FERC slammed SDGE on their complaint for lack of merit and the FERC also initiated an FPA Section Investigation into the wholesale power market in California Here are some of the juicy excerpts from FERCFs Order FIn this order we are denying SDGEs requested immediate imposition of a price cap on all sellers in California However we are instituting consolidated hearing proceedings pursuant to section of the Federal Power Act to investigate the justness and reasonableness of the rates and charges of public utilities that sell energy and ancillary services to or through the California ISO and PX and to also investigate whether the tariffs and institutional structures and bylaws of the California ISO and PX are adversely affecting the efficient operation of competitive wholesale electric power markets in California and need to be modified FSDGE concludes that the markets cannot be workably competitive if sellers are able to exact prices that are considerably above levels that would prevail in open competition ie sellers are able to bid and receive prices significantly above their marginal costs SDGE also argues that the hourtohour volatility in imbalance energy prices and the erratic clearing price for ancillary services is an indication that the market is breaking down when it is moderately stressed FWhile we find it appropriate to institute a section hearing on these issues we cannot implement an immediate price cap of MWh as requested by SDGE because there is no record before us to support such an action While the issues raised by this complaint are important the Commission has no basis to conclude that SDGEs proposal to place an immediate arbitrary MWh cap on the price that every public utility seller of energy and ancillary services may bid into the PX and ISO markets would satisfy this standard SDGE has provided no evidence to demonstrate that all potential sellers are able to exercise market power has not documented a single instance of a seller exercising market power during times of scarcity and did not attempt to show that the conditions underlying the Commissions approval of marketbased rates for public utility sellers of energy and ancillary services have changed Nor did it address specific market or institutional factors that may be causing rates to be unjust or unreasonable FSDGE asserts that the ISOs congestion management and market structures are flawed and in need of overhaul Furthermore SDGE expresses its concern that for a number of reasons the congestion management and market reform efforts being pursued by ISO stakeholders will not produce meaningful results SDGE indicates that it is prepared to work with the ISO to develop alternative reform proposals however SDGEs complains that the ISO stakeholder process has in SDGEs judgment been ineffective with respect to these issues FVarious interveners contend that SDGEs arguments are premature We agree with Interveners The reform efforts have been the subject of extensive public review and comment and are nearing completion Accordingly we reject SDGEs arguments at this time FIt is unclear whether SDGEs failure to purchase hedging instruments for its retail operations is due to state regulatory policies or its business decisions A retail rate design that exposes consumers to the volatility of commodity prices would be extraordinary particularly when consumers do not have the ability to receive or respond to price signals FWe are concerned that increasing level of market activity in the realtime market raises significant reliability and economical concerns Historically the ISO procures on a daily basis only the resources needed for the operating day Not only does this procurement practice put pressure on the grid operator to secure needed resources at the last minute but the practice is uneconomical Such spotmarket purchases are not subject to the ISOs buyers cap Furthermore because the ISO is the supplier of last resort for these services when OOM calls are made suppliers realize that the ISO is in a mustbuy situation FIn an effort to address this problem we direct the ISO to immediately institute a more forward approach to procuring the resources necessary to reliably operate the grid Specifically the ISO should anticipate the need for such additional resources based on forecasted peak periods We direct the ISO to factor these reforms into an analysis of the need for and level of purchase price caps and to include this analysis as support for any filing it makes to extend its purchase price cap authorityF In closing WPTF is an intervenor in the case and we hope to be very active in the case through testimony cross examination the filing of briefs and reply briefs Things in the PeopleFs Republic of California The Development of a SuperPeak Block Energy Product Several weeks ago I discussed with the ISO their interest in developing a new market for a block energy product that would be purchased in the morning of a trade day and be dispatched during the superpeak hours I challenged them to let the market participants develop this market instead of the ISO doing the same At the August ISO Governing Board meeting I stated as the WPTF position that we oppose price caps but if the ISO Governing Board insisted on going down the MWH price cap route we would do what ever we could to help the situation and avoid the occurrences of Stage alerts Whereas I didnFt think about the conversation on superpeak block markets as being relevant to the remarks before the Governing Board it became painfully clear soon after that we could and should work with the ISO to develop a new market through either APX or the California PX or both to bring some order to the otherwise chaotic Out of Market system This week WPTF and the ISO had a joint meeting whereby both sides discussed the merits of a superpeak block firmenergy product and how it could be instituted The meeting at the ISO at which WPTF had many of its members who either have generation in the State or import power into California was for market participants and the ISO to discuss how to bring more order and price transparency to the ISOs out of market calls The ISO reported that this summer to date the amount of money spent on Out of Market purchases was about million Last year the total cost of Out of Market purchases was million APX and CalPX in response to our earlier discussions with them presented their proposals at the meeting The discussions which ensued during the course of the presentations focused on how the ISO might utilize a productservice to reduce the manpower requirements currently needed to satisfy its out of market telephone calls typically on short notice and the interest on the part of market participants to make bids into either the APX or CalPXs proposed system for a superpeak firmenergy product There were no commitments made by any party simply a willingness to work together to alleviate the problems associated with finding sufficient electric power during high demand periods with greater transparency more participants and greater market efficiency WeFll keep you posted on our development of this market The Mailbag A Letter from My Friend and A Response Sometimes I share bites of our Burrito with fellow travellers much as I did last week when I sent my friend Mike Florio a copy of the story called the Trial of Gow Jing Mike sent me a note that I would like to share He said I could I want you to read it and appreciate that there are other people who share his view I also copied the response I sent to Michael aka Old Deuteronomy Michael wrote FIm not going to attempt to complete your little melodrama the GowJing story but I did want to offer an observation In simpler times people knew the other people that they did business with and they typically lived in the same community If a merchant tried to charge exorbitant prices for his products even if he was the only one in town who had the product in stock he would face the wrath of his fellow citizens This undoubtedly served as a constraint on such behavior even in the absence of a CPUC or FERC Telling Mrs Jones that the loaf of bread she needs to feed her kids will cost her would not be a pleasant way to do business and such things ordinarily did not happen FIn the modern global economy of course this personal aspect of doing business has been almost completely lost And so has the restraint I have no doubt that the folks who sell electricity are good people jeez I know many of them but they work in an environment where the end results of their business decisions are invisible If Mrs Jones cant afford to run her refrigerator any more that fact is at best dimly perceived and if so it is viewed as cause for some sort of social program not a reason why a merchant would alter his behavior FThis is clearly not a case of socialism versus capitalism because both scenarios occur within the overall context of a capitalist system But certainly something fundamental has changed and not for the better in my view Now everyone feels compelled to squeeze the last dollar out of every transaction their jobs may even depend upon it and no one is responsible for the end result Is this the kind of world we want to live in FPUT THAT IN YOUR BURRITO AND SEE WHAT YOUR READERS SAY YOU CAN EVEN BLAME ME SO THAT YOU ARE NOT ACCUSED OF TURNING PINK IN YOUR MIDDLE AGE DeutF Okay ItFs in the Burrito And here is what I think You allude to the change in a world that was once Fmore personalF and is now institutional You make the point that things are not better off if for no other reason then the lack of personal accountability But I donFt think that in all cases the more personal world is lost It is ever present as I will argue below Second your group embraces the impersonal FefficienciesF when it is convenient Finally and most importantly where will your socialminded and like minded counterparts be when competitive forces leap supply ahead of demand which might happen in a handful of years However your essential point is not lost on me I do believe that there are ways for generators and consumers to be good neighbors in California I have a proposal below to which I would like to hear your response First though the personal business touch is present in our economy I exercise the restraint to which your story pines in many of my consulting engagements which require financial give and take between client and vendor It is simply smart business to do so I have been the beneficiary of the same with my local bank when errors occurred in my checking accounts or when loan payments were made absent mindedly late etc and the late fee forgiven However much of our economy and certainly the trade of a commodity such as electricity requires the use of markets Nameless and faceless they do squeeze out all the efficiencies which lead to lower prices more innovation and a sharing of price risk with parties who are neither the ultimate consumer nor the initial producer The producer and consumer get out of the risk arbitrage and leave it to others who are more skilled and monied I find it ironic that TURN then is so insistent on arguing as it has done on many many occasions for the relaxation of market separation in the ISOFs congestion management reform Elimination of market separation is nothing more than the impersonal forcing of parties to execute trades on either side of a congested transmission path in the name of market efficiency Lower prices for consumers Does it really matter if it is done through person to person transactions or through markets Third your story can be used to make an alternative point What happens to the merchant in town when WalMart moves into the next town down the road All the faithful customers that your Merchant of Vengeance was protecting suddenly migrate to a competitor with greater inventory more choice and lower prices What do you say then The corollary for us is direct The new generation owners moved literally billions of dollars into California at risk and took a chance It paid off They succeeded as we all know this year and probably will next year and so on But the MW of new power plants under construction in California and the MW under construction in Arizona and the over MW of combined power projects in California Arizona and Southern Nevada that are in line for permits will change the financial landscape in a hurry once energized The prices will soften returns will be less cherry and I really want to know where will todayFs accusers be when there is a shake out Consumers will reap that benefit oh you best believe it But the alliances to which your opening story alludes simply misses that point You gotta make hay while the sun shines Now to my proposal Michael I would be willing to work with you to develop some kind of loan program for residential and small commercial customers that would in effect reduce the economic hardship of higher electricity prices I could imagine although I havenFt tested the idea with any parties that a significant program could be crafted possibly secured by the credit of participating generating companies and executed by a commercial lending institution such as Bank of America Borrowers would pay a fair interest rate and the administrative fees ItFs simply smart business not charity ItFs one way to amortize th e earnings which came about due to a circumstance of short supply relative to the sudden growth of demand for power Maybe that is a step in the right direction I donFt know One could argue that it is no different than SDGE implementing a level payment plan for itFs consumers True it is no different because in either case the customer is paying for the loan interest and administrative fees and I consistently believe that a market for credit is more efficient am I getting impersonal than one instituted by a monopoly Second the security for these loans is provided by parties other than the utilityFs customers Further we wouldnFt have to wor ry about PUC oversight and prudence reviews We could make this work quickly I will be very interested to hear your thoughts and the comments of my members Thanks for sending us your letter Odds and Ends Finish the Story Contest Well there was only one response and that was from Carl Imparato Here is what Carl said FAm I missing something Who is GowJing supposed to represent Yes I get the pun in the name But is he also just an anonymous everyman or is there someone in particular FMy first response to your question is that GowJing simply replies FItaiF You could look it up I think its Chinese for Fit hurt sF Then he takes out a concealed axe goes on a rampage and kills everyone But thats too realistic so dont use that ending Instead FEnding Just as he was about to reply a giant foot wall of water swept through the room drowning everyone And they lived happily ever after The end I havenFt decided whether to name this response CarlFs Gilgamesh Epic Ie Noah and the flood or CarlFs Hydro Dream WeFll leave the contest open for another week CanFt let bucks go the only entry WhereFs the competition Odds and Ends October General Meeting Barb Ennis our

Douglass of Arter and Hadden sent us the following item Houston the unofficial home of the electric power industry is a town you either love or hate Here are some guiding principles offered by the Chamber of Commerce of the th largest city to enable their many visitors to cope F First you must learn to pronounce the city name It is YEWSTUN a nd it does not matter how people pronounce it in other places F Forget the traffic rules you learned elsewhere Houston has its ow n version of traffic rules Never forget that downtown Houston is composed entirely of one way streets The only way to get out of center of town is to turn around and start over when you reach Dallas Texas F All directions start with Go down Westheimer F Westheimer has no beginning and no end F Its impossible to go around a block and wind up on the street yo u started on The Chamber of Commerce calls this a scenic drive F The am rush hour is from to am The pm rush hour is from to pm Fridays rush hour starts on Thursday morning F If you actually stop at a yellow light you cannot be from Houston F Kuykendahl Road can only be pronounced by a native so do not attempt the phonetic pronunciation People will simply tilt their heads to the right and stare at you F Construction on the Gulf Freeway is a way of life and a permanent form of entertainment F Many bizarre sights can be explained simply by uttering the phrase Oh were in Montrose F Construction crews arent doing their job properly unless they close down all lanes except one during rush hour F If someone actually has their turn signal on it was probably lef t on at the factory where the car was made F White haired men driving red or silver sports cars will not obey a ny known traffic rule and cannot be expected to stop for red lights or stop signs F All ladies with blue hair who drive Cadillacs or Lincoln Continentals have the right of way F The above mentioned blue haired ladies also have a legal right to turn right from a left lane or to turn left from a right lane YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED F Buying a Houston street map is a waste of money since there is absolutely no way that you can route yourself in such a manner as to avoid major road construction F Houston natives are so rare that they are listed on the endangered species list The few remaining specimens are kept in a controlled environment for their own safety F Sir and Maam are used by the person speaking to you if theres a remote possibility that youre at least minutes older than they are F Sugar is a more common form of address than Miss So is Honey Do not take offense This is how southerners address grown women F In Houston we drink CocaCola and Dr Pepper It is rumored that other soft drinks are sold here but no one will admit to knowing anyone who actually drinks them So dont ask for any other soft drink F What you need to know when arriving at Bush Intercontinental Airport Your arrival gate is at least miles away from the Main Concourse of any terminal Walking heels on your boots or walking shoes are advised F Never honk your horn at another car in Houston traffic The bumper sticker that reads Keep honking Im reloading is considered fair

folks smoking crack he asked in an outrage My friend Ol Dave in Houston has trouble understanding the workings of our power business here in California In fact so do I Yesterdays Joint SenateAssembly Committee on Energy and Natural Resources did nothing to improve either Daves or my understanding of the national embarrassment California is perpetrating with electricity deregulation The next thing you know they will be taking property and forcing utilities to build power plants and transmission he mused between sips of Dixie longneck beer and chomps of jalapeno peppers Come to think of it Dave they did say something about that Yeah I recalled Senator Peace was expounding on his favorite idea which is forcing the ISO or the utilities to build peakers and not let the market build them I cant remember if that was before or after he suggested to EOB Chairman Kahn that the ISO and the PX should be folded into State agencies under the direction of the Electric Oversight Board I know what you are thinking right now The next thing you know California will have regulated retail rates That recipe should be out of the PUCs oven sometime next week Well the power marketers are jigging the system bidding up to the ISOs bid cap There is no way you can tell me that a generator planned to make MWH in its pro forma Dave added So you agree with Herr Hair Peace You dont believe in markets I retorted Oh I believe in them but I remember when I was short on a MW trade and without any notice or advanced warning the price in the Midwest market went against me Dave recalled I called everyone who I tra ded with and they had nothing I finally called XXXXX and I asked what will it cost for MW Why didnt you ask for I wondered I didnt want to show him my position You get hosed when you show the buyer your position Ask for first Dave chided What happened Oh they offered to sell for MWH I said I d take it and then said I needed another fifty He asked I took that and he priced the next MW at lamented Dave He just wanted to see how far he could push me Thats what I mean when I say the traders are jigging it But Dave you old communist your forgetting the trading function is what mitigates the risk The traders are the in between people who guess at the price Sometimes they guess right and sometimes they guess wrong But the damage or the reward is on their book not passed on to the ultimate consumer It has nothing to do with the marginal cost of a generating plant And there you have it Put in a price cap and the traders have a target for which to shoot I cant prove the following yet but Il l wager with any of you that as the price cap level dips down the average trading price climbs even as the socalled dysfunctional price spik es are eliminated Consumers get hosed and the fundamental economic principle is upheld which is one can never be made better off with the imposition of an additional constraint I feel better already Here is what is on our short agenda this week Things in the Mailbag Things in the Peoples Republic of California The ISO Replies to the EOB Report Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market Odds Ends Things in the Mailbag It has been awhile since we put the mail feedbag on and had a munch Here is what my friends have been writing me FPL Energys Steve Ponder was only too quick to tell me Please Gary no more whining about your computer How old are you Is this the year you get the AARP letter A very depressing moment Do you really not know how to spell Morro Bay Please let us know what is going on with your sons hockey team Dont forget the cigars for Moron Bay It is good to have friends like Steve They make the pain of separation so much easier And Steve when you FPL guys get that Entergy merger sorted out in a dozen years or so you let us know I want to participate in the name selection for the new entity How about Fentergy PLus Next from the PXs Mark Hoppe who writes As youve heard from others I dont know quite how you manage to knock out all this material each week The burrito is informative humorous and usually contains a sprinkle of irony tragedy ISO Drama Though you are usually neutral regarding the PX you are not unduly negative which I appreciate I think we do a pretty good job over here and so often people in the industry forget the amount effort and challenge it took the PX to successfully open this market Thanks Mark I just want you to know that my ability to write this stuff every week is not constrained by the facts or evidence I have learned from watching Herr Hair Peace that as long as you can talk write too fast and have conviction in your statements regardless of how groundless they may be you will have a willing and eager audience A few weeks ago I received from the PXs Jennifer Sherwood a note which she wants you to know are her opinions not necessarily the PXs Its okay Jennifer I paid Georgeyesterday the I owed him for that sham Rose Bowl bet remember Stanford lost and your opinions are cool with us Just curious has anyone been comparing high unleaded prices to high CA electricity prices What I mean is we are up in arms about how we should protect the unfortunate San Diego consumer who cant afford to keep the AC on But what about the inflated unleaded gas prices the whole country has seen over the last few months No effort is made by the government to shield the consumer from how much it costs to fill their gas tank No mention is made of those who cant afford to drive to the grocery store because they cant afford the extra or cents a gallon The costs are passed along to the consumer without pause Granted there are differences between the unleaded market and the electricity market in terms of demandside responsiveness but then again is it that much different to say I cant drive today because gas is too expensive vs I cant turn up the AC today because its too expensive Finally from one of our secret Washington readers and I am not telling who I received the following I broke down and listened to the ISO Governing Board discussion and vote Ugh I too noted that the speak fast was applied to everyone but Herr Peace My goodness what a mess we have I loved Jerrys picture in USA Today it spoke volumes My sources at FERC tell me though that we should keep an eye out for FERC Chairman Hoecker to do something really Censored for political reasons Given no Commission meetings til September the only way to act is by unanimous consent so I would hope he cant do all that much Things in the Peoples Republic of California The ISO Replies to the EOB Report Several of you people commented to me that the ISOs reply to the PUCEOB report was very good I decided to excerpt the best sections of it for the Burrito The full document can be found on the ISOs website the PUCEOB Report asserts that the suspected activities of certain generators on June created frequency instability leading to the Bay Area blackouts the following day In fact the events of June and June were completely independent of one another The voltage instability on June was caused by system conditions on that day alone exceptionally high loads insufficient generation in the specific local area and transmission constraints that prevented the import of generation from outside the area The Report states that the ISO never tried to call upon consume rs to reduce demand in order to avoid the Bay Area blackouts In fact the ISO had in place on June a number of demand response programs designed to reduce load including the Summer Demand Response Program under which customers have agreed through a prior solicitation to curtail energy use in exchange for a fee The Report makes a number of assertions concerning the prices paid by purchasers of energy as a result of the recent price spikes eg billion in the month of June alone These assertions leave one with the mistaken impression that these prices reflect amounts actually paid by the UDCs andor passed through to customers However in determining the total cost of energy one must determine the impact of any forward contracts entered into by the UDCs in advance of the wholesale energy markets These contracts which are designed to lockin a specific price in advance of realtime or near realtime market activities are specifically designed to mitigate the impact of price volatility and are standard in all commodities markets We have reason to believe that some of the UDCs were substantially hedged during the period of the recent price spikes In a similar vein the reports asserts that California might well have saved million dollars had a price cap been in place in May and June This assertion assumes that all energy purchases would have been made at or below the bid cap In fact during times of peak demand when all of the states generation has been exhausted the ISO competes with neighboring regions for available generation In order to secure the necessary power the ISO must purchase on a bilateral basis this energy from resources located outside of the ISOs control area The Report asserts that California power markets are not now competitive and implies erroneously in our view that this is the normal state of affairs It is not The Market Surveillance Committee has noted that market power in the California energy market appears to arise primarily during periods of peak demand and warned that demand growth would increase the incidence of market power during the summer of The Report asserts that the ISO is answerable only to a selfinterested board and not to the citizens of California This simply is not the case The ISO is subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act and to the rules and regulations of FERC which dictate in part that wholesale energy rates must be just and reasonable and in the public interest The ISO further operates under a detailed tariff reviewed and approved by FERC Every change to our market design and virtually every aspect of the ISOs business is subject to review and scrutiny by FERC The FERC process provides substantial opportunities for input by the state agencies and such agencies have in fact been active participants in the FERC proceedings The Report asserts that California supply conditions have been affected by restructuring and that somehow the restructuring choices have made California more vulnerable to supply shortages This assertion is unfounded Significant load growth in California and neighboring states coupled with a lack of significant infrastructure investment in both generation and transmission have caused this vulnerability Restructuring has increased proposed power plant applications many fold Only by immediate and sustained attention to streamlining approval and siting processes for both of these critical infrastructure elements will this significant shortage be addressed Things in the Peoples Republic of California Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings If you want to imagine a scary sight imagine then twelve California legislators gathering together in one hearing room to rectify the wrongs of electric restructuring Also imagine as if you are in the Twilight Zone witnesses that are slow on their feet and reckless in their facts Then you get a glimpse of what yesterdays Joint SenateAssembly hearing was like It started over two hours late The Senate was busy congratulating one of their own who is termlimited out next session and they wanted to heap on the glory That said the show began with CEC Commissioner Bill Keese Mr Keese has one story and regardless how well he tells it and he does it is always the same story It is the heat storm story One can imagine in the heat storm story a lead character who is a singlemom call her LadyBird Bowen who travels across an angry land with her precocious preteen child Stevie Wonderboy They are searching for electric power plants in the dessert which by the grace of God have been shipped to other countries which have more liberal returns on investment Being the first speaker Mr Keese took at least half the heat storm of the day The rage of the Energy Fuhrer was palpable Last week San Diegans shed MW of load last week to save the entire system and did not receive one penny of compensation Im not making that up He said it He is sick of hearing about demand management as being a solution for the problem over the last five years and he is about done listening People in San Diego are depressed by the sudden price hikes Yikes Keese did mention that the California reserve margin has sunk to but in neighboring Arizona the reserve margin is or Mr Keese correctly pointed out that electric power is not solely a California problem it is a regional problem One member of the Committee asked what the legislature could do to speed up the power plant siting and construction process Keese referred to Governor Gray Davis Executive Order issued last week to which the CEC plans to respond soon date uncertain that lays out a month permitting time line The six months are enough if the applicant has the land secured zoning okayed transmission access and air offsets Hmmmmmm That alone might take six months before you get to the CEC The next panel included Mr Kahn of the EOB and Ms Lynch I went too hard on her last week calling her Lets Do Lynch That was a TPC Sorry I promise to be nicer starting now The Energy Fuhrer instructed Ms Lynch to use her authority to order SDGE to divert the pass through of funds from the customers to the PX until the dysfunction of the market is cured Put it in an escrow account Ms Lynch promised to review this option at her August PUC Meeting where she will enact SDGE rate caps told you The star of the day I thought was FERC General Counsel Doug Smith Mr Smith comes to Sacramento Isnt that a switch Mr Smith came in place of Mr Hoecker thank the Lord Mr Smith put into FERCeese what these legislators could not get through their heads any other way The angry legislators were looking for a way for FERC to declare the wholesale market as noncompetitive and then ask the generators to give back the money they over collected When can we do that Mr Smith answered as only a FERC attorney can answer There is a process It takes time You must have evidence FERC uses a threepart criteria for assessing whether or not market based rates are allowable Its based on market concentration and dominance not the existence of high prices You would have to sue FERC in federal court and the best you could hope for is for FERC to reconsider its decision upon remand from the US Court of Appeals Slowly the wind came out of the sails of the gang of They were stumped Herr Hair Peace screamed couldnt you Mr Smith of FERC today use your authority to declare the markets noncompetitive that generators who had market based rates have exercised market power and retroactively implement a rate cap across the Western region Like a wheezing accordion Mr Smith played back and forth the familiar strains of music like a solo street musician on the corner Back and forth the process the process the process There have been times in the past I hated the process at FERC Today I have a renewed respect for what process affords me and you Freedom from the tyranny of a mob For the remainder of the hearing they focused on remedies that could be undertaken by the PUC Things in the Peoples Republic of California PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market Well the official title is Order Instituting Investigation into the Functioning of the Wholesale Electric Market and Associated Impact on Retail Electric Rates in the Services Territory of San Diego Gas Electric Company I like my title better This Order or OII was issued at the last business meeting of the Commission on August It calls for an investigation of the wholesale markets responses from the three UDCs and a prehearing conference in San Diego on August at the San Diego Convention Center Here are the questions the PUC wishes us to address What bill payment options should be provided to assist residential a nd small commercial customers What does this have to do with the functioning of the wholesale market Should SDGE be authorized to participate in bilateral contracts or other supply procurement activities How should the Commission assess reasonableness Are SDGEs purchasing activities serving its customers on just and reasonable terms What is SDGEs obligation to minimize energy costs for its curre nt customers How should the Commission Attorney General EOB ISO and PX coordinate to investigate wholesale market events behaviors and irregularities How should statefederal concerns be addressed What are the causes of the price increases Are anticompeititve practices causing some of the price increases Are there mechanisms the Commission can employ to make ratepayers whole Odds Ends As promised last week I have a message from our event coordinator Barb Ennis regarding the upcoming WPTF General Meeting on October and Listen up She writes Hi Folks Well it is almost

hint of Autumn in the air I dont know if its wishful thinking or if the seasons are really beginning to turn from our pale summer into a Bay Area glorious Fall Its premature I know A few fallen leaves the start of schools slightly longer afternoon shadows Im jumping the gun I cant wait for this summer to be over especially this summer The pounding never stops and as I hear the din of the cash register ringing with each climb in Southwest temperature I can barely keep track of all the hiccups which drive prices up fires in Montana restricting transmission paths blown up interstate gas pipeline in New Mexico diminishing NOx credits for instate power plants depleted inventory of hours of voluntary load interruptions for commercial and industrial customers credit limits restricting imports of Canadian power into the Northwest and California and BPA buying about MW to cover its short hydro position I also get the willies every time another politician lambastes the California restructured power industry I just want to end to the summer now and start a two week Fall vacation anywhere even in Cleveland There are seven count them seven investigations into some aspect of the wholesale power market out here Two days ago there were only six but FERC just added another yesterday in response to the Prezs request That means FERC has two the PUC has two the State Attorneys General has two one on the ISO Governing Board and one on the instate generators and one by the Electric Oversight Board If you dont have an ongoing study of the California Market then youre not hip All of these investigations save FERCs Section Investigation are going to amount to near nothing A lot of wasted time and paper The PUC and EOB studies have their conclusion sections all finished Now they need some evidence to support their assertions And how are we holding up under all of this How are you doing I talk to many of you throughout the week and I know how frustrated you are I share your frustration You want to tell the public the press and anyone in between the truth You want to lay out the facts You want to show anyone who will listen that each interference into the market is making things worse not better The price caps for example are damnable and screwing up the prices much to the detriment of those people for who price caps were supposed to be a protection against price shocks Now they are receiving higher average prices The public isnt going to listen to anything longer than a sound bite And lets face it when it comes to stellar public relations our industry is not known for turning in A performances except for SCE Those guys seem to get their story in front of the public at every turn I heard SCE is putting on their customers bill Here is what you would have paid if the rate freeze ended But many of us in the new power industry borne from the loins of either the naturalgas industry or nuclearpower business learned the hard way that the best response to a public inquiry is a twoblock head start in front of an angry mob Keep your head down shut your mouth and this too shall pass I dont buy that approach at least not anymore That is I dont believe we have anything to hide or of which to be ashamed What electric restructuring is about is correct beneficial to the public and in everyones best interests Look at it this way when they pat the last shovelful of dirt on your final resting place for what do you most want to be remembered That you caved in to the political will of others or at a moment when you had the chance you did what was right instead of what was expedient I think the choice is easy albeit laced with sheer terror Those bland homilies I so diligently teach my kids eg tell the truth do what is right think of the big picture and not just yourself are a lot easier to speak than to live by So join me and stand up for what you believe They cant take away your pride not yet Here is this weeks line up Things in the Peoples Republic of California Excerpts from FERCs Order on SDGE Complaint The Development of a SuperPeak Block Energy Product The Mailbag A Letter from My Friend and A Response Odds and Ends Finish the Story Contest October General Meeting What Makes Houston Houston Things in the Peoples Republic of California Excerpts from FERCs Order on SDGE Complaint President Clinton commented from the Rose Garden that good folks in San Diego retired fixedincome likely to vote for a Democrat are making choices between buying medicine or air conditioning their homes I call this the Del Monica Beach lecture The Prez instructed the FERC to investigate the situation in California and FERC wasted no time In response to SDGEs August complaint whereby the utility asked FERC to impose a price cap on generators in the region the FERC responded in a way that I was hoping to see several months ago The FERC slammed SDGE on their complaint for lack of merit and the FERC also initiated an FPA Section Investigation into the wholesale power market in California Here are some of the juicy excerpts from FERCs Order In this order we are denying SDGEs requested immediate imposition of a price cap on all sellers in California However we are instituting consolidated hearing proceedings pursuant to section of the Federal Power Act to investigate the justness and reasonableness of the rates and charges of public utilities that sell energy and ancillary services to or through the California ISO and PX and to also investigate whether the tariffs and institutional structures and bylaws of the California ISO and PX are adversely affecting the efficient operation of competitive wholesale electric power markets in California and need to be modified SDGE concludes that the markets cannot be workably competitive if sellers are able to exact prices that are considerably above levels that would prevail in open competition ie sellers are able to bid and receive prices significantly above their marginal costs SDGE also argues that the hourtohour volatility in imbalance energy prices and the erratic clearing price for ancillary services is an indication that the market is breaking down when it is moderately stressed While we find it appropriate to institute a section hearing on these issues we cannot implement an immediate price cap of MWh as requested by SDGE because there is no record before us to support such an action While the issues raised by this complaint are important the Commission has no basis to conclude that SDGEs proposal to place an immediate arbitrary MWh cap on the price that every public utility seller of energy and ancillary services may bid into the PX and ISO markets would satisfy this standard SDGE has provided no evidence to demonstrate that all potential sellers are able to exercise market power has not documented a single instance of a seller exercising market power during times of scarcity and did not attempt to show that the conditions underlying the Commissions approval of marketbased rates for public utility sellers of energy and ancillary services have changed Nor did it address specific market or institutional factors that may be causing rates to be unjust or unreasonable SDGE asserts that the ISOs congestion management and market structures are flawed and in need of overhaul Furthermore SDGE expresses its concern that for a number of reasons the congestion management and market reform efforts being pursued by ISO stakeholders will not produce meaningful results SDGE indicates that it is prepared to work with the ISO to develop alternative reform proposals however SDGEs complains that the ISO stakeholder process has in SDGEs judgment been ineffective with respect to these issues Various interveners contend that SDGEs arguments are premature We agree with Interveners The reform efforts have been the subject of extensive public review and comment and are nearing completion Accordingly we reject SDGEs arguments at this time It is unclear whether SDGEs failure to purchase hedging instruments for its retail operations is due to state regulatory policies or its business decisions A retail rate design that exposes consumers to the volatility of commodity prices would be extraordinary particularly when consumers do not have the ability to receive or respond to price signals We are concerned that increasing level of market activity in the realtime market raises significant reliability and economical concerns Historically the ISO procures on a daily basis only the resources needed for the operating day Not only does this procurement practice put pressure on the grid operator to secure needed resources at the last minute but the practice is uneconomical Such spotmarket purchases are not subject to the ISOs buyers cap Furthermore because the ISO is the supplier of last resort for these services when OOM calls are made suppliers realize that the ISO is in a mustbuy situation In an effort to address this problem we direct the ISO to immediately institute a more forward approach to procuring the resources necessary to reliably operate the grid Specifically the ISO should anticipate the need for such additional resources based on forecasted peak periods We direct the ISO to factor these reforms into an analysis of the need for and level of purchase price caps and to include this analysis as support for any filing it makes to extend its purchase price cap authority In closing WPTF is an intervenor in the case and we hope to be very active in the case through testimony cross examination the filing of briefs and reply briefs Things in the Peoples Republic of California The Development of a SuperPeak Block Energy Product Several weeks ago I discussed with the ISO their interest in developing a new market for a block energy product that would be purchased in the morning of a trade day and be dispatched during the superpeak hours I challenged them to let the market participants develop this market instead of the ISO doing the same At the August ISO Governing Board meeting I stated as the WPTF position that we oppose price caps but if the ISO Governing Board insisted on going down the MWH price cap route we would do what ever we could to help the situation and avoid the occurrences of Stage alerts Whereas I didnt think about the conversation on superpeak block markets as being relevant to the remarks before the Governing Board it became painfully clear soon after that we could and should work with the ISO to develop a new market through either APX or the California PX or both to bring some order to the otherwise chaotic Out of Market system This week WPTF and the ISO had a joint meeting whereby both sides discussed the merits of a superpeak block firmenergy product and how it could be instituted The meeting at the ISO at which WPTF had many of its members who either have generation in the State or import power into California was for market participants and the ISO to discuss how to bring more order and price transparency to the ISOs out of market calls The ISO reported that this summer to date the amount of money spent on Out of Market purchases was about million Last year the total cost of Out of Market purchases was million APX and CalPX in response to our earlier discussions with them presented their proposals at the meeting The discussions which ensued during the course of the presentations focused on how the ISO might utilize a productservice to reduce the manpower requirements currently needed to satisfy its out of market telephone calls typically on short notice and the interest on the part of market participants to make bids into either the APX or CalPXs proposed system for a superpeak firmenergy product There were no commitments made by any party simply a willingness to work together to alleviate the problems associated with finding sufficient electric power during high demand periods with greater transparency more participants and greater market efficiency Well keep you posted on our development of this market The Mailbag A Letter from My Friend and A Response Sometimes I share bites of our Burrito with fellow travellers much as I did last week when I sent my friend Mike Florio a copy of the story called the Trial of Gow Jing Mike sent me a note that I would like to share He said I could I want you to read it and appreciate that there are other people who share his view I also copied the response I sent to Michael aka Old Deuteronomy Michael wrote Im not going to attempt to complete your little melodrama the GowJing story but I did want to offer an observation In simpler times people knew the other people that they did business with and they typically lived in the same community If a merchant tried to charge exorbitant prices for his products even if he was the only one in town who had the product in stock he would face the wrath of his fellow citizens This undoubtedly served as a constraint on such behavior even in the absence of a CPUC or FERC Telling Mrs Jones that the loaf of bread she needs to feed her kids will cost her would not be a pleasant way to do business and such things ordinarily did not happen In the modern global economy of course this personal aspect of doing business has been almost completely lost And so has the restraint I have no doubt that the folks who sell electricity are good people jeez I know many of them but they work in an environment where the end results of their business decisions are invisible If Mrs Jones cant afford to run her refrigerator any more that fact is at best dimly perceived and if so it is viewed as cause for some sort of social program not a reason why a merchant would alter his behavior This is clearly not a case of socialism versus capitalism because both scenarios occur within the overall context of a capitalist system But certainly something fundamental has changed and not for the better in my view Now everyone feels compelled to squeeze the last dollar out of every transaction their jobs may even depend upon it and no one is responsible for the end result Is this the kind of world we want to live in PUT THAT IN YOUR BURRITO AND SEE WHAT YOUR READERS SAY YOU CAN EVEN BLAME ME SO THAT YOU ARE NOT ACCUSED OF TURNING PINK IN YOUR MIDDLE AGE Deut Okay Its in the Burrito And here is what I think You allude to the change in a world that was once more personal and is now institutional You make the point that things are not better off if for no other reason then the lack of personal accountability But I dont think that in all cases the more personal world is lost It is ever present as I will argue below Second your group embraces the impersonal efficiencies when it is convenient Finally and most importantly where will your socialminded and like minded counterparts be when competitive forces leap supply ahead of demand which might happen in a handful of years However your essential point is not lost on me I do believe that there are ways for generators and consumers to be good neighbors in California I have a proposal below to which I would like to hear your response First though the personal business touch is present in our economy I exercise the restraint to which your story pines in many of my consulting engagements which require financial give and take between client and vendor It is simply smart business to do so I have been the beneficiary of the same with my local bank when errors occurred in my checking accounts or when loan payments were made absent mindedly late etc and the late fee forgiven However much of our economy and certainly the trade of a commodity such as electricity requires the use of markets Nameless and faceless they do squeeze out all the efficiencies which lead to lower prices more innovation and a sharing of price risk with parties who are neither the ultimate consumer nor the initial producer The producer and consumer get out of the risk arbitrage and leave it to others who are more skilled and monied I find it ironic that TURN then is so insistent on arguing as it has done on many many occasions for the relaxation of market separation in the ISOs congestion management reform Elimination of market separation is nothing more than the impersonal forcing of parties to execute trades on either side of a congested transmission path in the name of market efficiency Lower prices for consumers Does it really matter if it is done through person to person transactions or through markets Third your story can be used to make an alternative point What happens to the merchant in town when WalMart moves into the next town down the road All the faithful customers that your Merchant of Vengeance was protecting suddenly migrate to a competitor with greater inventory more choice and lower prices What do you say then The corollary for us is direct The new generation owners moved literally billions of dollars into California at risk and took a chance It paid off They succeeded as we all know this year and probably will next year and so on But the MW of new power plants under construction in California and the MW under construction in Arizona and the over MW of combined power projects in California Arizona and Southern Nevada that are in line for permits will change the financial landscape in a hurry once energized The prices will soften returns will be less cherry and I really want to know where will todays accusers be when there is a shake out Consumers will reap that benefit oh you best believe it But the alliances to which your opening story alludes simply misses that point You gotta make hay while the sun shines Now to my proposal Michael I would be willing to work with you to develop some kind of loan program for residential and small commercial customers that would in effect reduce the economic hardship of higher electricity prices I could imagine although I havent tested the idea with any parties that a significant program could be crafted possibly secured by the credit of participating generating companies and executed by a commercial lending institution such as Bank of America Borrowers would pay a fair interest rate and the administrative fees Its simply smart business not charity Its one way to amortize th e earnings which came about due to a circumstance of short supply relative to the sudden growth of demand for power Maybe that is a step in the right direction I dont know One could argue that it is no different than SDGE implementing a level payment plan for its consumers True it is no different because in either case the customer is paying for the loan interest and administrative fees and I consistently believe that a market for credit is more efficient am I getting impersonal than one instituted by a monopoly Second the security for these loans is provided by parties other than the utilitys customers Further we wouldnt have to wor ry about PUC oversight and prudence reviews We could make this work quickly I will be very interested to hear your thoughts and the comments of my members Thanks for sending us your letter Odds and Ends Finish the Story Contest Well there was only one response and that was from Carl Imparato Here is what Carl said Am I missing something Who is GowJing supposed to represent Yes I get the pun in the name But is he also just an anonymous everyman or is there someone in particular My first response to your question is that GowJing simply replies Itai You could look it up I think its Chinese for it hurt s Then he takes out a concealed axe goes on a rampage and kills everyone But thats too realistic so dont use that ending Instead Ending Just as he was about to reply a giant foot wall of water swept through the room drowning everyone And they lived happily ever after The end I havent decided whether to name this response Carls Gilgamesh Epic Ie Noah and the flood or Carls Hydro Dream Well leave the contest open

unofficial home of the electric power industry is a town you either love or hate Here are some guiding principles offered by the Chamber of Commerce of the th largest city to enable their many visitors to cope First you must learn to pronounce the city name It is YEWSTUN a nd it does not matter how people pronounce it in other places Forget the traffic rules you learned elsewhere Houston has its ow n version of traffic rules Never forget that downtown Houston is composed entirely of one way streets The only way to get out of center of town is to turn around and start over when you reach Dallas Texas All directions start with Go down Westheimer Westheimer has no beginning and no end Its impossible to go around a block and wind up on the street yo u started on The Chamber of Commerce calls this a scenic drive The am rush hour is from to am The pm rush hour is from to pm Fridays rush hour starts on Thursday morning If you actually stop at a yellow light you cannot be from Houston Kuykendahl Road can only be pronounced by a native so do not attempt the phonetic pronunciation People will simply tilt their heads to the right and stare at you Construction on the Gulf Freeway is a way of life and a permanent form of entertainment Many bizarre sights can be explained simply by uttering the phrase Oh were in Montrose Construction crews arent doing their job properly unless they close down all lanes except one during rush hour If someone actually has their turn signal on it was probably lef t on at the factory where the car was made White haired men driving red or silver sports cars will not obey a ny known traffic rule and cannot be expected to stop for red lights or stop signs All ladies with blue hair who drive Cadillacs or Lincoln Continentals have the right of way The above mentioned blue haired ladies also have a legal right to turn right from a left lane or to turn left from a right lane YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED Buying a Houston street map is a waste of money since there is absolutely no way that you can route yourself in such a manner as to avoid major road construction Houston natives are so rare that they are listed on the endangered species list The few remaining specimens are kept in a controlled environment for their own safety Sir and Maam are used by the person speaking to you if theres a remote possibility that youre at least minutes older than they are Sugar is a more common form of address than Miss So is Honey Do not take offense This is how southerners address grown women In Houston we drink CocaCola and Dr Pepper It is rumored that other soft drinks are sold here but no one will admit to knowing anyone who actually drinks them So dont ask for any other soft drink What you need to know when arriving at Bush Intercontinental Airport Your arrival gate is at least miles away from the Main Concourse of any terminal Walking heels on your boots or walking shoes are advised Never honk your horn at another car in Houston traffic The bumper sticker that reads Keep honking Im reloading is considered fair warning DDDDDDDDDDDDD Have a great weekend yall gba

about whats new whats happening and all the important stuff This week Governor Gray Davis decided to write his own Burrito His epistle got more press than mine but why is he muscling in o n my turf

business f or all of us They need to clear out With people like Herr Hair Peace Governor ImNot MrRogers Davis a nd Lets Do Lynch who needs a Friday Burrito They redefine our reality each week with mindnumbing aplomb For example starting in early June the PX was ordered to compete for business against other Qualified Trading Vehicles Then two weeks later the Energy Fhrer legislated that idea to an early death which kept the status quo for at least one year This week the PUC approved year bilateral deals for PGE and SCE thereby opening t he PX to competition and emasculating the PXs Block

California Is there anyone left at SDGE with a brain Well the answer very clearly is no I have been astounded by repeated attempts of SDGEs most senior people to ape humans but instead they m imic apes Consider the following First they waltz their default customers into the summer with little of no protection from price spikes in the wholesale market Forgivable in that it is human to err The prices skyrocket in June and they start looking for who to blame Must be them damn independent generators say their managers Gary Cotton informs the IS O Governing Board that hedging SDGEs position in the Block Forward Marke t wouldnt have made any difference Theres one nobel laureate who mi ssed his prime Next under pressure they ask for help from suppliers and anyone else who will assist the utility and their customers Nine offers show up at their table and they cant choose any of them Again Mr Cotton tells his fe llow ISO Governing Board members that these things take time and we dont to rush since there are many legislative barriers and well the surfing was good this week so why spoil it Now they are in a panic because the Energy Fhrer is visiting old ladies living in trailer parks advising them not to pay their SDGE electricity bill and to continue to operate their air conditioners SDGE puts a full page ad in the local newspaper telling everyone that SDGE is doing everything it can to lower their electric bills including asking the ISO f or a price cap but the public can help by calling the ISO address and phone number provided in the ad and urging them to lower the cap I alway s thought the location of the ISO was a State secret for security reasons N o secrets in San Diego But we are not done No sir we are not Those buffalo heads who run that company decide they will win a gold star on their collective foreheads and implement one of the four resolutions passed by the Electric Oversight Board The one they pick is to petition FERC on an expedited basis to cap at the price at which sellers may bid energy or ancillary services into the ISO and the PX The primary reason is that Western power markets are n ot workably competitive In other words they want FERC to set a max price on what generators can sell in addition to the price limit at which the ISO ca n buy What I find most astounding about this double talk is that SDGE continues to collect tons of money from the sales of regulatory must run energy into the PX These are sales from their stranded assets Their grief hasnt ab ated their greed So to recap SDGE missed the boat on price hedging failed to win consume r confidence in public meetings asked for help from suppliers and did nothin g in response then filed at FERC to cap the sale price because the wholesale market into which they sell overpriced energy is not workably competitive Too much time in the direct sun light Things on the Island of California The PUC issues its scathing report The PUC report released yesterday is a gem with which I have not spent enou gh time I only read the Executive Summary and that only because our counsel Dan Douglass forwarded me a copy Let me pick out some of the gems in President Lets Do Lynchs burrito I would recommend reading the whole text if you have time and if you seek perverse entertainment California is experiencing major problems with electricity supply and pricing caused by policies and procedures adopted over the past ten years Since June wholesale prices for electrical power in California have increased on average over the same period in resulting in over billion in excess payments for electricity Hot weather aging power plant and transmission infrastructure and dysfunctional bidding behavior in the wholesale power markets combined to drive prices up Because of serious market defects and tight supply of electricity purchasers of California power will likely pay billions more in electricity costs this year Moreover these price increases do not necessarily fund ne w investments in electricity supply or delivery reliability they may flow solely to power producer profit margins Despite the Electricity Oversight Boards legislative mandate to overse e those institutions we have been unable to obtain bid data Nevertheless we believe enough evidence of questionable behavior exists that the Attorney General should conduct an investigation into these statewide marke t practices coordinating with other State agencies including the PUC and th e EOB Such an investigation would provide the factual foundation that California policy makers and regulators need to recover any illegally obtained profits A momentous consequence of Californias attempt to create a market in electricity is that the federal government now regulates Californias electric system Washington DC now controls pricing decisions directly at the wholesale level and indirectly at the retail level and to the extent that supply incentives are correlated to prices Washington DC now affec ts Californias ability to attract new investment in power plants Past administrations willingness to cede the States authority to the federal government combined with the legislative creation of two nonpublic supervisory organizations that have no duty to protect the public or consid er the retail customer The Independent System Operator ISO and the Power Exchange PX the nonprofit private corporations that operate the States transmission system and control wholesale pricing policies are governed by boards whose members can have serious conflicts of interest Some of these board members or their companies financially benefit from higher prices in electricity markets Neither of these private organizations is accountable to the State or its consumers Despite the federalization and the fragmentation of the States electri c services the State of California should protect its businesses and consume rs from cartel pricing collusive behavior inadequate power plant maintenance and lack of market planning for adequate electricity supplies California consumers and businesses deserve to know in advance as San Diegans did not this summer how and when the price of an essential servic e like electricity will double California is now largely constrained by federal mandates from providing comprehensive retail price relief as long a s wholesale prices remain so high If California tried to reimpose a price freeze in San Diego now federal regulators would likely prevent that action Shortterm price relief however cannot resolve market gaming or fundamental wholesale pricing problems controlled by federal regulators We have been precluded from obtaining the data necessary to know if th e ISO and PX failed to detect manipulation and gaming on several fronts We do no t know how market players acted in price offering and bidding and scheduling The FERC has just announced an inquiry into national pricing and energy market issues California should not wait for national findings before it investigates California market practices We recommend that the California Attorney General immediately subpoena relevant records and data to determin e the pricing and offering behavior of market participants the actions of th e ISO and its board members and the actions of generators in supplying Californias energy needs Ten Actions to Consider or Act Upon to Prevent Current Electricity Prob lems From Spreading in Create a California Energy Council modeled on the National Security Council to unify State action to resolve energy problems and to perform integrated energy planning Ask FERC for extended wholesale price cap authority to moderate Californ ia wholesale market pricing Ask FERC to recognize the defects in the California and western regional markets and find that no competitive market exists in California power markets Eliminate potential conflicts of interest in ISOPX stakeholder board s Improve Californias ability to obtain ISO and generator data and enhanc e the States enforcement capability for power plant maintenance price manipulation and generation gaming consistent with protection of proprieta ry business information Provide the EOB with effective enforcement ability and additional oversight authority for the ISO and PX Ten Issues to Consider or Act Upon Within the Next Six Months Streamline state power plant siting procedures consistent with environmental requirements and prioritize applications to advance clean BACT power plant proposals Institute useit or loseit permitting power plant licensing and emissions credits rules to ensure power plants get built Reform PX pricing protocols and structures to lower wholesale and retai l prices and reduce excess profits I told you I dont need to write a Burrito anymore The Democrats in Sacramento are doing that for me Welcome comrade Things on the Island of California The ISO invokes price caps Duh It is really hard to describe the drama of an ISO Governing Board meeting especially when our favorite topic arises It seems the only time the Boar d becomes animated is when one of three issues are on the agenda price caps FTRs and priorities for software enhancements Otherwise its pretty much humdrum Round and round we went once again A few more forced votes tippe d the scale in favor of the cap There were yes votes which included a force d yes vote from our friend Jerry Toenyes by order of Secretary of Energy Mr Richardson Jerry did you realize that the last letters of your name coul d be rearranged to spell NO ET YES Kind of a french thing Im sorry about that vote Jerry You still go in my book as one of the brave and bo ld for standing up to that sort of intimidation for so long Your picture in the SF Chron said it all The brave souls who stood tall and voted NO included David Parquet Enron Jan SmutnyJones IEP Barbara Barkovich CLECA Caolyn Kehrein CMA Da n Kirshner EDF and Stacy Roscoe Procter Gamble Now I must admit tha t Dynegys Greg Blue did help by voting a Texas No spelled ABSTA IN I have instructed Dynegy trader Dave Francis in Houston to work with Greg t o correct that problem Were going to work things out The Energy Fhrer addressed the Board again I didnt mind that I only had a few brief very brief moments to address the Board and Herr Hair Peac e got over minutes That didnt bother me at all He did more damage to himself in than I could do in He blasted away at everyone who oppose d him He pined about Camden quitting the Board He said he knew how prices and markets work that it isnt the way those academic egghead FERClo ving economists tell you who pray to the gods of competition He lambasted WAPA for withholding generation to protect fish and wildlife what was that all about He predicted that on Thursdays PUC meeting he and all the oth er powerful Democrats Republicans and angry citizens of San Diego would deman d that the PUC impose a rate cap on retail electric rates in San Diego that a re just and reasonable it didnt happen And on and on and on This man is very delusional He believes that Steve and only Steve Peace can save the world He believes that political will trumps judicial quasijudicial or independent Board actions This man makes relevant all the abstract musing s of the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche The will to power t he bermensch the transvaluation of values etc But we are getting under uber his skin with the help of the press Wednesday afternoon I called Commissioner Dick Bilas to see if he thought whether the next days PUC meeting was going to be a roll over Dick sai d he got a call from Peace and that Peace said he would not come to the meeting Apparently Peace had received a lot of press and all of it bad Thats the thin line of freedom which keeps tyranny at least one step aw ay from our front door Things at the throne of FERC Amen for the Morgan Stanley Order And now the good news You deserve this FERC gave the California market a little wiggle room last Friday FERC issued a last minute reply to the complaint by Morgan Stanley Capital Group relating to the ISOs intent t o lower the price cap FERC denied the complaint but they didnt waste t ime with an Order to simply deny a complaint FERC danced on the head of the I SO and pulled the bite out of the price cap Here are some excerpts We accepted this Amendment not because it was a cap on sellers prices but because it would promote order and transparency in the market by clearl y telling sellers of the maximum price the ISO was willing to pay and allowin g sellers to make informed economic choices on whether to sell in the ISO market or to sell elsewhere The ISO has no more or less ability to procure capacity and energy than any other buyer of these services If the ISO is unable to elicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced purchase price ceiling becau se generators are free to sell elsewhere if they choose it will have to rais e its purchase price to the level necessary to meet its needs Therefore an increase in outofmarket OOM calls for generation may be necessary to maintain system reliability Because the current payment for OOM is not subject to a maximum purchase price the resulting overall payments may be higher To the extent the ISO Board resolution contemplates implementing a directive that generators must bid their capacity into the ISO markets unde r any circumstances eg when system load exceeds MW such a requirement is not permitted by our Order and the ISO tariff Futur e implementation of the ISO Board resolution with regard to a requirement to sell would require significant revisions to the ISO market rules Such market changes could not become effective absent a corresponding amendment to the ISO tariff which would have to be filed under section of the FPA Well What do you think about that Just wait Here is what the sleeping bear Commissioner Hebert said in his concurring remarks Getting to the bottom of the problem in my view requires us to begin a proceeding to rescind our approval of the ISO as the operator of the California grid The record supports such a move A memorandum to the ISO from a stakeholder who resigned from the governing board eloquently brings to our attention repeated attempts to undermine the independence of the ISO The memorandum also thoughtfully outlines consequences to the markets of a return to command and control Because these allegations come from a nonmarket participant especiall y should we take heed We must also take notice of the public pressure on th e Board to compromise its independence Amen brother amen Odds and Ends As you can imagine this week like an endless string of weeks before this has been interminable I get about three phone calls a day from press reporters very little of which ever sees print My shtick is just too complex for casual readers But I do notice that the reporters are asking better questions The public is becoming more savvy The information flow is moving in our favor and will disarm the forces of evil in about years I have other problems on my mind I am working on a new computer system Really its just an upgrade of an older computer that is a bit faster t han the laptop I tried to upgrade very unsuccessfully As a result of the all the new hardware and software I purchased my office looks like a war zone with an odd mix of PUC service copies computer documentation and diskette s laying all around Quite a mess Prepare for the future Our next general meeting is scheduled for Thursday and Friday October and at Moro Bay Barb Ennis will prepare a blurb f or us in next weeks Burrito about room reservations timing golf etc O ur guest speakers will include MSC Chairman Professor Frank Wolak who will tal k on the subject of his choice Ms Irene Moosen of Grueneich Resource Advocates who will make a presentation on the distributed generation case before the PUC and William Freddo of PGE National Energy Group who will give us some education on operating a power plant inside the New England IS O Now for your daily bread provided this week by Dan Douglass Last week we had a joke about Catholics This week its agnostics DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD An atheist was taking a walk thru the woods admiring all that the accident of evolution had created What majestic trees What powerful rivers Wha t beautiful animals he said to himself As he was walking alongside the river he heard a rustling in the bushes behind him As he turned to look he saw a foot grizzly bear charging towards him He ran as fast as he could up the path He looked over his shoulder and saw that the bear was closing in on him He tried to run even faster so scared that tears were coming to his eyes His heart was pumping frantically as he tried to run even faster but he tripped and fell on the ground He rolled over to pick himself up and saw the bear right on top of him raising its paw to kill him At that instant he cried out Oh my God And time stopped The bear froze The forest was silent The river even stopped flowing A bright light shone upon the man and a voice out of the sky said You deny my existenc e all these years teach others I dont exist and even credit my creation to a cosmic accident and now do you expect me to help you out of this predicament Am I to count you as a believer The atheist ever so proud looked into the light and said It would be rather hypocritical to ask to be counted as a believer after all these years but could you make the bear a believer Very well said the voice And the light went out the river flowed the sounds of the forest continued and the bear brought both paws together bowed his head and said Lord I thank you for this food which I am about to receive DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD Amen And have a great weekend Oh and thanks to all of you who sent me happy birthday wishes It was very much appreciated KSB gba

XMimeOLE Produced By Microsoft MimeOLE V XStatus XKeywords XUID XMozillaStatus Heres the latest press release from PGE Proposal Uses Hydroelectric Power to Help Stabilize Energy Prices Business Editors and Energy Writers EDITORS Please do not use Pacific Gas and Electric or PGE when referring to PGE Corporation or its National Energy Group The PGE National Energy Group is not the same company as Pacific Gas and Electric Company the utility and is not regulated by the California Public Utilities Commission Customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Company do not have to buy products or services from the National Energy Group in order to continue to receive quality regulated services from Pacific Gas and Electric Company SAN FRANCISCOBUSINESS WIREAug As state swelters through long hot summers cheap hydroelectric power will ensure consumers pay less for electricity Citing broad support from a coalition representing consumer advocates business labor agriculture and water interests Pacific Gas and Electric Company jointly filed an agreement with the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC today to commit the utilitys hydroelectric generating plants to the effort to help provide needed stability in Californias fragile electricity market If approved by the CPUC this settlement agreement creates a compact between customer groups and Pacific Gas and Electric Company that would enhance the economic and environmental benefits of the hydroelectric system for the public The agreement would supersede current plans for auctioning the hydroelectric plants to third parties which were filed late last year The agreement calls for PGE Corporation to retain the hydroelectric generation system within a Californiabased affiliate The other signatories to the agreement include The Utility Reform Network TURN the Coalition of California Utility Employees CUE Agricultural Energy Consumers Association AECA California Retailers Association Sonoma County Water Agency and Tuolumne Utility District Parties came together to develop this proposal that will moderate prices and combined with the strong leadership steps taken by Governor Davis last week will help ensure consumers are protected from the volatility of the market said Gordon Smith President and CEO of Pacific Gas and Electric Company We are gratified to have the support of large and small consumer groups for this settlement The power produced by these hydroelectric facilities will now be committed to the market during the periods when the market needs it the most thereby reducing price volatility caused by supply shortages Additionally the agreement returns percent of any profits from hydroelectric operations to customers This sharing of revenues will act as a natural hedge for customers against rising energy prices since as market prices increase so will payments back to customers under the agreement A key component of the settlement is a proposed agreement with the California Independent System Operator CAISO that assures that power from the hydroelectric assets will not be bid into the energy market in a way that can raise power prices said Nettie Hoge executive director of TURN and strong supporter of the proposal The agreements key components Provides a revenuesharing mechanism that returns percent of profits from the hydroelectric operations to customers Establishes a market value of billion for the hydroelectric system that can be used immediately to pay down ratepayer cost obligations Commits PGE Corporation to establish a million fund to enhance environmental quality water quality and recreational opportunities Commits PGE Corporation to donate or protect through conservation easements approximately acres of watershed lands for public use Honors all existing water agreements with downstream users Protects agricultural uses of the water Ensures the facilities will continue to be operated by a highly qualified union workforce This settlement benefits both California consumers and PGEs employees said Jack McNally Business Manager of IBEW Consumers will be assured that hydroelectric plants will continue to be operated by the same dedicated employees will continue to provide low cost reliable energy to California consumers and will continue to be owned by a California company IBEW represents the union members who operate and maintain the hydroelectric system This agreement represents a fair valuation of the hydroelectric system said Michael Boccadoro director Agricultural Energy Consumers Association this agreement also protects the longstanding beneficial relationship between the hydro operations and the agricultural users in the state The settlement agreement filed at the CPUC will be subject to public hearings and review under the California Environmental Quality Act CEQA Interested parties will be able to provide comment prior to any CPUC decision Also the hydroelectric system transfer requires approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC The CEQA review process itself will ensure that there are no significant environmental impacts as a result of this transfer said Gordon Smith In addition keeping the hydroelectric facilities and associated watershed lands together protects the public interest in these assets The system includes dams powerhouses miles of canals tunnels and flumes and approximately acres of watershed land The hydroelectric system has a capacity of megawatts and provides a clean renewable lowcost source of electricity particularly during periods of high demand The system currently delivers about percent of Californias yearly electricity needs and up to of the States electricity demand during hot summer days We have enjoyed a positive working relationship with the folks at PGE for many years said Tim McCullough manager of the Tuolumne Utilities District This agreement ensures the water resource will continue to be managed in a way that protects the interests of Tuolumne County residents This agreement differs substantially from the transfer contemplated through legislation at the end of August last year The Legislative proposal did not include the price stabilizing revenue sharing mechanism Although the legislative package ultimately failed to achieve consensus because of the immense complexities of balancing interests through legislative compromise this years regulatory filing fulfills the directives of the restructuring legislation and provides the kind of public and state environmental review that will forge consensus PGE Corporation with operating revenues of almost billion and operations in states markets energy services and products throughout North America through its National Energy Group PGE Corporations businesses also include Pacific Gas and Electric Company the Northern and Central California utility that delivers natural gas and electricity to one in every Americans

XMimeOLE Produced By Microsoft MimeOLE V XStatus XKeywords XUID XMozillaStatus Heres the latest press release from PGE Proposal Uses Hydroelectric Power to Help Stabilize Energy Prices Business Editors and Energy Writers EDITORS Please do not use Pacific Gas and Electric or PGE when referring to PGE Corporation or its National Energy Group The PGE National Energy Group is not the same company as Pacific Gas and Electric Company the utility and is not regulated by the California Public Utilities Commission Customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Company do not have to buy products or services from the National Energy Group in order to continue to receive quality regulated services from Pacific Gas and Electric Company SAN FRANCISCOBUSINESS WIREAug As state swelters through long hot summers cheap hydroelectric power will ensure consumers pay less for electricity Citing broad support from a coalition representing consumer advocates business labor agriculture and water interests Pacific Gas and Electric Company jointly filed an agreement with the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC today to commit the utilitys hydroelectric generating plants to the effort to help provide needed stability in Californias fragile electricity market If approved by the CPUC this settlement agreement creates a compact between customer groups and Pacific Gas and Electric Company that would enhance the economic and environmental benefits of the hydroelectric system for the public The agreement would supersede current plans for auctioning the hydroelectric plants to third parties which were filed late last year The agreement calls for PGE Corporation to retain the hydroelectric generation system within a Californiabased affiliate The other signatories to the agreement include The Utility Reform Network TURN the Coalition of California Utility Employees CUE Agricultural Energy Consumers Association AECA California Retailers Association Sonoma County Water Agency and Tuolumne Utility District Parties came together to develop this proposal that will moderate prices and combined with the strong leadership steps taken by Governor Davis last week will help ensure consumers are protected from the volatility of the market said Gordon Smith President and CEO of Pacific Gas and Electric Company We are gratified to have the support of large and small consumer groups for this settlement The power produced by these hydroelectric facilities will now be committed to the market during the periods when the market needs it the most thereby reducing price volatility caused by supply shortages Additionally the agreement returns percent of any profits from hydroelectric operations to customers This sharing of revenues will act as a natural hedge for customers against rising energy prices since as market prices increase so will payments back to customers under the agreement A key component of the settlement is a proposed agreement with the California Independent System Operator CAISO that assures that power from the hydroelectric assets will not be bid into the energy market in a way that can raise power prices said Nettie Hoge executive director of TURN and strong supporter of the proposal The agreements key components Provides a revenuesharing mechanism that returns percent of profits from the hydroelectric operations to customers Establishes a market value of billion for the hydroelectric system that can be used immediately to pay down ratepayer cost obligations Commits PGE Corporation to establish a million fund to enhance environmental quality water quality and recreational opportunities Commits PGE Corporation to donate or protect through conservation easements approximately acres of watershed lands for public use Honors all existing water agreements with downstream users Protects agricultural uses of the water Ensures the facilities will continue to be operated by a highly qualified union workforce This settlement benefits both California consumers and PGEs employees said Jack McNally Business Manager of IBEW Consumers will be assured that hydroelectric plants will continue to be operated by the same dedicated employees will continue to provide low cost reliable energy to California consumers and will continue to be owned by a California company IBEW represents the union members who operate and maintain the hydroelectric system This agreement represents a fair valuation of the hydroelectric system said Michael Boccadoro director Agricultural Energy Consumers Association this agreement also protects the longstanding beneficial relationship between the hydro operations and the agricultural users in the state The settlement agreement filed at the CPUC will be subject to public hearings and review under the California Environmental Quality Act CEQA Interested parties will be able to provide comment prior to any CPUC decision Also the hydroelectric system transfer requires approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC The CEQA review process itself will ensure that there are no significant environmental impacts as a result of this transfer said Gordon Smith In addition keeping the hydroelectric facilities and associated watershed lands together protects the public interest in these assets The system includes dams powerhouses miles of canals tunnels and flumes and approximately acres of watershed land The hydroelectric system has a capacity of megawatts and provides a clean renewable lowcost source of electricity particularly during periods of high demand The system currently delivers about percent of Californias yearly electricity needs and up to of the States electricity demand during hot summer days We have enjoyed a positive working relationship with the folks at PGE for many years said Tim McCullough manager of the Tuolumne Utilities District This agreement ensures the water resource will continue to be managed in a way that protects the interests of Tuolumne County residents This agreement differs substantially from the transfer contemplated through legislation at the end of August last year The Legislative proposal did not include the price stabilizing revenue sharing mechanism Although the legislative package ultimately failed to achieve consensus because of the immense complexities of balancing interests through legislative compromise this years regulatory filing fulfills the directives of the restructuring legislation and provides the kind of public and state environmental review that will forge consensus PGE Corporation with operating revenues of almost billion and operations in states markets energy services and products throughout North America through its National Energy Group PGE Corporations businesses also include Pacific Gas and Electric Company the Northern and Central California utility that delivers natural gas and electricity to one in every Americans

fortune cookie and at least as accurate Everyone is getting into the act When I started this gig I was the only guy in town writing to folks like you about the power industry in California I wrote about whats new whats happening and all the important stuff This week Governor Gray Davis decided to write his own Burrito His epistle got more press than mine but why is he muscling in o n my turf Not to be outdone PUC President Loretta Lynch released a report which looks into every facet of Californias power business No stone l eft unturned Im telling you there isnt enough room in this business f or all of us They need to clear out With people like Herr Hair Peace Governor ImNot MrRogers Davis a nd Lets Do Lynch who needs a Friday Burrito They redefine our reality each week with mindnumbing aplomb For example starting in early June the PX was ordered to compete for business against other Qualified Trading Vehicles Then two weeks later the Energy Fhrer legislated that idea to an early death which kept the status quo for at least one year This week the PUC approved year bilateral deals for PGE and SCE thereby opening t he PX to competition and emasculating the PXs Block Forward Market Zip bam boom I cant wait to see what next week will bring I hear Senator Bowen is holding Committee hearings on re regulating the industry and the Governor s new Energy Security Council will meet to decide six things Whats for lunch Who will sit at the head of the table Does anyone have good seats for next weeks Democratic convention Is there anyone we havent indicted yet in the power industry Who will crank up the air conditioning in this room Its getting too w arm Then they will collect data from innocent businesses under subpoena ignor e the facts and publish a report It makes one want to take a deep breath and inhale the scented fumes of democracy You know I cant think about where to begin so lets start somewher e Things on the Island of California Is there anyone left at SDGE with a brain The PUC issues its scathing report The ISO invokes price caps Duh Things at the throne of FERC Amen for the Morgan Stanley Order Odds and Ends Things on the Island of California Is there anyone left at SDGE with a brain Well the answer very clearly is no I have been astounded by repeated attempts of SDGEs most senior people to ape humans but instead they m imic apes Consider the following First they waltz their default customers into the summer with little of no protection from price spikes in the wholesale market Forgivable in that it is human to err The prices skyrocket in June and they start looking for who to blame Must be them damn independent generators say their managers Gary Cotton informs the IS O Governing Board that hedging SDGEs position in the Block Forward Marke t wouldnt have made any difference Theres one nobel laureate who mi ssed his prime Next under pressure they ask for help from suppliers and anyone else who will assist the utility and their customers Nine offers show up at their table and they cant choose any of them Again Mr Cotton tells his fe llow ISO Governing Board members that these things take time and we dont to rush since there are many legislative barriers and well the surfing was good this week so why spoil it Now they are in a panic because the Energy Fhrer is visiting old ladies living in trailer parks advising them not to pay their SDGE electricity bill and to continue to operate their air conditioners SDGE puts a full page ad in the local newspaper telling everyone that SDGE is doing everything it can to lower their electric bills including asking the ISO f or a price cap but the public can help by calling the ISO address and phone number provided in the ad and urging them to lower the cap I alway s thought the location of the ISO was a State secret for security reasons N o secrets in San Diego But we are not done No sir we are not Those buffalo heads who run that company decide they will win a gold star on their collective foreheads and implement one of the four resolutions passed by the Electric Oversight Board The one they pick is to petition FERC on an expedited basis to cap at the price at which sellers may bid energy or ancillary services into the ISO and the PX The primary reason is that Western power markets are n ot workably competitive In other words they want FERC to set a max price on what generators can sell in addition to the price limit at which the ISO ca n buy What I find most astounding about this double talk is that SDGE continues to collect tons of money from the sales of regulatory must run energy into the PX These are sales from their stranded assets Their grief hasnt ab ated their greed So to recap SDGE missed the boat on price hedging failed to win consume r confidence in public meetings asked for help from suppliers and did nothin g in response then filed at FERC to cap the sale price because the wholesale market into which they sell overpriced energy is not workably competitive Too much time in the direct sun light Things on the Island of California The PUC issues its scathing report The PUC report released yesterday is a gem with which I have not spent enou gh time I only read the Executive Summary and that only because our counsel Dan Douglass forwarded me a copy Let me pick out some of the gems in President Lets Do Lynchs burrito I would recommend reading the whole text if you have time and if you seek perverse entertainment California is experiencing major problems with electricity supply and pricing caused by policies and procedures adopted over the past ten years Since June wholesale prices for electrical power in California have increased on average over the same period in resulting in over billion in excess payments for electricity Hot weather aging power plant and transmission infrastructure and dysfunctional bidding behavior in the wholesale power markets combined to drive prices up Because of serious market defects and tight supply of electricity purchasers of California power will likely pay billions more in electricity costs this year Moreover these price increases do not necessarily fund ne w investments in electricity supply or delivery reliability they may flow solely to power producer profit margins Despite the Electricity Oversight Boards legislative mandate to overse e those institutions we have been unable to obtain bid data Nevertheless we believe enough evidence of questionable behavior exists that the Attorney General should conduct an investigation into these statewide marke t practices coordinating with other State agencies including the PUC and th e EOB Such an investigation would provide the factual foundation that California policy makers and regulators need to recover any illegally obtained profits A momentous consequence of Californias attempt to create a market in electricity is that the federal government now regulates Californias electric system Washington DC now controls pricing decisions directly at the wholesale level and indirectly at the retail level and to the extent that supply incentives are correlated to prices Washington DC now affec ts Californias ability to attract new investment in power plants Past administrations willingness to cede the States authority to the federal government combined with the legislative creation of two nonpublic supervisory organizations that have no duty to protect the public or consid er the retail customer The Independent System Operator ISO and the Power Exchange PX the nonprofit private corporations that operate the States transmission system and control wholesale pricing policies are governed by boards whose members can have serious conflicts of interest Some of these board members or their companies financially benefit from higher prices in electricity markets Neither of these private organizations is accountable to the State or its consumers Despite the federalization and the fragmentation of the States electri c services the State of California should protect its businesses and consume rs from cartel pricing collusive behavior inadequate power plant maintenance and lack of market planning for adequate electricity supplies California consumers and businesses deserve to know in advance as San Diegans did not this summer how and when the price of an essential servic e like electricity will double California is now largely constrained by federal mandates from providing comprehensive retail price relief as long a s wholesale prices remain so high If California tried to reimpose a price freeze in San Diego now federal regulators would likely prevent that action Shortterm price relief however cannot resolve market gaming or fundamental wholesale pricing problems controlled by federal regulators We have been precluded from obtaining the data necessary to know if th e ISO and PX failed to detect manipulation and gaming on several fronts We do no t know how market players acted in price offering and bidding and scheduling The FERC has just announced an inquiry into national pricing and energy market issues California should not wait for national findings before it investigates California market practices We recommend that the California Attorney General immediately subpoena relevant records and data to determin e the pricing and offering behavior of market participants the actions of th e ISO and its board members and the actions of generators in supplying Californias energy needs Ten Actions to Consider or Act Upon to Prevent Current Electricity Prob lems From Spreading in Create a California Energy Council modeled on the National Security Council to unify State action to resolve energy problems and to perform integrated energy planning Ask FERC for extended wholesale price cap authority to moderate Californ ia wholesale market pricing Ask FERC to recognize the defects in the California and western regional markets and find that no competitive market exists in California power markets Eliminate potential conflicts of interest in ISOPX stakeholder board s Improve Californias ability to obtain ISO and generator data and enhanc e the States enforcement capability for power plant maintenance price manipulation and generation gaming consistent with protection of proprieta ry business information Provide the EOB with effective enforcement ability and additional oversight authority for the ISO and PX Ten Issues to Consider or Act Upon Within the Next Six Months Streamline state power plant siting procedures consistent with environmental requirements and prioritize applications to advance clean BACT power plant proposals Institute useit or loseit permitting power plant licensing and emissions credits rules to ensure power plants get built Reform PX pricing protocols and structures to lower wholesale and retai l prices and reduce excess profits I told you I dont need to write a Burrito anymore The Democrats in Sacramento are doing that for me Welcome comrade Things on the Island of California The ISO invokes price caps Duh It is really hard to describe the drama of an ISO Governing Board meeting especially when our favorite topic arises It seems the only time the Boar d becomes animated is when one of three issues are on the agenda price caps FTRs and priorities for software enhancements Otherwise its pretty much humdrum Round and round we went once again A few more forced votes tippe d the scale in favor of the cap There were yes votes which included a force d yes vote from our friend Jerry Toenyes by order of Secretary of Energy Mr Richardson Jerry did you realize that the last letters of your name coul d be rearranged to spell NO ET YES Kind of a french thing Im sorry about that vote Jerry You still go in my book as one of the brave and bo ld for standing up to that sort of intimidation for so long Your picture in the SF Chron said it all The brave souls who stood tall and voted NO included David Parquet Enron Jan SmutnyJones IEP Barbara Barkovich CLECA Caolyn Kehrein CMA Da n Kirshner EDF and Stacy Roscoe Procter Gamble Now I must admit tha t Dynegys Greg Blue did help by voting a Texas No spelled ABSTA IN I have instructed Dynegy trader Dave Francis in Houston to work with Greg t o correct that problem Were going to work things out The Energy Fhrer addressed the Board again I didnt mind that I only had a few brief very brief moments to address the Board and Herr Hair Peac e got over minutes That didnt bother me at all He did more damage to himself in than I could do in He blasted away at everyone who oppose d him He pined about Camden quitting the Board He said he knew how prices and markets work that it isnt the way those academic egghead FERClo ving economists tell you who pray to the gods of competition He lambasted WAPA for withholding generation to protect fish and wildlife what was that all about He predicted that on Thursdays PUC meeting he and all the oth er powerful Democrats Republicans and angry citizens of San Diego would deman d that the PUC impose a rate cap on retail electric rates in San Diego that a re just and reasonable it didnt happen And on and on and on This man is very delusional He believes that Steve and only Steve Peace can save the world He believes that political will trumps judicial quasijudicial or independent Board actions This man makes relevant all the abstract musing s of the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche The will to power t he bermensch the transvaluation of values etc But we are getting under uber his skin with the help of the press Wednesday afternoon I called Commissioner Dick Bilas to see if he thought whether the next days PUC meeting was going to be a roll over Dick sai d he got a call from Peace and that Peace said he would not come to the meeting Apparently Peace had received a lot of press and all of it bad Thats the thin line of freedom which keeps tyranny at least one step aw ay from our front door Things at the throne of FERC Amen for the Morgan Stanley Order And now the good news You deserve this FERC gave the California market a little wiggle room last Friday FERC issued a last minute reply to the complaint by Morgan Stanley Capital Group relating to the ISOs intent t o lower the price cap FERC denied the complaint but they didnt waste t ime with an Order to simply deny a complaint FERC danced on the head of the I SO and pulled the bite out of the price cap Here are some excerpts We accepted this Amendment not because it was a cap on sellers prices but because it would promote order and transparency in the market by clearl y telling sellers of the maximum price the ISO was willing to pay and allowin g sellers to make informed economic choices on whether to sell in the ISO market or to sell elsewhere The ISO has no more or less ability to procure capacity and energy than any other buyer of these services If the ISO is unable to elicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced purchase price ceiling becau se generators are free to sell elsewhere if they choose it will have to rais e its purchase price to the level necessary to meet its needs Therefore an increase in outofmarket OOM calls for generation may be necessary to maintain system reliability Because the current payment for OOM is not subject to a maximum purchase price the resulting overall payments may be higher To the extent the ISO Board resolution contemplates implementing a directive that generators must bid their capacity into the ISO markets unde r any circumstances eg when system load exceeds MW such a requirement is not permitted by our Order and the ISO tariff Futur e implementation of the ISO Board resolution with regard to a requirement to sell would require significant revisions to the ISO market rules Such market changes could not become effective absent a corresponding amendment to the ISO tariff which would have to be filed under section of the FPA Well What do you think about that Just wait Here is what the sleeping bear Commissioner Hebert said in his concurring remarks Getting to the bottom of the problem in my view requires us to begin a proceeding to rescind our approval of the ISO as the operator of the California grid The record supports such a move A memorandum to the ISO from a stakeholder who resigned from the governing board eloquently brings to our attention repeated attempts to undermine the independence of the ISO The memorandum also thoughtfully outlines consequences to the markets of a return to command and control Because these allegations come from a nonmarket participant especiall y should we take heed We must also take notice of the public pressure on th e Board to compromise its independence Amen brother amen Odds and Ends As you can imagine this week like an endless string of weeks before this has been interminable I get about three phone calls a day from press reporters very little of which ever sees print My shtick is just too complex for casual readers But I do notice that the reporters are asking better questions The public is becoming more savvy The information flow is moving in our favor and will disarm the forces of evil in about years I have other problems on my mind I am working on a new computer system Really its just an upgrade of an older computer that is a bit faster t han the laptop I tried to upgrade very unsuccessfully As a result of the all the new hardware and software I purchased my office looks like a war zone with an odd mix of PUC service copies computer documentation and diskette s laying all around Quite a mess Prepare for the future Our next general meeting is scheduled for Thursday and Friday October and at Moro Bay Barb Ennis will prepare a blurb f or us in next weeks Burrito about room reservations timing golf etc O ur guest speakers will include MSC Chairman Professor Frank Wolak who will tal k on the subject of his choice Ms Irene Moosen of Grueneich Resource Advocates who will make a presentation on the distributed generation case before the PUC and William Freddo of PGE National Energy Group who will give us some education on operating a power plant inside the New England IS O Now for your daily bread provided this week by Dan Douglass Last week we had a joke about Catholics This week its agnostics DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD An atheist was taking a walk thru the woods admiring all that the accident of evolution had created What majestic trees What powerful rivers Wha t beautiful animals he said to himself As he was walking alongside the river he heard a rustling in the bushes behind him As he turned to look he saw a foot grizzly bear charging towards him He ran as fast as he could up the path He looked over his shoulder and saw that the bear was closing in on him He tried to run even faster so scared that tears were coming to his eyes His heart was pumping frantically as he tried to run even faster but he tripped and fell on the ground He rolled over to pick himself up and saw the bear right on top of him raising its paw to kill him At that instant he cried out Oh my God And time stopped The bear froze The forest was silent The river even stopped flowing A bright light shone upon the man and a voice out of the sky said You deny my existenc e all these years teach others I dont exist and even credit my creation to a cosmic accident and now do you expect me to help you out of this predicament Am I to count you as a believer The atheist ever so proud looked into the light and said It would be rather hypocritical to ask to be counted as a believer after all these years but could you make the bear a believer Very well said the voice And the light went out the river flowed

<27734499.1075863622656.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,foothi19@idt.net,2000-08-24 19:09:00,WPTF Friday Credo Veritas BurritoFRIDAY BURRITO more fun than a fortune cookie and at least as accurate There is a hint of Autumn in the air I dont know if its wishful thinking or if the seasons are really beginning to turn from our pale summer into a Bay Area glorious Fall Its premature I know A few fallen leaves the start of schools slightly longer afternoon shadows Im jumping the gun I cant wait for this summer to be over especially this summer The pounding never stops and as I hear the din of the cash register ringing with each climb in Southwest temperature I can barely keep track of all the hiccups which drive prices up fires in Montana restricting transmission paths blown up interstate gas pipeline in New Mexico diminishing NOx credits for instate power plants depleted inventory of hours of voluntary load interruptions for commercial and industrial customers credit limits restricting imports of Canadian power into the Northwest and California and BPA buying about MW to cover its short hydro position I also get the willies every time another politician lambastes the California restructured power industry I just want to end to the summer now and start a two week Fall vacation anywhere even in Cleveland There are seven count them seven investigations into some aspect of the wholesale power market out here Two days ago there were only six but FERC just added another yesterday in response to the Prezs request That means FERC has two the PUC has two the State Attorneys General has two one on the ISO Governing Board and one on the instate generators and one by the Electric Oversight Board If you dont have an ongoing study of the California Market then youre not hip All of these investigations save FERCs Section Investigation are going to amount to near nothing A lot of wasted time and paper The PUC and EOB studies have their conclusion sections all finished Now they need some evidence to support their assertions And how are we holding up under all of this How are you doing I talk to many of you throughout the week and I know how frustrated you are I share your frustration You want to tell the public the press and anyone in between the truth You want to lay out the facts You want to show anyone who will listen that each interference into the market is making things worse not better The price caps for example are damnable and screwing up the prices much to the detriment of those people for who price caps were supposed to be a protection against price shocks Now they are receiving higher average prices The public isnt going to listen to anything longer than a sound bite And lets face it when it comes to stellar public relations our industry is not known for turning in A performances except for SCE Those guys seem to get their story in front of the public at every turn I heard SCE is putting on their customers bill Here is what you would have paid if the rate freeze ended But many of us in the new power industry borne from the loins of either the naturalgas industry or nuclearpower business learned the hard way that the best response to a public inquiry is a twoblock head start in front of an angry mob Keep your head down shut your mouth and this too shall pass I dont buy that approach at least not anymore That is I dont believe we have anything to hide or of which to be ashamed What electric restructuring is about is correct beneficial to the public and in everyones best interests Look at it this way when they pat the last shovelful of dirt on your final resting place for what do you most want to be remembered That you caved in to the political will of others or at a moment when you had the chance you did what was right instead of what was expedient I think the choice is easy albeit laced with sheer terror Those bland homilies I so diligently teach my kids eg tell the truth do what is right think of the big picture and not just yourself are a lot easier to speak than to live by So join me and stand up for what you believe They cant take away your pride not yet Here is this weeks line up Things in the Peoples Republic of California Excerpts from FERCs Order on SDGE Complaint The Development of a SuperPeak Block Energy Product The Mailbag A Letter from My Friend and A Response Odds and Ends Finish the Story Contest October General Meeting What Makes Houston Houston Things in the Peoples Republic of California Excerpts from FERCs Order on SDGE Complaint President Clinton commented from the Rose Garden that good folks in San Diego retired fixedincome likely to vote for a Democrat are making choices between buying medicine or air conditioning their homes I call this the Del Monica Beach lecture The Prez instructed the FERC to investigate the situation in California and FERC wasted no time In response to SDGEs August complaint whereby the utility asked FERC to impose a price cap on generators in the region the FERC responded in a way that I was hoping to see several months ago The FERC slammed SDGE on their complaint for lack of merit and the FERC also initiated an FPA Section Investigation into the wholesale power market in California Here are some of the juicy excerpts from FERCs Order In this order we are denying SDGEs requested immediate imposition of a price cap on all sellers in California However we are instituting consolidated hearing proceedings pursuant to section of the Federal Power Act to investigate the justness and reasonableness of the rates and charges of public utilities that sell energy and ancillary services to or through the California ISO and PX and to also investigate whether the tariffs and institutional structures and bylaws of the California ISO and PX are adversely affecting the efficient operation of competitive wholesale electric power markets in California and need to be modified SDGE concludes that the markets cannot be workably competitive if sellers are able to exact prices that are considerably above levels that would prevail in open competition ie sellers are able to bid and receive prices significantly above their marginal costs SDGE also argues that the hourtohour volatility in imbalance energy prices and the erratic clearing price for ancillary services is an indication that the market is breaking down when it is moderately stressed While we find it appropriate to institute a section hearing on these issues we cannot implement an immediate price cap of MWh as requested by SDGE because there is no record before us to support such an action While the issues raised by this complaint are important the Commission has no basis to conclude that SDGEs proposal to place an immediate arbitrary MWh cap on the price that every public utility seller of energy and ancillary services may bid into the PX and ISO markets would satisfy this standard SDGE has provided no evidence to demonstrate that all potential sellers are able to exercise market power has not documented a single instance of a seller exercising market power during times of scarcity and did not attempt to show that the conditions underlying the Commissions approval of marketbased rates for public utility sellers of energy and ancillary services have changed Nor did it address specific market or institutional factors that may be causing rates to be unjust or unreasonable SDGE asserts that the ISOs congestion management and market structures are flawed and in need of overhaul Furthermore SDGE expresses its concern that for a number of reasons the congestion management and market reform efforts being pursued by ISO stakeholders will not produce meaningful results SDGE indicates that it is prepared to work with the ISO to develop alternative reform proposals however SDGEs complains that the ISO stakeholder process has in SDGEs judgment been ineffective with respect to these issues Various interveners contend that SDGEs arguments are premature We agree with Interveners The reform efforts have been the subject of extensive public review and comment and are nearing completion Accordingly we reject SDGEs arguments at this time It is unclear whether SDGEs failure to purchase hedging instruments for its retail operations is due to state regulatory policies or its business decisions A retail rate design that exposes consumers to the volatility of commodity prices would be extraordinary particularly when consumers do not have the ability to receive or respond to price signals We are concerned that increasing level of market activity in the realtime market raises significant reliability and economical concerns Historically the ISO procures on a daily basis only the resources needed for the operating day Not only does this procurement practice put pressure on the grid operator to secure needed resources at the last minute but the practice is uneconomical Such spotmarket purchases are not subject to the ISOs buyers cap Furthermore because the ISO is the supplier of last resort for these services when OOM calls are made suppliers realize that the ISO is in a mustbuy situation In an effort to address this problem we direct the ISO to immediately institute a more forward approach to procuring the resources necessary to reliably operate the grid Specifically the ISO should anticipate the need for such additional resources based on forecasted peak periods We direct the ISO to factor these reforms into an analysis of the need for and level of purchase price caps and to include this analysis as support for any filing it makes to extend its purchase price cap authority In closing WPTF is an intervenor in the case and we hope to be very active in the case through testimony cross examination the filing of briefs and reply briefs Things in the Peoples Republic of California The Development of a SuperPeak Block Energy Product Several weeks ago I discussed with the ISO their interest in developing a new market for a block energy product that would be purchased in the morning of a trade day and be dispatched during the superpeak hours I challenged them to let the market participants develop this market instead of the ISO doing the same At the August ISO Governing Board meeting I stated as the WPTF position that we oppose price caps but if the ISO Governing Board insisted on going down the MWH price cap route we would do what ever we could to help the situation and avoid the occurrences of Stage alerts Whereas I didnt think about the conversation on superpeak block markets as being relevant to the remarks before the Governing Board it became painfully clear soon after that we could and should work with the ISO to develop a new market through either APX or the California PX or both to bring some order to the otherwise chaotic Out of Market system This week WPTF and the ISO had a joint meeting whereby both sides discussed the merits of a superpeak block firmenergy product and how it could be instituted The meeting at the ISO at which WPTF had many of its members who either have generation in the State or import power into California was for market participants and the ISO to discuss how to bring more order and price transparency to the ISOs out of market calls The ISO reported that this summer to date the amount of money spent on Out of Market purchases was about million Last year the total cost of Out of Market purchases was million APX and CalPX in response to our earlier discussions with them presented their proposals at the meeting The discussions which ensued during the course of the presentations focused on how the ISO might utilize a productservice to reduce the manpower requirements currently needed to satisfy its out of market telephone calls typically on short notice and the interest on the part of market participants to make bids into either the APX or CalPXs proposed system for a superpeak firmenergy product There were no commitments made by any party simply a willingness to work together to alleviate the problems associated with finding sufficient electric power during high demand periods with greater transparency more participants and greater market efficiency Well keep you posted on our development of this market The Mailbag A Letter from My Friend and A Response Sometimes I share bites of our Burrito with fellow travellers much as I did last week when I sent my friend Mike Florio a copy of the story called the Trial of Gow Jing Mike sent me a note that I would like to share He said I could I want you to read it and appreciate that there are other people who share his view I also copied the response I sent to Michael aka Old Deuteronomy Michael wrote Im not going to attempt to complete your little melodrama the GowJing story but I did want to offer an observation In simpler times people knew the other people that they did business with and they typically lived in the same community If a merchant tried to charge exorbitant prices for his products even if he was the only one in town who had the product in stock he would face the wrath of his fellow citizens This undoubtedly served as a constraint on such behavior even in the absence of a CPUC or FERC Telling Mrs Jones that the loaf of bread she needs to feed her kids will cost her would not be a pleasant way to do business and such things ordinarily did not happen In the modern global economy of course this personal aspect of doing business has been almost completely lost And so has the restraint I have no doubt that the folks who sell electricity are good people jeez I know many of them but they work in an environment where the end results of their business decisions are invisible If Mrs Jones cant afford to run her refrigerator any more that fact is at best dimly perceived and if so it is viewed as cause for some sort of social program not a reason why a merchant would alter his behavior This is clearly not a case of socialism versus capitalism because both scenarios occur within the overall context of a capitalist system But certainly something fundamental has changed and not for the better in my view Now everyone feels compelled to squeeze the last dollar out of every transaction their jobs may even depend upon it and no one is responsible for the end result Is this the kind of world we want to live in PUT THAT IN YOUR BURRITO AND SEE WHAT YOUR READERS SAY YOU CAN EVEN BLAME ME SO THAT YOU ARE NOT ACCUSED OF TURNING PINK IN YOUR MIDDLE AGE Deut Okay Its in the Burrito And here is what I think You allude to the change in a world that was once more personal and is now institutional You make the point that things are not better off if for no other reason then the lack of personal accountability But I dont think that in all cases the more personal world is lost It is ever present as I will argue below Second your group embraces the impersonal efficiencies when it is convenient Finally and most importantly where will your socialminded and like minded counterparts be when competitive forces leap supply ahead of demand which might happen in a handful of years However your essential point is not lost on me I do believe that there are ways for generators and consumers to be good neighbors in California I have a proposal below to which I would like to hear your response First though the personal business touch is present in our economy I exercise the restraint to which your story pines in many of my consulting engagements which require financial give and take between client and vendor It is simply smart business to do so I have been the beneficiary of the same with my local bank when errors occurred in my checking accounts or when loan payments were made absent mindedly late etc and the late fee forgiven However much of our economy and certainly the trade of a commodity such as electricity requires the use of markets Nameless and faceless they do squeeze out all the efficiencies which lead to lower prices more innovation and a sharing of price risk with parties who are neither the ultimate consumer nor the initial producer The producer and consumer get out of the risk arbitrage and leave it to others who are more skilled and monied I find it ironic that TURN then is so insistent on arguing as it has done on many many occasions for the relaxation of market separation in the ISOs congestion management reform Elimination of market separation is nothing more than the impersonal forcing of parties to execute trades on either side of a congested transmission path in the name of market efficiency Lower prices for consumers Does it really matter if it is done through person to person transactions or through markets Third your story can be used to make an alternative point What happens to the merchant in town when WalMart moves into the next town down the road All the faithful customers that your Merchant of Vengeance was protecting suddenly migrate to a competitor with greater inventory more choice and lower prices What do you say then The corollary for us is direct The new generation owners moved literally billions of dollars into California at risk and took a chance It paid off They succeeded as we all know this year and probably will next year and so on But the MW of new power plants under construction in California and the MW under construction in Arizona and the over MW of combined power projects in California Arizona and Southern Nevada that are in line for permits will change the financial landscape in a hurry once energized The prices will soften returns will be less cherry and I really want to know where will todays accusers be when there is a shake out Consumers will reap that benefit oh you best believe it But the alliances to which your opening story alludes simply misses that point You gotta make hay while the sun shines Now to my proposal Michael I would be willing to work with you to develop some kind of loan program for residential and small commercial customers that would in effect reduce the economic hardship of higher electricity prices I could imagine although I havent tested the idea with any parties that a significant program could be crafted possibly secured by the credit of participating generating companies and executed by a commercial lending institution such as Bank of America Borrowers would pay a fair interest rate and the administrative fees Its simply smart business not charity Its one way to amortize th e earnings which came about due to a circumstance of short supply relative to the sudden growth of demand for power Maybe that is a step in the right direction I dont know One could argue that it is no different than SDGE implementing a level payment plan for its consumers True it is no different because in either case the customer is paying for the loan interest and administrative fees and I consistently believe that a market for credit is more efficient am I getting impersonal than one instituted by a monopoly Second the security for these loans is provided by parties other than the utilitys customers Further we wouldnt have to wor ry about PUC oversight and prudence reviews We could make this work quickly I will be very interested to hear your thoughts and the comments of my members Thanks for sending us your letter Odds and Ends Finish the Story Contest Well there was only one response and that was from Carl Imparato Here is what Carl said Am I missing something Who is GowJing supposed to represent Yes I get the pun in the name But is he also just an anonymous everyman or is there someone in particular My first response to your question is that GowJing simply replies Itai You could look it up I think its Chinese for it hurt s Then he takes out a concealed axe goes on a rampage and kills everyone But thats too realistic so dont use that ending Instead Ending Just as he was about to reply a giant foot wall of water swept through the room drowning everyone And they lived happily ever after The end I havent decided whether to name this response Carls Gilgamesh Epic Ie Noah and the flood or Carls Hydro Dream Well leave the contest open for another week Cant let bucks go the only entry Wheres the competition Odds and Ends October General Meeting Barb Ennis our event coordinator for our General Meeting wanted you folks to know that

unofficial home of the electric power industry is a town you either love or hate Here are some guiding principles offered by the Chamber of Commerce of the th largest city to enable their many visitors to cope First you must learn to pronounce the city name It is YEWSTUN a nd it does not matter how people pronounce it in other places Forget the traffic rules you learned elsewhere Houston has its ow n version of traffic rules Never forget that downtown Houston is composed entirely of one way streets The only way to get out of center of town is to turn around and start over when you reach Dallas Texas All directions start with Go down Westheimer Westheimer has no beginning and no end Its impossible to go around a block and wind up on the street yo u started on The Chamber of Commerce calls this a scenic drive The am rush hour is from to am The pm rush hour is from to pm Fridays rush hour starts on Thursday morning If you actually stop at a yellow light you cannot be from Houston Kuykendahl Road can only be pronounced by a native so do not attempt the phonetic pronunciation People will simply tilt their heads to the right and stare at you Construction on the Gulf Freeway is a way of life and a permanent form of entertainment Many bizarre sights can be explained simply by uttering the phrase Oh were in Montrose Construction crews arent doing their job properly unless they close down all lanes except one during rush hour If someone actually has their turn signal on it was probably lef t on at the factory where the car was made White haired men driving red or silver sports cars will not obey a ny known traffic rule and cannot be expected to stop for red lights or stop signs All ladies with blue hair who drive Cadillacs or Lincoln Continentals have the right of way The above mentioned blue haired ladies also have a legal right to turn right from a left lane or to turn left from a right lane YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED Buying a Houston street map is a waste of money since there is absolutely no way that you can route yourself in such a manner as to avoid major road construction Houston natives are so rare that they are listed on the endangered species list The few remaining specimens are kept in a controlled environment for their own safety Sir and Maam are used by the person speaking to you if theres a remote possibility that youre at least minutes older than they are Sugar is a more common form of address than Miss So is Honey Do not take offense This is how southerners address grown women In Houston we drink CocaCola and Dr Pepper It is rumored that other soft drinks are sold here but no one will admit to knowing anyone who actually drinks them So dont ask for any other soft drink What you need to know when arriving at Bush Intercontinental Airport Your arrival gate is at least miles away from the Main Concourse of any terminal Walking heels on your boots or walking shoes are advised Never honk your horn at another car in Houston traffic The bumper sticker that reads Keep honking Im reloading is considered fair warning DDDDDDDDDDDDD Have a great weekend yall gba

folks smoking crack he asked in an outrage My friend Ol Dave in Houston has trouble understanding the workings of our power business here in California In fact so do I Yesterdays Joint SenateAssembly Committee on Energy and Natural Resources did nothing to improve either Daves or my understanding of the national embarrassment California is perpetrating with electricity deregulation The next thing you know they will be taking property and forcing utilities to build power plants and transmission he mused between sips of Dixie longneck beer and chomps of jalapeno peppers Come to think of it Dave they did say something about that Yeah I recalled Senator Peace was expounding on his favorite idea which is forcing the ISO or the utilities to build peakers and not let the market build them I cant remember if that was before or after he suggested to EOB Chairman Kahn that the ISO and the PX should be folded into State agencies under the direction of the Electric Oversight Board I know what you are thinking right now The next thing you know California will have regulated retail rates That recipe should be out of the PUCs oven sometime next week Well the power marketers are jigging the system bidding up to the ISOs bid cap There is no way you can tell me that a generator planned to make MWH in its pro forma Dave added So you agree with Herr Hair Peace You dont believe in markets I retorted Oh I believe in them but I remember when I was short on a MW trade and without any notice or advanced warning the price in the Midwest market went against me Dave recalled I called everyone who I tra ded with and they had nothing I finally called XXXXX and I asked what will it cost for MW Why didnt you ask for I wondered I didnt want to show him my position You get hosed when you show the buyer your position Ask for first Dave chided What happened Oh they offered to sell for MWH I said I d take it and then said I needed another fifty He asked I took that and he priced the next MW at lamented Dave He just wanted to see how far he could push me Thats what I mean when I say the traders are jigging it But Dave you old communist your forgetting the trading function is what mitigates the risk The traders are the in between people who guess at the price Sometimes they guess right and sometimes they guess wrong But the damage or the reward is on their book not passed on to the ultimate consumer It has nothing to do with the marginal cost of a generating plant And there you have it Put in a price cap and the traders have a target for which to shoot I cant prove the following yet but Il l wager with any of you that as the price cap level dips down the average trading price climbs even as the socalled dysfunctional price spik es are eliminated Consumers get hosed and the fundamental economic principle is upheld which is one can never be made better off with the imposition of an additional constraint I feel better already Here is what is on our short agenda this week Things in the Mailbag Things in the Peoples Republic of California The ISO Replies to the EOB Report Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market Odds Ends Things in the Mailbag It has been awhile since we put the mail feedbag on and had a munch Here is what my friends have been writing me FPL Energys Steve Ponder was only too quick to tell me Please Gary no more whining about your computer How old are you Is this the year you get the AARP letter A very depressing moment Do you really not know how to spell Morro Bay Please let us know what is going on with your sons hockey team Dont forget the cigars for Moron Bay It is good to have friends like Steve They make the pain of separation so much easier And Steve when you FPL guys get that Entergy merger sorted out in a dozen years or so you let us know I want to participate in the name selection for the new entity How about Fentergy PLus Next from the PXs Mark Hoppe who writes As youve heard from others I dont know quite how you manage to knock out all this material each week The burrito is informative humorous and usually contains a sprinkle of irony tragedy ISO Drama Though you are usually neutral regarding the PX you are not unduly negative which I appreciate I think we do a pretty good job over here and so often people in the industry forget the amount effort and challenge it took the PX to successfully open this market Thanks Mark I just want you to know that my ability to write this stuff every week is not constrained by the facts or evidence I have learned from watching Herr Hair Peace that as long as you can talk write too fast and have conviction in your statements regardless of how groundless they may be you will have a willing and eager audience A few weeks ago I received from the PXs Jennifer Sherwood a note which she wants you to know are her opinions not necessarily the PXs Its okay Jennifer I paid Georgeyesterday the I owed him for that sham Rose Bowl bet remember Stanford lost and your opinions are cool with us Just curious has anyone been comparing high unleaded prices to high CA electricity prices What I mean is we are up in arms about how we should protect the unfortunate San Diego consumer who cant afford to keep the AC on But what about the inflated unleaded gas prices the whole country has seen over the last few months No effort is made by the government to shield the consumer from how much it costs to fill their gas tank No mention is made of those who cant afford to drive to the grocery store because they cant afford the extra or cents a gallon The costs are passed along to the consumer without pause Granted there are differences between the unleaded market and the electricity market in terms of demandside responsiveness but then again is it that much different to say I cant drive today because gas is too expensive vs I cant turn up the AC today because its too expensive Finally from one of our secret Washington readers and I am not telling who I received the following I broke down and listened to the ISO Governing Board discussion and vote Ugh I too noted that the speak fast was applied to everyone but Herr Peace My goodness what a mess we have I loved Jerrys picture in USA Today it spoke volumes My sources at FERC tell me though that we should keep an eye out for FERC Chairman Hoecker to do something really Censored for political reasons Given no Commission meetings til September the only way to act is by unanimous consent so I would hope he cant do all that much Things in the Peoples Republic of California The ISO Replies to the EOB Report Several of you people commented to me that the ISOs reply to the PUCEOB report was very good I decided to excerpt the best sections of it for the Burrito The full document can be found on the ISOs website the PUCEOB Report asserts that the suspected activities of certain generators on June created frequency instability leading to the Bay Area blackouts the following day In fact the events of June and June were completely independent of one another The voltage instability on June was caused by system conditions on that day alone exceptionally high loads insufficient generation in the specific local area and transmission constraints that prevented the import of generation from outside the area The Report states that the ISO never tried to call upon consume rs to reduce demand in order to avoid the Bay Area blackouts In fact the ISO had in place on June a number of demand response programs designed to reduce load including the Summer Demand Response Program under which customers have agreed through a prior solicitation to curtail energy use in exchange for a fee The Report makes a number of assertions concerning the prices paid by purchasers of energy as a result of the recent price spikes eg billion in the month of June alone These assertions leave one with the mistaken impression that these prices reflect amounts actually paid by the UDCs andor passed through to customers However in determining the total cost of energy one must determine the impact of any forward contracts entered into by the UDCs in advance of the wholesale energy markets These contracts which are designed to lockin a specific price in advance of realtime or near realtime market activities are specifically designed to mitigate the impact of price volatility and are standard in all commodities markets We have reason to believe that some of the UDCs were substantially hedged during the period of the recent price spikes In a similar vein the reports asserts that California might well have saved million dollars had a price cap been in place in May and June This assertion assumes that all energy purchases would have been made at or below the bid cap In fact during times of peak demand when all of the states generation has been exhausted the ISO competes with neighboring regions for available generation In order to secure the necessary power the ISO must purchase on a bilateral basis this energy from resources located outside of the ISOs control area The Report asserts that California power markets are not now competitive and implies erroneously in our view that this is the normal state of affairs It is not The Market Surveillance Committee has noted that market power in the California energy market appears to arise primarily during periods of peak demand and warned that demand growth would increase the incidence of market power during the summer of The Report asserts that the ISO is answerable only to a selfinterested board and not to the citizens of California This simply is not the case The ISO is subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act and to the rules and regulations of FERC which dictate in part that wholesale energy rates must be just and reasonable and in the public interest The ISO further operates under a detailed tariff reviewed and approved by FERC Every change to our market design and virtually every aspect of the ISOs business is subject to review and scrutiny by FERC The FERC process provides substantial opportunities for input by the state agencies and such agencies have in fact been active participants in the FERC proceedings The Report asserts that California supply conditions have been affected by restructuring and that somehow the restructuring choices have made California more vulnerable to supply shortages This assertion is unfounded Significant load growth in California and neighboring states coupled with a lack of significant infrastructure investment in both generation and transmission have caused this vulnerability Restructuring has increased proposed power plant applications many fold Only by immediate and sustained attention to streamlining approval and siting processes for both of these critical infrastructure elements will this significant shortage be addressed Things in the Peoples Republic of California Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings If you want to imagine a scary sight imagine then twelve California legislators gathering together in one hearing room to rectify the wrongs of electric restructuring Also imagine as if you are in the Twilight Zone witnesses that are slow on their feet and reckless in their facts Then you get a glimpse of what yesterdays Joint SenateAssembly hearing was like It started over two hours late The Senate was busy congratulating one of their own who is termlimited out next session and they wanted to heap on the glory That said the show began with CEC Commissioner Bill Keese Mr Keese has one story and regardless how well he tells it and he does it is always the same story It is the heat storm story One can imagine in the heat storm story a lead character who is a singlemom call her LadyBird Bowen who travels across an angry land with her precocious preteen child Stevie Wonderboy They are searching for electric power plants in the dessert which by the grace of God have been shipped to other countries which have more liberal returns on investment Being the first speaker Mr Keese took at least half the heat storm of the day The rage of the Energy Fuhrer was palpable Last week San Diegans shed MW of load last week to save the entire system and did not receive one penny of compensation Im not making that up He said it He is sick of hearing about demand management as being a solution for the problem over the last five years and he is about done listening People in San Diego are depressed by the sudden price hikes Yikes Keese did mention that the California reserve margin has sunk to but in neighboring Arizona the reserve margin is or Mr Keese correctly pointed out that electric power is not solely a California problem it is a regional problem One member of the Committee asked what the legislature could do to speed up the power plant siting and construction process Keese referred to Governor Gray Davis Executive Order issued last week to which the CEC plans to respond soon date uncertain that lays out a month permitting time line The six months are enough if the applicant has the land secured zoning okayed transmission access and air offsets Hmmmmmm That alone might take six months before you get to the CEC The next panel included Mr Kahn of the EOB and Ms Lynch I went too hard on her last week calling her Lets Do Lynch That was a TPC Sorry I promise to be nicer starting now The Energy Fuhrer instructed Ms Lynch to use her authority to order SDGE to divert the pass through of funds from the customers to the PX until the dysfunction of the market is cured Put it in an escrow account Ms Lynch promised to review this option at her August PUC Meeting where she will enact SDGE rate caps told you The star of the day I thought was FERC General Counsel Doug Smith Mr Smith comes to Sacramento Isnt that a switch Mr Smith came in place of Mr Hoecker thank the Lord Mr Smith put into FERCeese what these legislators could not get through their heads any other way The angry legislators were looking for a way for FERC to declare the wholesale market as noncompetitive and then ask the generators to give back the money they over collected When can we do that Mr Smith answered as only a FERC attorney can answer There is a process It takes time You must have evidence FERC uses a threepart criteria for assessing whether or not market based rates are allowable Its based on market concentration and dominance not the existence of high prices You would have to sue FERC in federal court and the best you could hope for is for FERC to reconsider its decision upon remand from the US Court of Appeals Slowly the wind came out of the sails of the gang of They were stumped Herr Hair Peace screamed couldnt you Mr Smith of FERC today use your authority to declare the markets noncompetitive that generators who had market based rates have exercised market power and retroactively implement a rate cap across the Western region Like a wheezing accordion Mr Smith played back and forth the familiar strains of music like a solo street musician on the corner Back and forth the process the process the process There have been times in the past I hated the process at FERC Today I have a renewed respect for what process affords me and you Freedom from the tyranny of a mob For the remainder of the hearing they focused on remedies that could be undertaken by the PUC Things in the Peoples Republic of California PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market Well the official title is Order Instituting Investigation into the Functioning of the Wholesale Electric Market and Associated Impact on Retail Electric Rates in the Services Territory of San Diego Gas Electric Company I like my title better This Order or OII was issued at the last business meeting of the Commission on August It calls for an investigation of the wholesale markets responses from the three UDCs and a prehearing conference in San Diego on August at the San Diego Convention Center Here are the questions the PUC wishes us to address What bill payment options should be provided to assist residential a nd small commercial customers What does this have to do with the functioning of the wholesale market Should SDGE be authorized to participate in bilateral contracts or other supply procurement activities How should the Commission assess reasonableness Are SDGEs purchasing activities serving its customers on just and reasonable terms What is SDGEs obligation to minimize energy costs for its curre nt customers How should the Commission Attorney General EOB ISO and PX coordinate to investigate wholesale market events behaviors and irregularities How should statefederal concerns be addressed What are the causes of the price increases Are anticompeititve practices causing some of the price increases Are there mechanisms the Commission can employ to make ratepayers
