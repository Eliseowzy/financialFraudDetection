about all in East ie Rs to Rs CB Original Message From Venkataswami Vishwanatha Sent Friday August AM To Bentley Corry Cc Semperger Cara Smith Will Atta Asem Subject RE Outstanding Issues with PreSchedule and Path Confirmation Corry Please give me the list of Region choices you want to see in Path Cut Detail View Cara is looking for WSCCS WSCCN Rockies Northwest California regions in West desk Thanks Vish x Original Message From Semperger Cara Sent Tuesday July AM To Bentley Corry Poston David Smith Will Venkataswami Vishwanatha Subject RE Outstanding Issues with PreSchedule and Path Confirmation Please see my comments in blue What follows are known issues with the Path Confirmation Report Path Confirmation Report Fixed Need to enable text wrapping for Path field The Path field is the most important field of which to see all data Right now some paths are wrapped and some arent Fixed Can we add a masterdetail setup when soring by Tag Provide a list of tags and show data for selected Tag Fixed Sorting by Global ID This needs to be able to be done in the upper Sort area This is unclear What is meant by the upper Sort area The area where we can drag and shuffle sort criteria up above the regular line view Fixed Not able to see the entire path in the expanded view Also delivery points are not showing up Yesterday I found that if a delivery point on the sheet is not exactly what Enpower has ie Midway instead of MidwayPSC the expanded view just gets rid of it completely Perhaps this should be an errorchecking point Done Find out to what the greyed out name in the expanded view is related Just getting rid of that unrelated name is enough Fixed Extend the size limit of the path We need to find out if the existing data was blown away purposefully or if this was accidental In the last release only the data from was preserved from the previous version The PORPOD fields are still the same We would like the delivery point selection to mimic the same functionality as the delivery point selection we see in Scheduling Fixed Press Enter or Seelct the date from the drop down Pulling up the proper date with the calendar is slow when there is data populated into the system We need to make sure that the selection process does not get incrementally slower with each additional day of data that is added Fixed For some reason a gobal ID is showing up in the expanded view in lines where there is not a Global ID provided It is always the same one CISOEPMI Path Cuts Need to filter Region list for cuts by trading desk East or West Allow hour ranges in the Hour field specifically in HE military format eg or Must allow string values to be stored in the annuity field Fixed Transmission should be optional Confirm with Cara Fixed Make it easier to show all cuts for a path Added Copy Path Cut Button it stores all selected pathcut ino change the required hour and save it Allow incremental hours to a cut as hourly cuts can go on for several hours but one hour at a time A new tag might have to be made each hour of the cut Im not quite sure what you are asking for Can you give a little more detail If I create a cut for a single hour I would like to show additional hours in the same cut at a later time Kind of an addon to the original cut This application will go through a final evaluation by the real time departments and I expect that they will need features that I have not been able to anticipate My plan is to get as many of their needs met as possible before turning testing over to them they are aware of this and the time table that we all are trying to meet I will also help them with their testing to articulate their needs to you in the most efficient way possible In the cut view the region is still the cumbersome drop down list This needs to be a forced choice option like the hourahead vs realtime selection The choices for the west are WSCCS WSCCN Rockies Northwest California Corry will be able to provide his region choices Fixed The path that has been cut needs to be able to pull up the cut note without hunting for it in the Cut Path view The suggestion of a Go to Cut button was made in an earlier email Let me know if there is anything that I have missed Thanks Will
