Sent October To Sherriff John Brown Michael COO London Edgley Anne Murphy Ted Gold Joe Lewis Richard Scrimshaw Matthew Dyson Fernley Lien Thor Cc Valnek Tomas Subject FW JP Morgan Conference Call on Enron below is a summary prepared by Tomas Valnek of the JP Morgan conference call to fixed income and equity investors The consensus view of our team is the call was very positive and should provide a platform for stability absent new negative surprises Original Message From Valnek Tomas Sent October To Seyfried Bryan Subject JP Morgan Conference Call on Enron JPM Morgan JPM held a conference call on October on the recent events surrounding Enron Below the main points are summarised The overall tone was positive for three reasons The two analysts one equity and fixed income made a very good effort to clarify the current situation They gave a positive view on Enron in general And they capped the value of the potential offbalance sheet liabilities In their view there are no issues with the core business The fundamental issue is shortterm liquidity To alleviate this issue they would like to see extra credit lines of about USD bn and the extension of a revolver maturing in May They think that the liability from Osprey and Marlin is likely to be in the region of USD m This assumes that there are no other contingent liabilities form other offbalance sheet commitments To resolve the situation surrounding this issue and to potentially avoid a downgrade Enron must primarily restore confidence and improve disclosure of information surrounding the offbalance sheet liabilities One of the first things pointed out by the equity analyst was that he considered little permanent damage on the equity side and importantly that there were no major with Enrons core business But in their view the fundamental issue was related to credit markets short term liquidity in particular To alleviate this issue the analyst would like to see the following That Enron secures an extra USD bn in credit lines preferably USD bn That the maturity of the USD bn revolver maturing in May is extended From the commodity side they were confident that there no immediate liquidity issues They had been in touch with trading counterparties like Dynegy El Paso Williams and had not sensed that any of them would radically reduce their trading with Enron However they noted that a weakening in trading activities could mean smaller market shares which could negatively affect earnings On the debt side one overall concern was the actual amount of debt which they estimated to about USD bn and related potential debt servicing problems This includes debt actually held by Enron about USD bn debt attributable to Enron through unconsolidated equity affiliates and the Marlin Osprey and Yosemite debt Much focus was on the Marlin and Osprey potential equity liabilities as the analysts had no information indicating that any liability could arise from the equity affiliates or Yosemite From Marlin and Osprey Enrons worst case liability would be about USD bn implying zero asset value but they estimated that a likely outcome would be a liability of about USD m This liability only concerns Marlin and Osprey and thus assumes that there no liabilities related to the equity affiliates and Yosemite It was noted that this liability did not necessarily have to be settled through a share issue but could be settled through cash raised in asset sales The issue of getting downgraded below investment grade was discussed The analysts did not seem to think that this was a likely outcome but that a downgrade to BBBBaa was a possibility They considered that if Enron wants to avoid a downgrade the following measures should be implemented Restore confidence in Enron In particular improve disclosure give a better background to the LJM partnership and specify the nature and the value of the assets held in the trusts Develop a cash flow plan to show how assets are to be monetised to pay down debt Streamline operations Provide information about the USD m broadband investments Finally marktomarket accounting was discussed as well The analysts had no issue with that noting that for Enrons type of business this was an appropriate way to account for revenues They considered the average daily VaR number of USD m to be low thus not showing any evidence of aggressive accounting Also the retention of key staff would become very important in the future Regards Tomas
