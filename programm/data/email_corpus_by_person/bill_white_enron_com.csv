<22863528.1075858814426.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,bill.white@enron.com,2001-09-28 05:21:54,RE Trades as ENA Cc Justin Your solution appears to respond specifically to EOL related legalcredit issues However isnt this only the tip of the iceberg What about nonEOL OTC trades conducted by ECTRIC traders with counterparties that want ENA as their counterparty From my time in London it was always impressed upon me that there was a quagmire of additional tax and potential regulatory SFA issues Please comment Also as a commercially efficient course of action It has always seemed to me that we should attempt to train our couterparties to accept that ECTRIC is also a Enron Corp guaranteed sub at least it was in the past at their request and somehow initially set up our contractsISDA to be inclusive of this vehicle Is this possible Otherwise the permutations of various legalcredittaxregulatory hurdles for all manner of OTC trades becomes onerous Bill Original Message From Boyd Justin Sent September To Dyk Russell Shackleton Sara White Bill Shankman Jeffrey A Cc Abramo Caroline Zivic Robyn Diamond Daniel Radous Paul Lebrocq Wendi Sharma Shifali Juggins Janine Nelson Roderick Subject RE Trades as ENA Russell My view would be to follow the novation route ie CP trades via EOL with ECTRIC Each trade is novated from ECTRIC to ENA and treated as concluded under ENA ISDA Master ENA enters into backtoback trade with ECTRIC This does mean that the CP must initially accept the European EOL GTCs though if we set up a mechanism whereby EOL trades are automatically novated to ENA and treated as concluded under the ENA ISDA Master this effectively cancels out the EOL GTCs Justin Original Message From Dyk Russell Sent September To Shackleton Sara Boyd Justin White Bill Shankman Jeffrey A Cc Abramo Caroline Zivic Robyn Diamond Daniel Radous Paul Lebrocq Wendi Sharma Shifali Subject FW Trades as ENA Everyone Our hedge fund group needs clarification on the issue of doing Brent and other European product deals w our hedge fund counterparties and booking them back to ENA the entity with which all the funds have ISDAs We just did two WTIBrent crude oil spreads today one w very large volume and expect to be doing more such deals This is more than just a legal issue its going to impact credit and our strategy to get the funds trading on EOL as well As we understand it the main legal issue is that all the funds have an ISDA only w ENA and not w ECTRIC so they and I assume we want all deals and legal exposure to be w ENA To satisfy both parties desires all European product deals must be booked from ECTRIC to ENA Sara from speaking to you and from Justins response below it seems to me that the only legal hurdle we the funds and our traders might face is if no trader w ENA in Houston okays w the counterparty on ENAs behalf However there seem to be other solutions a netting agreement and novating that get around this As Sara knows dealing on legal agreements w the funds can be onerous and timeconsuming negotiating more paperwork is not a viable option From the credit side as we understand it the issue w not backtobacking the trades w ENA is that the credit exposure will not be aggregated to the funds net position in Houston and therefore not monitored In other words any exposure not sitting w ENA will be invisible to credit so daily margining etc will be incorrect From the EnronOnline side as we see it there are a couple of issues EOL wants the funds to trade online an increasing number of funds also want to trade online However they do not want to be restricted to trading products that are only US based Also they would like to see more arb spread products like a WTIBrent crude oil spread online If neither desire can be easily met bc we need a separate ISDA w ECTRIC which potentially means as above more onerous and timeconsuming negotiation then it will certainly be detrimental for volume and also foresake a certain momentum that we are gaining now The point has been raised that the funds could trade European products if credit in London cleared them and if they were willing then to accept the general terms and conditions that pop up on EOL We can assure you that they will not accept this These are the issues as we see them from the origination side There may be other issues that were missing from the sides that Ive mentioned as well as the tradingback office side Regards Russ Original Message From White Bill Sent Thursday September PM To Dyk Russell Subject FW Trades as ENA Original Message From Sharma Shifali Sent July To White Bill Subject FW Trades as ENA This is what we have heard from Legal and Tax so far Were trying to get a list of couterparties that currently will not trade with ECTRIC and only with ENA Original Message From Boyd Justin Sent Thursday July AM To Juggins Janine Beyhum Maya Cc Sharma Shifali Klar Guenther Sexton Camille Watt Julie Marsh Jonathan Subject RE Trades as ENA i agree assuming you follow janines approach then no adverse UK regulatory issues will ensue justin Original Message From Juggins Janine Sent July To Beyhum Maya Boyd Justin Cc Sharma Shifali Klar Guenther Sexton Camille Watt Julie Subject RE Trades as ENA I assume that these are financial transactions The current approach is the right one in the circumstances ie trade between ECTRIC and ENA trade between ENA and third party eg Bank of America It is important that the trader agreeing to the deal with the third party in the name of ENA is located in Houston they cannot agree deals in the name of ENA when located in London The pricing should be such that ENA is compensated for taking the credit risk with respect to the third party but otherwise all the economics should be with ECTRIC To avoid booking the back to back trades a possibility would be an agreement on netting to be entered into by ECTRIC ENA and Bank of America if all parties can get comfortable with the legal position Another alternative sometimes put forward is that ECTRIC does the deal with Bank of America the contract is then novated from ECTRIC to ENA and ENA enters into a back to back swap on the same financial terms with ECTRIC Note that we are currently working on a project to enter into financials through EFET LLC arranged by EEFT instead of ECTRIC effective November Regards Janine Original Message From Beyhum Maya Sent July To Juggins Janine Boyd Justin Cc Sharma Shifali Subject Trades as ENA Hi I am currently working in the London Risk group for Global Markets At the moment we have a number of counterparties who do not want to transact with ECTRIC but would like to do deals only with ENA eg Bank of America As a result if a London trader wants to carry out a trade with Bank of America he will do an internal trade with a trader in Houston and then book a trade between the Houston trader who trades under ENA and Bank Of America The trades are then confirmed from the Houston office We were wondering about a couple of things Are there any taxlegal implications we should be aware of as a result of booking the trades as we do Is there a way to approach these counterparties to get them to trade with ECTRIC as this currently creates a lot of paperwork and administration Thanks for your help Maya
