realtimetradersmarketinfowatchlistasp Beyond The Numbers Are the markets ready for a rally Whether the markets are ready for a bounce or a sustainable rally is a topi c that can probably be argued for a long time to come Some may argue the fundamentals may or may not be in place for a reversal While others may argue the markets are due for a bounce because of the oversold condition Then there are those few including RealTimeTraderscom who believe its a good idea not to fight the markets and simply go with the flow Important factors may be coming together for a move up Notice our heading states a move up rather than a rally Along wit h a few market analysts we are not so sure this move up will be a definite reversal or a temporary bounce that many traders are looking for in next few session s Last week we pointed out that Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan finally ga ve the markets what they had been anticipating His favorable comments were interpreted to be a sign of possible lowering of interest rates to help the economy from slowing down to undesirable growth levels Last Friday Labor Department announced the November employment numbers were below the consensus estimates Over the weekend we learned that Iraq will b e back in the crude oil market If Iraqs crude comes online that may furthe r pressure the crude oil prices which is in the best interest of US consumers The fact this election drama is also getting close to an end is also a positive for the markets All the above facts coupled with the usual year end rally better known as Santa Claus rally may set the stage for a meaningful move up in the last few weeks of the year Economic slowdown may impact future earnings Last week some of the biggest and wellknown names warned their upcoming quarterly earnings will fall short of Wall Streets expectations Despit e the earnings warnings markets have started to rally on the FED Chairmans comments about possibly lowering interest rates to stimulate or stop the economy from slowing down While lower rates are expected to help the marke ts move higher it is important to note that corporate earnings will not immediately start to move higher Given that we believe markets are likely to move in a range for some time before starting to pick up pace Moreover unlike the past when dot com businesses rocketed higher and higher despite losing more money stock prices in the future will depend a lot on the companies future earnings brbr We encourage our readers to take a closer look at companies earnings power and their position within the sector What we mean by that is it is a good idea to stay with the leaders in each sector rather than any stock that is moving higher a good example of that is Applied Materials AMAT within th e semiconductor sector Applied Materials is the strongest stock in the Semiconductor equipment world and as such it has always produced steady an d predictable earnings Sector Analysis Healthcare and Insurance related Stocks continue to attract money Once again we like to stay with stocks that are outperforming the broad market Past few months we have been pointing out health and food related stocks that are among the defensive stocks that has caught the interest of investors We at RealTimeTraderscom believe the healthcare and insurance related stocks will continue to move higher regardless of the possibility o f technology stocks coming back into the spotlight Some of the stocks that a re worth mentioning are United Healthcare UNH has been hovering around its week high for the past few weeks Friday the stock

Numbers When will the Election madness come to an end The US presidential election was held weeks ago Since then there has been plenty of speculation on who will be the next president of United States Each passing day this matter has gotten more complicated causing the nation to become increasingly frustrated with the entire situation Traders convey the message that the financial markets have reached a point where the outcome of this election in either direction will have very little effect on the markets As one frustrated trader said Mostly markets are looking for an end to this matter not many care at this point who the next president will be We believe the initial reaction to the outcome will be mixed However as the cloud clears markets should be able to find a clear direction from there As of Tuesday night it appears the Texas Governor George Bush will most likely be the next president Even negative news is boosting stock prices Just a few weeks ago no news was good news for US financial markets Readers may recall even when there was positive news announcements made by companies stocks continued to trade lower However in the past few trading sessions we have highlighted many betterknown names warnings about the upcoming quarterly earnings and about their entire years outlook Interestingly enough following the bad news most of these stocks have rallied to recover some of the recent losses We are still confused about this reaction and trying to make sense of it all This interesting development brings back some important memories Some time ago months ago we pointed out that some of the better known money managers left the business or were forced out because they too could not make sense or understand what was taking place in the market back then Of course the entire street is aware of what has happened to the Nasdaq in last months Others with many decades of experience in the markets have voiced similar opinions Some of the smartest people in Wall Street like Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway Hedge fund manager Julian H Robertson and fund manager George Soros also find it difficult to make sense of the market reaction to the negative news Whats puzzling is the fact these companies are steadily moving higher despite the companies loosing money We believe it is worth pointing out or at least taking a closer look at before blindly joining the crowd Sector Analysis Another big name warns Tuesday after the close one of the betterknown names in the PC world Compaq Computer CPQ warned the companys earnings would fall short of analysts expectations Following this earnings warning the box makers stock briefly dipped down to before bouncing back to finish the session around Given this is the third box maker to preannounce negative earnings it may be worth watching the component manufacturers who make the parts that go into the computers Some of the tech stocks worth watching closely are disc drive makers memory producers modem network cardnetwork suppliers audiovideo and other component makers Dow Transports may stall around In the past few sessions we wrote about transportation stocks benefiting from lower crude oil prices Some of the best performers within the sector were airlines and railroads As we are approaching the critical resistance level of we like to alert readers to watch for possible profit taking Tuesday Transportation index traded as high as before settling at Tuesdays move up put the index at a month high If the crude oil prices stays around the current levels or move lower

technology stocks helped Nasdaq outpace the bluechip index Nasdaq finished the session higher by points to close above the mark Bluechip index for its part finished the session higher by only points thanks only to the strength in Intel and Microsoft Monday as tech stocks picked up momentum old economy stocks went out of favor It is worth noting that we saw the same pattern of trading many months ago when Nasdaq was in favor Federal Reserves actions will take time to produce results Mondays Market Analysis explained why a change in interest rate s by the FED may take many quarters to produce any meaningful effects This was clearly evident when the Federal Reserve raised rates times beginning last June to slowdown the economy As our readers may realize the effects of all those rate hikes were not evident up until recently Which implies that buying stocks in anticipation of a rate hike may not translate into a sustainable longterm rally Plenty of problems ahead Monday more companies preannounced negative earnings for their upcoming quarters We like to remind our readers there are still many weeks left for preannouncements We at Realtimetraderscom expect this quarters preannouncements to exceed last quarters We also believe the earnings picture for US companies to be mixed with a negative bias for the next few quarters Sector Analysis Momentum is starting to build in technology stocks Despite the problems in the economy the oversold technology stocks are setting the stage for a Santa Claus rally In Mondays market analysis we wrote of several reasons why we expect the markets to see an upside move in the next few weeks Given Mondays upside move in tech stocks and the fact the tech index Nasdaq managed to close above the initial resistance level of is yet another reason that leads us to believe the markets may be setting the stage for a rally in the next few weeks Semiconductor and biotech Indices are heading higher again Some of our readers may recall that semiconductor and biotech were the strongest sectors that powered the Nasdaq index to record levels in early Mondays best performing sectors were the former highfliers Given the momentum that is

more evidence a recovery in the tech sector may not occur as quickly as some analysts had been predicting On the session the Nasdaq Composite lost points and closed below the level at Dow Industrial was able to post a modest gain and remain above the support level After the close Sun Microsystems Inc lowered their estimates and said demand continues to be weak This morning two of the leading brokerages are making a lot of negative comments about the semiconductor stocks and some cautious comments on Juniper Networks and downgraded the stock Given all the negative news in the market this morning we expect the Nasdaq to continue to come under pressure and the Dow to break below the level As of this writing the Dow futures are lower by points and the Nasdaq futures are lower by points Stocks to Watch After the close Alcatel ALA and Lucent Technologies LU announced their discussions concerning a possible merger of equals have been terminated As a result both stocks rebounded slightly in afterhours trading but this morning Alcatel is lowering its guidance As mentioned above after the close Sun Microsystems SUNW warned it will not meet its previous estimates for the fourth quarter and lowered its revenue estimates to be between billion and billion This figure is significantly lower than the billion in the sameperiod last year and billion in the third quarter of this year The company went on to say US demand is worse than expected and more importantly the company is starting to see weakness in both Europe and Asia Sector Analysis Semiconductors remains under

since the book to bill number came in at a year low Now after days of trading and a decline all the major brokers have woken up and are cutting estimates on some of the leading semiconductor stocks We

Tuesdays closing bell Sun Microsystems said its earnings for the current quarter will be substantially below street estimates Wednesday morning other major brokers either downgraded or cut estimates

believe the markets will continue be very volatile with technology stocks contributing to the downside It is our opinion that the worst in terms of earnings warning may be behind us However there will be selective stocks from the PC related and seasonal sectors that may warn about their earnings RealTimeTraders analysts expect the markets to trade in a range till the end of the quarter mainly due

a positive note and finished the session slightly higher Dow Jones gained points Nasdaq Composite for its part finished the session higher by points and the broader SP index finished the session

this type of bounce as a dead cat bounce Traders said the market as a whole is waiting on earnings preannouncement to determine where the markets will be heading in the shortterm Thus far the overall earnings picture does not seem to be improving due to the negative comments by Goldman Sachs USB Warburg and the downward earnings revisions by Sun Microsystems and Altera Corporation Some

However it is very clear the markets have very little tolerance to any negative news Friday morning markets declined in the early going after the markets received news that the manufacturing sector may be heading towards a recession But later in the session good old General Motors rescued the markets with its latest sales data GM said sales are ahead of expectations and the company expects to deliver earnings in line with previously stated expectations of for the full year and for the second quarter While the Dow components sales data is favorable for the markets RealTimeTraders analysts point out the sales for the month May is misleading because GM truck sales were up but car sales were down Analysts believe the sharp jump in the truck sales could be due to problems surrounding Ford Motors According to Ford Motor Company sales for both truck and car sales have declined sharply On a positive note analysts pointed out the fact employment data showed some improvement is a positive for the overall market Which suggests the Federal Reserves efforts to stimulate the economy may be starting to take effect As we stated in last Thursdays market analysis we expect this quarters earnings warnings and job cut announcements to be below last quarter One other important fact that is worth noting is that the Federal Reserve seems to still indicate there will be more rates cuts ahead to further stimulate the economy Stocks to watch Shares of Cisco have been steadily declining in the past few sessions and accelerated to the downside going into theclose Friday after the

have been following the semiconductor sector may recall that most of the companies in this sector have continue to make negative comments about their nearterm earnings outlook Given that the semiconductor index has some support around the current level it can be expected the sector may trade in a range until we receive further news from some of the bellwether stocks Note that Intel is expected to give its mid quarter update during this week We believe Intels update would definitely impact the sector as a whole We will continue to monitor the markets and alert our readers to any

Numbers When will the Election madness come to an end The US presidential election was held weeks ago Since then there has been plenty of speculation on who will be the next president of United States Each passing day this matter has gotten more complicated causing the nation to become increasingly frustrated with the entire situation Traders convey the message that the financial markets have reached a point where the outcome of this election in either direction will have very little effect on the markets As one frustrated trader said Mostly markets are looking for an end to this matter not many care at this point who the next president will be We believe the initial reaction to the outcome will be mixed However as the cloud clears markets should be able to find a clear direction from there As of Tuesday night it appears the Texas Governor George Bush will most likely be the next president Even negative news is boosting stock prices Just a few weeks ago no news was good news for US financial markets Readers may recall even when there was positive news announcements made by companies stocks continued to trade lower However in the past few trading sessions we have highlighted many betterknown names warnings about the upcoming quarterly earnings and about their entire years outlook Interestingly enough following the bad news most of these stocks have rallied to recover some of the recent losses We are still confused about this reaction and trying to make sense of it all This interesting development brings back some important memories Some time ago months ago we pointed out that some of the better known money managers left the business or were forced out because they too could not make sense or understand what was taking place in the market back then Of course the entire street is aware of what has happened to the Nasdaq in last months Others with many decades of experience in the markets have voiced similar opinions Some of the smartest people in Wall Street like Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway Hedge fund manager Julian H Robertson and fund manager George Soros also find it difficult to make sense of the market reaction to the negative news Whats puzzling is the fact these companies are steadily moving higher despite the companies loosing money We believe it is worth pointing out or at least taking a closer look at before blindly joining the crowd Sector Analysis Another big name warns Tuesday after the close one of the betterknown names in the PC world Compaq Computer CPQ warned the companys earnings would fall short of analysts expectations Following this earnings warning the box makers stock briefly dipped down to before bouncing back to finish the session around Given this is the third box maker to preannounce negative earnings it may be worth watching the component manufacturers who make the parts that go into the computers Some of the tech stocks worth watching closely are disc drive makers memory

crude oil prices Some of the best performers within the sector were airlines and railroads As we are approaching the critical resistance level of we like to alert readers to watch for possible profit

realtimetradersmarketinfowatchlistasp Beyond The Numbers Are the markets ready for a rally Whether the markets are ready for a bounce or a sustainable rally is a topi c that can probably be argued for a long time to come Some may argue the fundamentals may or may not be in place for a reversal While others may argue the markets are due for a bounce because of the oversold condition Then there are those few including RealTimeTraderscom who believe its a good idea not to fight the markets and simply go with the flow Important factors may be coming together for a move up Notice our heading states a move up rather than a rally Along wit h a few market analysts we are not so sure this move up will be a definite reversal or a temporary bounce that many traders are looking for in next few session s Last week we pointed out that Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan finally ga ve the markets what they had been anticipating His favorable comments were interpreted to be a sign of possible lowering of interest rates to help the economy from slowing down to undesirable growth levels Last Friday Labor Department announced the November employment numbers were below the consensus estimates Over the weekend we learned that Iraq will b e back in the crude oil market If Iraqs crude comes online that may furthe r pressure the crude oil prices which is in the best interest of US consumers The fact this election drama is also getting close to an end is also a positive for the markets All the above facts coupled with the usual year end rally better known as Santa Claus rally may set the stage for a meaningful move up in the last few weeks of the year Economic slowdown may impact future earnings Last week some of the biggest and wellknown names warned their upcoming quarterly earnings will fall short of Wall Streets expectations Despit e the earnings warnings markets have started to rally on the FED Chairmans comments about possibly lowering interest rates to stimulate or stop the economy from slowing down While lower rates are expected to help the marke ts move higher it is important to note that corporate earnings will not immediately start to move higher Given that we believe markets are likely to move in a range for some time before starting to pick up pace Moreover unlike the past when dot com businesses rocketed higher and higher despite losing more money stock prices in the future will depend a lot on the companies future earnings brbr We encourage our readers to take a closer look at companies earnings power and their position within the sector What we mean by that is it is a good idea to stay with the leaders in each sector rather than any stock that is moving higher a good example of that is Applied Materials AMAT within th e semiconductor sector Applied Materials is the strongest stock in the Semiconductor equipment world and as such it has always produced steady an d predictable earnings Sector Analysis Healthcare and Insurance related Stocks

any meaningful effects This was clearly evident when the Federal Reserve raised rates times beginning last June to slowdown the economy As our readers may realize the effects of all those rate hikes

rally on favorable news from the semiconductor sector First the Semiconductor Industry association said the future demand for semiconductors would be strong despite the drop in the booktobill ratio Following that announcement National Semiconductor said it is starting to see improvements as some of its major customers are starting to place orders again This news combined with Mondays positive comments from Xilinx Inc XLNX propelled the semiconductor sector higher Another factor that helped the index move higher was the anticipation of more favorable comments from industry leader Intel Corporation INTC after the close Intel finished the regular session higher by to close at Just as traders expected after the close Intel said it expects to meet earnings estimates While they were not really positive comments investors were happy to hear the company was not warning As a result traders drove the stock even higher in the afterhours session Shares of Intel traded as high as on million shares in the Island ECN Despite the fact Intel did not warn Merrill Lynch is cautious on the stock Taking a closer look at todays comments RealTimeTraders analysts are not very positive on the stock as well It seems Intel really painted a mixed picture as the company said it expects revenue to be slightly below the midpoint of the previous guidance range given on April th The company went on to say it sees stability in the microprocessor business and weakness in its communications related businesses Readers may want to watch the analyst comments and ratingestimate changes on Friday When Thursdays session came to a close the semiconductor index had risen and closed above the day moving average for the first time in more than months While it was a broad based rally some of the veteran traders expressed concern over the fact stocks such as Broadcom Corporation climbed after warning that its earnings will fall short of expectations It is also worth mentioning the company is expecting sales to drop by a whopping below its first quarter number It seems as though investors and traders have decided to selectively focus only on the positive news and ignore all the negatives On the economic front the government reported jobless claims rose to a multiyear high Analysts had expected the number to come in around K but the actual number was K Not only did this number beat the estimates but it also beat the previous weeks K number by a wide margin RealTimeTraders analysts believe this could cause some problem for the ailing economy In our opinion the slowing economy combined with increasing unemployment spells trouble for the economy While we believe the rebate from the tax cut is a good thing for the economy in our view it alone may not be enough to help the economy recover It is also our opinion the longer the slowdown lasts the harder it will be to recover Under the current circumstances we believe the Federal Reserve may consider another rate cut to boost the economy at the next FOMC meeting on June th and th Ahead of the meeting markets and analysts will be watching the economic reports closely for any clues to determine if the recent rate cuts have started to help the economy We at RealTimeTraders continue to believe earnings will be the driving force in the nearterm In our opinion the companies that manage to deliver strong earnings in

realtimetradersmarketinfowatchlistasp Beyond The Numbers Are the markets ready for a rally Whether the markets are ready for a bounce or a sustainable rally is a topi c that can probably be argued for a long time to come Some may argue the fundamentals may or may not be in place for a reversal While others may argue the markets are due for a bounce because of the oversold condition Then there are those few including RealTimeTraderscom who believe its a good idea not to fight the markets and simply go with the flow Important factors may be coming together for a move up Notice our heading states a move up rather than a rally Along wit h a few market analysts we are not so sure this move up will be a definite reversal or a temporary bounce that many traders are looking for in next few session s Last week we pointed out that Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan finally ga ve the markets what they had been anticipating His favorable comments were interpreted to be a sign of possible lowering of interest rates to help the economy from slowing down to undesirable growth levels Last Friday Labor Department announced the November employment numbers were below the consensus estimates Over the weekend we learned that Iraq will b e back in the crude oil market If Iraqs crude comes online that may furthe r pressure the crude oil prices which is in the best interest of US consumers The fact this election drama is also getting close to an end is also a positive for the markets All the above facts coupled with the usual year end rally better known as Santa Claus rally may set the stage for a meaningful move up in the last few weeks of the year Economic slowdown may impact future earnings Last week some of the biggest and wellknown names warned their upcoming quarterly earnings will fall short of Wall Streets expectations Despit e the earnings warnings markets have started to rally on the FED Chairmans comments about possibly lowering interest rates to stimulate or stop the economy from slowing down While lower rates are expected to help the marke ts move higher it is important to note that corporate earnings will not immediately start to move higher Given that we believe markets are likely to move in a range for some time before starting to pick up pace Moreover unlike the past when dot com businesses rocketed higher and higher despite losing more money stock prices in the future will depend a lot on the companies future earnings brbr We encourage our readers to take a closer look at companies earnings power and their position within the sector What we mean by that is it is a good idea to stay with the leaders in each sector rather than any stock that is moving higher a good example of that is Applied Materials AMAT within th e semiconductor sector Applied Materials is the strongest stock in the Semiconductor equipment world and as such it has always produced steady an d predictable earnings Sector Analysis Healthcare and Insurance related Stocks continue to attract money Once again we like to stay with stocks that are outperforming the broad market Past few months we have been pointing out health and food related stocks that are among the defensive stocks that has caught the interest of investors We at RealTimeTraderscom believe the healthcare and insurance related stocks will continue to move higher regardless of the possibility o f technology stocks coming back into the spotlight Some of the stocks that a re worth mentioning are United Healthcare UNH has been hovering around its week high for the past few weeks Friday the stock closed at a new we ek on average volume Allstate Corp ALL closed at a new week high on Friday for the fourth consecutive day Oxford Healthcare OXHP has set series of new highs since we started to

Numbers When will the Election madness come to an end The US presidential election was held weeks ago Since then there has been plenty of speculation on who will be the next president of United States Each passing day this matter has gotten more complicated causing the nation to become increasingly frustrated with the entire situation Traders convey the message that the financial markets have reached a point where the outcome of this election in either direction will have very little effect on the markets As one frustrated trader said Mostly markets are looking for an end to this matter not many care at this point who the next president will be We believe the initial reaction to the outcome will be mixed However as the cloud clears markets should be able to find a clear direction from there As of Tuesday night it appears the Texas Governor George Bush will most likely be the next president Even negative news is boosting stock prices Just a few weeks ago no news was good news for US financial markets Readers may recall even when there was positive news announcements made by companies stocks continued to trade lower However in the past few trading sessions we have highlighted many betterknown names warnings about the upcoming quarterly earnings and about their entire years outlook Interestingly enough following the bad news most of these stocks have rallied to recover some of the recent losses We are still confused about this reaction and trying to make sense of it all This interesting development brings back some important memories Some time ago months ago we pointed out that some of the better known money managers left the business or were forced out because they too could not make sense or understand what was taking place in the market back then Of course the entire street is aware of what has happened to the Nasdaq in last months Others with many decades of experience in the markets have voiced similar opinions Some of the smartest people in Wall Street like Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway Hedge fund manager Julian H Robertson and fund manager George Soros also find it difficult to make sense of the market reaction to the negative news Whats puzzling is the fact these companies are steadily moving higher despite the companies loosing money We believe it is worth pointing out or at least taking a closer look at before blindly joining the crowd Sector Analysis Another big name warns Tuesday after the close one of the betterknown names in the PC world Compaq Computer CPQ warned the companys earnings would fall short of analysts expectations Following this earnings warning the box makers stock briefly dipped down to before bouncing back to finish the session around Given this is the third box maker to preannounce negative earnings it may be worth watching the component manufacturers who make the parts that go into the computers Some of the tech stocks worth watching closely are disc drive makers memory producers modem network cardnetwork suppliers audiovideo and other component makers Dow Transports may stall around In the past few sessions we wrote about transportation stocks benefiting from lower crude oil prices Some of the best performers within the sector were airlines and railroads As we are approaching the critical resistance level of we like to alert readers to watch for possible profit taking Tuesday Transportation index traded as high as before settling at Tuesdays move up put the index at a month high If the crude oil prices stays around the current levels or move lower Transportation index may challenge the resistance level and move higher if the markets as a whole moves higher Economic Reports Bond Markets Retail Report may Set the Stage Tuesdays long bond moved up

Stocks realtimetradersmarketinfowatchlistasp Beyond The Numbers Mondays action resembles the good old days Monday morning futures indicated for a very sharp opening Markets gapped open higher and traded lower due to the continued uncertainty in the political front However shortly after dipping into the negative territory buyers stepped up to drive the markets higher again Strength in technology stocks helped Nasdaq outpace the bluechip index Nasdaq finished the session higher by points to close above the mark Bluechip index for its part finished the session higher by only points thanks only to the strength in Intel and Microsoft Monday as tech stocks picked up momentum old economy stocks went out of favor It is worth noting that we saw the same pattern of trading many months ago when Nasdaq was in favor Federal Reserves actions will take time to produce results Mondays Market Analysis explained why a change in interest rate s by the FED may take many quarters to produce any meaningful effects This was clearly evident when the Federal Reserve raised rates times beginning last June to slowdown the economy As our readers may realize the effects of all those rate hikes were not evident up until recently Which implies that buying stocks in anticipation of a rate hike may not translate into a sustainable longterm rally Plenty of problems ahead Monday more companies preannounced negative earnings for their upcoming quarters We like to remind our readers there are still many weeks left for preannouncements We at Realtimetraderscom expect this quarters preannouncements to exceed last quarters We also believe the earnings picture for US companies to be mixed with a negative bias for the next few quarters Sector Analysis Momentum is starting to build in technology stocks Despite the problems in the economy the oversold technology stocks are setting the stage for a Santa Claus rally In Mondays market analysis we wrote of several reasons why we expect the markets to see an upside move in the next few weeks Given Mondays upside move in tech stocks and the fact the tech index Nasdaq managed to close above the initial resistance level of is yet another reason that leads us to believe the markets may be setting the stage for a rally in the next few weeks Semiconductor and biotech Indices are heading higher again Some of our readers may recall that semiconductor and biotech were the strongest sectors that powered the Nasdaq index to record levels in early Mondays best performing sectors were the former highfliers Given the momentum that is
