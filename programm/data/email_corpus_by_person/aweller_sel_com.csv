messages to the CPUC I think that once the aggregate is exposed it will not seem as frightening to the CPUC Also what if one of our messages to the CPUC speaks to the fact that they got what they want no more customers will be signed to direct access but dont retroactively suspend or retroactively assign arbitrary exit fees Andrea Weller Market Strategist Strategic Energy LLC Original Message From

IMMEDIATE REVIEW NEEDED Importance High I think there would be value in the various companies on this distribution who are serving direct access to be able to show that the amount of load now being served or recently signed up is not significant enough to jeopardize payment of the bonds Anything less may not erase fears Showing that the Constitutional impariment of contracts issue will cost more and do more damage than grandfathering those now seems to be one of the strongest courses of action for the Sept pleading Perhaps Dan could confidentially be told generally how much load has or will have access by Sept and he could aggregate the number and then it could be compared to the amount of longor short supply is for the UDCs compared to the load left to pay for it What do you think

Subject CRITICAL IMMEDIATE REVIEW NEEDED THE COMMISSION HAS ISSUED A REVISED DRAFT OF THE BARNETT DECISION TODAY WHICH RETROACTIVELY SUSPENDS DIRECT ACCESS TO JULY The cover letter states as follows This version differs from the draft mailed on August in several ways First the effective date of the suspension has been changed from September to July as proposed in the draft mailed June Second the draft decision clarifies that customers who have executed direct access contracts prior to July may continue to receive power from electric service providers for the initial term of the contracts Several other editorial and explanatory changes have also been made Assembly Bill No from the First Extraordinary Session ABX requires that direct access be suspended until the Department of Water Resources no longer supplies power to the customers of the three largest regulated electricity companies It directs that the Commission determine the effective date of the suspension In order to reduce the possibility of harm to customers and to resolve potential conflict parties should comment on whether ABX suspends the entire direct access program including all transactions under that program how the Commission can comply with ABX if it exempts written contracts for direct access executed before July from the suspension and whether July is an appropriate date for the suspensionComments on the draft decision are permitted Those comments are to be electronically served on the service list for those who have electronic addresses no later than am on September and shall be filed with the Commission by pm on that date The specific wording in the Decision is The Legislature has directed this Commission to suspend direct access until DWR no longer procures power for the retail endusers and we find it should be suspended effective July The Legislative direction is clear and the suspension should apply to SCE Pacific Gas and Electric Company PGE and San Diego Gas Electric Company SDGE In the interest of providing cost stability for current direct access customers written contracts for direct access signed before July are exempt from the suspension for the initial term of the contracts It also provides that In comments on the draft decision several parties questioned the need for the Commission to implement the legislative suspension of direct access as soon as July By the draft decision mailed for comment to the parties on June market participants were provided notice that direct access would be suspended as of July The Commission postponed its consideration of the draft decision However we do not change the effective date of the suspension The underlying legislation was introduced on January enrolled and sent to the Governor on February and signed by the Governor the same day Market participants have now had eight months since then to prepare for this event We do not wish to reward customers who have switched to direct access since July in the hope that we would change the effective date of the suspension when this switch could disadvantage customers who continue to receive bundled service from the utility The decision also states that no parties have raised any factual issues which would justify hearings which presumably although not explicitly disposes of the joint AReMWPTF filing I presume we will want to file in strong opposition Suggestions on strategy It might be a good idea to have a conference call on this and get started immediately with raising a movement to counter this Dan Law Offices of Daniel W Douglass
