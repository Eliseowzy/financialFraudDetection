wwwusbellowscom wwwswecofabcom Product of the month Sweco Fab Inc the ASME fabrication shop of PTP specially designed and fabricated a inch ID Toroidal bellow expansion joint for an ASME U stamp heat exchanger shell The toroidal shape gives the bellow the unique ability to carry high pressures conversely it also permits modest deflection ability For more information about this project please refer

transport gases liquids and suspended solids between units of a plant The temperatures of the contents and the pipe when the plant is in operation are often quite different from the ambient temperature of the surroundings The heat transferred during changes in temperature causes metal pipe to expand and contract Piping designers must provide for movement due to temperature changes and forces caused by pumps gravity and other elements of the piping system Read PTPs How to Size a Spring Hanger Technical Bulletin for more information PTP Specially Designs and Fabricates Constants for a RadiantTube Support System These constants are an essential component of the radianttube support system for a reforming furnace Piping Technology custom designed these units to fit in the limited space available inside the furnace The bolting patterns for the constants needed to be flexible enough that they could be attached to the supporting structure with any of the support system designs being considered For more information about this project please contact us at Slide Plates The Sandwich Concept Piping Technology Products Inc uses the sandwich concept when applying slide plates to our customers systems Figure shows a sandwich composed of two identical slide plates one on top and another on the bottom Each slide plate which is like the bun of the sandwich and a low coefficient of friction material which is bonded to the metal backing plate Figure In a typical application a slide bearing plate is welded to a structural steel member which is strong enough to provide the required support but whose coefficient of friction is too high Figure shows an application in which a slide bearing plate is welded on top of one steel beam supporting the other beam When the top beam moves due to thermal expansion for example it slides across the surface of the bearing plate without contacting the supporting another beam To return to our sandwich metaphor the top half of the sandwich is bonded to the sliding beam and to the bottom half to the supporting beam For more technical bulletins please refer to our products page and technical page at Figure PTPs Online Quotation
