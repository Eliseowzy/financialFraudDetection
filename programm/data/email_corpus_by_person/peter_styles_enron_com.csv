Spain and Netherlands and you will see there are a couple of mentions of those countries though only in context of interconnection capacity towards the end of the piece I think other relevant lessons would be related to perils of allowing retail and wholesale esp pools for residual capacity markets to be divorced in regulatory terms one from the other Difference from California however is that the

California power crisis By Stuart Penson Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited LONDON Jan Reuters Californias electricity crisis has sent jitters through the European power industry but the continent better supplied than the US state will continue down the path of liberalisation analysts said on Thursday California is definitely going to help us recognise that there are potential problems in Europe said Katharina Gassner power analyst at the UKs Oxford Economic Research Associates OXERA But we would certainly expect those problems to be ironed out as liberalised markets evolve in Europe Acute power shortages in California have triggered a surge in wholesale prices causing the states two biggest utilities Pacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edison to run up costs of billion which cannot be passed on to customers because prices are capped under state law The meltdown of Californias flawed experiment in power deregulation has alerted European regulators to the pitfalls of opening up energy markets to competition But analysts say Europes ample supplies of electricity mean it will make the switch to competitive markets without the threat of utility bankruptcies and blackouts now faced by Americas richest state The European Unions power markets are opening up to competition under a European Union Directive which came into force in Californias crisis which is sending ripples through financial markets and topping the agenda of US Energy Secretary Bill Richardson is rooted in a shortage of power and an apparently unbalanced deregulation model analysts say Electricity consumption fuelled by Californias hightech industrial base is far outstripping local supply which has not grown significantly for years New power projects were a rarity in the s as environmental constraints bureaucratic delays and regulatory uncertainty put off investors EUROPE HAS POWER SURPLUS By contrast most European markets have a significant surplus of power This is most evident in Germany mainland Europes biggest market where power prices crashed after liberalisation in Anyone who assumes what is happening in California is going to happen in Europe is really not understanding the situation said Nigel Evans managing director in Europe for Energy consulting company Caminus The supplydemand fundamentals in Europe are vastly different to California Supply is tighter in Europes fastest growing markets like Spain and Ireland But unlike in California there is no shortage of companies prepared to build new generation I dont think there is any evidence of the system coming under real stress in any European markets said David Smol of UKbased consultants Ilex There is lots of new investment on the block CALIFORNIA POWER PRICES ROCKET The Californian price increases mainly seen on the California Power Exchange have been higher than fundamentals justify said Mark Schroeder a vice president of European government and regulatory affairs at US energy group Enron Prices on the exchange reflect the need to recoup stranded costs rather than true market fundamentals he said The utilities cannot pass the costs on to retail customers because retail rates unlike liberalised wholesale prices are frozen under state deregulation laws Europes deregulation plan contains a staggered timetable of market opening that brings competition ultimately to all consumers from big industrial consumers down to private households But European liberalisation is not problem free Transmission bottlenecks are restricting supply on the borders of France Spain Italy and the Netherlands Prices in Spain and the Netherlands have been forced higher recently as a result of constraints on interconnection much of which is used under longterm supply deals arranged prior to liberalisation Interconnection is a problem but its more about freeing up existing capacity taken up by long term contracts than about building new interconnection said Gassner at OXERA The development of efficient free markets across Europe would enable companies to enter into swaps deals removing the need for physical interconnection Gassner added Folder Name Enron Reuters folder

nron cc Peter CT Joe CT Andrew CT Subject EU plans for single power market suffer setback Enron Mention Reuters This articlewire report from Reuters came in yesterday just as I left for a lecture so I am only now forwarding it to you Joe tells me that Investor Relations has received some inquiries about what is going on in Europe yesterday due to the bad headline Reuters chose below aided by a selfserving European Commission official and Dynegys Q earnings showing red ink for Europe Ignoring the headline and the quote from the European Commission civil servant which I will elaborate upon below this is a BIG WIN It is progress for liberalisation and I intend to tell The Economist just that when I do an interview with a reporter later today This story is about the DEMISE of the illconceived EurosMWh export charge It stands truth and logic on its head to say as the unnamed European official does that the demise of the euros charge was anything like harmonisation or that its demise sets back European liberalisattion It is now much more likely that we will get a charging regime that will maintain or increase trade and certainly will not set back trade as the euros would have Just to further deconstruct the article it was never a single charge recall that new entrants disproportionately bore the burden with many preexisting contracts of incumbents since we did not exist in this market years ago being exempt nor would it contribute to a single market but rather would have raised barriers to crossborder trade Moreover the cost basis for the charge was never made transparent either Finally the rebate scheme likely would have subsidised the incumbents competition against new entrants There is a good quote from Peter Styles and Peter deserves a great deal of recognition for leading the efforts to defeat this If you read the article not the headline and European Commission official quote you can see the other arguments against it including the claim by German industrial consumers that it would have raised their prices by Any message from PR or Investor Relations must be that this is a victory in the march towards a fully liberalised market and a win for consumers The reason a European ommission official would say what they did is that they have been complicit in the GermanFranco conspiracy to impose the euros charge and probably felt compelled to save face by saying this is a setback otherwise one would ask why were they working onsupporting something so deleterious to the development of the market Apologies for being a bit lengthy but I wrote this hopefully with sufficient detail that if you want to forward this to either PR or Investor Relations they will be armed with enough info that they can respond to further inquiries By the way we had an inkling of this via telephone coversation I had with UK DTI three days ago communicated immediately to traders just did not have time to summarise in an email to you I will be summarising my conversation with UK DTI momentarily even though it is days old because I will be adding some of her commentary on the wider political lay of the land which I think you will want to read for the big

Capital Trade Resources Corp From Please respond to To cc Subject Enron Reuters folder UK EU plans for single power market suffer setback UK EU plans for single power market suffer setback By Margaret Orgill Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited LONDON Oct Reuters European Union hopes for a single electricity market have suffered a setback after power companies and consumers failed to agree a system for harmonising crossborder transmission tariffs said officials on Thursday Plans to introduce a single tariff for access to the west European grid by November have been postponed because of misgivings particularly from some power producers said a European Union source It seems that we have more problems than expected and the European Commission could have to go for legislation said the official who declined to be named The tariff is a voluntary proposal by western European grid operators to harmonise cross border charges and create a single regional power market The official declined to give more details of the producers doubts but traders are opposed to the fee which they say is too high and will stifle the emerging European power trading market The proposal has also run into legal problems in Germany where its introduction would require changes to an industry agreement on access to the regional electricity grid German consumer bodies are unlikely to accept the new tariff which will add around percent to wholesale power prices The VIK which represents industrial consumers has already written to the Commission saying they will not accept this fee said Einar Vestra managing director of the trading division at Mannheimbased utility MVV TARIFF TO BE DISCUSSED BY EU INDUSTRY The tariff will be discussed by the socalled Florence group which includes EU officials government and industry representatives which is due to meet again on November If the voluntary approach does not work Brussels may decide to include provisions on crossborder transmission in a forthcoming directive to speed up the opening of Europes electricity markets Grid operators have proposed a flat charge of two euros per megawatt hour for exports regardless of how many borders the power crosses instead of charging a fee at each frontier The funds from the tariff will be put in a central pot and divided among grid owners to reimburse network transit costs estimated at around million euros a year Traders argue the fee is too expensive and object to the fact the grid companies want to charge it only on new contracts and exempt existing longterm contracts An exportrelated transmission fee was misconceived in the first place said Peter Styles vice president of European government affairs at US utility Enron The priority in the Florence process should be greater

Spain and Netherlands and you will see there are a couple of mentions of those countries though only in context of interconnection capacity towards the end of the piece I think other relevant lessons would be related to perils of allowing retail and wholesale esp pools for residual capacity markets to be divorced in regulatory terms one from the other Difference from California however is that the

California power crisis By Stuart Penson Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited LONDON Jan Reuters Californias electricity crisis has sent jitters through the European power industry but the continent better supplied than the US state will continue down the path of liberalisation analysts said on Thursday California is definitely going to help us recognise that there are potential problems in Europe said Katharina Gassner power analyst at the UKs Oxford Economic Research Associates OXERA But we would certainly expect those problems to be ironed out as liberalised markets evolve in Europe Acute power shortages in California have triggered a surge in wholesale prices causing the states two biggest utilities Pacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edison to run up costs of billion which cannot be passed on to customers because prices are capped under state law The meltdown of Californias flawed experiment in power deregulation has alerted European regulators to the pitfalls of opening up energy markets to competition But analysts say Europes ample supplies of electricity mean it will make the switch to competitive markets without the threat of utility bankruptcies and blackouts now faced by Americas richest state The European Unions power markets are opening up to competition under a European Union Directive which came into force in Californias crisis which is sending ripples through financial markets and topping the agenda of US Energy Secretary Bill Richardson is rooted in a shortage of power and an apparently unbalanced deregulation model analysts say Electricity consumption fuelled by Californias hightech industrial base is far outstripping local supply which has not grown significantly for years New power projects were a rarity in the s as environmental constraints bureaucratic delays and regulatory uncertainty put off investors EUROPE HAS POWER SURPLUS By contrast most European markets have a significant surplus of power This is most evident in Germany mainland Europes biggest market where power prices crashed after liberalisation in Anyone who assumes what is happening in California is going to happen in Europe is really not understanding the situation said Nigel Evans managing director in Europe for Energy consulting company Caminus The supplydemand fundamentals in Europe are vastly different to California Supply is tighter in Europes fastest growing markets like Spain and Ireland But unlike in California there is no shortage of companies prepared to build new generation I dont think there is any evidence of the system coming under real stress in any European markets said David Smol of UKbased consultants Ilex There is lots of new investment on the block CALIFORNIA POWER PRICES ROCKET The Californian price increases mainly seen on the California Power Exchange have been higher than fundamentals justify said Mark Schroeder a vice president of European government and regulatory affairs at US energy group Enron Prices on the exchange reflect the need to recoup stranded costs rather than true market fundamentals he said The utilities cannot pass the costs on to retail customers because retail rates unlike liberalised wholesale prices are frozen under state deregulation laws Europes deregulation plan contains a staggered timetable of market opening that brings competition ultimately to all consumers from big industrial consumers down to private households But European liberalisation is not problem free Transmission bottlenecks are restricting supply on the borders of France Spain Italy and the Netherlands Prices in Spain and the Netherlands have been forced higher recently as a result of constraints on interconnection much of which is used under longterm supply deals arranged prior to liberalisation Interconnection is a problem but its more about freeing up existing capacity taken up by long term contracts than about building new interconnection said Gassner at OXERA The development of efficient free markets across Europe would enable companies to enter into swaps deals removing the need for physical interconnection Gassner added Folder Name Enron Reuters folder

agree a system for harmonising crossborder transmission tariffs said officials on Thursday Plans to introduce a single tariff for access to the west European grid by November have been postponed because of misgivings particularly from some power producers said a European Union source It seems that we have more problems than expected and the European Commission could have to go for legislation said the official who declined to be named The tariff is a voluntary proposal by western European grid operators to harmonise cross border charges and create a single regional power market The official declined to give more details of the producers doubts but traders are opposed to the fee which they say is too high and will stifle the emerging European power trading market The proposal has also run into legal problems in Germany where its introduction would require changes to an industry agreement on access to the regional electricity grid German consumer bodies are unlikely to accept the new tariff which will add around percent to wholesale power prices The VIK which represents industrial consumers has already written to the Commission saying they will not accept this fee said Einar Vestra managing director of the trading division at Mannheimbased utility MVV TARIFF TO BE DISCUSSED BY EU INDUSTRY The tariff will be discussed by the socalled Florence group which includes EU officials government and industry representatives which is due to meet again on November If the voluntary approach does not work Brussels may decide to include provisions on crossborder transmission in a forthcoming directive to speed up the opening of Europes electricity markets Grid operators have proposed a flat charge of two euros per megawatt hour for exports regardless of how many borders the power crosses instead of charging a fee at each frontier The funds from the tariff will be put in a central pot and divided among grid owners to reimburse network transit costs estimated at around million euros a year Traders argue the fee is too expensive and object to the fact the grid companies want to charge it only on new contracts and exempt existing longterm contracts An exportrelated

not understanding the situation said Nigel Evans managing director in Europe for Energy consulting company Caminus The supplydemand fundamentals in Europe are vastly different to California Supply is tighter in Europes fastest growing markets like Spain and Ireland But unlike in California there is no shortage of companies prepared to build new generation I dont think there is any evidence of the system coming under real stress in any European markets said David Smol of UKbased consultants Ilex There is lots of new investment on the block CALIFORNIA POWER PRICES ROCKET The Californian price increases mainly seen on the California Power Exchange have been higher than fundamentals justify said Mark Schroeder a vice president of European government and regulatory affairs at US energy group Enron Prices on the exchange reflect the need to recoup stranded costs rather than true market fundamentals he said The utilities cannot pass the costs on to retail customers because retail rates unlike liberalised wholesale prices are frozen under state deregulation laws Europes deregulation plan contains a staggered timetable of market opening that brings competition ultimately to all consumers from big industrial consumers down to private households But European liberalisation is not problem free Transmission bottlenecks are restricting supply on the borders of France Spain Italy and the Netherlands Prices in Spain and the Netherlands have been forced higher recently as a result of constraints on interconnection much of which is used under longterm supply deals arranged prior to liberalisation Interconnection is a problem but its more about freeing up existing capacity taken up by long term contracts than about building new interconnection said Gassner at OXERA The development of efficient free markets across Europe would enable companies to enter into swaps deals removing the need for physical interconnection Gassner added Folder Name Enron Reuters folder

discriminatory effect and absence of agreement about implementation in Germany are attributable to my briefing of the other journalist Orgill The quoted official is giving the Dominique Ristori a Commission Energy Policy Director of French nationality party line but our victory is attributable to decisions taken in the Cabinet of Loyola de Palacio the Energy Commissioner with whom I intervened on behalf of EFET two weeks ago and who had already been confronted in September by British government objections As such it no longer matters objectively what M Ristori and his spokespersons think about the demise of the euros As you and I discussed yesterday we must now move on rapidly to offer an alternative traders system users solution for establishment of non discriminatory cross border

for single power market suffer setback By Margaret Orgill Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited LONDON Oct Reuters European Union hopes for a single electricity market have suffered a setback after power companies and consumers failed to agree a system for harmonising crossborder transmission tariffs said officials on Thursday Plans to introduce a single tariff for access to the west European grid by November have been postponed because of misgivings particularly from some power producers said a European Union source It seems that we have more problems than expected and the European Commission could have to go for legislation said the official who declined to be named The tariff is a voluntary proposal by western European grid operators to harmonise cross border charges and create a single regional power market The official declined to give more details of the producers doubts but traders are opposed to the fee which they say is too high and will stifle the emerging European power trading market The proposal has also run into legal problems in Germany where its introduction would require changes to an industry agreement on access to the regional electricity grid German consumer bodies are unlikely to accept the new tariff which will add around percent to wholesale power prices The VIK which represents industrial consumers has already written to the Commission saying they will not accept this fee said Einar Vestra managing director of the trading division at Mannheimbased utility MVV TARIFF TO BE DISCUSSED BY EU INDUSTRY The tariff will be discussed by the socalled Florence group which includes EU officials government and industry representatives which is due to meet again on November If the voluntary approach does not work Brussels may decide to include provisions on crossborder transmission in a forthcoming directive to speed up the opening of Europes electricity markets Grid operators have proposed a flat charge of two euros per megawatt hour for exports regardless of how many borders the power crosses instead of charging a fee at each frontier The funds from the tariff will be put in a central pot and divided among grid owners to reimburse network transit costs estimated at around million euros a year Traders argue the fee is too expensive and object to the fact the grid companies want to charge it only on new contracts and exempt existing longterm contracts An exportrelated transmission fee was misconceived in the first place said Peter Styles vice president of European government affairs at US utility Enron The

Obviously Bruno can give more background And I have met the UM people with Philip previously Forwarded by Peter StylesLONECT on PM From Philip UEnronXGate on PM GDT To Paul CT Ross SankeyOENRONOUNACNRECIPIENTSCNNOTESADDRCNBFCCADCCEFF E UEnronXGate cc Bruno UEnronXGate Raphael CT Peter CT Jonathan UEnronXGate Simon CT Subject RE EFET Meeting with the CREGUnion Miniere feedback Ross Paul We had good feedback from Union Miniere on the Belgian situation yesterday Apparently the Febeliec press release on the competitive situation in Belgium went down very badly in the government Febeliec got a letter back saying that the govt was disappointed and unhappy with the letter noting that the govt priorities were the Belgian presidency of the EU the finances of the communes whose finances are of course completely wrapped up with Electrabels extraction of revenues from captive customers and something along the lines of preserving the traditions of Belgian electricity supply Furthermore there are suggestions of veiled threats not from the government directly but from those working closely with govt of retribution taxesenvironmental burdens presumably if Febeliec dont lay off Also confirmed Brunos CREG feedback that border issues are not a priority UM however is going to persist Senior management Marcel Goetstouwers VP of Purchasing Transportation wants us to go back next week and present to him why exactly we cant commit to delivering firm on the Belgian grid next year and what it takes for us to be able to do so He intends to use this material in his upcoming meeting with the Minister We have of course been explaining all along the difficulties but it has taken their recent Belgian tender in response to which they received no offers apart from their Electrabel offer plus our OTM option for him to take the issues seriously UM is also talking again about complaints to the Commission which they may actually do now possibly Our OTM option remains on the table and we can discuss it again after their visit to the Minister Against this background the CREG refusal to meet with Enron is obviously symptomatic of the general attitude of the govt EFET Belgium needs to take this into account in moving forward Bruno why not get some feedback directly and independently from Febeliec and see if it confirms or not UMs report On the test sale to Electrabel on the Belgian grid I will take this forward with Jonathan on his return on Tuesday Following the recent pressureletters from us on the issue to CPTE they had indicated ARP trading on the grid would be in place by July but this has since slipped to Sep or Oct and of course there is no CPTE commitment on paper anyway a promised press release on the subject is probably being saved for the announcement of the nomination of the TS expected July It will be interesting to see if Electrabel still give us a price since there have been CPTEElectrabel discussions on the matter since we raised it Philip Original Message From Mead Paul Sent May To Sankey Ross Cc Gaillard Bruno Davies Philip Brun Raphael Styles Peter Subject Re EFET Meeting with the CREG Elect and Gas Just to clarify we can buy from Electrabel in Belgium but are told we can not SELL to them in Belgium Perhaps an even more crazy situation BTW we intend to challenge this by doing a deal and just submitting a schedule Philip what is the status of this PM Ross CT To Bruno UEnronXGate ENRON cc Paul NRON Philip NRON Raphael NRON Peter NRON Subject Re EFET Meeting with the CREG Elect and Gas OLE Object StdOleLink Bruno As you say not unexpected Were they quoting the govt in terms of their intentions to not open the market How does this approach play in terms of the Belgium presidency As a simple example we face the ludicrous situation that CPTE allows us to wheel power through Belgium from Fr to NL et vv but refuses to allow us to buy from or sell to Electrabel with significant implications for the Dutch as well as Belgium markets given Electrabels strong position in both markets In that this is a cross border issue the EU ie TREN andor COMP should take more interestbut probably only if prodded by the Dutch to conisder it more of a priority and pigs might fly on that one Obviously position of TREN key on this what hot buttons can we press assuming Dutch do nothing Is there action that could be taken or threatened against Electrabel although this would obviously need to be justified by lengthy and difficult abuse investigation or such like Is the reported ElectrabelDistrigas concert another angle to raise with TREMCOMP Could CPTE be fined Regards Ross From Bruno UEnronXGate on To Ross CT Paul CT Philip UEnronXGate Raphael CT cc Peter CT Subject EFET Meeting with the CREG Elect and Gas The meeting yesterday with the CREG was very disappointing although not surprising We met Christine VANDERVEEREN President and Department for dispute settlement Thomas LEKANE Director of the technical operation of the electricity market JeanPaul PINON Director of the technical operation of the gas market and Franois POSSEMIERS Director of gas price control The attitude of Ms VANDERVEEREN was one of resignation and apathy Mr LEKANE was very defensive and did not seem to understand the issues ie did not understand the exchanging of energy blocks M PINON was the only one that seemed proactive open and wiling to listen to market participants and Mr POSSEMIERS did not say anything Electricity We presented the situation no access to markettransit quasi monopoly situation at the detriment to consumers no wholesale and retail market no wholesale trading allowed We insisted that in the short term capacity should be available on a UIOLI bases block exchanges should be put in place ASAP They indicated that only the strict minimum was going to be implemented in the short run In particular at the end of the meeting M Vanderverren told me that the government had no intention of opening up the market for competition and that their only intention was to focus on internal market issues and not border issues to insure the transposition of the directive to fend off the Commissions latest infringement action The CREG is still operating under the we have no power mode The tension between the CREG and the ministry is obvious and politically motivated The CREG gives the impression that they are subject to the ministrys power they are only acting as an administrator for the ministry in providing advice on proposed legislation The CREG continues to claim that they are not able to impose any rules or regulation on CPTE as CPTE is not the nominated TSO They also seem to fend off any offer for us to consult on any issues other than draft decrees and certain indicative plans that are envisage see below Status of TSO designation The TSO should be nominated on All important decrees will be passed by the This includes the grid code tariff related decrees need precisions and a new decree requiring licensing for intermediaries including suppliers and traders Regarding this issue the CREG is against additional licences but see this requirement unavoidable due to political will and asked that we provide them with comments once the proposed decree is available with the condition that there will be very little time to provide for comments Grid Code According to a prior conversation I had with the secretary cabinet the grid code should be issued by the end of June at the latest They are still considering including a concentration process on specific issues EFET will be scheduling a meeting with the cabinet shortly Border capacity allocation It seems that the only change in allocation that they are considering is one that would implement auctions by this what they consider to be the short term solution In the long term Leanne explained that the preferred solution would be market splitting They are not considering any type on UIOLI procedure in the immediate despite our stressing that this should be easily implementable Trading Arrangements We also insisted on the need to implement ASAP block exchange procedures It seemed that Lekane did not understand the issue and implied that his comments on the grid code did not envisage that because of the limited time they had to offer comments to the ministry Again in previous conversation with the energy cabinet they are considering to include that notion and are possibly looking to ask for a formal consultation process Envisaged Consultation Electric Decree on licences Projected demand for the next ten years projected imports exports and transits need for production Gas Projected demand for the next ten years the need for flexibility competition New Grid Code Changes to the existing proposed grid code to incorporate the new law Next steps EFET decided to try meet with the Energy cabinet within two weeks Is Envisaging meeting with Christopher Jones by the end of the month Enron is continuing to actively talk with the Energy Cabinet next issue to discuss are UIOLI capacity allocation trading arrangements June Meeting with DGTREN to expose barriers in BE market At the end of the CREG meeting I asked that they meet with Enron and the responded that they did not have the time Bruno

Obviously Bruno can give more background And I have met the UM people with Philip previously Forwarded by Peter StylesLONECT on PM From Philip UEnronXGate on PM GDT To Paul CT Ross SankeyOENRONOUNACNRECIPIENTSCNNOTESADDRCNBFCCADCCEFF E UEnronXGate cc Bruno UEnronXGate Raphael CT Peter CT Jonathan UEnronXGate Simon CT Subject RE EFET Meeting with the CREGUnion Miniere feedback Ross Paul We had good feedback from Union Miniere on the Belgian situation yesterday Apparently the Febeliec press release on the competitive situation in Belgium went down very badly in the government Febeliec got a letter back saying that the govt was disappointed and unhappy with the letter noting that the govt priorities were the Belgian presidency of the EU the finances of the communes whose finances are of course completely wrapped up with Electrabels extraction of revenues from captive customers and something along the lines of preserving the traditions of Belgian electricity supply Furthermore there are suggestions of veiled threats not from the government directly but from those working closely with govt of retribution taxesenvironmental burdens presumably if Febeliec dont lay off Also confirmed Brunos CREG feedback that border issues are not a priority UM however is going to persist Senior management Marcel Goetstouwers VP of Purchasing Transportation wants us to go back next week and present to him why exactly we cant commit to delivering firm on the Belgian grid next year and what it takes for us to be able to do so He intends to use this material in his upcoming meeting with the Minister We have of course been explaining all along the difficulties but it has taken their recent Belgian tender in response to which they received no offers apart from their Electrabel offer plus our OTM option for him to take the issues seriously UM is also talking again about complaints to the Commission which they may actually do now possibly Our OTM option remains on the table and we can discuss it again after their visit to the Minister Against this background the CREG refusal to meet with Enron is obviously symptomatic of the general attitude of the govt EFET Belgium needs to take this into account in moving forward Bruno why not get some feedback directly and independently from Febeliec and see if it confirms or not UMs report On the test sale to Electrabel on the Belgian grid I will take this forward with Jonathan on his return on Tuesday Following the recent pressureletters from us on the issue to CPTE they had indicated ARP trading on the grid would be in place by July but this has since slipped to Sep or Oct and of course there is no CPTE commitment on paper anyway a promised press release on the subject is probably being saved for the announcement of the nomination of the TS expected July It will be interesting to see if Electrabel still give us a price since there have been CPTEElectrabel discussions on the matter since we raised it Philip Original Message From Mead Paul Sent May To Sankey Ross Cc Gaillard Bruno Davies Philip Brun Raphael Styles Peter Subject Re EFET Meeting with the CREG Elect and Gas Just to clarify we can buy from Electrabel in Belgium but are told we can not SELL to them in Belgium Perhaps an even more crazy situation BTW we intend to challenge this by doing a deal and just submitting a schedule Philip what is the status of this PM Ross CT To Bruno UEnronXGate ENRON cc Paul NRON Philip NRON Raphael NRON Peter NRON Subject Re EFET Meeting with the CREG Elect and Gas OLE Object StdOleLink Bruno As you say not unexpected Were they quoting the govt in terms of their intentions to not open the market How does this approach play in terms of the Belgium presidency As a simple example we face the ludicrous situation that CPTE allows us to wheel power through Belgium from Fr to NL et vv but refuses to allow us to buy from or sell to Electrabel with significant implications for the Dutch as well as Belgium markets given Electrabels strong position in both markets In that this is a cross border issue the EU ie TREN andor COMP should take more interestbut probably only if prodded by the Dutch to conisder it more of a priority and pigs might fly on that one Obviously position of TREN key on this what hot buttons can we press assuming Dutch do nothing Is there action that could be taken or threatened against Electrabel although this would obviously need to be justified by lengthy and difficult abuse investigation or such like Is the reported ElectrabelDistrigas concert another angle to raise with TREMCOMP Could CPTE be fined Regards Ross From Bruno UEnronXGate on To Ross CT Paul CT Philip UEnronXGate Raphael CT cc Peter CT Subject EFET Meeting with the CREG Elect and Gas The meeting yesterday with the CREG was very disappointing although not surprising We met Christine VANDERVEEREN President and Department for dispute settlement Thomas LEKANE Director of the technical operation of the electricity market JeanPaul PINON Director of the technical operation of the gas market and Franois POSSEMIERS Director of gas price control The attitude of Ms VANDERVEEREN was one of resignation and apathy Mr LEKANE was very defensive and did not seem to understand the issues ie did not understand the exchanging of energy blocks M PINON was the only one that seemed proactive open and wiling to listen to market participants and Mr POSSEMIERS did not say anything Electricity We presented the situation no access to markettransit quasi monopoly situation at the detriment to consumers no wholesale and retail market no wholesale trading allowed We insisted that in the short term capacity should be available on a UIOLI bases block exchanges should be put in place ASAP They indicated that only the strict minimum was going to be implemented in the short run In particular at the end of the meeting M Vanderverren told me that the government had no intention of opening up the market for competition and that their only intention was to focus on internal market issues and not border issues to insure the transposition of the directive to fend off the Commissions latest infringement action The CREG is still operating under the we have no power mode The tension between the CREG and the ministry is obvious and politically motivated The CREG gives the impression that they are subject to the ministrys power they are only acting as an administrator for the ministry in providing advice on proposed legislation The CREG continues to claim that they are not able to impose any rules or regulation on CPTE as CPTE is not the nominated TSO They also seem to fend off any offer for us to consult on any issues other than draft decrees and certain indicative plans that are envisage see below Status of TSO designation The TSO should be nominated on All important decrees will be passed by the This includes the grid code tariff related decrees need precisions and a new decree requiring licensing for intermediaries including suppliers and traders Regarding this issue the CREG is against additional licences but see this requirement unavoidable due to political will and asked that we provide them with comments once the proposed decree is available with the condition that there will be very little time to provide for comments Grid Code According to a prior conversation I had with the secretary cabinet the grid code should be issued by the end of June at the latest They are still considering including a concentration process on specific issues EFET will be scheduling a meeting with the cabinet shortly Border capacity allocation It seems that the only change in allocation that they are considering is one that would implement auctions by this what they consider to be the short term solution In the long term Leanne explained that the preferred solution would be market splitting They are not considering any type on UIOLI procedure in the immediate despite our stressing that this should be easily implementable Trading Arrangements We also insisted on the need to implement ASAP block exchange procedures It seemed that Lekane did not understand the issue and implied that his comments on the grid code did not envisage that because of the limited time they had to offer comments to the ministry Again in previous conversation with the energy cabinet they are considering to include that notion and are possibly looking to ask for a formal consultation process Envisaged Consultation Electric Decree on licences Projected demand for the next ten years projected imports exports and transits need for production Gas Projected demand for the next ten years the need for flexibility competition New Grid Code Changes to the existing proposed grid code to incorporate the new law Next steps EFET decided to try meet with the Energy cabinet within two weeks Is Envisaging meeting with Christopher Jones by the end of the month Enron is continuing to actively talk with the Energy Cabinet next issue to discuss are UIOLI capacity allocation trading arrangements June Meeting with DGTREN to expose barriers in BE market At the end of the CREG meeting I asked that they meet with Enron and the responded that they did not have the time Bruno

Ross Paul We had good feedback from Union Miniere on the Belgian situation yesterday Apparently the Febeliec press release on the competitive situation in Belgium went down very badly in the government Febeliec got a letter back saying that the govt was disappointed and unhappy with the letter noting that the govt priorities were the Belgian presidency of the EU the finances of the communes whose finances are of course completely wrapped up with Electrabels extraction of revenues from captive customers and something along the lines of preserving the traditions of Belgian electricity supply Furthermore there are suggestions of veiled threats not from the government directly but from those working closely with govt of retribution taxesenvironmental burdens presumably if Febeliec dont lay off Also confirmed Brunos CREG feedback that border issues are not a priority UM however is going to persist Senior management Marcel Goetstouwers VP of Purchasing Transportation wants us to go back next week and present to him why exactly we cant commit to delivering firm on the Belgian grid next year and what it takes for us to be able to do so He intends to use this material in his upcoming meeting with the Minister We have of course been explaining all along the difficulties but it has taken their recent Belgian tender in response to which they received no offers apart from their Electrabel offer plus our OTM option for him to take the issues seriously UM is also talking again about complaints to the Commission which they may actually do now possibly Our OTM option remains on the table and we can discuss it again after their visit to the Minister Against this background the CREG refusal to meet with Enron is obviously symptomatic of the general attitude of the govt EFET Belgium needs to take this into account in moving forward Bruno why not get some feedback directly and independently from Febeliec and see if it confirms or not UMs report On the test sale to Electrabel on the Belgian grid I will take this forward with Jonathan on his return on Tuesday Following the recent pressureletters from us on the issue to CPTE they had indicated ARP trading on the grid would be in place by July but this has since slipped to Sep or Oct and of course there is no CPTE commitment on paper anyway a promised press release on the subject is probably being saved for the announcement of the nomination of the TS expected July It will be interesting to see if Electrabel still give us a price since there have been CPTEElectrabel discussions on the

implications for the Dutch as well as Belgium markets given Electrabels strong position in both markets In that this is a cross border issue the EU ie TREN andor COMP should take more interestbut probably only if prodded by the Dutch to conisder it more of a priority and pigs might fly on that one Obviously position of TREN key on this what hot buttons can we press assuming Dutch do nothing Is there action that could be taken or threatened against Electrabel although this would obviously need to be justified by lengthy and difficult abuse investigation or such like Is the reported

Meeting with the CREG Elect and Gas The meeting yesterday with the CREG was very disappointing although not surprising We met Christine VANDERVEEREN President and Department for dispute settlement Thomas LEKANE Director of the technical operation of the electricity market JeanPaul PINON Director of the technical operation of the gas market and Franois POSSEMIERS Director of gas price control The attitude of Ms VANDERVEEREN was one of resignation and apathy Mr LEKANE was very defensive and did not seem to understand the issues ie did not understand the exchanging of energy blocks M PINON was the only one that seemed proactive open and wiling to listen to market participants and Mr POSSEMIERS did not say anything Electricity We presented the situation no access to markettransit quasi monopoly situation at the detriment to consumers no wholesale and retail market no wholesale trading allowed We insisted that in the short term capacity should be available on a UIOLI bases block exchanges should be put in place ASAP They indicated that only the strict minimum was going to be implemented in the short run In particular at the end of the meeting M Vanderverren told me that the government had no intention of opening up the market for competition and that their only intention was to focus on internal market issues and not border issues to insure the transposition of the directive to fend off the Commissions latest infringement action The CREG is still operating under the we have no power mode The tension between the CREG and the ministry is obvious and politically motivated The CREG gives the impression that they are subject to the ministrys power they are only acting as an administrator for the ministry in providing advice on proposed legislation The CREG continues to claim that they are not able to impose any rules or regulation on CPTE as CPTE is not the nominated TSO They also seem to fend off any offer for us to consult on any issues other than draft decrees and certain indicative plans that are envisage see below Status of TSO designation The TSO should be nominated on All important decrees will be passed by the This includes the grid code tariff related decrees need precisions and a new decree requiring licensing for intermediaries including suppliers and traders Regarding this issue the CREG is against additional licences but see this requirement unavoidable due to political will and asked that we provide them with comments once the proposed decree is available with the condition that there will be very little time to provide for comments Grid Code According to a prior conversation I had with the secretary cabinet the grid code should be issued by the end of June at the latest They are still considering including a concentration process on specific issues EFET will be scheduling a meeting with the cabinet shortly Border capacity allocation It seems that the only change in allocation that they are considering is one that would implement auctions by this what they consider to be the short term solution In the long term Leanne explained that the preferred solution would be market splitting They are not considering any type on UIOLI procedure in the immediate despite our stressing that this should be easily implementable Trading Arrangements We also insisted on the need to implement ASAP block exchange procedures It seemed that Lekane did not understand the issue and implied that his comments on the grid code did not envisage that because of the limited time they had to offer comments to the ministry Again in previous conversation with the energy cabinet they are considering to include that notion and are possibly looking to ask for a formal consultation process Envisaged Consultation Electric Decree on licences Projected demand for the next ten years projected imports exports and transits need for production Gas Projected demand for the next ten years the need for flexibility competition New Grid Code Changes to the existing proposed grid code to incorporate the new law Next steps EFET decided to try meet with the Energy cabinet within two weeks Is Envisaging meeting with Christopher Jones by the end of the month Enron is continuing to actively talk with the Energy Cabinet next issue to discuss are UIOLI capacity allocation trading arrangements June Meeting with DGTREN
