From ENRON mailtoIMCEANOTESjamesEdotybakerbottsEcom NRONcom Sent Thursday March AM To Subject SEC Chairmanship and James R Doty Mark If this is not what you had in mind let me know I have tried to give you some detail to back up my claim that I can provided muchneeded stature and leadership to the SEC I am also addressing what I think may be some of the objections of constituencies in the corporate and financial community who have I believe told the Administration not to appoint a lawyer and former member of the Staff of the SEC Of course Arthur Levitt was not a lawyer and was a former head of the Amex and has rammed through one of the mose activist regulatory programs in SEC history So what I am offering in part is balance and respect for process The President has the opportunity by appointing Jim Doty to get the SEC headed in a direction the corporate and financial community wants and to do so with broad indeed enthusiastic support from the agency itself the corporate and securities bar the accounting profession and other constituencies including the NASDAQ the NYSE members of the Congressional oversight committees and their staff on both sides of the aisle Doty knows securities markets and practices through his work for securities firms and is well aware of the issues of market structure that will face the new Chairmanin this he favors continuing to encourage competition and technological innovation in the markets and is committed to keeping our capital markets the best in the world He understands the problems the accounting profession and the standardsetting bodies are facingincluding international accounting standard issuesand is well equipped to be sure the private standard setting regime we have relied on works well and with sensitivity to current realities He will not be a grenade thrower on the complex poolingpurchase issues now confronting the SEC and the FASB Here it will be particularly important that the next Chariman give the FASB proposals on impairment of goodwill in purchase transactions a fair hearing and not attempt to strong arm the private standard setters into a requiring accelerated depreciation of goodwill this is especially critical given the fragile state of the technology sector Doty has spent his career advising boards of directors and senior management on the practical problems businessmen face in dealing with the SEC He will bring to the job handson experience working with the business communitycorporate and financial in solving the problems they face in raising capital and complying with securities regulatory regimesState Federal and crossborder Doty has a national reputation as a corporate and securities law expert has published and is in demand as a speaker As a practicing lawyer however Doty would bring some extraordinary qualifications to the job of running the SEC which are as folows a His record as General Counsel of the SEC from demonstrates an understanding of how to work effectively in governmnet Doty has the respect of the Staff and will bring credibility within the building to accomplish needed reform During his tenure as the SECs General Counsel with a Democratic majority in Congress he had a major role in reform initiatives to reduce costs of raising capital and streamline the financial regulatory structure under President George HWBush These included the Small Business Initiative which reduced costs for small and firsttime registrants and structured finance initiatives to provide more efficient access to capital markets for seasoned issuers b Doty is committed to using the exemptive authority under the Securities Act of to promote more efficiency and lower costs in the capitalformation process He knows where additional exemptive
