HAJOVSKY Home in the Heights After more than a year of work the Houston Heights Associations board of directors last month accepted a set of proposed revisions to the Heights deed restrictions The revisions are intended to severely curtail prospective townhome and other new construction considered by the association to be inappropriate to the historic nature and character of the area Just over percent of Houston Heights properties are currently protected by the deed restriction documents first drafted by the association more than years ago The updates are necessary in order to keep pace with current threats to the neighborhood according to association President Allan Tiller When the restriction documents were first drafted the perceived threat was from commercial intrusion having a business set up next to your home he said Now with the rise in property values thats not as much of a threat What is a threat is the possibility that townhomes with their canyons of garage doors up and down the street will replace the essential character of the neighborhood with a level of density that is inappropriate Tiller is not dismayed by the fact that after two decades of work only a minority of area homeowners have signed on Certainly we want this to extend to everyone in the neighborhood and were working to do that he said But just the fact that you have it and its publicized means that it becomes kind of a guideline for the neighborhood and builders and developers are still reluctant to go in and change that or build anything contrary to that Thats been my experience The proposed revisions deal with eight major areas in new construction dealing with design density and placement but not use of properties Setbacks A house or structure would have to leave at least three feet increased from the current two on the sides three feet from the back and feet from the front Corner lots would have the foot setback apply on both sides facing a street similar to the citys foot front setback rule Frontfacing construction Any new house will have to face the street rather than a common private driveway to prevent multipleunit compoundtype construction Common wall construction Although the association board feels that the setback rules should generally prevent commonwall construction two units sharing a common exterior wall this provision was put in to help ensure that the prohibition is not circumvented by multipleunit construction on a single lot such as apartments Garage setback The new restrictions would require that any garage facing the street be set back at least halfway to the back lot line and in any event be no closer to the street than the front of the house itself This is the case throughout the Heights currently where garages are generally unseen from the street as opposed to the newer townhome styles found throughout the Montrose area and the West End near Memorial Park Garagedominated front A new provision would mandate that a frontfacing garage door could not take up more than a half of the firstfloor front of the house a direct blow at the most common townhome styles Raised foundations Preserving another dominant characteristic of home construction in the Heights the new restrictions would require either pierandbeam construction or other foundation construction that would raise the bottom floor of the house at least feet from the ground There are currently no townhome styles in Montrose or the West End that have raised construction of any kind Height restrictions The revisions would retain the current height restriction of feet except that for lots of width greater than feet the limit would go up an additional foot for every feet of additional setback from the nearest lot line The point of this is to maintain the general Heights practice of no more than two stories in a single family dwelling Density and lot width The minimum lot size would be increased from one residence per every square feet to one per every square feet and there would be a minimum frontage of feet for each lot This would essentially establish a minimum lot size of feet by feet This would represent a major break from the past When the Heights was originally laid out in the s lots were considered to be generally no wider than feet and houses occupied two or more of these lots However throughout the area examples abound of homes constructed on footwide lots only Recognizing that situation there would be two important exceptions to the new density and lot width requirements First garage apartments would not be treated as residences for this purpose Second lots of smaller frontage or size with existing houses as of the date of adoption of the revisions or other fixed date to be determined would be grandfathered That is their size would be treated as conforming to the deed restrictions A bracketed bill enacted by the Texas Legislature in applying only to the Heights created a means by which the deed restrictions could be changed setting the stage for these revisions However the alteration process is something that in itself could take many months according to Tiller There are three methods by which the restrictions can be changed according to the bracketed law First a ballot could be mailed or delivered to each qualified property owner that is those who have already signed the deed restriction documents Adoption of the revisions would require an affirmative vote of percent of those submitting a ballot Second a petition could be mailed or otherwise sent out to all signedon owners Adoption would require the signature of percent of the owners The third and as Tiller pointed out by far the easiest method would be to call a meeting of signedon property owners Adoption would require the affirmative vote of percent of those attending the meeting Obviously what we would prefer to do is to hold the meeting because its the easiest thing to do he said We would send out the notice to everyone see who shows up and pretty much do it all in one fell swoop Also the group that would be most excited about the issue would be those attending the meeting However Tiller said that no one on the board or the associations Land Use Committee which originally drafted the proposed revisions wants to enact any change to any document without ensuring that the entire community supports such a move The number one priority is to build a consensus of support for the proposals he said We are in the public education phase of the campaign Before theres any kind of vote taken theres going to be a mailer to everyone that we have on our list who own deed restricted properties Thats going to be a hassle trying to track all those people down but we need to do that The statute requires that notice be sent to all restricted property owners What steps do you need to take in order to satisfy that Well take every practical step we can and well record we did that But thats another technical issue we have to deal with First and foremost our goal is finding out whether or not we have the consensus to do this Tiller did acknowledge the difficulty inherent in building that consensus with the associations allvolunteer work force With the petition its my understanding youd need percent of everyone he said That appeals to me because that means weve got as broad a consensus as possible But thats a lot of work With an allvolunteer process that might be too much In any event well be sending out a notice to everyone probably more than once The technical issues of presenting the proposals to the neighborhood have to be worked out Protecting the historic quality of the neighborhood Tiller said is the main goal of the restriction documents As such it coincides with a similar effort to seek historic district status from the city of Houston an effort that still hasnt yet gotten off the ground in the Houston Heights despite the awarding of the status to the neighboring community of Norhill to the east Tiller acknowledged the similarities in goals but noted that the deed restrictions have a much tighter focus The deed restrictions really apply to new construction rather than preserving whats already on the ground he said We could have extended it to preserving issues as well but we did not want to overload this particular issue of stopping townhouse construction with the preservation issue as well It will be a similar process building a consensus and going to the homeowners to do that Here initially we have a much more limited group we have to address though which is the qualified property owners The Houston Heights Association board of directors will focus on this issue at its next meeting to be held at pm Oct at the Fire Station at the corner of West th and Yale
