Washington today Al Gore called for Social Security reform that preserves the basic guarantee of retirement security The Gore plan will keep Social Security solvent through at least while Bush is pushing a risky privatization scheme Under the Bush plan poor investment choices by some individuals or a downturn in the stock market could force taxpayers to bailout those who lost money GORE MEETS WITH SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT THABO MBEKI At a State Department luncheon Al Gore met with South African President Thabo Mbeki to discuss trade the AIDS epidemic and other concerns with the African subcontinent Gore has proposed strengthening economic engagement with Africa which will lead to greater prosperity and international security George Bush however takes a dim view of Africa stating Africa doesnt fit into the national strategic interests as far as I can seen them PBS NewsHour THE NRA GUNS FOR THE PRESIDENCY Meeting in Charlotte this weekend Charlton Heston fired up the faithful

explaining he has spent his life being rescued for his familys rich friends from one failed business deal after another Among Kauls criticisms of Mr Bush Texas ranks near the tops of the charts in every bad category poverty rates teen pregnancies people without insurance air pollution executions Texas ranks near the bottom in all the good categories the environment public health parks and recreation highways and support for the arts The one place where Bush has shown leadership is in working tirelessly to cut state taxes of the welltodo He has protected the oil refiners which dump million tons of pollution into the Texas air annually He pushed a billion property tax cut despite the fact that Texas schools are starved for cash I Support Al Gore for President Paid for by Gore Inc

NYT Herbert Are You Feeling Lucky BUSHS SOCIAL SECURITY PLAN WOULD HURT WOMEN Women Would Be the Largest Group of Losers Under Privatization John Mueller the Senior Vice President and Chief Economist of Lehrman Bell Mueller Cannon Inc and former adviser to Rep Jack Kemp testified before the House Social Security Subcommittee that the largest group of losers from privatizing Social Security would be women This is true for women in all birthyears all kinds of marital status all kinds of labormarket behavior and all income levels Privatization Plans Exacerbate the Already Unequal Distribution of Retirement Benefits According to the statement of Jane Ross Director of Income Security issues at the US General Accounting Office GAO Social Security reform plans that incorporate private accounts exacerbate the already unequal distribution of retirement benefits under Social Security Social Security Reform Implications for the Financial WellBeing of Women Statement of Jane L Ross GAO Privatization Plans a Threat to Womens LongTerm Security Privatization would transform todays guaranteed retirement benefits into a risky program that could threaten womens retirement security since women are more likely to rely on Social Security for their primary source of retirement benefits Women rely on Social Security because half of all women work in jobs that dont offer pensions women retirees with pensions receive half the average pensions benefits that men collect nearly three out of four women earn less than a year Women Retirement Security An Overview WISER Viewpoint Legislative Agenda for the th Congress Social Security Privatization National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare Women and Retirement Security wwwssagov HERBERT FROM TODAYS NYT DO YOU FEEL LUCKY Bob Herbert today deconstructed the various arguments for why Bushs privatization scheme is too risky Even his chief economic advisor doesnt trust the market Mr Lindsey who strongly favors Mr Bushs proposed trillion tax cut and argues that it would provide a needed economic stimulus has warned his private clients of a potential stock market tailspin that could lead to a recession He said he sold his own stocks about two years ago so he would be able to sleep at night Mr Bush told the nation that the key to saving Social Security retirement benefits was to allow working Americans to invest a portion of their Social Security taxes in the very same stock market that Mr Lindsey at the moment wants no part of Herbert also questioned Bushs motives noting that Bushs Wall Street contributors would make out like bandits under his plan There is however a group of guaranteed winners under Mr Bushs plan the movers and shakers at the big brokerage houses who have been funneling many millions of dollars into the campaign coffers of Mr Bush and other politicians just begging them to steer some of the hundreds of billions of dollars in Social Security taxes their way Everyone who sells stocks or mutual funds stands to benefit from this welfare scheme for the notsoidle rich He explained the chronology of Republicans trying to do away with Social Security Face it the Republicans have had it in for Social Security since its inception The historian William Manchester wrote about the GOPs desperate efforts in to block its creation On radio spots actors hired by the Republican National Committee revealed in shocked tones that each man would be given a number as though there were any other way to keep track of Social Security accounts and perpetrated the hoax that people would be fingerprinted When the Republicans won control of Congress in party leaders called for the repeal of Social Security And nearly four decades later Governor Bushs fellow Texan Senator Phil Gramm could be quoted as follows on the question of eliminating minimum benefits for the elderly They are yearolds Most people dont have the luxury of living to be years old so its hard for me to feel sorry for them I Support Al Gore for President Paid for by Gore Inc Nashville TN Contributions to Gore Inc are not tax deductible for Federal income tax purposes I Support Al Gore for President

challenged George W Bush to hold a debate as soon as possible on their competing Social Security proposals Gore has called for Social Security reform based not on stock market speculation but on fiscal responsibility and debt reduction Bush is pushing the partial privatization of Social Security but has provided no specific details BUSH WOULD COMPLETELY PRIVATIZE SOCIAL SECURITY George Bush has revealed that his secret plan for Social Security is an attempt to completely dismantle and privatize the year system of social insurance according to reports in the New York Times the Associated Press and the Houston Chronicle The Chronicle reports that Republican presidential candidate George W Bush on Tuesday said his plan to create private savings accounts could be the first step toward a complete privatization of Social Security Its going to take a while to transition to a system where personal savings accounts are the predominant part of the investment vehicle Bush said This is a step toward a completely different world and an important step Bush admits that the individual private accounts are but the first step in his larger plan to privatize the program This may be good for the stockbrokers who have poured million into his Presidential campaign but it is a horrible deal for America BUSH PLAN PANNED IN THE PRESS Bushs privatization plan has come under fire from responsible journalists and editorial pages across the country A New York Daily News editorial writes On the future of Social Security the presidential candidates have offered stark choices Bush would destroy the program Gore would save it Easy choice Paul Krugman addresses the current concern about the stock market being overvalued at present If you think that stocks are currently overpriced this

itself under intense pressure to bail out the baby boomers TEXAS ALTERNATIVE TO SOCIAL SECURITY HURTS RETIREES The Baltimore Sun today revealed that three Texas counties which opted out of the Social Security system in the early s in favor of private investments According to the Sun many of the counties employees especially low to middleincome workers will actually earn less money than if they had stuck with Social Security While wealthier workers might have done better under privatization middle and lowwage workers did significantly worse According to a GAO report a lowwage County employee working for years would earn a month under Social Security but as little as under the privatized plan So much for Bushs plan to help poorer Americans I Support Al Gore for President Paid for by Gore
