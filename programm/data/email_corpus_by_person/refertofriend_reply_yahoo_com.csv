Related Quotes EPG P WMB delayed mins disclaimer Quote Data provided by Reuters Thursday October am Eastern Time Rockies seen as key to US natural gas growth By Andrew Kelly HOUSTON Oct Reuters As US natural gas production declines in traditional strongholds such as Texas and the Gulf of Mexico the Rocky Mountains are widely viewed as the best bet for boosting domestic supplies to meet rising demand for gas The Rockies have loomed large in several recent US energy industry acquisitions as companies bet that they will be able to overcome technical obstacles and environmental opposition to unlock the regions rich reserve potential Most of the supply growth in the United States has been disappointing but weve seen extremely strong growth in the Rockies said Jennifer Snyder Director of North American Natural Gas at Cambridge Energy Research Associates CERA The Rockies could contain over trillion cubic feet of recoverable reserves or almost one quarter of all onshore and offshore reserves in the lower states according to a report by the National Petroleum Council However not everybody wants to tap that hydrocarbon wealth The Montana Wilderness Organization for example is campaigning to keep the Rocky Mountain Front recognized as an important wildlife habitat closed to oil and gas drilling This is one of Americas national treasures and one of our greatest conservation stories To try to undo that for a small amount of natural gas doesnt make a lot of sense said Mark Good a field organizer with the association POWER GENERATION DRIVES GROWTH US gas consumption rose five percent to trillion cubic feet in and despite current concerns about the weak economy further growth is forecast in the long term driven largely by increased use of the cleanburning fuel to generate electricity Until quite recently there was scant interest in Rockies gas because it was tough to get at prices were low and there were not enough pipelines to take the gas to market according to Fred Meissner a petroleum geologist at the Colorado School of Mines But that has changed as the environmental benefits of gas and the development of efficient new combinedcycle gas turbines have spurred increased use of the fuel for power generation The lack of pipeline capacity in the Rockies has also eased as big companies such as Williams Cos NYSEWMB news and El Paso Corp NYSEEPG news have committed themselves to expansion projects Phillips Petroleum CoNYSEP news gained a foothold in the Rockies by buying gas assets in Wyomings Powder River Basin last year If you look at total US production to reserves its a decline story but its exactly the opposite in the Rockies said Don Wallette Phillips regional director in the Rockies Rocky Mountain gas was also a key driver behind KerrMcGee Corps NYSEKMG news recent acquisition of HS Resources Oil giant Royal DutchShell quote from Yahoo UK Ireland SHELL launched a hostile takeover bid for Rockies gas producer Barrett Resources this year but was thwarted when its offer topped by Williams Cos TAPPING UNCONVENTIONAL GAS Interest in the Rockies has been spurred in part by technologies that allow unconventional gas resources such as coalbed methane to be exploited economically Coal can hold several times as much gas as the rock in conventional reservoirs and it can be extracted by drilling relatively shallow wells into the coal seam then releasing the gas by pumping out large volumes of water First seen on a meaningful scale in the San Juan basin of New Mexico and Colorado in the s coal bed methane development has spread in recent years to the Raton basin in Colorado and the Green River and Powder River basins in Wyoming The beauty of coalbed methane is that you dont have to discover it so you eliminate a lot of the traditional risk It isnt very expensive compared to setting up an exploration effort offshore said Wallette of Phillips Petroleum Coalbed methane draws considerably less enthusiasm from environmentalists who are concerned by the Bush administrations plans to open more federal land in the Rockies to drilling Pollution problems associated with the disposal of saline water released as a byproduct of coalbed methane production have led to protests in some Rockies communities Another unconventional resource that can be tapped in the Rockies is tight gas found deep below the earths surface in low permeability sandstone that restricts the flow of the gas A few years ago people became aware that there is a lot of gas in these very tight Cretaceous sands but the economics were minimal because you couldnt get it out economically Hydraulic fracturing turned that around said Professor Meissner Fracturing involves injecting a fluid into a rock formation causing it to crack and making it easier for the gas to flow Phillips is mainly focusing on coalbed methane in the Rockies but has drilled some tight gas wells in Utah said Wallette Email this story Mostemailed articles
