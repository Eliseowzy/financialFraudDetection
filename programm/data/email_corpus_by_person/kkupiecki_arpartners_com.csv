hope you dont mind GHANA Monetary Policy Ghana has a new central bank governor Kwabena Duffour who is focused on tightening the money supply shifting govenment sector accounts from commercial banks who charged rates to the gov to the Bank of Ghana this had the effect of reducing the money supply which helped keep the currency from sliding too much against the dollar instead of the typical Fiscal Policy Ghana is currently investing governement and forein investment in infrastructure projects The govenment has kept borrowing and inflation down under pressure from the IMF UE I could not find the UE rate but Ghana suffers from a lack of high skilled workers they are lacking in human capital so I suspect the UE rate is low I will keep looking GDP Growth Decreased slightly from levels projection for is ExhangeCurrency Currency is the Cidi which has been slipping against the dollar since current nominal rate Cidi to the dollar Inflation around Trade Ghana is one of Africas leading countries on free trade Their main exports are commodities cocoa gold Trade balance is negative and the trend is towards a larger negative number deficit USM Ghana has not changed their export profile in years They rely heavily upon energy imports and their economy is very sensitive to oil prices Polictial Events President elected every four years by popular vote cabinet style minstry Tension exists between Aglophone and Francophone countries in Africa which creates risk aversion to foreign investment Ghanas economy is linked to Nigeria which has experienced political instability if Nigeria takes off so will Ghana IRELAND Monetary Policy EU policy no control over its own monetary policy Fiscal Policy Investment in human capital want to improve the quality of the work force stay in school policy is aimed to alleviate tight labour market Investment in infrastructure Aging work force is triggering the government to increase pension fund provisions UE GDP Growth much higher than most other EU Zone countries ExchangeCurrencySterling is the currency of Irelands main trading partner England If this currency depreciates England will import less Irish goods because the price will be too high This decreases Irelands exports to England and reduces this source of income Inflation Trade Main trading partner is England Ireland is moving into electronics Dell and ecommerce Political Events Continuing NorthSouth conflict ADDITIONAL NOTES ON GHANA Efforts to increase Growth Ghana is encouraging a private sector role in developing infrastructure toll roads water port handling Ghana is encouraging outside investment in the country be positioning itself as the gateway to Africa Ghana is increasing the percentage of equity investment in pension funds from Ghana is amending securities law allowing the creation of investment vehicles such as unit trusts The new central bank governor Kwabena Duffour shifted government sector accounts from commercial banks who charged rates to the gov to the Bank of Ghana this had the effect of reducing the money supply which helped keep the currency from sliding too much against the dollar instead of the typical The government has kept borrowing and inflation down under pressure from the IMF Central Bank has promoted a repurchase strategy to tie up excess liquidity this will also tighten the money supply What Ghana still needs to do or still can do to increase growth The government needs to reduce interest rates to spur investment The government needs to speed up the privatization of stateowned enterprises oil cocoa privatization will allow these industries to operate more efficiently and competitively Ghana can do more to encourage investment from abroad by working with neighboring countries to create a politically stable environment The country could offer incentives for foreign investment could invest in the countrys human capital through training of relevant skills Step up infrastructure projects make this a very high priority most wealthy countries have a solid infrastructure Target the margin for savings and investment policies example investment tax breaks tax breaks for saving based on income Diversify sources of income which are not so prone to commodity price effects Government can take longterm loans from investors transforming shortterm into long term since Ghana is so dependant on foreign oil prices in the long term they can reduce their dependence by developingemploying energy saving processes Offer more support for industry subsidies lower interest rates Facts on Ghana Main GDP contributors Services Agriculture Industry Heavy reliance on commodity products Cocoa Gold Sensitive to fuel costs Government has lost reserves there is concern that if the government spends more that it has inflation will result There have been complaints that the government is too soft Ghanas sources of income have not changed for over years ADDITIONAL NOTES ON IRELAND Efforts to increase growth Encourage continuing education to alleviate tight labour force stay in school policy What Ireland still needs to do or still can do to increase growth improve infrastructure public services index welfare to wages increasing the use of the Internet in schools and businesses increasing ecommerce establishing the country as a worldclass site for ecommerce Facts on Ireland Economy is growing faster than main trading partners More education from university to university in years Why does Ireland fear a weak British pound according to FT Sterling is the currency of Irelands main trading partner England If this currency depreciates England will import less Irish goods because the price will be too high This decreases Irelands exports to England and reduces this source of income Why does ECB interest rate policy not match Irelands needs Does this mismatch mean joining the Eurozone was a bad idea Irelands economic growth is much higher than other EU nations but it only contributes about of the Eurozone economy this means it does not have much say in interest rate policy What is good for Germanys growth with their UE and growth may not be good for Ireland with UE and growth if ECB reduces interest rates to simulate growth in the Eurozone it may cause inflation in Ireland At PM Jonathan Hudacko wrote Aaron Mednelson Email aasBerkeleyEDU Aiaz Kazi Email aasBerkeleyEDU

<24518353.1075843089742.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,kkupiecki@arpartners.com,1999-12-08 08:54:00,IrelandGhana Cc Team I have attached country information on Ireland and Ghana it is not in the special format hope you dont mind GHANA Monetary Policy Ghana has a new central bank governor Kwabena Duffour who is focused on tightening the money supply shifting govenment sector accounts from commercial banks who charged rates to the gov to the Bank of Ghana this had the effect of reducing the money supply which helped keep the currency from sliding too much against the dollar instead of the typical Fiscal Policy Ghana is currently investing governement and forein investment in infrastructure projects The govenment has kept borrowing and inflation down under pressure from the IMF UE I could not find the UE rate but Ghana suffers from a lack of high skilled workers they are lacking in human capital so I suspect the UE rate is low I will keep looking GDP Growth Decreased slightly from levels projection for is ExhangeCurrency Currency is the Cidi which has been slipping against the dollar since current nominal rate Cidi to the dollar Inflation around Trade Ghana is one of Africas leading countries on free trade Their main exports are commodities cocoa gold Trade balance is negative and the trend is towards a larger negative number deficit USM Ghana has not changed their export profile in years They rely heavily upon energy imports and their economy is very sensitive to oil prices Polictial Events President elected every four years by popular vote cabinet style minstry Tension exists between Aglophone and Francophone countries in Africa which creates risk aversion to foreign investment Ghanas economy is linked to Nigeria which has experienced political instability if Nigeria takes off so will Ghana IRELAND Monetary Policy EU policy no control over its own monetary policy Fiscal Policy Investment in human capital want to improve the quality of the work force stay in school policy is aimed to alleviate tight labour market Investment in infrastructure Aging work force is triggering the government to increase pension fund provisions UE GDP Growth much higher than most other EU Zone countries ExchangeCurrencySterling is the currency of Irelands main trading partner England If this currency depreciates England will import less Irish goods because the price will be too high This decreases Irelands exports to England and reduces this source of income Inflation Trade Main trading partner is England Ireland is moving into electronics Dell and ecommerce Political Events Continuing NorthSouth conflict ADDITIONAL NOTES ON GHANA Efforts to increase Growth Ghana is encouraging a private sector role in developing infrastructure toll roads water port handling Ghana is encouraging outside investment in the country be positioning itself as the gateway to Africa Ghana is increasing the percentage of equity investment in pension funds from Ghana is amending securities law allowing the creation of investment vehicles such as unit trusts The new central bank governor Kwabena Duffour shifted government sector accounts from commercial banks who charged rates to the gov to the Bank of Ghana this had the effect of reducing the money supply which helped keep the currency from sliding too much against the dollar instead of the typical The government has kept borrowing and inflation down under pressure from the IMF Central Bank has promoted a repurchase strategy to tie up excess liquidity this will also tighten the money supply What Ghana still needs to do or still can do to increase growth The government needs to reduce interest rates to spur investment The government needs to speed up the privatization of stateowned enterprises oil cocoa privatization will allow these industries to operate more efficiently and competitively Ghana can do more to encourage investment from abroad by working with neighboring countries to create a politically stable environment The country could offer incentives for foreign investment could invest in the countrys human capital through training of relevant skills Step up infrastructure projects make this a very high priority most wealthy countries have a solid infrastructure Target the margin for savings and investment policies example investment tax breaks tax breaks for saving based on income Diversify sources of income which are not so prone to commodity price effects Government can take longterm loans from investors transforming shortterm into long term since Ghana is so dependant on foreign oil prices in the long term they can reduce their dependence by developingemploying energy saving processes Offer more support for industry subsidies lower interest rates Facts on Ghana Main GDP contributors Services Agriculture Industry Heavy reliance on commodity products Cocoa Gold Sensitive to fuel costs Government has lost reserves there is concern that if the government spends more that it has inflation will result There have been complaints that the government is too soft Ghanas sources of income have not changed for over years ADDITIONAL NOTES ON IRELAND Efforts to increase growth Encourage continuing education to alleviate tight labour force stay in school policy What Ireland still needs to do or still can do to increase growth improve infrastructure public services index welfare to wages increasing the use of the Internet in schools and businesses increasing ecommerce establishing the country as a worldclass site for ecommerce Facts on Ireland Economy is growing faster than main trading partners More education from university to university in years Why does Ireland fear a weak British pound according to FT Sterling is the currency of Irelands main trading partner England If this currency depreciates England will import less Irish goods because the price will be too high This decreases Irelands exports to England and reduces this source of income Why does ECB interest rate policy not match Irelands needs Does this mismatch mean joining the Eurozone was a bad idea Irelands economic growth is much higher than other EU nations but it only contributes about of the Eurozone economy this means it does not have much say in interest rate policy What is good for Germanys growth with their UE and growth may not be good for Ireland with UE and growth if ECB reduces interest rates to simulate growth in the Eurozone it may cause inflation in Ireland At PM Jonathan Hudacko wrote Aaron Mednelson Email aasBerkeleyEDU Aiaz Kazi Email aasBerkeleyEDU
