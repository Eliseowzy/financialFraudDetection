Jersey and fell into it Recently I was lucky enough to be the th attendee at the State Fair in Texas and was asked to fill in to be a judge at a chili cookoff Apparently the original judge called in sick at the last moment and I happened to be standing there when the call came in I was assured by the other two judges Native Texans that it would be a fun event and a true taste of Texas hospitality They assured me that the chili wouldnt be all that spicy and besides they told me I could have free beer during the tasting so I accepted Here are the scorecards from the event Chili Mikes Maniac Mobster Monster Chili JUDGE ONE A little too heavy on tomato Amusing kick JUDGE TWO Nice smooth tomato flavor Very mild FRANK Holy shit what the hell is this stuff You could remove dried paint from your driveway with it Took me two beers to put the flames out Hope thats the worst one These Texans are crazy Chili Arthurs Afterburner Chili JUDGE ONE Smoky with a hint of pork Slight Jalapeno tang JUDGE TWO Exciting BBQ flavor needs more peppers to be taken seriously FRANK Keep this out of reach of children Im not sure what I am supposed to taste besides pain I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver They had to walkietalkie in extra beers when they saw the look on my face Chili Freds Famous Burn Down the Barn Chili JUDGE ONE Excellent firehouse chili Great kick Needs more beans JUDGE TWO A beanless chili a bit salty good use of red peppers FRANK Call the EPA Ive located a uranium spill My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano Everyone knows the routine by now Barmaid pounded me on the back now my backbone is in the front part of my chest m getting shitfaced Chili Bubbas Black Magic JUDGE ONE Black bean chili with almost no spice Disappointing JUDGE TWO Hint of lime in the black beans Good side dish for fish or other mild foods not much of a chili FRANK I felt something scraping across my tongue but was unable to taste it Sally the bar maid was standing behind me with fresh refills that lb bitch is starting to look HOT just like this nuclearwaste Im eating Chili Lindas Legal Lip Remover JUDGE ONE Meaty strong chili Cayenne peppers freshly ground adding considerable kick Very impressive JUDGE TWO Chili using shredded beef could use more tomato Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement FRANK My ears are ringing and I can no longer focus my eyes I farted and four people behind me needed paramedics The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly on it from a pitcher It really pisses me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming Screw those rednecks Chili Veras Very Vegetarian Variety JUDGE ONE Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili Good balance of spice and peppers JUDGE TWO The best yet Aggressive use of peppers onions and garlic Superb FRANK My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous sulfuric flames No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that slut Sally I need to wipe my ass with a snow cone Chili Susans Screaming Sensation Chili JUDGE ONE A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers JUDGE TWO Ho Hum tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment I should note that I am worried about Judge Number He appears to be in a bit of distress as he is cursing uncontrollably FRANK You could put a grenade in my mouth pull the pin and I wouldnt feel a damn thing Ive lost the sight in one eye and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water My shirt is covered with chili which slid unnoticed out of my mouth My pants are full of lavalike shit to match my damn shirt At least during the autopsy theyll know what killed me Ive decided to stop breathing its too painful Screw it Im not getting any oxygen anyway If I need air Ill just suck it in through the inch hole in my stomach Chili Helens Mount Saint Chili JUDGE ONE A perfect ending this is a nice blend chili safe for all not too bold but spicy enough to declare its existence JUDGE TWO This final entry is a good balanced chili neither mild nor hot Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge Number passed out fell and pulled the chili pot on top of himself Not sure if hes going to make it Poor Yank FRANK editors note Judge was

Forwarded by Sarah GoodpastorEnron Communications on PM AM Please respond to nobody To cc bcc Sarah GoodpastorEnron Communications Subject Enron Corp Is Enron Overpriced Its in a bunch of complex businesses Its financial Is Enron Overpriced Its in a bunch of complex businesses Its financial statements are nearly impenetrable So why is Enron trading at such a huge multiple Bethany McLean Fortune Magazine Copyright In Hollywood parlance the It Girl is someone who commands the spotlight at any given momentyou know like Jennifer Lopez or Kate Hudson Wall Street is a far less glitzy place but theres still such a thing as an It Stock Right now that title belongs to Enron the Houston energy giant While tech stocks were bombing at the box office last year fans couldnt get enough of Enron whose shares returned By almost every measure the company turned in a virtuoso performance Earnings increased and revenues more than doubled to over billion Not surprisingly the critics are gushing Enron has built unique and in our view extraordinary franchises in several business units in very large markets says Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer Along with It status come high multiples and high expectations Enron now trades at roughly times trailing earnings Thats more than times the multiple of a competitor like Duke Energy more than twice that of the SP and about on a par with neweconomy sex symbol Cisco Systems Enron has an even higher opinion of itself At a lateJanuary meeting with analysts in Houston the company declared that it should be valued at a share more than above current levels Enron has no shame in telling you what its worth says one portfolio manager who describes such gatherings as revival meetings Indeed First Call says that of Enrons analysts rate the stock a buy But for all the attention thats lavished on Enron the company remains largely impenetrable to outsiders as even some of its admirers are quick to admit Start with a pretty straightforward question How exactly does Enron make its money Details are hard to come by because Enron keeps many of the specifics confidential for what it terms competitive reasons And the numbers that Enron does present are often extremely complicated Even quantitatively minded Wall Streeters who scrutinize the company for a living think so If you figure it out let me know laughs credit analyst Todd Shipman at SP Do you have a year asks Ralph Pellecchia Fitchs credit analyst in response to the same question To skeptics the lack of clarity raises a red flag about Enrons pricey stock Even owners of the stock arent uniformly sanguine Im somewhat afraid of it admits one portfolio manager And the inability to get behind the numbers combined with ever higher expectations for the company may increase the chance of a nasty surprise Enron is an earningsatrisk story says Chris Wolfe the equity market strategist at JP Morgans private bank who despite his remark is an Enron fan If it doesnt meet earnings the stock could implode Whats clear is that Enron isnt the company it was a decade ago In around of its revenues came from the regulated gas pipeline business But Enron has been steadily selling off its old economy iron and steel assets and expanding into new areas In of its revenues and more than of its operating profits came from wholesale energy operations and services This business which Enron pioneered is usually described in vague grandiose terms like the financialization of energybut also more simply as buying and selling gas and electricity In fact Enrons view is that it can create a market for just about anything as if to underscore that point the company announced last year that it would begin trading excess broadband capacity But describing what Enron does isnt easy because what it does is mindnumbingly complex CEO Jeff Skilling calls Enron a logistics company that ties together supply and demand for a given commodity and figures out the most costeffective way to transport that commodity to its destination Enron also uses derivatives like swaps options and forwards to create contracts for third parties and to hedge its exposure to credit risks and other variables If you thought Enron was just an energy company have a look at its SEC filings In its annual report the company wrote that the use of financial instruments by Enrons businesses may expose Enron to market and credit risks resulting from adverse changes in commodity and equity prices interest rates and foreign exchange rates Analyzing Enron can be deeply frustrating Its very difficult for us on Wall Street with as little information as we have says Fleischer who is a big bull The same is true for Enrons competitors but wholesale operations are usually a smaller part of their business and they trade at far lower multiples Enron is a big black box gripes another analyst Without having access to each and every one of Enrons contracts and its minutebyminute activities there isnt any way to independently answer critical questions about the company For instance many Wall Streeters believe that the current volatility in gas and power markets is boosting Enrons profits but there is no way to know for sure The ability to develop a somewhat predictable model of this business for the future is mostly an exercise in futility wrote Bear Stearns analyst Robert Winters in a recent report To some observers Enron resembles a Wall Street firm Indeed people commonly refer to the company as the Goldman Sachs of energy trading Thats meant as a compliment But the fact that part of Goldmans business is inherently risky and impenetrable to outsiders is precisely the reason that Goldman despite its powerful franchise trades at times trailing earningsor less than onethird of Enrons PE And as Long Term Capital taught us the bestlaid hedges even those designed by geniuses can go disastrously wrong Trying to get a good grip on Enrons risk profile is challenging says Shipman Nor at the moment is Enrons profitability close to that of brokerages which in fairness do tend to be more leveraged While Wall Street firms routinely earn north of returns on their equity Goldmans ROE last year was Enrons rate for the months ended in September the last period for which balance sheet information is available was Even less appealing is Enrons return on invested capital a measure including debt which is around Thats about the same rate of return you get on far less risky US Treasuries Enron vehemently disagrees with any characterization of its business as black boxlike It also dismisses any comparison to a securities firm We are not a trading company CFO Andrew Fastow emphatically declares In Enrons view its core businesswhere the company says it makes most of its moneyis delivering a physical commodity something a Goldman Sachs doesnt do And unlike a trading firm which thrives when prices are going wild Enron says that volatility has no effect on its profitsother than to increase customers who flock to the company in turbulent times Both Skilling who describes Enrons wholesale business as very simple to model and Fastow note that the growth in Enrons profitability tracks the growth in its volumes almost perfectly People who raise questions are people who have not gone through our business in detail and who want to throw rocks at us says Skilling Indeed Enron dismisses criticism as ignorance or as sour grapes on the part of analysts who failed to win its investmentbanking business The company also blames shortsellers for talking down Enron As for the details about how it makes money Enron says thats proprietary information sort of like CocaColas secret formula Fastow who points out that Enron has trading books for different commodities says We dont want anyone to know whats on those books We dont want to tell anyone where were making money In addition to its commodities business Enron has another division called Assets and Investments that is every bit as mysterious This business involves building power plants around the world operating them selling off pieces of them investing in debt and equity securities of energy and communicationsrelated business as Enrons filings note and other things Actually analysts dont seem to have a clue whats in Assets and Investments or more to the point what sort of earnings it will generate Enrons results from that part of its business tend to be quite volatileprofits fell from million in the second quarter of to million in the second quarter of In written reports Morgan Stanley chalked up the decline to the poor performance of Enrons significant number of investments in telecom stocks Dain Rauscher Wessels blamed it on a lack of asset sales In any event some analysts seem to like the fact that Enron has some discretion over the results it reports in this area In a footnote to its financials Enron notes that it booked pretax gains from sales of merchant assets and investments totaling million million and million in and This is an enormous earnings vehicle which can often be called upon when and if market conditions require notes UBS Warburg analyst Ron Barone Not everyone is so chipper We are concerned they are liquidating their asset base and booking it as recurring revenue especially in Latin America says analyst Andre Meade at Commerzbank who has a hold rating on the stock At the least these sorts of hardtopredict earnings are usually assigned a lower multiple There are other concerns Despite the fact that Enron has been talking about reducing its debt in the first nine months of its debt went up substantially During this period Enron issued a net billion in debt bringing its total debt up to a net billion at the end of September and its debttocapital ratio up to vs at the end of Nor does Enron make life easy for those who measure the health of a business by its cash flow from operations In its cash flow from operations fell from billion the previous year to billion In the first nine months of the company generated just million in cash In fact cash flow would have been negative if not for the million in tax breaks it received from employees exercising their options But Enron says that extrapolating from its financial statements is misleading The fact that Enrons cash flow this year was meager at least when compared with earnings was partly a result of its wholesale business Accounting standards mandate that its assets and liabilities from its wholesale business be marked to market valued at their market price at a given moment in time Changes in the valuation are reported in earnings But these earnings arent necessarily cash at the instant they are recorded Skilling says that Enron can convert these contracts to cash anytime it chooses by securitizing them or selling them off to a financial institution Enron then receives a servicing fee but Skilling says that all the risks for example changes in the value of the assets and liabilities are then transferred to the buyer Thats why he says Enrons cash flow will be up dramatically while debt will be way down way down when the company publishes its full yearend results which are due out soon Thats good because Enron will need plenty of cash to fund its new highcost initiatives namely the highcost buildout of its broadband operations In order to facilitate its plan to trade excess bandwidth capacity Enron is constructing its own network This requires big capital expenditures So broadband had better be a good business Both Enron and some of the analysts who cover it think it already is Included in the a share that Enron says its worth is a shareor billionfor broadband Several of Enrons analysts value broadband at a share or roughly billion and congratulate themselves for being conservative But billion seems like a high valuation for a business that reported million of revenues and million of losses in Not all analysts are so aggressive Valuing the broadband business is an extremely difficult uncertain exercise at this point in time notes Bear Stearns Winters who thinks that broadband while promising is worth some a share today Of course everything could go swimmingly Enron has told analysts that it plans to sell between billion and billion of assets over the next months The bullish scenario for Enron is that the proceeds from those sales will reduce debt and as earnings from new businesses kick in the companys return on invested capital will shoot upward Along with broadband Enron has ambitious plans to create big businesses trading a huge number of other commodities from pulp and paper to data storage to advertising time and space Perhaps most promising is its Enron Energy Services business which manages all the energy needs of big commercial and industrial companies Skilling has told analysts that its new businesses will generate a return on invested capital of about over the long run But all of these expectations are based on what Wolfe the JP Morgan strategist calls a little bit of the China syndromein other words if you get x of y enormous market youll get z in revenues For instance Enron says the global market for broadband and storage services will expand from billion in to somewhere around billion in Even a modest market share and thin margins provide excellent potential here writes Ed Tirello a Deutsche Bank Alex Brown senior power strategist The problem as we know from innumerable failed dotcoms is that the y enormous market doesnt always materialize on schedule And Enron isnt leaving itself a lot of room for the normal wobbles and glitches that happen in any developing business In the end it boils down to a question of faith Enron is no black box says Goldmans Fleischer Thats like calling Michael Jordan a black box just because you dont know what hes going to score every quarter Then again Jordan never had to promise to hit a certain number of shots in order to please investors FEEDBACK COLOR PHOTO PHOTOGRAPH BY PAUL HOWELLLIAISON SOME PEOPLE liken Enron with its massive trading operation to a Wall Street securities firm

on earth Yet unlike many peoples that have adapted and evolved in response to external and internal influences over the centuries the aggies have largely remained true to their roots And theyre proud of it As a result of passing on their beliefs and practices over the years their behavior over time has been remarkably consistent It is this consistency that makes them an exciting and fascinating group to study Who are the aggies The relationship between the aggies and morons idiots and okies are often misunderstood Contrary to widespread belief the aggies are considered and consider themselves a separate people from the morons idiots and okies Historically the true stupidity of aggies has largely dominated over and outnumbered all three other groups combined The misconception that the four groups are related probably stems from the fact that morons and idiots have imitated many rituals and behaviors practiced by the aggies However aggies are a distinct group Although recent evidence Solomon Shyster et al suggests that at one time probably early in the century aggies and okies lived together and interbred in parts of Southern Oklahoma and Texas hence Arkansas was populated by their offspring What largely separates aggies from the others groups is their social interaction Unlike okies idiots and morons aggies are highly social creatures that tend to validate each others views and beliefs This can lead to what scholars call a groupthink delusion It is believed that these delusions are the glue that have bound aggies everywhere together over the years The history of the aggie school of thought actually begins in ancient Greece with the early philospher Slocumedes who was the first to recognize that the absence of everything is equivalent to nothing He had a large number of stupid followers and much of his works is still passed on from parent to child today Stupicles from Pheces taught that all things could be crushed by a large enough piece of wood His students known as woodpeckers practiced pet embalming hand gestures organized grunting and mastered many techniques in consuming solid food through their nasal cavities Stupicles was also a prolific writer Unfortunately his twelve volumes of philosophical works which he wrote entirely in the sand on an Egyptian beach was lost during a high Mediterranean tide With the rise of the Roman Empire many aggies sought the stability and steady work afforded by slavery The aggies however made poor slaves and many were forced into Christianity for entertainment of monks and so that they could be fed to the lions Others were driven out of the Roman Empire into Northern Europe where they settled many colonies The void left by the fall of the Roman Empire provided the aggies an opportunity to flourish unhindered in Europe hence Poland and France were populated The aggies didnt fare so well during the industrial revolution since the philosophical and scientific frameworks of Descartes and Newton didnt give much leeway to superstition and planned ignorance More and more aggies found themselves falling into the ranks of the working masses Aggies caused many early industrial accidents as they tried to fit into this rapidly changing society and evidence of their engineering prowess remains such as the Leaning Tower of Pisa Their ways and practices were not appreciated in the new European culture however and increasingly many aggies sought refuge across the ocean in America That is those who didnt wind up sinking their ships in the North Atlantic Part of the problem in identifying an aggie is that they look and act much like anyone else until they do or say something decidedly stupid Most aggies dont think of themselves as morons but rather as intelligent individuals This makes it very difficult to reason with an aggie Stupid acts can take many forms and vary in degree but when an aggie commits one it is unmistakable The majority of the times a aggie turns out to be nothing more than an inconvenience and source of humor to the innocent bystander These incidents are played out on city streets supermarkets and country Dairy Queens daily However there are times when these acts can get out of hand and be devastating It is always wise to be on alert and prepared and stay away from large stacks of logs maroonclad men wielding binoculars or people with shaved heads with swords At times you may find yourself in close proximity to an aggie in the midst of a stupid spell It is good advice not to approach them during an incident unless accompanied by a trained professional If you find that you have no choice then speak slowly and use small soothing words Never try to outwit an aggie since they will only interpret that as a hostile and aggressive act Always let the aggie think they are superior And under no circumstances let your face or hands pets or livestock near aggies mouth Keep in mind at all times that although an aggie may seem intelligent and civilized they are not It is an adaptive disguise developed over the centuries Beware be safe and be orange Hookem

Forwarded by Sarah GoodpastorEnron Communications on PM AM Please respond to nobody To cc bcc Sarah GoodpastorEnron Communications Subject Enron Corp Is Enron Overpriced Its in a bunch of complex businesses Its financial Is Enron Overpriced Its in a bunch of complex businesses Its financial statements are nearly impenetrable So why is Enron trading at such a huge multiple Bethany McLean Fortune Magazine Copyright In Hollywood parlance the It Girl is someone who commands the spotlight at any given momentyou know like Jennifer Lopez or Kate Hudson Wall Street is a far less glitzy place but theres still such a thing as an It Stock Right now that title belongs to Enron the Houston energy giant While tech stocks were bombing at the box office last year fans couldnt get enough of Enron whose shares returned By almost every measure the company turned in a virtuoso performance Earnings increased and revenues more than doubled to over billion Not surprisingly the critics are gushing Enron has built unique and in our view extraordinary franchises in several business units in very large markets says Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer Along with It status come high multiples and high expectations Enron now trades at roughly times trailing earnings Thats more than times the multiple of a competitor like Duke Energy more than twice that of the SP and about on a par with neweconomy sex symbol Cisco Systems Enron has an even higher opinion of itself At a lateJanuary meeting with analysts in Houston the company declared that it should be valued at a share more than above current levels Enron has no shame in telling you what its worth says one portfolio manager who describes such gatherings as revival meetings Indeed First Call says that of Enrons analysts rate the stock a buy But for all the attention thats lavished on Enron the company remains largely impenetrable to outsiders as even some of its admirers are quick to admit Start with a pretty straightforward question How exactly does Enron make its money Details are hard to come by because Enron keeps many of the specifics confidential for what it terms competitive reasons And the numbers that Enron does present are often extremely complicated Even quantitatively minded Wall Streeters who scrutinize the company for a living think so If you figure it out let me know laughs credit analyst Todd Shipman at SP Do you have a year asks Ralph Pellecchia Fitchs credit analyst in response to the same question To skeptics the lack of clarity raises a red flag about Enrons pricey stock Even owners of the stock arent uniformly sanguine Im somewhat afraid of it admits one portfolio manager And the inability to get behind the numbers combined with ever higher expectations for the company may increase the chance of a nasty surprise Enron is an earningsatrisk story says Chris Wolfe the equity market strategist at JP Morgans private bank who despite his remark is an Enron fan If it doesnt meet earnings the stock could implode Whats clear is that Enron isnt the company it was a decade ago In around of its revenues came from the regulated gas pipeline business But Enron has been steadily selling off its old economy iron and steel assets and expanding into new areas In of its revenues and more than of its operating profits came from wholesale energy operations and services This business which Enron pioneered is usually described in vague grandiose terms like the financialization of energybut also more simply as buying and selling gas and electricity In fact Enrons view is that it can create a market for just about anything as if to underscore that point the company announced last year that it would begin trading excess broadband capacity But describing what Enron does isnt easy because what it does is mindnumbingly complex CEO Jeff Skilling calls Enron a logistics company that ties together supply and demand for a given commodity and figures out the most costeffective way to transport that commodity to its destination Enron also uses derivatives like swaps options and forwards to create contracts for third parties and to hedge its exposure to credit risks and other variables If you thought Enron was just an energy company have a look at its SEC filings In its annual report the company wrote that the use of financial instruments by Enrons businesses may expose Enron to market and credit risks resulting from adverse changes in commodity and equity prices interest rates and foreign exchange rates Analyzing Enron can be deeply frustrating Its very difficult for us on Wall Street with as little information as we have says Fleischer who is a big bull The same is true for Enrons competitors but wholesale operations are usually a smaller part of their business and they trade at far lower multiples Enron is a big black box gripes another analyst Without having access to each and every one of Enrons contracts and its minutebyminute activities there isnt any way to independently answer critical questions about the company For instance many Wall Streeters believe that the current volatility in gas and power markets is boosting Enrons profits but there is no way to know for sure The ability to develop a somewhat predictable model of this business for the future is mostly an exercise in futility wrote Bear Stearns analyst Robert Winters in a recent report To some observers Enron resembles a Wall Street firm Indeed people commonly refer to the company as the Goldman Sachs of energy trading Thats meant as a compliment But the fact that part of Goldmans business is inherently risky and impenetrable to outsiders is precisely the reason that Goldman despite its powerful franchise trades at times trailing earningsor less than onethird of Enrons PE And as Long Term Capital taught us the bestlaid hedges even those designed by geniuses can go disastrously wrong Trying to get a good grip on Enrons risk profile is challenging says Shipman Nor at the moment is Enrons profitability close to that of brokerages which in fairness do tend to be more leveraged While Wall Street firms routinely earn north of returns on their equity Goldmans ROE last year was Enrons rate for the months ended in September the last period for which balance sheet information is available was Even less appealing is Enrons return on invested capital a measure including debt which is around Thats about the same rate of return you get on far less risky US Treasuries Enron vehemently disagrees with any characterization of its business as black boxlike It also dismisses any comparison to a securities firm We are not a trading company CFO Andrew Fastow emphatically declares In Enrons view its core businesswhere the company says it makes most of its moneyis delivering a physical commodity something a Goldman Sachs doesnt do And unlike a trading firm which thrives when prices are going wild Enron says that volatility has no effect on its profitsother than to increase customers who flock to the company in turbulent times Both Skilling who describes Enrons wholesale business as very simple to model and Fastow note that the growth in Enrons profitability tracks the growth in its volumes almost perfectly People who raise questions are people who have not gone through our business in detail and who want to throw rocks at us says Skilling Indeed Enron dismisses criticism as ignorance or as sour grapes on the part of analysts who failed to win its investmentbanking business The company also blames shortsellers for talking down Enron As for the details about how it makes money Enron says thats proprietary information sort of like CocaColas secret formula Fastow who points out that Enron has trading books for different commodities says We dont want anyone to know whats on those books We dont want to tell anyone where were making money In addition to its commodities business Enron has another division called Assets and Investments that is every bit as mysterious This business involves building power plants around the world operating them selling off pieces of them investing in debt and equity securities of energy and communicationsrelated business as Enrons filings note and other things Actually analysts dont seem to have a clue whats in Assets and Investments or more to the point what sort of earnings it will generate Enrons results from that part of its business tend to be quite volatileprofits fell from million in the second quarter of to million in the second quarter of In written reports Morgan Stanley chalked up the decline to the poor performance of Enrons significant number of investments in telecom stocks Dain Rauscher Wessels blamed it on a lack of asset sales In any event some analysts seem to like the fact that Enron has some discretion over the results it reports in this area In a footnote to its financials Enron notes that it booked pretax gains from sales of merchant assets and investments totaling million million and million in and This is an enormous earnings vehicle which can often be called upon when and if market conditions require notes UBS Warburg analyst Ron Barone Not everyone is so chipper We are concerned they are liquidating their asset base and booking it as recurring revenue especially in Latin America says analyst Andre Meade at Commerzbank who has a hold rating on the stock At the least these sorts of hardtopredict earnings are usually assigned a lower multiple There are other concerns Despite the fact that Enron has been talking about reducing its debt in the first nine months of its debt went up substantially During this period Enron issued a net billion in debt bringing its total debt up to a net billion at the end of September and its debttocapital ratio up to vs at the end of Nor does Enron make life easy for those who measure the health of a business by its cash flow from operations In its cash flow from operations fell from billion the previous year to billion In the first nine months of the company generated just million in cash In fact cash flow would have been negative if not for the million in tax breaks it received from employees exercising their options But Enron says that extrapolating from its financial statements is misleading The fact that Enrons cash flow this year was meager at least when compared with earnings was partly a result of its wholesale business Accounting standards mandate that its assets and liabilities from its wholesale business be marked to market valued at their market price at a given moment in time Changes in the valuation are reported in earnings But these earnings arent necessarily cash at the instant they are recorded Skilling says that Enron can convert these contracts to cash anytime it chooses by securitizing them or selling them off to a financial institution Enron then receives a servicing fee but Skilling says that all the risks for example changes in the value of the assets and liabilities are then transferred to the buyer Thats why he says Enrons cash flow will be up dramatically while debt will be way down way down when the company publishes its full yearend results which are due out soon Thats good because Enron will need plenty of cash to fund its new highcost initiatives namely the highcost buildout of its broadband operations In order to facilitate its plan to trade excess bandwidth capacity Enron is constructing its own network This requires big capital expenditures So broadband had better be a good business Both Enron and some of the analysts who cover it think it already is Included in the a share that Enron says its worth is a shareor billionfor broadband Several of Enrons analysts value broadband at a share or roughly billion and congratulate themselves for being conservative But billion seems like a high valuation for a business that reported million of revenues and million of losses in Not all analysts are so aggressive Valuing the broadband business is an extremely difficult uncertain exercise at this point in time notes Bear Stearns Winters who thinks that broadband while promising is worth some a share today Of course everything could go swimmingly Enron has told analysts that it plans to sell between billion and billion of assets over the next months The bullish scenario for Enron is that the proceeds from those sales will reduce debt and as earnings from new businesses kick in the companys return on invested capital will shoot upward Along with broadband Enron has ambitious plans to create big businesses trading a huge number of other commodities from pulp and paper to data storage to advertising time and space Perhaps most promising is its Enron Energy Services business which manages all the energy needs of big commercial and industrial companies Skilling has told analysts that its new businesses will generate a return on invested capital of about over the long run But all of these expectations are based on what Wolfe the JP Morgan strategist calls a little bit of the China syndromein other words if you get x of y enormous market youll get z in revenues For instance Enron says the global market for broadband and storage services will expand from billion in to somewhere around billion in Even a modest market share and thin margins provide excellent potential here writes Ed Tirello a Deutsche Bank Alex Brown senior power strategist The problem as we know from innumerable failed dotcoms is that the y enormous market doesnt always materialize on schedule And Enron isnt leaving itself a lot of room for the normal wobbles and glitches that happen in any developing business In the end it boils down to a question of faith Enron is no black box says Goldmans Fleischer Thats like calling Michael Jordan a black box just because you dont know what hes going to score every quarter Then again Jordan never had to promise to hit a certain number of shots in order to please investors FEEDBACK COLOR PHOTO PHOTOGRAPH BY PAUL HOWELLLIAISON SOME PEOPLE liken Enron with its massive trading operation to a Wall Street securities firm

are ringing and I can no longer focus my eyes I farted and four people behind me needed paramedics The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage Sally saved
