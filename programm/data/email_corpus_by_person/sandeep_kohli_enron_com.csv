Enron India Newsdesk Jan th newsclips Untie Them Editorial Thursday Jan todayedithtm State not to give tax sops to DPC for buying naphtha from IOC Sanjay Jog Thursday Jan fedailyfechtml Centre yet to receive proposal on Enron Thursday Jan todayinfrhtm Untie Them Editorial Thursday Jan THE GOVERNMENT of Maharashtra wants New Delhi to convince the Power Trading Corporation a central utility to buy power from Dabhol and sell it across the countryIt would be far simpler if Dabhol and all independent power producers were allowed to sell power to whoever was willing to pay for itThat unfortunately is not allowed by law which forces private sector generators to sell power only to state utilities which in turn are not permitted to sell power across states on their own Most state electricity boards are bankrupt MSEB reportedly owes central utilities Rs crore They cannot bring themselves to charge many types of users for the power consumed nor can they prevent largescale theft of electricity Few including wealthy Maharashtra have the will to reform state electricity boards and privatise transmission and distribution Given this profile of buyers private generators demand sovereign guarantees to help them tide over default risks But the guarantees merely insulate IPPs against risk They cannot make SEBs solvent Yet India needs power desperately Maharashtra Indias richest state experiences power short ages of around MW about a sixth of its peak needs Over time the hunger for power will only grow India cannot afford to wait for the painful politics of SEB reform to work themselves out The governme nt should bring in legislation that allows IPPs to sell power directly to payi ng customersThis will free IPPs from the clutches of bankrupt monopsony buyer s The power trading legislation will have unexpectedly happy consequences for the government tooOnce IPPs are freed from their onerous obligations to se ll power to single mostly bankrupt buyers their default risks will come down substantially New Delhi and state governments should then scrap the guarantees that they gave IPPs in the past The combination of power trading private investments in generation transmission and distribution and gradual SEB reform will create a commercial workable and competitive power market in India Anything less will be a recipe for disaster State not to give tax sops to DPC for buying naphtha from IOC Sanjay Jog Thursday Jan The Maharshtra governments finance department which is striving to reduce fiscal deficit from Rs crore to Rs crore by the beginning of April this year has expressed its inability to provide a sales tax waiver to the Dabhol Power Company DPC on the procurement of million tonne of naphtha from the staterun Indian Oil Corporation IOC Mantralaya sources told The Financial Express on Wednesday that DPC would have to pay per cent sales tax The government way back in has modified the sales tax rate to per cent to discourage the import of napht ha from Gujarat by electrical companies operating in Maharashtra The decision was taken with a view to encouraging electrical companies to procure naphth a at reduced rates within the state government sources added Sources said that these companies had to pay nearly per cent sales tax on naphtha that was procured from Gujarat However following their representation th e government slashed the sales tax rate to per cent The state finance departments opinion which would be presented before the state cabinet shortly in order to take a final decision deserves special significance especially when the state energy department and the lossmakin g Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB have wholeheartedly supported th e DPCs cause and recommended the sales tax waiver DPC which was asked by t he Union ministry of oil and petroleum to procure naphtha within the country i n view of excess availability in its presentation to the state government an d to MSEB had made it clear that it would be left with no alternative but to pass on the additional burden on the MSEB which would be ultimately passed on to its consumers DPC had also told the state government that it had not pa id sales tax on the procurement of naphtha from Glencore in the calender year Sources from the state energy department and MSEB have stressed on the need for such a waiver while expressing their inability to bear additional burde n They have suggested that the state should reciprocate by offering a sales t ax exemption to DPC because the IOC at the behest of the Centre has tried to match the international landing price of naphtha during the recently signed memorandum of agreement with DPC If the state finance department sticks t o its views it may hurt the state as a whole sources from the state energy department and MSEB saidDPC will procure naphtha at Rs per ton from IOC during the calender year as compared to the Rs per tonne price quoted by Glencore The naphtha price comprises per tonne free o n board FOB per cent of customs duty per cent of sales tax and of premium DPC senior vice president Mukesh Tyagi reiterated that the company has already made an appeal to the state government for the sales tax waiver on naphtha in the larger interest of the consumers Sales tax is a pass throu gh and MSEB which will have to bear the additional burden will pass it on th e consumers he added Centre yet to receive proposal on Enron Thursday Jan CENTRE on Wednesday said that it had not recevied any proposal from Maharashtra government seeking help to solve the tangle with the Enron promoted Dhabol Power Project relating to cost and surplus power Asked abo ut the reports that Maharashtra government was sending a proposal that centre buy surplus power from Dhabol Power Company through power trading corporation power minister Suresh Prabhu said we have not received any proposal We are carefully watching the situation and will await a concre te proposal before intervening in this matter Parbhu said on the sidelines o f greentech environment excellence awards ceremony here Asked whether there was any possibility of the government asking the Power Trading Corporation to buy power from the Dhabol Power Corporation Prabhu replied what will the PTC do with the power Prabhu had earlier asked the state government to study the matter before approaching the centre for payment of dues MSEB had earlier declined to pi ck up its per cent stake in phase II of the mw project The Enron issu e has been hanging fire with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board unable t o clear the dues of DPC as a result of the skyrocketing prices of Naphtha infact MSEB has asked DPC to backdown completely leading to a situation whe re DPC has stopped production at the facility from the begining of the monthState government has stepped in with support to the tune of Rs crore to enable MSEB to clear the dues for October MSEB dues to DPC for November and December amount to over Rs crores

place I will be arranging meeting with some officicals from the transmission side and gather any additional data there too Krishan got in last night I conveyed your best wishes to him We will hopefully have a useful day with Henwood folks tomorrow I look forward to being in Houston possibly by the end of the coming week Hope you and the team are doing well Regards Sandeep Forwarded by Sandeep KohliENRONDEVELOPMENT on AM Sandeep Kohli AM To Wade ClineENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Subject Points for Singh Meet Wade Please find below a brief note on what I feel your tack should be with NKSingh who is supposed to be a hard negotiator I am assuming here that this will be more of an introductory meeting where both sides are feeling out the other The two meetings I had arranged over the weekend would hopefully have given you a better idea of the thinking of at least these two people o the issue Incidentally in the Indian system the Governor of any state is a Central government nominee He is the eyes and ears of the Central govt in the state Please see Basaks meeting in that light The message he takes will likely go directly to the PMO in Delhi I will therefore be working closely to convey the right impression For NKSingh clearly there are three things you would try to convey A description of the problem Some of the resultant consequences if it is not solved soon enough and Conveying the fact that there are winwin solutions well within the GoIs power to implement that would in fact enhance his reputation and the countrys as one that lives up to its reputation I would be careful to make the point that we are NOT going to give up any value but are willing to be accomodative to MSEB GoM and GoI needs either through financial reengineering or through getting direct access to the market in some areas This will also fly well with Enron management that is more comfortable with market risks than political Describing the Problem DPC has a PPA backed by GoI GoM guarantees for one of the most high profile projects in the world Worlds largest gas fired power plant Indias first LNG terminal gateway to providing clean reliable energy for all of western India development of Konkan With coming of Phase II due end cost of power from Dabhol will be more competitive than any other liquid fuel fired plant low heat rates larger turbines spreading of infrastructure costs over a larger base use of LNG as fuel Our average tariff at despatch is Rs kWh for Phase I This goes down to Rs kWh with coming in of Phase II Compare this with NTPCs own Kayamkulam plant having a tariff of Rs for same range of crude prices barrel Hence DPC power is competitive our standards of performance are higher penalties for nonperformance are greater and as a private player our place in the waterfall seems to be lower quote the fact that while we have been delayed in payment by days MSEB has made all of its other payment commitments However monthly outflows could be as much as Rs Crmonth MSEBs monthy collections not improving are in the range of Rs Crmonth MSEB and GoM clearly do not have the resources in the short run yrs to meet these obligations hence Central intervention is needed In a grid of MW Maharashtra grid size absorbing an additional MW Phase II at one go is difficult however if we take Western Region grid size is MW Clearly absorbing all the power in that framework is much easier To this if we add Northern and Southern grids we can probably evacuate out another MW through the interconnects Hence there is definitely value in looking at this issue at a national level Additionally it is not just solvable at that level but actually answers to the crying need for power in the country and hence is a boon for the govt and should be treated as such Consequences of Not Solving the Problem We can call upon the sovereign guarantee which will cover our partial payments However this would almost definitely lead to a deterioration of the countrys credit rating put back incoming investments into the Petroleum sector where private participation program is about to be unveiled in OG blocks telecom sector where a new policy has been announced months ago and where foreign companies are looking favorably at investing It is likely to put India on the backlist of many international banks including export credit agencies of US Japan and Belgium an EEC member It would bring to the knees many prominent Indian banks Indian lenders to the project include IDBI ICICI SBI to metion just a few Would completely stop any new investment into the power sector where there is urgent need for funding especially te new initiatives in transmission There is a timeline for solving this since our project is coming before yearend and hence we cannot wait for the slow pace of reform to take place at the SEB and state level WinWin Solutions Exist Northern region is power starved south needs power badly Hence it is a boon to have this power made available in the timeframe With Central govt intevention it is possible to solve th problem to everyones mutual benefit MW incremental Phase II is only of the capacity existing in the Western Region and can be easily absorbed WinWin Solutions exist by Restructuring some of the guarantees Adding some central govt entity including those from the petroleum sector IOC or GAIL interested due to LNG trml to the equity mix at par Backending tariff and other financial reengineering solutions that could involve Indian banks taking a greater share of the debt et etc Bottom Line Time is of essence we need to get someone to negotiate with Please use your good offices to quickly form a representative group that includes Central State govt and SEB representatives so that we can work on the solution Without active participation from PMs office we are likely to waste precious time bouncing between the SEB GoM and various Ministries of GoI Hope this helps Regards

board had almost decided to call it quits and proceed with the termination of the billion power projec t at Dabhol the veto exercised by the company chairman Kenneth Lay has save d the project at least for the timebeing Sources said the meeting held on Tuesday at the energy majors headquarters in Houston could have sounded th e death knell for the only big foreign investment in the Indian power sector Although the future of the project is still pretty uncertain with the lende rs unwilling to continue disbursements unless payment obligations are not honoured and contractual obligations left unfulfilled the veto exercised a t this juncture by the chairman of the parent company has come as a big boost to the Indian venture Company sources said We do not know what went on there but it is true that as of now we are not pulling out With the engineering procurement and construction contractors GE and equipment suppliers Bechtel too in a cautious mode mode DPC was finding it even mor e difficult to continue the construction of the project as per the schedules Sources said the stand taken by the rest of the directors on the board woul d be in view of the backlash that the company would have to face from its shareholders if the project actually floppedEnron had similar bitter experiences in Pakistan and it was difficult for the parent company to then justify such investments to the shareholders Enron which had planned a major investments in Indias infrastructure sectors such as oil and gas LNG gas transportation telecom and broadband network has already pulled out most of their personnel from some of these operations The companys MoUs with various other majors like Indian Oil Corporation too is in a limbo and the US majors stake in the oil and gas venture is up for grabs However even though Lay is still hoping to find a solution to the controversy back home both DPC and MSEB are still to get down to negotiations THE ECONOMIC TIMES MAY Maha sore over delay in

hold discussions with Enron officials from Houston on May has only a months time for renegotiations and wit h DPCs termination notice threat hanging on our head time is actually runni ng out Yet there

to hear anything from their side he said The official said that the state expected the Centre to announce their representative before May as it would appreciate his crucial presence i n the first session of discussions with Enron officials lenders and gas suppliers Sources in the Mantralaya added that the government had also bee n unhappy over the Centres rigid stand on not allowing stateowned National Thermal Power Corporation NTPC to buy the excess capacity of DPCs total mw project Let NTPC and Power Trading Corporation of India PTC co me together and sell DPCs surlpus power We have already mooted this suggestion but a favourable reply is yet to come from the Union power ministry the official said The official said that the Centre which was also responsible for DPC project as it has provided counter guarantee to Enron India should form a special purpose vehicle for sale of the excess power to other states The state governments reaction comes in wake of Uni on power minister Suresh Prabhus discussion with Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh in Delhi few days ago It was learnt that Prabhu told Deshmukh there is no question of NTPC buying power from the project since long term PPAs have been signed by NTPC with the buying states Deshmukh had suggested that the Central power utility should sell excess power over and above the mw needed for the state from the DPCs mw phaseI and soon to be commissioned phaseII of mw to other nee dy states Considering the high cost of power generated from DPC which duri ng the recent months has hovered around Rs per unit as against an average co st of Rs a unit from Central and state utilities there would be fe w takers for the power from Dabhol the power minister reportedly said Deficit states will buy DPC power only when the cost of power is brought down he said adding power ministry would facilitate wheelng of this pow er to the buyers BUSINESS STANDARD Monday May Reliance allowed to hawk power from Patalganga to third parties Arijit De S Ravindran Renni Abraham in Mumbai In an unusual departure from normal practice the Maharashtra government h as allowed the Reliance group to sell power generated by its mw Patalgan ga power project directly to third parties if the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB does not lift power The projects power purch ase agreement PPA has a clause to this effect The state governments permission to Reliance to hawk power to third parties has to be seen in th e context of its dithering on forwarding to the Centre the Dabhol Power Companys bid for mega power status so that it could sell power to thir d parties DPC sources told Business Standard several weeks ago that the companys application had been pending with the Chief Ministers office for months Only now has the state government authorised the Godbole committee to negotiate with DPC on third party sales outside the state The DPC project is facing the threat of closure following MSEBs inability to buy power from it thanks to the Boards weak financial position Not only can the Reliance group sell power to third parties within Maharashtra but it can sell power to utilities outside the state The PPA does not expressly bar it from doing so Nor does it specify the category of customers to whom power can be sold So in effect this suggests that the group could sell power t o industrial and commercial customers in Maharashtra and emerge as a rival t o the MSEBThe state electricity board derives over per cent of its reven ue from such consumers Apart from captive power plants independent power producers in India are allowed to sell power only to state electricity boards They can sell powe r outside the state only if they qualify for mega power project status With its mw capacity the Patalganga project is not eligible for such status because mega power rojects are supposed to have a minimum capacity of mw Speaking on the sidelines of a press conference last week Reliance Industries managing director Anil Ambani told Business Standard A provisi on in third parties Ambani was answering a question on whether the MSEBs weak financials and inability to offer escrow cover to the project as emphasised in the Godbole committee report set up to defuse the Dabhol crisis would derail the Patalganga project The PPA does not have any express restriction as to third party sale outsid e the state a Reliance spokesperson confirmed on Friday in a faxed response to questions A senior MSEB official explained that the state government cleared private power projects some years ago on the basis of the unrealistically high demand projections contained in a report by a former MSEB official Subsequently it was realised that the state would be stuck with excess power So the Reliance group was permitted to sell power to thi rd parties he said The Patalganga project along with the Ispat groups mw Bhadravati project has been put on hold till the Godbole committee submi ts its second report THE ECONOMIC TIMES MAY No need of Patalganga Bhadravati power MSEB THE AXE seems to have finally fallen on the muchdelayed Reliance Industriespromoted Patalganga and Ispat Industries Bhadravati Power projects in Maharashtra as the state electricity board has firmly told the government that there is no need of these projects nor their power The lossmaking board has communicated to the government that MSEB had no interest in Patalganga and Bhadravati as it did not have escrowable capacity and also that industrial demand for power had slowed down tremendously in Maharashtra state government sources said here on Sunday In last November itself MSEB had sent an official intimation to the state government informing its decision in favour of cancellation of the two projects on several grounds including they being unviable and unaffordable sources said Reliances project is no different from that of DPCs Patalganga is also naphthabased and its PPA is on similar lines After the Enron experience MSEB cannot even dream of another gasbased power plant in the state a senior MSEB official said He said MSEB has already asked the state government not to provide escrow to both the m w Patalganga and the mw coalbased Bhadravati as the US energy major has almost squeezed us of all over finances When contacted MSEB chairman Vinay Bansal said Reliance and Ispat projects have been put on hold as pe r the Godbole Committees recommendations but expressed inability to give further details Currently Bhadravati and Patalganga projects have been put on hold as per Godbole Committee report which was set up to review the DPCMSEB PPA and energy scenario in Maharashtra Can you go ahead with the project without an escrow cover the committee was believed to have asked Ispat and Reliance representatives to which the reply had been negative sources added Sources said as of now both the projects have not been able to achieve financial closure as leading financial institutions were not willing to fund the projects which do not have a guaranteed payment mechanism from MSEB which incidentally it has promised to DPC All the three were clear ed as fasttrack projects but other than Enron Reliance and Ispat have bee n caught in a quagmire especially Bhadravati which has been hanging afire since last nine years they added Moreover the MSEB official opined that given the current situation if DPC calls it quits from India Bhadravati was a safer bet than Reliances Patalganga Patalgangas power would be mere paise less than that of DPC s that ranges anywhere around approximately Rs per unit to as high as R s while Bhadravatis cost could be around Rs to Rs per unit he informed MSEBs installed capacity ended on March was mw a nd it has generated million units with transmission and distribution losses as high as per cent PTI BUSINESS STANDARD MAY Global bankers ask govt to honour DPC obligations Tamal Bandyopadhyay Surajeet Dasgupta Santosh Tiwary in MumbaiNewDelhi Global arrangers for the Dabhol Power Company have mounted fresh pressure o n the finance ministry to honour the Union governments counterguarante e and have also set strict conditions for reconsidering the termination of the power purchase agreement PPA between the DPC and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB In a related development the DPC has sent a not e to all lenders saying they would have to bear the consequences of the tur n of events as they have prevented the DPC from serving the PPA termination notice last month The lenders in their turn sent a statement prepared by the New Yorkbased legal firm White Case defending their stance saying they a re working in the best interest of the project The lenders are expected to meet in London over the next fortnight to take stock of the situationThe deadline for resolving the issues are drawing to a close as days of the threeweek reprieve have passed At the DPC board meeting in London on May the lenders had managed to stall the issuance of the termination notice and got three weeks time for themselves to convince the Centre a s well as the Maharashtra government to resolve the impasse on the controversial project In a letter to finance secretary Ajit Kumar dated April the global arrangers said the government must own up its responsibility and meet its obligations without further delay Among the stiff conditions set by the arrangers are the demand that the central government ensure payment of all the pending bills of MSEB for December January February and March which remain unpaid without any protest or reservation by May Monday Any payment previously made under protest should be made free and c lear of such protest or any other reservation and the Center should ensure time ly payment of future bills by MSEB they said Meanwhile sources said that t he finance secretary was expected to meet the international lenders to the Dabhol projects in London stand on the issue The lenders list of deman ds also include asking MSEB to take steps required under the existing contracts to activate the escrow arrangements put in place at the time of financial close of Phase II of the Project by May They have demanded that the Union government and the Maharashtra government should take all required actions to ensure that no government agency will take any step to impede the operation of Phase I or the construction and operation of Phase II without due cause The lenders have also asked them to ensure that the relevant customs authorities permit import of all goods and equipment required for the Project by May CSFB ANZ Export Finance Citi Bank Of America and ABN Amro are the global arrangers for both phase I as well as phase II of the project The State Bank of India which is also a global arranger for phase II did not sign the letter Ten days have passed since the lenders bought three weeks time from the company delaying its declaration of the termination of the PPA Since then nothing has moved at the material level barring MSEBs payment of the January bill to the tune of Rs crore under protest sai d a source among the global arrangers come forward to meet its obligations The lenders are planning to meet around midMay in London and this time they will be left with no choice but to give the goahead to the company to terminate the PPA unless the finance ministry comes forward to settle the issue the source added The lenders are however not ready to take the blame for any delay in the termination of PPA as implied by the company Th e White Case statement said the lenders are concerned about the fate of th e project and they are exploring all intermediate steps before choosing the last option termination of PPA BUSINESS STANDARD Saturday May

public relations agency Burson Marsteller Roger Pereira said that only DPC executives were authorised to speak on the issue The DPC spokesman declined to comment on the issue The first phase of the mw has already been commissioned After the seco nd phase of mwis commissioned by December MSEB will have to pay DPC a minimum of Rs crore per month The escrow account for this was to have been made operational by April MSEB has refused to do this Earlier DPC had invoked the political force majeure clause in its contract with the board MSEB is now arguing that the invocation of this clause has absolved DPC of all its liabilities Consequently it will not operationalise the escrow account This casts a further shadow over DPCs ability to pay General Electric and Bechtel T his is worrying the lenders to the project as well The situation has taken a turn for the worse with DPC practically refusing to renegotiate the contra ct for the second phase with the Godbole panel constituted by the

the meeting with Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh last month convened by the finance minister Yashwant Sinha to discuss the Enron crisis said government sources on Friday Prabhu had

MSEB contract THE ENRON power project crisis on Thursday deepened with the board of Dabho l Power Company authorising the management to issue a termination notice to t he Maharashtra State Electricity Board even while international lenders to the project asked Enron to renegotiate power purchase agreement signed with the MSEB The decision to authorise managing director Neil McGregor to issue notice of termination on the contract to sell MW of power was taken after the board prevented MSEB from voting on the ground that it was an interested party The decision was taken with six votes in favour and the single opposition vote was cast by IDBI sources said According to reports financial institutions such as ANZ Investment Bank Credit Suisse First Boston Citibank ABNAmro and the State Bank of India have on Wednesday advised Enron against terminating its PPA with MSEB MSEB chairman Vinay Bansal who with two other directors attended the meeting on Wednesday representing Maharashtras per cent stake in the near bi llion project said The Indian side told them that it would be unfortunate if Enron broke the contract While Bansal declined comment on the board decision the sources said the Indian side had expressed its interest to holds talks on the issue rather than terminating the project and there were possibilities of a fresh power purchase agreement between the company and t he state PTI THE ECONOMIC TIMES Friday Apr MSEB pays Rs cr under protest to DPC DESPITE the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head Maharashtra State Electricity Board on Thursday made a protest payment of Rs crore disputed amount towards March bill of Rs crore to Dabhol We were ready with the payment on Wednesday itself but DPC officials could not collect the cheque due to the statewide bandh a senio r MSEB official said We have disputed payment of Rs crore and it woul d be now taken up at the disputes resolution forum of which Enron India managing director K Wade Cline and Krishna Rao are members MSEB sources said Last week DPC had dashed off a communication to the government and MSEB th at it would not accept protest payments anymore Cline had said the energy major shall treat such payments as an election to pay the sums which MSEB in fact owed DPC in full and that the company would also not recognise the purported protest or reservation MSEB had paid a Rs crore February bill in protest last month On April last both domestic and internation al lenders of DPC had met in London and held exhaustive discussions the multinationals move to issue a termination notice to MSEB and state government PTI BUSINESS STANDARD Friday April Enron India MD authorised to terminate PPA The board of the Enronpromoted Dabhol Power Company DPC at its meeting in London on Wednesday authorised the managing director of Enron India to iss ue a notice for terminating the power purchase agreement to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board and the state government The board has authori sed Wade Cline to serve the termination notice However this does not mean tha t the termination notice will be served immediately It is only an enabling provision and will be used only if the situation arises a state govern ment source told Business Standard from London He said DPC was under pressure from its lenders The DPC spokesperson here refused to comment on the issue The hardening of the boards stand is in sharp contrast to the advice of DPCs lenders w ho had warned Enron not to precipitate matters by issuing a termination notice The lenders had arrived at a consensus that the termination notice need not be served at this stage Serving of the notice requires a nod from the lenders who have an exposure of about billion in the project Sources said given the lenders strong opposition to termination of the contract t he Enron boards enabling resolution did not have much significance beyond conveying a hardening of its stand with regard to the current imbroglio Th e Maharashtra Chief Minister had warned Enron not to scuttle the process of crisis resolution by issuing a termination notice The state government is to nominate an expert group to renegotiate the terms of the Dabhol contract Enron holds per cent in DPC while USbased GE and Bechtel hold per cent each The balance per cent is held by MSEB through a special purpos e vehicle Maharashtra Power Development Corporation The MSEB representative s were not allowed to vote at the meeting since they were an interested party The IDBI representative protested against the boards decision The meeting was attended by state energy secretary VM Lal The meeting was held against the backdrop of a dispute between MSEB and DPC over payment of bills After MSEB failed to pay Rs crore towards the December bill DPC invoked the state governments guarantee and then the Union governments counter guarantee When payment of the Rs crore January bill became overdue DPC again invoked the state governments guarantee MSEB retaliate d on January by slapping a Rs crore penalty for nonsupply of electricity at adequate levels It demanded that DPC adjust the bills again st this penalty This stand of MSEB was explained to DPC at the board meeting a state government official said The Centre also supported MSEBs stand an d refused to honour the counter guarantee The power company then invoked the political force majeure clause A process of conciliation and arbitration between the Centre and DPC is currently on THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS Friday April Foreign lenders slam brakes on disbursements to DPC Sanjay Jog Raghu Mo han Global banks comfortable with Enron pullout Lenders to the Dabhol Power Company DPC are a sharply divided lot International lenders in direct contrast to the stand taken by local ones led by the the Industrial Develoment Bank of India IDBI are categorical that additional assistance to DPCs phaseII will be held in abeyance de spite the completion of per cent of the project workThe stage is also set for a preliminary termination notice to be served by DPC to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB within the next four weeksThis follows the authorisation given to Enron Indias managing director K Wade Cline and DPC president CEO Neil McGregor to serve the termination notice and transfer notices to MSEB following Wednesdays DPC board meeting in London The essence of the message from the international lenders following the London meeting with DPC board is Emotions do not work Contractual obligations and payments have to be met We are convinced that the MSEB has failed to meet its obligations There is no point in Enron continuing with the project and the company should get out of itThe structuring of DPC s debt has created two classes of lenders In phaseI international lenders are covered by a sovereign guarantee while in phaseII no lender is However all lenders have a parri passu charge making attachment of assets a messy affair Sources in international banks were quick to point out that local lenders t o phaseII of the project are worried that an awry DPC project will affect their interests more given that they have no security other than asset s like a sovereign cover It was this desperation that made local lenders like IDBI slash the interest rates a few months back to per cent from per cent a leading foreign banker pointed outThree points that were m ade clear and stressed in no uncertain terms by international lenders were a there are contractual obligations b MSEB was not punctual in its payments to DPC and c MSEB adopted a confrontational position by slapping a Rs cro re rebate charge on DPC for misdeclaration and default on the availability of power While local lenders led by IDBI with MSEB parroting the same were of the view that the current situation is a temporary one international lenders were steadfast that pulling out of the project is the only way out This is despite the stance taken by IDBI and MSEB that authorisation for terminatio n given to Mr Cline and Mr McGregor was not called for International bankers pointed out that they will now have to look at the issue of charges and protection for their loans in the event of the power project being scrapped in its present formThe points of contention are a that phaseI of DPC is backed by a sovereign guarantee b phaseII is not and c to the extent tha t phaseII is covered by assets cancellation of phaseII may see all assets even those under phaseI getting attached Therefore an examination o n the segregation of assets under phaseI and phaseII is now warranted PTI adds In a significant move DPC board has empowered its management to sever power supply agreement with MSEB a move that could inflict a financi al liability of about Rs crore on the Centre A decision to authorise DPC president Neil McGregor to issue a termination notice to MSEB for sale of power was taken by the board at its meeting on Wednesday THE INDIAN EXPRESS Friday April Enron Dabhol chief gets powers to end deal with the MSEB THE BOARD of Dabhol Power Company a subsidiary of Houstonbased Enron Corp has decided to warn the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB that it intends to pull the plug on its Guhagarbased projectIn a board meeting he ld in London on Wednesday the board decided to authorise DPC President and CE O Neil McGregor and Enron Indias managing director K Wade Cline to serve a preliminary termination notice for sale of power to the MSE B within the next four weeksThe Dabhol project has been mired in disputes since MSEB began missing payments last year MSEB owes Dabhol Power million for power delivered in December and January The payment ran into a dispute aft er MSEB slapped penalty notices of Rs crore on DPC for its failure to supp ly power within three hours of the demand being placedBut MSEB has paid million for February And a payment of million was made for March on Thursday The billion Dabhol project is the largest foreign investment made in Ind ia to date Issuing the preliminary termination notice could enable Dabhol to suspend deliveries as it negotiates payment disputesWhile a preliminary termination notice is the first of three steps that could potentially lead to the abandonment of the project by Enron analysts have described the decisi on as a procedural move consistent with DPCs negotiating s trategy to recover overdue payments from the MSEB After the company issues the preliminary termination notice step two would be an official termination notice and step three would be a notice that th e company is surrendering control of the project If the project is terminate d the government of India will have to take a hit of million besides paying bills of Rs crore for the next one year to Enron as penalty Our Centres liability if Dabhol power project is terminated would be one years electricity bill and a termination fee of million Power Secretary A K Basu saidContractually the Centre will have to pay one year s electricity bill totalling at present prices about Rs crore and take over DPCs debt which stands at around million if the pr oject was terminated Basu said in Delhi Dabhol Power is in the process of completing the second phase of the megawatt powerplant project whic h is per cent through While the international lenders to the project are pressurising the company to get out of the project Indian lenders led by IDBI are asking the company to reconsider its decision on its termination notice During the meeting in London MSEB which holds a per cent stake in the project had strongly opposed DPCs move to authorise Cline and McGregor to issue not ices for termination MSEB Chairman Vinay Bansal and technical director Prem Paunikar both directors on the DPC board and the state principal secretary energy VM Lal an invitee to the board raised the issue at the board meeting in London MSEB claimed that DPC was needlessly threatening to issue various arbitration notices and thereby interpreting the clauses of PPA in isolationIn recent weeks Dabhol has raised the stakes in its spat with th e MSEB delivering a notice of political force majeure to Maharashtra a step typically invoked to dissolve a contract in case of an emergency like a war coup or a similar radical political event In this case DPCs move was viewed as a threat to stop providing electricityDPC has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power Critics object to the company charging Rs a kilowatthour for its power compared with around Rs a kilowatthour charged by other suppliers THE HINDU Friday April Offer of renegotiation too late Enron By Mahesh Vijapurkar MUMBAI APRIL The Enronsponsored Dabhol Power Company which last nigh t authorised its local management to issue a notice of termination of its Pow er Purchase Agreement PPA with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board has decided to keep a stiff upper lip This in turn has stoked speculation th at the switching off of power from its Phase I plant was imminent while in reality a lengthy procedure has to be followed as prescribed within the PP A As one source familiar with the PPA told The Hindu it is not sudden deat h of the project and in all probability the DPC vexed with the developments including sharp and pointed observations by the Godbole Committee has chosen to only arm itself with a serious option This woul d only eventually come into effect It is not an overnight operation and a lo t of legal work is involved Apparently the DPC intends to do some armtwisting At the board of directors meeting in London which Maharashtra was initiall y disinclined to attend but later used the forum to put across its contention s on the project the DPC squarely told the MSEB nominees on the board that t he offer of renegotiation had come rather too late It also said it did no t see any room for optimism about the outcome It did not however rule out the option of talks thus underscoring the possibility that the decision to authorise termination was a new weapon The Maharashtra Chief Minister Mr Vilasrao Deshmukh had hoped that DPC would not take any harsh step which would cause lot of damage to the interests of both the independent power producer and the Government and tod ay he expressed his dismay In fact the mandate of the team that went on the strength of its stake in the DPC was to put across the idea that negotiati on was the requirement and not confrontation Echo in LS The Enron issue also echoed in the Lok Sabha today where the Power Minister Mr Suresh Prabhu said that scrapping of the agreement would cost the Cent re Rs crores whose liability in the project agreement was limited The Centres liability in case of termination is one years electricity bill an d a termination fee of million Blow to FIs The termination could prove to be a serious blow to the Indian Financial Institutions FIs which under the leadership of the IDBI were trying to convince the other lenders of the project against the notice The exposure of Indian FIs in the project is understood to be not covered by any guarantee either of the Centre or the State THE TIMES OF INDIA Friday April Enron ready to pull out but lenders say wait The Dabhol Power Company board which met on Wednesday in London authorise d the company management to issue a termination notice to the Maharashtra Sta te Electricity Board The company however may not pull out of the project ye t considering its lenders who met on Monday opposed such a move and favoure d renegotiations Sources present during both the meetings said that though foreign lenders supported Enron on the termination issue domestic financia l institutions led by the Industrial Development Bank of India prevailed ov er the deliberations to oppose any such drastic move Enron needs the lenders consent to file a pretermination notice for pulling out from the project The decision to empower DPC chief Wade Cline to issue a termination notice was taken with six votes in favour against a single IDBI vote against such a move Another significant development during the entire proceedings was that the financial institutions made it clear that further funding of Phase II of th e project will depend on the Government of India assuring payment mechanisms Institutions are yet to disburse about per cent of the sanctioned packag e which is crucial for completing the Phase II expansion project The board has given powers to Wade Cline to issue a pretermination notice But the meeting quite unanimously felt the need of the hour is not to terminate the project but to initiate serious renegotiation proceedings said MSEB Chairman Vinay Bansal who attended the board meeting MSEB presented the ir views to the board members and it was understood by Enron which also includ ed the Rs crore penalty issue which is heading for arbitration proceedings We have also made it clear that the tariff structure of Enron is quite hi gh and a downward revision of tariffs is unavoidable Bansal added They cannot issue a termination notice without our consent since our exposure in the project is quite large and the lenders should approve any plans in that direction said a top banker who was present during the lenders meet There is a general consensus that the project must be completed and the proposal to terminate the PPA should be kept in abeyance he added The global arrangers for the DPC include ANZ Investment Bank Credit Suisse First Boston ABNAMRO Citibank and the State Bank of India where all these parties conducted separate meetings with the company officials However some bankers said the company can file a termination notice even if one lender with a minimum per cent exposure on the project favours such proceedings Meanwhile in a clear reversal of roles Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasra o Deshmukh said that the state government was not keen on terminating the PPA We will ask them to refrain from taking any such harsh steps since that would be bad news for all of us including DPC Deshmukh said Deshmukh w as echoing Union Power Minister Suresh Prabhus sentiments who said that the government wanted an amicable settlement of the payment row He however added that termination of the project would not hurt foreign investments a nd dismissed warnings by analysts that winding up the billion project wou ld be a blow to Indias efforts to woo foreign investors The DPC has already slapped one conciliation notice on the Centre and three arbitration notices on the state government over nonpayment of dues amounting to Rs crore and interest towards the bills due for December and January Meanwhile MSEB officials said in Mumbai that the March bills amounting to Rs crore was paid on Thursday as protest payment despite the dispute over the amount When asked on the future course of action Bansal said it was up to the DPC THE HINDU BUSINESSLINE Friday April DPC board authorises MD to issue PPA termination notice THE board of directors of Dabhol Power Company DPC has authorised the Managing Director Mr Neil McGregor to issue the notice of intent to terminate its power purchase agreement PPA with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB at an appropriate time The decision was taken at a board meeting held in London yesterday While MSEB which is an interested party was not allowed to vote it made a presentation clarifying its stand on the matter a senior State Government official said The resolution to authorise the management to issue the termination notice was carried by six votes to one IDBI voted against the decision the official said The serving of the preliminary termination notice will lead to a sixmonth suspension period According to clause of the Termination Procedure of the PPA Following the giving of a preliminary termination notice the parties shall consult for a period of six months o r such longer period as they may agree as to what step shall be taken with a view to mitigating the consequences of the relevant event having regard to all the circumstances IDBI and State Bank of India the principal Indian lenders had earlier persuaded the overseas lenders to hold their consent to the termination notice for some more time At least one lender has to consent for the compa ny to serve termination notice It is understood that overseas lenders are in favour of termination of the project and are prepared to consent However domestic lenders are worried about the security of their advances if the PP A is abandoned midway According to institutional sources Indian lenders are trying to get all th e parties concerned to thrash out outstanding issues The Maharashtra and Central Governments too are in favour of a conciliation Mr Vilasrao Deshmukh Chief Minister of Maharashtra yesterday went on record that the State did not want the project terminated Mr Yashwant Sinha Union Finance Minister is also understood to be of the same opinion The DPC will now have to decide what is the appropriate time to serve the notice the official said MSEB pays Rs crore Meanwhile MSEB has paid DPC Rs crore towards its March bill MSEB officials confirmed that the bill w as paid in protest today morning They DPC had billed us for an amount of Rs crore We do not agree with some of the items included a senior MSEB official said THE PIONEER Friday April Enron testing Maharashtras nerves T N Raghunatha Dabhol Power Company DPC has begun to put fresh pressure on the Maharasht ra State Electricity Board MSEB the Maharashtra State Government and the Centre for an early resolution to the prolonged dispute between them if th e DPC Board of Directors decision to authorise its managing director to serv e a contract termination notice to the MSEB is any indication The DPC Board in its meeting in London on Wednesday empowered the company management to sever its power supply agreement with MSEB a move that could inflict a financial liability of Rs crore on the Centre The decision to authorise the DPC management to issue a termination notice to MSEB was taken by a vote of six to one after the Maharasthra Government representatives were prevented from voting on the ground of interested party When contacted the companys Mumbaibased spokesperson Mr Jimmy Mogal declined to comment on the reports about the decision taken by the DPC Boar d We have nothing to say on the reports emanating from London We will expre ss our views after a few days he said However Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh on Thursday termed the DPC boards decision as unfortunate We have already requested the company not to take any harsh decision Mr Deshmukh said in Mumbai Official sources in the State Energy Ministry interpreted the DPC Boards decision as a pressure tactic employed by the Enron subsidiary to force the MSEB to clear the pending power bills without any further delay Through it s tough posture the DPC wants to make its position stronger before it can formally agree for renegotiations with the MSEB the Centre and the State Government for cutting the price of power supplied by it to the State electricity board The sources said that the DPCs reported decision to authorise its managing director to stop electricity supply to the MSEB did not mean that the Enron subsidiary would actually go ahead with the scrappi ng of the power contract with the MSEB If anything the DPCs reported decision is to mount additional pressure o n the MSEB for clearance of pending power bills and put itself in a stronger position in settling its dispute with the MSEB As part of its plan to arm itself with powers to break a contract in case situation goes beyond its control the DPC had recently served a political force majeure to the MSEB the Centre and the State Government the sources saidNot surprisingly th e DPCs London decision comes on the heels of the Maharashtra Governments decision to set up a highlevel committee comprising representatives of th e MSEB the Centre and the State Government to renegotiate with the Enrons subsidiary company for reducing the cost of power supplied to the State electricity boardMeanwhile amidst the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head the MSEB on Thursday made a protest payment o f the Rs crore disputed amount towards March bill of Rs crore to D PC riday April THE TELEGRAPH Friday April ENRON SIGNAL TO SWITCH OFF DABHOL POWER Enron today took the first decisive step out of the controversyridden Dabh ol Power Company when it won an authorisation from the companys board to s top sale of power to Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB The meeting of the company of which the Houstonbased energy giant holds per cent and the MSEB per cent was attended by state energy secretary V M Lal and MSEB technical director P Paunikar and it came days after its lende rs discussed payment problems and a possible terminationThe Centres liabi lity if Enron decides to snap the agreement will be a years power bill and a termination fee of million However the company will have to wait fo r six months from the day it serves the notice before it pulls the plugThe Centre shrugged off the move saying there would not be any adverse effect on foreign investment in power if Enron walks out We do not see FDI inflo ws into the power sector being hit power minister Suresh Prabhu saidMSEB officials said the ball is now in the court of DPC which said its corporat e policy did not allow it to comment on proceedings at board meetings The decision coincided with a Rs crore protest payment by the cash strapped power board as part of the March bill worth Rs crore There was speculation that MSEB coughed up the amount to cool frayed temper s at Enrons hub in Houston and because it was rattled by the sudden turn of events in the past few days during which the dispute had come to a head MS EB officials brushed away the allusions saying the cheque was ready on Wednesday but could not be handed over to DPC because of the statewide bandh We have a disputed payment of Rs crore which will be take n up at the disputeresolution forum a board official said Last week DPC told the state government and MSEB it would no longer accept protest payments in a move to fortify its legal position MSEB officials say Bechtel and General Electric the other partners who hol d around per cent in DPC are willing to go along with Enron Corp in terminating the deal but financial institutions such as IDBI are not game because it puts their loans at risk Investments made by Indian institution s are not covered under the Centres and states counterguarantees un like those made by international lendersMaharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh called Enrons decision unfortunate We had told state gove rnment officials attending the Enron board meeting to stop the company from windin g up its operations in the state as it will harm both parties THE STATESMAN Friday April Enron threatens to pull out The Enron crisis deepened with the Board of Directors of the Dabhol Power Company deciding to authorise the managing director Mr K Wade Cline to serve a notice of termination on the contract for the first phase of the billion power projectThe decision which could lead to the cessation of Dabhols power supply to the state was taken at the meeting held yester day in London according to reports quoting the chairman of the Maharashtra Stat e Electricity Board Mr Vinay Bansal While DPC officials refuse to comment on anything it is learnt that MSEB w as itself prepared to serve a legal notice of termination just two days before the meetingMSEB was said to have been dissuaded by the Nationalist Congres s Party president Mr Sharad Pawar and union power minister Mr Suresh Prabhu who had talks in New Delhi with the Maharashtra chief minister Mr Vilasrao Deshmukh and an MSEB delegation last Monday The state government has been served two arbitration notices while the Cent re is ready to go for conciliation with the DPC for failing to honour its counterguaranteeFurther the DPC has already slapped a notice of politica l force majeure which protects itself against undeserved claims in the event of exigencies that force it to take an extreme stepThe union power minister Mr Suresh Prabhu contended in Delhi that since DPC contributed only per cent of the total energy output of the country its termination would not have such a phenomenal impact on the power situation However if terminations proceedings go through Enron Corp a per cent shareholder in the Dabhol Power Company would stand to net a hefty amount in damages The union power secretary has been quoted as saying that termination of the DPC would cost the Centre Rs crore which is the total of one years electricity bill and a termination fee of milli on According to an energy analyst Mr Pradyumna Kaul the total liability woul d not cross Rs crore However Mr Prabhu said in the Lok Sabha today that the that scrapping of the agreement would cost the Centre Rs croreIt is learnt that on April Mr Deshmukh had given the goahead to the MSEB to prepare a legal notice to be issued to Enron during the meeting of the DPC s Board of Directors on Wednesday At the meeting the energy minister Padamsinh Patil energy secretary Mr Vinay Mohan Lal and MSEB chairman Mr Vinay Bansal were also presentThe notice was prepared over the past weeke nd and taken by the delegation when they called on Mr Prabhu on April However the politicians convinced them that Enron would not get tough giv en its huge stake in the project and that such a notice would not be necessar y The meeting thus ended with the decision to renegotiate the power tariff with Enrons consent Among those present at the London meeting were Mr Lal Mr Bansal and MSEB technical director Mr P Paunikar in their capacity as directors However they abstained from voting since they were deemed an interested party The only vote to go against the decision was that of the IDBI which is also represented on the board it is learntThe chief minister Mr Vilasrao Deshmukh said the state was not in favour of terminating the project This could mean that the latest manoeuvre to armtwist the Indian authorities could achieve its immediate target of getting the arrears accumulated over the past three months clearedThe MSEB owes Enron Rs crore for March and Rs crore for December and January The Centre today p ut up a brave face on Enrons decision saying there would not be any advers e effect on foreign investment in power sector in the country PTI reported from New Delhi There will be no adverse impact as a result of any action by any domest ic or foreign company As far as we are concerned there will be no adverse impact on FDI in power sector Power Minister Suresh Prabhu told reporters whe n asked about DPCs decision to authorise management to issue a terminatio n notice to MSEBEmphasising that there would be no fallout of such decision Prabhu said after the meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs we are expecting cooperation from many Scandinavian countries as well a s European nations in the power sectorIn fact not only the Power Ministe r but also the Prime Minister of Norway was here to inaugurate a seminar on power and he promised lot of cooperation in the sector MID DAY DPC may not wind up Maharashtra Chief Secretary V Ranganathan has said that though Neil McGrego r managing director of the Dabhol Power Corporation DPC has been given complete powers with regard to DPCs operations in the state including the authority to wind up operations it does not necessarily mean that McGregor will issue such a termination notice McGregor was given the powers at a meeting of the DPC board in London on Wednesday Ranganathan said that stat e officials including Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB Chairman Vinay Bansal and Power Secretary V M Lal have reported back to him about t he meeting in London With regard to the states failure to pay Enron Ranganathan said Bills are prepared as per the Power Purchase Agreement PPA and DPC owes some money to us Our people informed Enron officials about this In fact ther e was no reason to give powers to the MD to slap a termination noticeIn the London meeting MSEB and Industrial Development Bank of India IDBI representatives insisted that the DPC must pay Rs crore since it could not supply power whenever needed Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh has already termed as unfortunate the decision of the board of the Enronpromoted DPC to give McGregor powers to wind up operations Deshmukh added We have already requested Enron not t o take any harsh decisionDeshmukh had earlier said We have directed stat e Government officials attending the DPC board meeting to desist the energy company from winding up operations in the state as it would be harmful to both of us Enron officials are keeping mum on the issue McGregor said I am not goi ng to give any comment MID DAY April Enron offers no comment on renegotiation H S Rao A crucial meeting of the Board of Directors of the Dabhol Power Company DPC promoted by the US energy major Enron was held here yesterday apparently to discuss fate of its million power project in Maharashtra but there was no official word on the Indian and state Governments decisio n to renegotiate the contract An Enron spokesman declined to divulge what transpired at the meeting sayi ng the issues discussed at the meeting were confidential We have not received any direct communication Unless we get it and evaluate the detail s we have no comments to make the spokesman said when asked about the proposed decision on renegotiation of the project in which the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB has per cent stake Asked whether the Board had taken a decision on empowering DPC Managing Director Neil McGregor to wind up its operations in India the spokesman sa id he had nothing to say on them Enron has reportedly authorised Mcgregor to look at various options including selling the companys stake in DPC Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh said in Mumbai that the state Government would pay up the undisputed dues to the company He said the Maharashtra government is not in favour of terminating the MW projec t but wanted an amicable solution to the imbroglio MID DAY Friday April Committee to renegotiate Enron deal A committee to renegotiate the Power Purchase Agreement with the Dabhol Pow er Company will be appointed by this evening Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh said today Addressing media persons after his meeting with the noted socia l reformer Anna Hazare at his official residence Varsha Deshmukh said the committee would be formed by this evening or by tomorrow at the mostHe termed as unfortunate the Enron board decision empowering DPC chief Neil McGregor to serve a preliminary termination notice on the Maharashtra State Electricity Board and said the state was willing to negotiate the issue wit h power company Renegotiations will be held as per the suggestions made by the Godbole committee and the center will also depute its representative on the renegotiating committee We dont want to take any hasty decision Deshmuk h saidHe pointed that the only bone of contention with the DPC had been its expensive tariff and hoped that the issue would be resolved amicablyWhen pointed that the Enron board had taken a decision to serve the notice despi te stateF s willingness to appoint a renegotiating committee Chief Ministe r said it was unfortunate Earlier in his meeting with Hazare Deshmukh promised to make necessary amendments to the Right to Information law recently passed by the state so that the information was easily accessed by the common people He also gave a patient hearing to Hazare on his complaints of corruption in various state departments and promised action against guilty after a thorough inquiry within three months AFTERNOON APRIL ENRONS ON State govt to renegotiate Dabhol Power Project By Hubert Vaz The US power giant Enron Power Corporations willingness to wrap up the Dabhol Power Project and leave the shores may not actually materialise though the Dabhol Power Company chief Mr Wade Cline has been authorised to do so since the lenders for the project would have a decisive say in the matter Disclosing this Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh confirmed this morning th at the state government would churn out a compromise formula by which the powe r project at Dabhol could be continued and at the same time Enron did not fe el slighted Enron has not yet conveyed to us about this decision We are waiting for their letter he said When asked what sort of compromise the state government plans to forge Mr Deshmukh said Let our officers come back After that we will decide a future course of action But we are definitely going in for renegotiation of the project It is very difficult to predict the outcome of Enrons decision but as of now the project is still on When asked whether the project could be moved to another state if wou nd up from Maharashtra Mr Deshmukh said that was not possible as per the terms of the agreement between the US company and the state government However it was difficult for the project to move out of the state itself he indicated He also confirmed that both parties would face considerable loss es if the project was terminated The board of directors of the Dabhol Power Company which met in London on Wednesday decided to put an end to all controversies surrounding the proje ct once and for all by empowering the DPC chief to terminate the project if h e deemed it fit However this decision as of now does not necessarily indicate the death knell for the project The Enron project which had been riddled with controversies right from its inception had been a pretext for the political parties in the state to drag each other on the mat from time to time The previous SenaBJP government which had been out to terminate the project however chose to continue with it following renegotiations with Enrons top visiting officials like Ms Rebecca Mark And the Democratic Front government inherited the controversial project when the governments changed hands a year and a half ago Meanwhile State Energy Minister Dr Padamsinh Patil when contacted at the Osmanabad Circuit House said the state government and the central governme nt have decided to appoint a joint committee to renegotiate the project with Enron It is not easy for them to walk out of the project just like that They will have to go in for litigation and this would prove costly for both sides he said In case the project is terminated the government can stil l manage the power needs of the state though it would be a bit tough job he added

out of the Dabhol project Sucheta Dalal It is finally Quit India time for Enron Though the controversial multinational has denied plans to sell its stake in Dabhol Power Company DPC informed sources say that it has sent feelers to China Light Power and others to offload its majority holdingGetting out of India may be the best course for Enron Though it has threatened a fight and invoked politic al force majeure the Energy Review Committee headed by Madhav Godbole will certainly weaken its case The committee points out that the many infirmities in the DPC approval process brings into question the propriety of the decisions It is clear that the m that Enron spent on educating Indias policymakers and bureaucrats did not even teach them the basics of technoeconomic appraisal or due procedure with regard to large internation al contracts The committee says it is troubled with the failure of govern ance that seems to have characterised almost every step of the decision making process on matters relating to DPC The failure of governance has been broa d across different governments at different points of time at both the state and the central level and across different agencies associated with examining the project and at both the administrative and political levels It strains belief to accept that such widespread and consistent failure to execute assigned responsibilities is purely coincidental Though the committee decided that it is not the proper forum to investigate these infirmities its two key members Mr Godbole and former secretary in the Ministry of Finance EAS Sarma have asked for a judicial inquiry into the process of clearing the DPC project Other members felt a judicial inquiry would delay the negotiation process and not serve any purpose There may be some merit in an argument against a further delay in renegotiating tariffs or facilitating Enrons exit but the report certa inly provides the Central Vigilance Commission CVC with all the grounds that i t needs to start an investigation CVC N Vittal has already received innumerable requests to investigate the deal especially the beneficiaries of its education campaign Though the political establishment may be reluctant to set up a judicial inquiry the CVC can establish whether there are lapses on the part of government functionaries including political executives and ensure appropriate action against them If it is indeed able to establish undue influence in signing the contract then Maharashtra may be able to get out of a deal patently against the public interest without any monetary liability The Godbole committee has vindicated the stand of antiEnron activists who have been opposed it since negotiations began in It establishes that Enron power is expensive per se and the project needs to be renegotiated regardless of the causes for the Maharashtra State Electricity Boards MSEB financial distress Also that DPCs extortionate tariffs are not merely because of the steep rise in petroproduct prices and rupee depreciation b ut mainly on account of its sweetheart deal with the state government Enron s contract is clearly onesided it deliberately uses expensive raw material ignoring World Bank warnings has worked on fanciful demandsupply estimates and several legal requirements and permissions In fact the committee has found that the MSEB has been paying Enron Rs crore more than it should every year This comprises overcharging of Rs crore on account of the large regassification plant of which only per ce nt of the capacity is used for DPC Theres also a Rs crore extra billi ng to the MSEB for shipping and harbour charges although the cost of these facilities had been included in the capital recovery charge By charging mo re than twice the operations maintenance rate stipulated by the government o f India Enron collects approximately Rs crore extra every year It has also been collecting Rs crore every year through inflated fuel consumption claims Enron has been charging at kcalkwh under the powe r purchase agreement PPA although the equipment manufacturer has guaranteed it a much lower consumption rate This gives it a fat fuel arbitrage opportunity at the cost of the people of Maharashtra The committee has also pointed to the strange practice of using four different exchange rates for different aspects of the project negotiation a rate of Rs per dollar was assumed for calculating debt service of rupee loans Rs per dollar as reference rate for PhaseI Rs per dolla r as reference rate for PhaseII and a curious Rs per dollar for calculati ng Government of India tariff Forcing a reduction of these excessive charges has nothing to do with contract cancellation All it needs is tough negotiation and public pressure on the political establishment The Godbole committee has established that DPCs tariffs can easily be h alved if excess payments are eliminated and unfair conditions such as the dollarisation of payments the takeorpay clause and escrow facility whic h is in fact hampering MSEBs reform particularly in power distribution a re scrappedThe security of future payments to DPC under the restructured tari ff would be based on increased cash flows from a reformed distribution system The committee also gives Enron a difficult escape route It says that if th e multinational finds the conditions for restructuring too onerous it should free MSEB from its contractual obligations and find buyers outside Maharashtra The committee has tried to establish another precedent on all projects negotiated by government The public has a right to know what is being contracted on their behalf and has recommended that all documents including contracts related to all Independent Power Projects IPPs particularly DPC should be published by the Maharashtra government within two months Also having established that demandsupply estimates by the state governme nt were fanciful the committee has asked MSEB to defer all negotiations with power producers until demand levels in the state permit full absorption of power generation from such IPPs It recommends that such negotiations shoul d be in accordance with the leastcost plan spelt out by the report This should also end the hectic lobbying by Reliance Patalganga Mittals Bhadravati the BSES Saphale and others to set up IPPs in Maharashtra THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS April DPC board set to authorise president Enron MD to issue notice of termination Sanjay Jog Scrapping of Power Purchase Agreement The board of directors of Dabhol Power Company DPC which has already tak en an aggressive posture has proposed to authorise the Enron India managing director K Wade Cline and DPC president and chief executive officer Neil McGregor to issue notices for the termination of power purchase agreement PPA and transfer of Dabhol project in view of continuing default by the state and Central governments and Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB The board of directors which would meet on April in London also plans to appoint Mr Cline as its true and lawful Attorneyinfact and author ise him to represent the company in the negotiation of all project contracts and financing agreements and their amendments and modificationsTop sources tol d The Financial Express that DPC would authorise Mr Cline andor Mr McGregor to serve the preliminary termination notices and transfer notices to the state and Central governments and MSEB under clause and schedule of the PPA In response to the continuing default by the MSEB of its payment obliga tions under the PPA the failure of the Government of Maharashtra to honour obligations under its guarantee and state support agreement and failure of the Government of India to honour obligations under its counter guarantee the company has sought recourse to dispute resolution and has initiated conciliation and arbitration proceedings the company resolution said Consistent with this recourse to contractual remedies the company now seeks the authority to serve preliminary termination notices and transfer notices pursuant to clause and schedule of the PPA from time to time and at a ny time upon the occurrence of an event giving rise to its right to serve such notices as determined by the company the resolution added According to the resolution the directors the company secretary and officers of the company and each of them acting individually are authorise d and empowered to execute and deliver such documents and instruments and tak e such other actions as they deem fit to effect the purpose of the resolution in the name and for and on behalf of the company Against this backdrop th e state government and MSEB have been exploring the possibilities of issuing termination notice to the DPC for its failure to meet the contractual obligations under the PPA The state government and MSEB sources said that such a notice could be served by the MSEB as DPC has not paid the rebate penalty of Rs crore for misdeclaration and default on the availabilit y of power on January and February The state government and MSEB which reviewed its position on Saturday at a meeting convened by the Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh are of the view that they have a strong case and substantial grounds to slap the terminatio n notice to the DPC The DPCs move to appoint Mr K Wade Cline as its true and lawful Attorneyinfact deserves importance especially when the state government proposes to set up a negotiating committee to cut the per unit cost and gauge the possibility of sale of Dabhol power to the power deficit states Mr Cline would also be authorised to dispose of equipment that is worn out or obsolete or other equipment or fuel no longer expected to be used in the ordinary course in amounts exceeding Rs crore or the equivalent in forei gn currency in any financial year Furthermore Mr Cline would be in a positio n to enter into contracts and take any other actions for purpose relating to the daytoday operation of the companys business or exercise its right s and discharge its obligations under the project contracts and the financing agreements BUSINESS STANDARD Monday

issue of serving a termination notice to the Maharshtra State Electricity Board MSEB DPC cannot go ahead with this unless it gets the go ahead from the lenders While bankers said the lenders meeting is about the second phase of the project which is still under construction state government officials clarified that since there is only one PPA covering both phases of the project the lenders decision will be applicable to the existing Phase I also The second phase of the project involves MW generation capacity whereas Phase I of MW is already operationalAccording to the loan agreement even if only four per cent of the lenders agree to terminate the contract then DPC can do so highly placed sources in the lenders consortium said from London This in effect means that only one lender has to agree for DPC to serve a preliminary termination noticeFollowing the notice there is a cooling off period of six months for both parties the MSEB and DPC to find a mutually acceptable solution which may take the form of a renegotiated PPA source s added Sources also said that there are two separate meetings scheduled wit h lenders The Monday meeting will be attended by all the lenders

Centre had decided to assist Maharashtra upto Rs crore every year to improve customer services OUTLOOK Monday April The Real Story Of Dabhol If a judicial probe suggested by the committee i s ordered into the Enron deal it could embarrass three governments RANJIT BHUSHAN The Committee has prima facie found infirmities in several decisions taken in respect of the Enron project at different points of time by successive governments and agencies in the Centre and state Energy Review Committee headed by former home secretary Madhav Godbole This could well be the real Enron story A fivemember highpowered committee headed by Madhav Godboleand includ ing former Union economic affairs secretary EAS Sarma hdfc chairman Deepak Parekh teri chairman RajendraPachauri and Maharashtra government official Vinay Mohan Lalhas recommended a judicial probe into the entire Enron p ower project deal saying it signified the utter failure of governance that seem s to have characterised almost every step of the decisionmaking process relating to the Dabhol project The report which was submitted to the Maharashtra government last fortnight and has been acquired by Outlook is severely critical of former chief minister Sharad Pawar with the Congress then the day bjpled Union government which reworked the deal in Shiv Sena supremo Balasaheb Thackeray and his government in Maharashtra headed by Manohar Joshi The utter failure of governance seems to have characterised almost every step of decisionmaking relating to the Dabhol project Madhav Godbole Committee Report An investigation if ordered could embarrass at least these three governments The report clearly upholds the allegations of money being paid by Enron to politicians and bureaucrats for clinching the deal According to t he committee the deal reveals failure of governance both at the Centre and state and across different agencies It strains belief to accept that suc h widespread and consistent failure to execute responsibilities is purely coincidental the report said proposing a set of measures to be implement ed if something of the project was to be retrieved Godbole and Sarma also fel t that the panel should categorically recommend the government of India to order a judicial inquiry This was finally adopted by it Says a Congress leader Enron could well become the biggest political issue in Maharashtra and put to question liberalisation particularly in the power sector The proposal has already struck panic Says ncps Praful Patel If the Enr on decision has at all been detrimental it is because of the haste with which phase was cleared by the Shiv Senabjp government Now with the state having already entered into an agreement with Enron the important thing is to resolve it amicably A judicial inquiry will be an eyewash because its not an issue of corruption but that of perception Promarket Congressmen privately admit that it was their governments at the Centre and the state which invited Enron even though the second phase was cleared by the bjpShiv Sena combine Says Congress spokesperson Jaipal Reddy Right now were too involved with the Parliament deadlock over Tehelka Proliberalisation Congress MPs also fear that such witchhunting could send wrong signals to foreign investors NonCongress MPs from Maharashtra meanwhile claim that the Godbole Committee was instituted wit h the express purpose of politicising the Enron issue I think I know Vilasr ao Deshmukhs gameplan says an MP from the state But some MPs like Congress Prithviraj Chavan question the cloak of secrecy thats surrounded the deal Ive maintained for long that there should be a judicial committee to examine this The committee report also says that had the Enron project been subjected to a technoeconomic appraisal as envisaged under provisions of the Electricity supply Act of and related legislations the infirmities could have bee n avoidedSince this wasnt done questions about a concerted effort towards exercising undue influence at every stage of the project are bound to arise the exhaustive page report points out Id highlight the speed with which the day Vajpayee government cleared the project minutes before it quit says Congress MP Prithviraj Chavan The Enron project had been held out as an exemplar of the impending liberalisation in the early s and despite several controversies is now an established power project at Dabhol km south of Mumbai In July Enron signed an MoU with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board mseb to set up a MW station as part of the governments fast track projects Subsequently when the ShivSenabjp came to power in Maharashtra it filed a writ against the project This curiously led to renegotiations with Enron The committee has quoted a Bombay High Court order on the renegotiated deal Once it GoM decided to revive the project it acted in the very same manner its predecessors in office had done It forgot all about competitive bidding and transparency The speed with which the negotiating group studie d the project and made its proposal for renegotiatons which was accepted by Dabhol is unprecedented Says Chavan I would particularly like to highlight the speed with which the day Vajpayee government at Centre endorsed the renegotiated project minutes before it resigned Since the commissioning of the plant in May the mseb has paid Rs crore for the power it has bought from Dabhol If the same watttage of powe r had been bought from Indianbuilt power plants fired by indigenous coal th e payment would have been approximately Rs crore In the first yearandahalf of its operation itself the dpc had drained the Maharashtr a exchequer of nearly Rs crore The Central Electricity Authority cea in fact pointed out that the Dabh ol plant was not the least costly option The mseb had other inexpensive alternatives like the four units of Kaparkheda but they were in a preliminary stage The report notes if the mseb had made efforts to seriously pursue these projects they might not have remained in their preliminary stages It adds that the members were of the opinion that the mseb and the Maharashtra government erred seriously based on information available at that time in proceeding with the dpc as a baseload factor ev en when its capacity was reduced The failure seems to have been compounded b y the laxity of the Union power ministry finance ministry and the cea It quotes the cea as saying that since the Union finance ministry found the tariff reasonable no further examination was required Strangely Bal Thackerays Shiv Sena when it came to power together with t he BJP in Maharashtra filed a writ in the court and then renegotiated the dea l After the new Shiv Senabjp government took over its CM Manohar Joshi appointed a renegotiating committee in which made the right noises actually managing to reduce the tariff But certain things remained inexplicable No fresh clearances were required from the cea which also sa id that since no cost increase was involvedfresh formal clearance wasnt necessary Says the committee This only adds strength to the suspicion that the cea didnt consider the economic aspects of the project at all Indeed given the nonavailability of any official record of the meeting on June with the Committee and the nature of this letter dated December the Committee is doubtful whether the economic aspects o f dpc were discussed at all The credibility of the Shiv Senabjp government has been seriously questioned The Committee finds it unexplicable sic why there was no mention of any reduction in capital cost of the project from million to million as agreed by dpc in the summary report of the renegotiati ng committee the panel observesSays lawyer Prashant Bhushan It is strange that the Shiv Senabjp government first filed a writ in the court and then coolly renegotiated the deal The committee further spells out the losses incurred through the deal Subsequent to the commissioning of the dpc the financial deterioration of mseb has been rapid While the mseb was in profi t in it plunged into huge losses of Rs crore in Significantly the World Bank in had predicted the systems inherent weaknesses In a letter written to the then power secretary R Vasudevan a top bank official had said that after a detailed review of the analytical framework and costing assumptions we reconfirm our earlier conclusion that the Dabhol project as presently formulated is not economically justified and that in our assessment the project is too large to enter the mseb syst em in The proposed baseload operation could result in uneconomic plant dispatch as already existing lower variable cost coal power would be replaced by the higher cost lng power Enrons persistence and the gullibility of the Indian side can be gauged from highranking Enron official Joe Suttons letter to a key Indian official Ajit Nimbalkar I recently met with the World Bank and have been following the articles in the India papers I feel that the World Bank opinion can be changed Well engage a PR firm and hopefully manage the med ia from here on The project has solid support from all other agencies in Washington The key question in the Enron deal is whether a developed state like Maharashtra needs outside intervention in the power sector at all For the first time the Godbole committee has raised objections about the viability of such a project According to the report the mseb has been one of the bette r performing boards in the country and has despite a faulty transmission and distribution T and D system managed to consistently earn net revenue surpluses on an accrual basis Maharashtra accounts for nearly onefourth of the gross value of Indias industrial sector Its one of the few states to achieve per cent electrification Since the mseb has been adding to its generation Th is improvement which has been largely due to renovation and modernisation undertaken by the mseb exceeded its own expectations at a time when the dp c was being considered the report points out Following a policy of crosssubsidy roughly nine out of its ten users are subsidised But the gap between the average cost of supply and average realisation hasn t been much In fact the subsidy claim decreased from Rs crore in to Rs crore in until in it increased nearly fivefol d to Rs crore due to the sudden increase in the gap by paise per uni t from to paisean increase of per cent The increase in the su bsidy claim by Rs crore is due to the increase in the gap principally becau se of the increase in power purchase costs says the committee adding Without the dpc and without problems of T and D loss the mseb could be financially healthy But can that happen now since Enron is here to stay The committee has come up with some farreaching recommendations make public all Dabholrelated documents and agreements restructure the Dabhol project itself to bring do wn the cost of power restructure dpc financially allow sale of dpc power outside Maharashtra reexamine ppas in accordance with leastcost plans a nd thoroughly reform the msebThe committee know this can become reality only with political consensus and through forming of public opinion The questio n is can that be achieved in an unstable political environment With Priya Sahgal Making Of A Scam Centre invites Enron to set up

Company DPC monthly financial burden issue now a topic of discussion among arbitrators on the negotiating table the MSEB has turned to putting its house in order As if to ward of any criticism of its fiscal condition that could be termed as the facilitator to the entire DPC tariff crisis the state electricity board has put matters relating to its performance on record For instance MSEB has recorded the highest power generation in the year ended March at units compared with the previous years units making it the top SEB of the country in this respect Similarly its power stations recorded the highest availability percentage at up from per cent last fiscal Plant load factor is up to per cent compared with per cent in The Parli power station has recorded the highest ever generation in the ten years of its life time in at million units which made it eligibl e for the meritorious productivity award under the eligibility guidelines issued by the Government of India carrying a cash award of Rs lakh Al l other power stations in the state without exception also fulfill the eligibility criteria for the cash award a senior MSEB official said Similarly the Chandrapur power station became the first power station of a ny state electricity board to get the ISO certification A senior MSEB official said Earlier MSEB was suffering from too much interference in its day to day functioning The agriculturists were touted as the major reason for its deteriorating accruals while theft of electricity during the transmission and distribution stage was conveniently camouflaged under this head In the recent past the government has authorised MSEB to take steps to curb this misuse of power by its own officials many of whom including a chief engineer have suffered suspensions

would be able to renegotiate the Dabhol power project promoted by the US energy major Enron may turn out to be misplaced The US energy major says that the Godbole committees suggest ions were unacceptable In response to a query from ET the company said in a statement that the published terms of the Godbole report do not repres ent an acceptable basis for further discussions The statement said that i t would be meeting the committee next week as a matter of courtesy Since the purpose of our meeting is to hear out the committee and understand thei r thoughts we will not present any proposals the statement said Accord ing to highlyplaced sources in the government the company has informed the Madhav Godbole panel that it would be meeting on May Earlier reports ha d indicated that the discussions with the panel would take place on May According to sources Enron would be meeting the panel with representatives of its lenders and shareholders The Godbole committee that studied the current power purchase agreement has called for cancellation of the presen t tariff structure renegotiation of the LNG and shipping contract removal o f dollar denomination as far as fixed charges of the tariff is concerned deb t restructuring and the formation of a committee to renegotiate the power purchase agreement These suggestions it seems may not be acceptable to Enron The Maharashtra government accepted the report and asked the Godbole committee to renegotiate The committee has been given a months time to renegotiate on behalf of the state government with DPC for a new PPA The committee has opined that since the LNG facility of mmpta is far in excess of what is required by the plant only mmpta of which mmpta is on take or pay it should be separated into a distinct facility whose capital costs should not be reflected in the fuel charge not as take or pa y It should instead be only in proportion to the fuel regassified for the pow er generation Using the entire allocated gas requires an unusually high PLF Instead the surplus gas can be sold to other players like Petronet or Enro n s own Metgas It is important to distribute the cost over the entire capacity and not just the amount sold to the power plant says the committee Similarly it has been suggested that Enron could lease out the harbour facilities as a common facility to other LNG importers On the LNG contract negotiated by Enron for longterm supplies it has said that since the LNG market has witnessed great changes particularly as far as prices a re concerned the power company should take advantage of spot buys and renegotiate the contract accordingly THE TIMES OF INDIA Friday May Enron ready to take part in PPA talk Nitin Yeshwantrao The Enron management has finally agreed to participate in a discussion with the Madhav Godboleled renegotiation committee setup to facilitate the restructuring of the Power Purchase Agreement PPA signed between the US power major and the state governmentOfficials of Dabhol Power Company DPC a subsidiary of Enron alongwith their team of shareholders and lenders will arrive here on May for talks with the ninemember Godbole panelThough the DPC spokesperson was reluctant to give a confirmation a k ey Mantralaya official told The times of India that the team had expressed willingness for talks with the experts committee in a bid to end the imbroglio Enrons response is viewed as a welcome development to amicably resolve the controversy which had been raging for the last few weeks with the board of directors of Enron authorising its India MD K Wade Cline to serve a termination notice to MSEB The state government on its part too adopted a confrontational position by slapping a Rs crore rebate charge on DPC fo r defaulting on power supplyHowever the sudden change of heart by the Enron management is largely attributed to the stand taken by its local lenders le d by Industrial Development Bank of India IDBI which had recently opposed t he move to pull out of the project This was in contradiction to the stand tak en by the foreign lenders of the DPC who were in favour of slamming the brakes on disbursement of funds to DPC The Congressled Democratic Front governme nt had publicly declared that it would impress upon the Enron management to renegotiate the PPA as scrapping the project would not be in the interest o f both the parties Last week the state government constituted a ninemember panel of experts under former bureaucrat Madhav Godbole Godbole had written to the DPC management inviting it for talks to renegotiate the PPA on May For the delayed response from Enron the meeting has been rescheduled to May The issues which would be debated at the meeting include the separation of the LNG facility from the power plant renegotiating LNG supply and shipping agreements redefining the DPC tariff and to convert it into a twopart tariff The Godbole panel will bargain hard for removal of dollar denomination in the fixed charge component and to allow the Maharashtra government to sell power to third parties THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS Friday May DPC team to appear before Godbole panel on May A

receive proposal on Enron Thursday Jan todayinfrhtm Untie Them Editorial Thursday Jan THE GOVERNMENT of Maharashtra wants New Delhi to convince the Power Trading Corporation a central utility to buy power from Dabhol and sell it across the countryIt would be far simpler if Dabhol and all independent power producers were allowed to sell power to whoever was willing to pay for itThat unfortunately is not allowed by law which forces private sector generators to sell power only to state utilities which in turn are not permitted to sell power across states on their own Most state electricity boards are bankrupt MSEB reportedly owes central utilities Rs crore They cannot bring themselves to charge many types of users for the power consumed nor can they prevent largescale theft of electricity Few including wealthy Maharashtra have the will to reform state electricity boards and privatise transmission and distribution Given this profile of buyers private generators demand sovereign guarantees to help them tide over default risks But the guarantees merely insulate IPPs against risk They cannot make SEBs solvent Yet India needs power desperately Maharashtra Indias richest state experiences power short ages of around MW about a sixth of its peak needs Over time the hunger for power will only grow India cannot afford to wait for the painful politics of SEB reform to work themselves out The governme nt should bring in legislation that allows IPPs to sell power directly to payi ng customersThis will free IPPs from the clutches of bankrupt monopsony buyer s The power trading legislation will have unexpectedly happy consequences for the government tooOnce IPPs are freed from their onerous obligations to se ll power to single mostly bankrupt buyers their default risks will come down substantially New Delhi and state governments should then scrap the guarantees that they gave IPPs in the past The combination of power trading private investments in generation transmission and distribution and gradual SEB reform will create a commercial workable and competitive power market in India Anything less will be a recipe for disaster State not to give tax sops to DPC for buying naphtha from IOC Sanjay Jog Thursday Jan The Maharshtra governments finance department which is striving to reduce fiscal deficit from Rs crore to Rs crore by the beginning of April this year has expressed its inability to provide a sales tax waiver to the Dabhol Power Company DPC on the procurement of million tonne of naphtha from the staterun Indian Oil Corporation IOC Mantralaya sources told The Financial Express on Wednesday that DPC would have to pay per cent sales tax The government way back in has modified the sales tax rate to per cent to discourage the import of napht ha from Gujarat by electrical companies operating in Maharashtra The decision was taken with a view to encouraging electrical companies to procure naphth a at reduced rates within the state government sources added Sources said that these companies had to pay nearly per cent sales tax on naphtha that was procured from Gujarat However following their representation th e government slashed the sales tax rate to per cent The state finance departments opinion which would be presented before the state cabinet shortly in order to take a final decision deserves special significance especially when the state energy department and the lossmakin g Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB have wholeheartedly supported th e DPCs cause and recommended the sales tax waiver DPC which was asked by t he Union ministry of oil and petroleum to procure naphtha within the country i n view of excess availability in its presentation to the state government an d to MSEB had made it clear that it would be left with no alternative but to pass on the additional burden on the MSEB which would be ultimately passed on to its consumers DPC had also told the state government that it had not pa id sales tax on the procurement of naphtha from Glencore in the calender year Sources from the state energy department and MSEB have stressed on the need for such a waiver while expressing their inability to bear additional burde n They have suggested that the state should reciprocate by offering a sales t ax exemption to DPC because the IOC at the behest of the Centre has tried to match the international landing price of naphtha during the recently signed memorandum of agreement with DPC If the state finance department sticks t o its views it may hurt the state as a whole sources from the state energy department and MSEB saidDPC will procure naphtha at Rs per ton from IOC during the calender year as compared to the Rs per tonne price quoted by Glencore The naphtha price comprises per tonne free o n board FOB per cent of customs duty per cent of sales tax and of premium DPC senior vice president Mukesh Tyagi reiterated that the company has already made an appeal to the state government for the sales tax waiver on naphtha in the larger interest of the consumers Sales tax is a pass throu gh and MSEB which will have to bear the additional burden will pass it on th e consumers he added Centre yet to receive proposal on Enron Thursday Jan CENTRE on Wednesday said that it had not recevied any proposal from Maharashtra government seeking help to solve the tangle with

Corporation to buy power from the Dhabol Power Corporation Prabhu replied what will the PTC do with the power Prabhu had earlier asked the state government to study the matter before approaching the centre for payment of dues MSEB had earlier declined to pi ck up its per cent stake in phase II of the mw project The Enron issu e has been hanging fire with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board unable t o clear the dues of DPC as a result of the skyrocketing prices of Naphtha infact MSEB has asked DPC to backdown completely leading to a situation whe re DPC has stopped production at the

closely to convey the right impression For NKSingh clearly there are three things you would try to convey A description of the problem Some of the resultant consequences if it is not solved soon enough and Conveying the fact that there are winwin solutions well within the GoIs power to implement that would in fact enhance his reputation and the countrys as one that lives up to its reputation I would be careful to make the point that we are NOT going to give up any value but are willing to be accomodative to MSEB GoM and GoI needs either through financial reengineering or through getting direct access to the market in some areas This will also fly well with Enron management that is more comfortable with market risks than political Describing the Problem DPC has a PPA backed by GoI GoM guarantees for one of the most high profile projects in the world Worlds largest gas fired power plant Indias first LNG terminal gateway to providing clean reliable energy for all of western India development of Konkan With coming of Phase II due end cost of power from Dabhol will be more competitive than any other liquid fuel fired plant low heat rates larger turbines spreading of infrastructure costs over a larger base use of LNG as fuel Our average tariff at despatch is Rs kWh for Phase I This goes down to Rs kWh with coming in of Phase II Compare this with NTPCs own Kayamkulam plant having a tariff of Rs for same range of crude prices barrel Hence DPC power is competitive our standards of performance are higher penalties for nonperformance are greater and as a private player our place in the waterfall seems to be lower quote the fact that while we have been delayed in payment by days MSEB has made all of its other payment commitments However monthly outflows could be as much as Rs Crmonth MSEBs monthy collections not improving are in the range of Rs Crmonth MSEB and GoM clearly do not have the resources in the short run yrs to meet these obligations hence Central intervention is needed In a grid of MW Maharashtra grid size absorbing an additional MW Phase II at one go is difficult however if we take Western Region grid size is MW Clearly absorbing all the power in that framework is much easier To this if we add Northern and Southern grids we can probably evacuate out another MW through the interconnects Hence there is definitely value in looking at this issue at a national level Additionally it is not just solvable at that level but actually answers to the crying need for power in the country and hence is a boon for the govt and should be treated as such Consequences of Not Solving the Problem We can call upon the sovereign guarantee which will cover our partial payments However this would almost definitely lead to a deterioration of the countrys credit rating put back incoming investments into the Petroleum sector where private participation program is about to be unveiled in OG blocks telecom sector where a new policy has been announced months ago and where foreign companies are looking favorably at investing It is likely to put India on the backlist of many international banks including export credit agencies of US Japan and Belgium an EEC member It would bring to the knees many prominent Indian banks Indian lenders to the project include IDBI ICICI SBI to metion just a few Would completely stop any new investment into the power sector where there is urgent need for funding especially te new initiatives in transmission There is a timeline for solving this since our project is coming before yearend and hence we cannot wait for the slow pace of reform to take place at the SEB and state level WinWin Solutions Exist Northern region is power starved south needs power badly Hence it is a boon to have this power made available in the timeframe With Central govt intevention it is possible to solve th problem to everyones mutual benefit MW incremental Phase II is only of the capacity existing in the Western Region and can be easily absorbed WinWin Solutions exist by Restructuring some of the guarantees Adding some central govt entity including those from the petroleum sector IOC or GAIL interested due to LNG trml to the equity mix at par Backending tariff and other financial reengineering solutions that could involve Indian banks taking a greater share of the debt et etc Bottom Line Time is of essence we need to get someone to negotiate with Please use your good offices to quickly form a representative group that includes Central State govt and SEB representatives so that we can work on the solution Without active participation from PMs office we are likely to waste precious time bouncing between the SEB GoM and various Ministries of GoI Hope this helps Regards

hopefully have a useful day with Henwood folks tomorrow I look forward to being in Houston possibly by the end of the coming week Hope you and the team are doing well Regards Sandeep Forwarded by Sandeep KohliENRONDEVELOPMENT on AM Sandeep Kohli AM To Wade ClineENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Subject Points for Singh Meet Wade Please find below a brief note on what I feel your tack should be with NKSingh who is supposed to be a hard negotiator I am assuming here that this will be more of an introductory meeting where both sides are feeling out the other The two meetings I had arranged over the weekend would hopefully have given you a better idea of the thinking of at least these two people o the issue Incidentally in the Indian system the Governor of any state is a Central government nominee He is the eyes and ears of the Central govt in the state Please see Basaks meeting in that light The message he takes will likely go directly to the PMO in Delhi I will therefore be working closely to convey the right impression For NKSingh clearly there are three things you would try to convey A description of the problem Some of the resultant consequences if it is not solved soon enough and Conveying the fact that there are winwin solutions well within the GoIs power to implement that would in fact enhance his reputation and the countrys as one that lives up to its reputation I would be careful to make the point that we are NOT going to give up any value but are willing to be accomodative to MSEB GoM and GoI needs either through financial reengineering or through getting direct access to the market in some areas This will also fly well with Enron management that is more comfortable with market risks than political Describing the Problem DPC has a PPA backed by GoI GoM guarantees for one of the most high profile projects in the world Worlds largest gas fired power plant Indias first LNG terminal gateway to providing clean reliable energy for all of western India development of Konkan With coming of Phase II due end cost of power from Dabhol will be more competitive than any other liquid fuel fired plant low heat rates larger turbines spreading of infrastructure costs over a larger base use of LNG as fuel Our average tariff at despatch is Rs kWh for Phase I This goes down to Rs kWh with coming in of Phase II Compare this with NTPCs own Kayamkulam plant having a tariff of Rs for same range of crude prices barrel Hence DPC power is competitive our standards of performance are higher penalties for nonperformance are greater and as a private player our place in the waterfall seems to be lower quote the fact that while we have been delayed in payment by days MSEB has made all of its other payment commitments However monthly outflows could be as much as Rs Crmonth MSEBs monthy collections not improving are in the range of Rs Crmonth MSEB and GoM clearly do not have the resources in the short run yrs to meet these obligations hence Central intervention is needed In a grid of MW Maharashtra grid size absorbing an additional MW Phase II at one go is difficult however if we take Western Region grid size is MW Clearly absorbing all the power in that framework is much easier To this if we add Northern and Southern grids we can probably evacuate out another MW through the interconnects Hence there is definitely value in looking at this issue at a national level Additionally it is not just solvable at that level but actually answers to the crying need for power in the country and hence is a boon for the govt and should be treated as such Consequences of Not Solving the Problem We can call upon the sovereign guarantee which will cover our partial payments However this would almost definitely lead to a deterioration of the countrys credit rating put back incoming investments into the Petroleum sector where private participation program is about to be unveiled in OG blocks telecom sector where a new policy has been announced months ago and where foreign companies are looking favorably at investing It is likely to put India on the backlist of many international banks including export credit agencies of US Japan and Belgium an EEC member It would bring to the knees many prominent Indian banks Indian lenders to the project include IDBI ICICI SBI to metion just a few Would completely stop any new investment into the power sector where there is urgent need for funding especially te new initiatives in transmission There is a timeline for solving this since our project is coming before yearend and hence we cannot wait for the slow pace of reform to take place at the SEB and state level WinWin Solutions Exist Northern region is power starved south needs power badly Hence it is a boon to have this power made available in the timeframe With Central govt intevention it is possible to solve th problem to everyones mutual benefit MW incremental Phase II is only of the capacity existing in the Western Region and can be easily absorbed WinWin Solutions exist by Restructuring some of the guarantees Adding some central govt entity including those from the petroleum sector IOC or GAIL interested due to LNG trml to the equity mix at par Backending tariff and other financial reengineering solutions that could involve Indian banks taking a greater share of the debt et etc Bottom Line Time is of essence we need to get someone to negotiate with Please use your good offices to quickly form a representative group that includes Central State govt and SEB representatives so that we can work on the solution Without active participation from PMs office we are likely to waste precious time bouncing between the SEB GoM and various Ministries of GoI Hope this helps Regards

receive proposal on Enron Thursday Jan todayinfrhtm Untie Them Editorial Thursday Jan THE GOVERNMENT of Maharashtra wants New Delhi to convince the Power Trading Corporation a central utility to buy power from Dabhol and sell it across the countryIt would be far simpler if Dabhol and all independent power producers were allowed to sell power to whoever was willing to pay for itThat unfortunately is not allowed by law which forces private sector generators to sell power only to state utilities which in turn are not permitted to sell power across states on their own Most state electricity boards are bankrupt MSEB reportedly owes central utilities Rs crore They cannot bring themselves to charge many types of users for the power consumed nor can they prevent largescale theft of electricity Few including wealthy Maharashtra have the will to reform state electricity boards and privatise transmission and distribution Given this profile of buyers private generators demand sovereign guarantees to help them tide over default risks But the guarantees merely insulate IPPs against risk They cannot make SEBs solvent Yet India needs power desperately Maharashtra Indias richest state experiences power short ages of around MW about a sixth of its peak needs Over time the hunger for power will only grow India cannot afford to wait for the painful politics of SEB reform to work themselves out The governme nt should bring in legislation that allows IPPs to sell power directly to payi ng customersThis will free IPPs from the clutches of bankrupt monopsony buyer s The power trading legislation will have unexpectedly happy consequences for the government tooOnce IPPs are freed from their onerous obligations to se ll power to single mostly bankrupt buyers their default risks will come down substantially New Delhi and state governments should then scrap the guarantees that they gave IPPs in the past The combination of power trading private investments in generation transmission and distribution and gradual SEB reform will create a commercial workable and competitive power market in India Anything less will be a recipe for disaster State not to give tax sops to DPC for buying naphtha from IOC Sanjay Jog Thursday Jan The Maharshtra governments finance department which is striving to reduce fiscal deficit from Rs crore to Rs crore by the beginning of April this year has expressed its inability to provide a sales tax waiver to the Dabhol Power Company DPC on the procurement of million tonne of naphtha from the staterun Indian Oil Corporation IOC Mantralaya sources told The Financial Express on Wednesday that DPC would have to pay per cent sales tax The government way back in has modified the sales tax rate to per cent to discourage the import of napht ha from Gujarat by electrical companies operating in Maharashtra The decision was taken with a view to encouraging electrical companies to procure naphth a at reduced rates within the state government sources added Sources said that these companies had to pay nearly per cent sales tax on naphtha that was procured from Gujarat However following their representation th e government slashed the sales tax rate to per cent The state finance departments opinion which would be presented before the state cabinet shortly in order to take a final decision deserves special significance especially when the state energy department and the lossmakin g Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB have wholeheartedly supported th e DPCs cause and recommended the sales tax waiver DPC which was asked by t he Union ministry of oil and petroleum to procure naphtha within the country i n view of excess availability in its presentation to the state government an d to MSEB had made it clear that it would be left with no alternative but to pass on the additional burden on the MSEB which would be ultimately passed on to its consumers DPC had also told the state government that it had not pa id sales tax on the procurement of naphtha from Glencore in the calender year Sources from the state energy department and MSEB have stressed on the need for such a waiver while expressing their inability to bear additional burde n They have suggested that the state should reciprocate by offering a sales t ax exemption to DPC because the IOC at the behest of the Centre has tried to match the international landing price of naphtha during the recently signed memorandum of agreement with DPC If the state finance department sticks t o its views it may hurt the state as a whole sources from the state energy department and MSEB saidDPC will procure naphtha at Rs per ton from IOC during the calender year as compared to the Rs per tonne price quoted by Glencore The naphtha price comprises per tonne free o n board FOB per cent of customs duty per cent of sales tax and of premium DPC senior vice president Mukesh Tyagi reiterated that the company has already made an appeal to the state government for the sales tax waiver on naphtha in the larger interest of the consumers Sales tax is a pass throu gh and MSEB which will have to bear the additional burden will pass it on th e consumers he added Centre yet to receive proposal on Enron Thursday Jan CENTRE on Wednesday said that it had not recevied any proposal from Maharashtra government seeking help to solve the tangle with

out of the Dabhol project Sucheta Dalal It is finally Quit India time for Enron Though the controversial multinational has denied plans to sell its stake in Dabhol Power Company DPC informed sources say that it has sent feelers to China Light Power and others to offload its majority holdingGetting out of India may be the best course for Enron Though it has threatened a fight and invoked politic al force majeure the Energy Review Committee headed by Madhav Godbole will certainly weaken its case The committee points out that the many infirmities in the DPC approval process brings into question the propriety of the decisions It is clear that the m that Enron spent on educating Indias policymakers and bureaucrats did not even teach them the basics of technoeconomic appraisal or due procedure with regard to large internation al contracts The committee says it is troubled with the failure of govern ance that seems to have characterised almost every step of the decision making process on matters relating to DPC The failure of governance has been broa d across different governments at different points of time at both the state and the central level and across different agencies associated with examining the project and at both the administrative and political levels It strains belief to accept that such widespread and consistent failure to execute assigned responsibilities is purely coincidental Though the committee decided that it is not the proper forum to investigate these infirmities its two key members Mr Godbole and former secretary in the Ministry of Finance EAS Sarma have asked for a judicial inquiry into the process of clearing the DPC project Other members felt a judicial inquiry would delay the negotiation process and not serve any purpose There may be some merit in an argument against a further delay in renegotiating tariffs or facilitating Enrons exit but the report certa inly provides the Central Vigilance Commission CVC with all the grounds that i t needs to start an investigation CVC N Vittal has already received innumerable requests to investigate the deal especially the beneficiaries of its education campaign Though the political establishment may be reluctant to set up a judicial inquiry the CVC can establish whether there are lapses on the part of government functionaries including political executives and ensure appropriate action against them If it is indeed able to establish undue influence in signing the contract then Maharashtra may be able to get out of a deal patently against the public interest without any monetary liability The Godbole committee has vindicated the stand of antiEnron activists who have been opposed it since negotiations began in It establishes that Enron power is expensive per se and the project needs to be renegotiated regardless of the causes for the Maharashtra State Electricity Boards MSEB financial distress Also that DPCs extortionate tariffs are not merely because of the steep rise in petroproduct prices and rupee depreciation b ut mainly on account of its sweetheart deal with the state government Enron s contract is clearly onesided it deliberately uses expensive raw material ignoring World Bank warnings has worked on fanciful demandsupply estimates and several legal requirements and permissions In fact the committee has found that the MSEB has been paying Enron Rs crore more than it should every year This comprises overcharging of Rs crore on account of the large regassification plant of which only per ce nt of the capacity is used for DPC Theres also a Rs crore extra billi ng to the MSEB for shipping and harbour charges although the cost of these facilities had been included in the capital recovery charge By charging mo re than twice the operations maintenance rate stipulated by the government o f India Enron collects approximately Rs crore extra every year It has also been collecting Rs crore every year through inflated fuel consumption claims Enron has been charging at kcalkwh under the powe r purchase agreement PPA although the equipment manufacturer has guaranteed it a much lower consumption rate This gives it a fat fuel arbitrage opportunity at the cost of the people of Maharashtra The committee has also pointed to the strange practice of using four different exchange rates for different aspects of the project negotiation a rate of Rs per dollar was assumed for calculating debt service of rupee loans Rs per dollar as reference rate for PhaseI Rs per dolla r as reference rate for PhaseII and a curious Rs per dollar for calculati ng Government of India tariff Forcing a reduction of these excessive charges has nothing to do with contract cancellation All it needs is tough negotiation and public pressure on the political establishment The Godbole committee has established that DPCs tariffs can easily be h alved if excess payments are eliminated and unfair conditions such as the dollarisation of payments the takeorpay clause and escrow facility whic h is in fact hampering MSEBs reform particularly in power distribution a re scrappedThe security of future payments to DPC under the restructured tari ff would be based on increased cash flows from a reformed distribution system The committee also gives Enron a difficult escape route It says that if th e multinational finds the conditions for restructuring too onerous it should free MSEB from its contractual obligations and find buyers outside Maharashtra The committee has tried to establish another precedent on all projects negotiated by government The public has a right to know what is being contracted on their behalf and has recommended that all documents including contracts related to all Independent Power Projects IPPs particularly DPC should be published by the Maharashtra government within two months Also having established that demandsupply estimates by the state governme nt were fanciful the committee has asked MSEB to defer all negotiations with power producers until demand levels in the state permit full absorption of power generation from such IPPs It recommends that such negotiations shoul d be in accordance with the leastcost plan spelt out by the report This should also end the hectic lobbying by Reliance Patalganga Mittals Bhadravati the BSES Saphale and others to set up IPPs in Maharashtra THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS April DPC board set to authorise president Enron MD to issue notice of termination Sanjay Jog Scrapping of Power Purchase Agreement The board of directors of Dabhol Power Company DPC which has already tak en an aggressive posture has proposed to authorise the Enron India managing director K Wade Cline and DPC president and chief executive officer Neil McGregor to issue notices for the termination of power purchase agreement PPA and transfer of Dabhol project in view of continuing default by the state and Central governments and Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB The board of directors which would meet on April in London also plans to appoint Mr Cline as its true and lawful Attorneyinfact and author ise him to represent the company in the negotiation of all project contracts and financing agreements and their amendments and modificationsTop sources tol d The Financial Express that DPC would authorise Mr Cline andor Mr McGregor to serve the preliminary termination notices and transfer notices to the state and Central governments and MSEB under clause and schedule of the PPA In response to the continuing default by the MSEB of its payment obliga tions under the PPA the failure of the Government of Maharashtra to honour obligations under its guarantee and state support agreement and failure of the Government of India to honour obligations under its counter guarantee the company has sought recourse to dispute resolution and has initiated conciliation and arbitration proceedings the company resolution said Consistent with this recourse to contractual remedies the company now seeks the authority to serve preliminary termination notices and transfer notices pursuant to clause and schedule of the PPA from time to time and at a ny time upon the occurrence of an event giving rise to its right to serve such notices as determined by the company the resolution added According to the resolution the directors the company secretary and officers of the company and each of them acting individually are authorise d and empowered to execute and deliver such documents and instruments and tak e such other actions as they deem fit to effect the purpose of the resolution in the name and for and on behalf of the company Against this backdrop th e state government and MSEB have been exploring the possibilities of issuing termination notice to the DPC for its failure to meet the contractual obligations under the PPA The state government and MSEB sources said that such a notice could be served by the MSEB as DPC has not paid the rebate penalty of Rs crore for misdeclaration and default on the availabilit y of power on January and February The state government and MSEB which reviewed its position on Saturday at a meeting convened by the Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh are of the view that they have a strong case and substantial grounds to slap the terminatio n notice to the DPC The DPCs move to appoint Mr K Wade Cline as its true and lawful Attorneyinfact deserves importance especially when the state government proposes to set up a negotiating committee to cut the per unit cost and gauge the possibility of sale of Dabhol power to the power deficit states Mr Cline would also be authorised to dispose of equipment that is worn out or obsolete or other equipment or fuel no longer expected to be used in the ordinary course in amounts exceeding Rs crore or the equivalent in forei gn currency in any financial year Furthermore Mr Cline would be in a positio n to enter into contracts and take any other actions for purpose

issue of serving a termination notice to the Maharshtra State Electricity Board MSEB DPC cannot go ahead with this unless it gets the go ahead from the lenders While bankers said the lenders meeting is about the second phase of the project which is still under construction state government officials clarified that since there is only one PPA covering both phases of the project the lenders decision will be applicable to the existing Phase I also The second phase of the project involves MW generation capacity whereas Phase I of MW is already operationalAccording to the loan agreement even if only four per cent of the lenders agree to terminate the contract then DPC can do so highly placed sources in the lenders consortium said from London This in effect means that only one lender has to agree for DPC to serve a preliminary termination noticeFollowing the notice there is a cooling off period of six months for both parties the MSEB and DPC to find a mutually acceptable solution which may take the form of a renegotiated PPA source s added Sources also said that there are two separate meetings scheduled wit h lenders The Monday meeting will be attended by all the lenders

Confirming that there was no proposal from the state government to handover the project to the Centre Mr Prabhu said that the situation of the electricity boards in the country was precarious The Centre had decided to assist Maharashtra upto Rs crore every year to improve customer services OUTLOOK Monday April The Real Story Of Dabhol If a judicial probe suggested by the committee i s ordered into the Enron deal it could embarrass three governments RANJIT BHUSHAN The Committee has prima facie found infirmities in several decisions taken in respect of the Enron project at different points of time by successive governments and agencies in the Centre and state Energy Review Committee headed by former home secretary Madhav Godbole This could well be the real Enron story A fivemember highpowered committee headed by Madhav Godboleand includ ing former Union economic affairs secretary EAS Sarma hdfc chairman Deepak Parekh teri chairman RajendraPachauri and Maharashtra government official Vinay Mohan Lalhas recommended a judicial probe into the entire Enron p ower project deal saying it signified the utter failure of governance that seem s to have characterised almost every step of the decisionmaking process relating to the Dabhol project The report which was submitted to the Maharashtra government last fortnight and has been acquired by Outlook is severely critical of former chief minister Sharad Pawar with the Congress then the day bjpled Union government which reworked the deal in Shiv Sena supremo Balasaheb Thackeray and his government in Maharashtra headed by Manohar Joshi The utter failure of governance seems to have characterised almost every step of decisionmaking relating to the Dabhol project Madhav Godbole Committee Report An investigation if ordered could embarrass at least these three governments The report clearly upholds the allegations of money being paid by Enron to politicians and bureaucrats for clinching the deal According to t he committee the deal reveals failure of governance both at the Centre and state and across different agencies It strains belief to accept that suc h widespread and consistent failure to execute responsibilities is purely coincidental the report said proposing a set of measures to be implement ed if something of the project was to be retrieved Godbole and Sarma also fel t that the panel should categorically recommend the government of India to order a judicial inquiry This was finally adopted by it Says a Congress leader Enron could well become the biggest political issue in Maharashtra and put to question liberalisation particularly in the power sector The proposal has already struck panic Says ncps Praful Patel If the Enr on decision has at all been detrimental it is because of the haste with which phase was cleared by the Shiv Senabjp government Now with the state having already entered into an agreement with Enron the important thing is to resolve it amicably A judicial inquiry will be an eyewash because its not an issue of corruption but that of perception Promarket Congressmen privately admit that it was their governments at the Centre and the state which invited Enron even though the second phase was cleared by the bjpShiv Sena combine Says Congress spokesperson Jaipal Reddy Right now were too involved with the Parliament deadlock over Tehelka Proliberalisation Congress MPs also fear that such witchhunting could send wrong signals to foreign investors NonCongress MPs from Maharashtra meanwhile claim that the Godbole Committee was instituted wit h the express purpose of politicising the Enron issue I think I know Vilasr ao Deshmukhs gameplan says an MP from the state But some MPs like Congress Prithviraj Chavan question the cloak of secrecy thats surrounded the deal Ive maintained for long that there should be a judicial committee to examine this The committee report also says that had the Enron project been subjected to a technoeconomic appraisal as envisaged under provisions of the Electricity supply Act of and related legislations the infirmities could have bee n avoidedSince this wasnt done questions about a concerted effort towards exercising undue influence at every stage of the project are bound to arise the exhaustive page report points out Id highlight the speed with which the day Vajpayee government cleared the project minutes before it quit says Congress MP Prithviraj Chavan The Enron project had been held out as an exemplar of the impending liberalisation in the early s and despite several controversies is now an established power project at Dabhol km south of Mumbai In July Enron signed an MoU with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board mseb to set up a MW station as part of the governments fast track projects Subsequently when the ShivSenabjp came to power in Maharashtra it filed a writ against the project This curiously led to renegotiations with Enron The committee has quoted a Bombay High Court order on the renegotiated deal Once it GoM decided to revive the project it acted in the very same manner its predecessors in office had done It forgot all about competitive bidding and transparency The speed with which the negotiating group studie d the project and made its proposal for renegotiatons which was accepted by Dabhol is unprecedented Says Chavan I would particularly like to highlight the speed with which the day Vajpayee government at Centre endorsed the renegotiated project minutes before it resigned Since the commissioning of the plant in May the mseb has paid Rs crore for the power it has bought from Dabhol If the same watttage of powe r had been bought from Indianbuilt power plants fired by indigenous coal th e payment would have been approximately Rs crore In the first yearandahalf of its operation itself the dpc had drained the Maharashtr a exchequer of nearly Rs crore The Central Electricity Authority cea in fact pointed out that the Dabh ol plant was not the least costly option The mseb had other inexpensive alternatives like the four units of Kaparkheda but they were in a preliminary stage The report notes if the mseb had made efforts to seriously pursue these projects they might not have remained in their preliminary stages It adds that the members were of the opinion that the mseb and the Maharashtra government erred seriously based on information available at that time in proceeding with the dpc as a baseload factor ev en when its capacity was reduced The failure seems to have been compounded b y the laxity of the Union power ministry finance ministry and the cea It quotes the cea as saying that since the Union finance ministry found the tariff reasonable no further examination was required Strangely Bal Thackerays Shiv Sena when it came to power together with t he BJP in Maharashtra filed a writ in the court and then renegotiated the dea l After the new Shiv Senabjp government took over its CM Manohar Joshi appointed a renegotiating committee in which made the right noises actually managing to reduce the tariff But certain things remained inexplicable No fresh clearances were required from the cea which also sa id that since no cost increase was involvedfresh formal clearance wasnt necessary Says the committee This only adds strength to the suspicion that the cea didnt consider the economic aspects of the project at all Indeed given the nonavailability of any official record of the meeting on June with the Committee and the nature of this letter dated December the Committee is doubtful whether the economic aspects o f dpc were discussed at all The credibility of the Shiv Senabjp government has been seriously questioned The Committee finds it unexplicable sic why there was no mention of any reduction in capital cost of the project from million to million as agreed by dpc in the summary report of the renegotiati ng committee the panel observesSays lawyer Prashant Bhushan It is strange that the Shiv Senabjp government first filed a writ in the court and then coolly renegotiated the deal The committee further spells out the losses incurred through the deal Subsequent to the commissioning of the dpc the financial deterioration of mseb has been rapid While the mseb was in profi t in it plunged into huge losses of Rs crore in Significantly the World Bank in had predicted the systems inherent weaknesses In a letter written to the then power secretary R Vasudevan a top bank official had said that after a detailed review of the analytical framework and costing assumptions we reconfirm our earlier conclusion that the Dabhol project as presently formulated is not economically justified and that in our assessment the project is too large to enter the mseb syst em in The proposed baseload operation could result in uneconomic plant dispatch as already existing lower variable cost coal power would be replaced by the higher cost lng power Enrons persistence and the gullibility of the Indian side can be gauged from highranking Enron official Joe Suttons letter to a key Indian official Ajit Nimbalkar I recently met with the World Bank and have been following the articles in the India papers I feel that the World Bank opinion can be changed Well engage a PR firm and hopefully manage the med ia from here on The project has solid support from all other agencies in Washington The key question in the Enron deal is whether a developed state like Maharashtra needs outside intervention in the power sector at all For the first time the Godbole committee has raised objections about the viability of such a project According to the report the mseb has been one of the bette r performing boards in the country and has despite a faulty transmission and distribution T and D system managed to consistently earn net revenue surpluses on an accrual basis Maharashtra accounts for nearly onefourth of the gross value of Indias industrial sector Its one of the few states to achieve per cent electrification Since the mseb has been adding to its generation Th is improvement which has been largely due to renovation and modernisation undertaken by the mseb exceeded its own expectations at a time when the dp c was being considered the report points out Following a policy of crosssubsidy roughly nine out of its ten users are subsidised But the gap between the average cost of supply and average realisation hasn t been much In fact the subsidy claim decreased from Rs crore in to Rs crore in until in it increased nearly fivefol d to Rs crore due to the sudden increase in the gap by paise per uni t from to paisean increase of per cent The increase in the su bsidy claim by Rs crore is due to the increase in the gap principally becau se of the increase in power purchase costs says the committee adding Without the dpc and without problems of T and D loss the mseb could be financially healthy But can that happen now since Enron is here to stay The committee has come up with some farreaching recommendations make public all Dabholrelated documents and agreements restructure the Dabhol project itself to bring do wn the cost of power restructure dpc financially allow sale of dpc power outside Maharashtra reexamine ppas in accordance with leastcost plans a nd thoroughly reform the msebThe committee know this can become reality only with political consensus and through forming of public opinion The questio n is can that be achieved in an unstable political environment With Priya Sahgal Making Of A Scam Centre invites Enron to set up

Company DPC monthly financial burden issue now a topic of discussion among arbitrators on the negotiating table the MSEB has turned to putting its house in order As if to ward of any criticism of its fiscal condition that could be termed as the facilitator to the entire DPC tariff crisis the state electricity board has put matters relating to its performance on record For instance MSEB has recorded the highest power generation in the year ended March at units compared with the previous years units making it the top SEB of the country in this respect Similarly its power stations recorded the highest availability percentage at up from per cent last fiscal Plant load factor is up to per cent compared with per cent in The Parli power station has recorded the highest ever generation in the ten years of its life time in at million units which made it eligibl e for the meritorious productivity award under the eligibility guidelines issued by the Government of India carrying a cash

became the first power station of a ny state electricity board to get the ISO certification A senior MSEB official said Earlier MSEB was suffering from too much interference in its day to day functioning The agriculturists were touted as the major reason for its deteriorating accruals while theft of electricity during the transmission and distribution stage was conveniently camouflaged under this head In the recent past the government has authorised MSEB to take steps to curb this misuse of power by its own officials many of whom including a chief engineer have suffered suspensions

MSEB contract THE ENRON power project crisis on Thursday deepened with the board of Dabho l Power Company authorising the management to issue a termination notice to t he Maharashtra State Electricity Board even while international lenders to the project asked Enron to renegotiate power purchase agreement signed with the MSEB The decision to authorise managing director Neil McGregor to issue notice of termination on the contract to sell MW of power was taken after the board prevented MSEB from voting on the ground that it was an interested party The decision was taken with six votes in favour and the single opposition vote was cast by IDBI sources said According to reports financial institutions such as ANZ Investment Bank Credit Suisse First Boston Citibank ABNAmro and the State Bank of India have on Wednesday advised Enron against terminating its PPA with MSEB MSEB chairman Vinay Bansal who with two other directors attended the meeting on Wednesday representing Maharashtras per cent stake in the near bi llion project said The Indian side told them that it would be unfortunate if Enron broke the contract While Bansal declined comment on the board decision the sources said the Indian side had expressed its interest to holds talks on the issue rather than terminating the project and there were possibilities of a fresh power purchase agreement between the company and t he state PTI THE ECONOMIC TIMES Friday Apr MSEB pays Rs cr under protest to DPC DESPITE the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head Maharashtra State Electricity Board on Thursday made a protest payment of Rs crore disputed amount towards March bill of Rs crore to Dabhol We were ready with the payment on Wednesday itself but DPC officials could not collect the cheque due to the statewide bandh a senio r MSEB official said We have disputed payment of Rs crore and it woul d be now taken up at the disputes resolution forum of which Enron India managing director K Wade Cline and Krishna Rao are members MSEB sources said Last week DPC had dashed off a communication to the government and MSEB th at it would not accept protest payments anymore Cline had said the energy major shall treat such payments as an election to pay the sums which MSEB in fact owed DPC in full and that the company would also not recognise the purported protest or reservation MSEB had paid a Rs crore February bill in protest last month On April last both domestic and internation al lenders of DPC had met in London and held exhaustive discussions the multinationals move to issue a termination notice to MSEB and state government PTI BUSINESS STANDARD Friday April Enron India MD authorised to terminate PPA The board of the Enronpromoted Dabhol Power Company DPC at its meeting in London on Wednesday authorised the managing director of Enron India to iss ue a notice for terminating the power purchase agreement to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board and the state government The board has authori sed Wade Cline to serve the termination notice However this does not mean tha t the termination notice will be served immediately It is only an enabling provision and will be used only if the situation arises a state govern ment source told Business Standard from London He said DPC was under pressure from its lenders The DPC spokesperson here refused to comment on the issue The hardening of the boards stand is in sharp contrast to the advice of DPCs lenders w ho had warned Enron not to precipitate matters by issuing a termination notice The lenders had arrived at a consensus that the termination notice need not be served at this stage Serving of the notice requires a nod from the lenders who have an exposure of about billion in the project Sources said given the lenders strong opposition to termination of the contract t he Enron boards enabling resolution did not have much significance beyond conveying a hardening of its stand with regard to the current imbroglio Th e Maharashtra Chief Minister had warned Enron not to scuttle the process of crisis resolution by issuing a termination notice The state government is to nominate an expert group to renegotiate the terms of the Dabhol contract Enron holds per cent in DPC while USbased GE and Bechtel hold per cent each The balance per cent is held by MSEB through a special purpos e vehicle Maharashtra Power Development Corporation The MSEB representative s were not allowed to vote at the meeting since they were an interested party The IDBI representative protested against the boards decision The meeting was attended by state energy secretary VM Lal The meeting was held against the backdrop of a dispute between MSEB and DPC over payment of bills After MSEB failed to pay Rs crore towards the December bill DPC invoked the state governments guarantee and then the Union governments counter guarantee When payment of the Rs crore January bill became overdue DPC again invoked the state governments guarantee MSEB retaliate d on January by slapping a Rs crore penalty for nonsupply of electricity at adequate levels It demanded that DPC adjust the bills again st this penalty This stand of MSEB was explained to DPC at the board meeting a state government official said The Centre also supported MSEBs stand an d refused to honour the counter guarantee The power company then invoked the political force majeure clause A process of conciliation and arbitration between the Centre and DPC is currently on THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS Friday April Foreign lenders slam brakes on disbursements to DPC Sanjay Jog Raghu Mo han Global banks comfortable with Enron pullout Lenders to the Dabhol Power Company DPC are a sharply divided lot International lenders in direct contrast to the stand taken by local ones led by the the Industrial Develoment Bank of India IDBI are categorical that additional assistance to DPCs phaseII will be held in abeyance de spite the completion of per cent of the project workThe stage is also set for a preliminary termination notice to be served by DPC to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB within the next four weeksThis follows the authorisation given to Enron Indias managing director K Wade Cline and DPC president CEO Neil McGregor to serve the termination notice and transfer notices to MSEB following Wednesdays DPC board meeting in London The essence of the message from the international lenders following the London meeting with DPC board is Emotions do not work Contractual obligations and payments have to be met We are convinced that the MSEB has failed to meet its obligations There is no point in Enron continuing with the project and the company should get out of itThe structuring of DPC s debt has created two classes of lenders In phaseI international lenders are covered by a sovereign guarantee while in phaseII no lender is However all lenders have a parri passu charge making attachment of assets a messy affair Sources in international banks were quick to point out that local lenders t o phaseII of the project are worried that an awry DPC project will affect their interests more given that they have no security other than asset s like a sovereign cover It was this desperation that made local lenders like IDBI slash the interest rates a few months back to per cent from per cent a leading foreign banker pointed outThree points that were m ade clear and stressed in no uncertain terms by international lenders were a there are contractual obligations b MSEB was not punctual in its payments to DPC and c MSEB adopted a confrontational position by slapping a Rs cro re rebate charge on DPC for misdeclaration and default on the availability of power While local lenders led by IDBI with MSEB parroting the same were of the view that the current situation is a temporary one international lenders were steadfast that pulling out of the project is the only way out This is despite the stance taken by IDBI and MSEB that authorisation for terminatio n given to Mr Cline and Mr McGregor was not called for International bankers pointed out that they will now have to look at the issue of charges and protection for their loans in the event of the power project being scrapped in its present formThe points of contention are a that phaseI of DPC is backed by a sovereign guarantee b phaseII is not and c to the extent tha t phaseII is covered by assets cancellation of phaseII may see all assets even those under phaseI getting attached Therefore an examination o n the segregation of assets under phaseI and phaseII is now warranted PTI adds In a significant move DPC board has empowered its management to sever power supply agreement with MSEB a move that could inflict a financi al liability of about Rs crore on the Centre A decision to authorise DPC president Neil McGregor to issue a termination notice to MSEB for sale of power was taken by the board at its meeting on Wednesday THE INDIAN EXPRESS Friday April Enron Dabhol chief gets powers to end deal with the MSEB THE BOARD of Dabhol Power Company a subsidiary of Houstonbased Enron Corp has decided to warn the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB that it intends to pull the plug on its Guhagarbased projectIn a board meeting he ld in London on Wednesday the board decided to authorise DPC President and CE O Neil McGregor and Enron Indias managing director K Wade Cline to serve a preliminary termination notice for sale of power to the MSE B within the next four weeksThe Dabhol project has been mired in disputes since MSEB began missing payments last year MSEB owes Dabhol Power million for power delivered in December and January The payment ran into a dispute aft er MSEB slapped penalty notices of Rs crore on DPC for its failure to supp ly power within three hours of the demand being placedBut MSEB has paid million for February And a payment of million was made for March on Thursday The billion Dabhol project is the largest foreign investment made in Ind ia to date Issuing the preliminary termination notice could enable Dabhol to suspend deliveries as it negotiates payment disputesWhile a preliminary termination notice is the first of three steps that could potentially lead to the abandonment of the project by Enron analysts have described the decisi on as a procedural move consistent with DPCs negotiating s trategy to recover overdue payments from the MSEB After the company issues the preliminary termination notice step two would be an official termination notice and step three would be a notice that th e company is surrendering control of the project If the project is terminate d the government of India will have to take a hit of million besides paying bills of Rs crore for the next one year to Enron as penalty Our Centres liability if Dabhol power project is terminated would be one years electricity bill and a termination fee of million Power Secretary A K Basu saidContractually the Centre will have to pay one year s electricity bill totalling at present prices about Rs crore and take over DPCs debt which stands at around million if the pr oject was terminated Basu said in Delhi Dabhol Power is in the process of completing the second phase of the megawatt powerplant project whic h is per cent through While the international lenders to the project are pressurising the company to get out of the project Indian lenders led by IDBI are asking the company to reconsider its decision on its termination notice During the meeting in London MSEB which holds a per cent stake in the project had strongly opposed DPCs move to authorise Cline and McGregor to issue not ices for termination MSEB Chairman Vinay Bansal and technical director Prem Paunikar both directors on the DPC board and the state principal secretary energy VM Lal an invitee to the board raised the issue at the board meeting in London MSEB claimed that DPC was needlessly threatening to issue various arbitration notices and thereby interpreting the clauses of PPA in isolationIn recent weeks Dabhol has raised the stakes in its spat with th e MSEB delivering a notice of political force majeure to Maharashtra a step typically invoked to dissolve a contract in case of an emergency like a war coup or a similar radical political event In this case DPCs move was viewed as a threat to stop providing electricityDPC has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power Critics object to the company charging Rs a kilowatthour for its power compared with around Rs a kilowatthour charged by other suppliers THE HINDU Friday April Offer of renegotiation too late Enron By Mahesh Vijapurkar MUMBAI APRIL The Enronsponsored Dabhol Power Company which last nigh t authorised its local management to issue a notice of termination of its Pow er Purchase Agreement PPA with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board has decided to keep a stiff upper lip This in turn has stoked speculation th at the switching off of power from its Phase I plant was imminent while in reality a lengthy procedure has to be followed as prescribed within the PP A As one source familiar with the PPA told The Hindu it is not sudden deat h of the project and in all probability the DPC vexed with the developments including sharp and pointed observations by the Godbole Committee has chosen to only arm itself with a serious option This woul d only eventually come into effect It is not an overnight operation and a lo t of legal work is involved Apparently the DPC intends to do some armtwisting At the board of directors meeting in London which Maharashtra was initiall y disinclined to attend but later used the forum to put across its contention s on the project the DPC squarely told the MSEB nominees on the board that t he offer of renegotiation had come rather too late It also said it did no t see any room for optimism about the outcome It did not however rule out the option of talks thus underscoring the possibility that the decision to authorise termination was a new weapon The Maharashtra Chief Minister Mr Vilasrao Deshmukh had hoped that DPC would not take any harsh step which would cause lot of damage to the interests of both the independent power producer and the Government and tod ay he expressed his dismay In fact the mandate of the team that went on the strength of its stake in the DPC was to put across the idea that negotiati on was the requirement and not confrontation Echo in LS The Enron issue also echoed in the Lok Sabha today where the Power Minister Mr Suresh Prabhu said that scrapping of the agreement would cost the Cent re Rs crores whose liability in the project agreement was limited The Centres liability in case of termination is one years electricity bill an d a termination fee of million Blow to FIs The termination could prove to be a serious blow to the Indian Financial Institutions FIs which under the leadership of the IDBI were trying to convince the other lenders of the project against the notice The exposure of Indian FIs in the project is understood to be not covered by any guarantee either of the Centre or the State THE TIMES OF INDIA Friday April Enron ready to pull out but lenders say wait The Dabhol Power Company board which met on Wednesday in London authorise d the company management to issue a termination notice to the Maharashtra Sta te Electricity Board The company however may not pull out of the project ye t considering its lenders who met on Monday opposed such a move and favoure d renegotiations Sources present during both the meetings said that though foreign lenders supported Enron on the termination issue domestic financia l institutions led by the Industrial Development Bank of India prevailed ov er the deliberations to oppose any such drastic move Enron needs the lenders consent to file a pretermination notice for pulling out from the project The decision to empower DPC chief Wade Cline to issue a termination notice was taken with six votes in favour against a single IDBI vote against such a move Another significant development during the entire proceedings was that the financial institutions made it clear that further funding of Phase II of th e project will depend on the Government of India assuring payment mechanisms Institutions are yet to disburse about per cent of the sanctioned packag e which is crucial for completing the Phase II expansion project The board has given powers to Wade Cline to issue a pretermination notice But the meeting quite unanimously felt the need of the hour is not to terminate the project but to initiate serious renegotiation proceedings said MSEB Chairman Vinay Bansal who attended the board meeting MSEB presented the ir views to the board members and it was understood by Enron which also includ ed the Rs crore penalty issue which is heading for arbitration proceedings We have also made it clear that the tariff structure of Enron is quite hi gh and a downward revision of tariffs is unavoidable Bansal added They cannot issue a termination notice without our consent since our exposure in the project is quite large and the lenders should approve any plans in that direction said a top banker who was present during the lenders meet There is a general consensus that the project must be completed and the proposal to terminate the PPA should be kept in abeyance he added The global arrangers for the DPC include ANZ Investment Bank Credit Suisse First Boston ABNAMRO Citibank and the State Bank of India where all these parties conducted separate meetings with the company officials However some bankers said the company can file a termination notice even if one lender with a minimum per cent exposure on the project favours such proceedings Meanwhile in a clear reversal of roles Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasra o Deshmukh said that the state government was not keen on terminating the PPA We will ask them to refrain from taking any such harsh steps since that would be bad news for all of us including DPC Deshmukh said Deshmukh w as echoing Union Power Minister Suresh Prabhus sentiments who said that the government wanted an amicable settlement of the payment row He however added that termination of the project would not hurt foreign investments a nd dismissed warnings by analysts that winding up the billion project wou ld be a blow to Indias efforts to woo foreign investors The DPC has already slapped one conciliation notice on the Centre and three arbitration notices on the state government over nonpayment of dues amounting to Rs crore and interest towards the bills due for December and January Meanwhile MSEB officials said in Mumbai that the March bills amounting to Rs crore was paid on Thursday as protest payment despite the dispute over the amount When asked on the future course of action Bansal said it was up to the DPC THE HINDU BUSINESSLINE Friday April DPC board authorises MD to issue PPA termination notice THE board of directors of Dabhol Power Company DPC has authorised the Managing Director Mr Neil McGregor to issue the notice of intent to terminate its power purchase agreement PPA with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB at an appropriate time The decision was taken at a board meeting held in London yesterday While MSEB which is an interested party was not allowed to vote it made a presentation clarifying its stand on the matter a senior State Government official said The resolution to authorise the management to issue the termination notice was carried by six votes to one IDBI voted against the decision the official said The serving of the preliminary termination notice will lead to a sixmonth suspension period According to clause of the Termination Procedure of the PPA Following the giving of a preliminary termination notice the parties shall consult for a period of six months o r such longer period as they may agree as to what step shall be taken with a view to mitigating the consequences of the relevant event having regard to all the circumstances IDBI and State Bank of India the principal Indian lenders had earlier persuaded the overseas lenders to hold their consent to the termination notice for some more time At least one lender has to consent for the compa ny to serve termination notice It is understood that overseas lenders are in favour of termination of the project and are prepared to consent However domestic lenders are worried about the security of their advances if the PP A is abandoned midway According to institutional sources Indian lenders are trying to get all th e parties concerned to thrash out outstanding issues The Maharashtra and Central Governments too are in favour of a conciliation Mr Vilasrao Deshmukh Chief Minister of Maharashtra yesterday went on record that the State did not want the project terminated Mr Yashwant Sinha Union Finance Minister is also understood to be of the same opinion The DPC will now have to decide what is the appropriate time to serve the notice the official said MSEB pays Rs crore Meanwhile MSEB has paid DPC Rs crore towards its March bill MSEB officials confirmed that the bill w as paid in protest today morning They DPC had billed us for an amount of Rs crore We do not agree with some of the items included a senior MSEB official said THE PIONEER Friday April Enron testing Maharashtras nerves T N Raghunatha Dabhol Power Company DPC has begun to put fresh pressure on the Maharasht ra State Electricity Board MSEB the Maharashtra State Government and the Centre for an early resolution to the prolonged dispute between them if th e DPC Board of Directors decision to authorise its managing director to serv e a contract termination notice to the MSEB is any indication The DPC Board in its meeting in London on Wednesday empowered the company management to sever its power supply agreement with MSEB a move that could inflict a financial liability of Rs crore on the Centre The decision to authorise the DPC management to issue a termination notice to MSEB was taken by a vote of six to one after the Maharasthra Government representatives were prevented from voting on the ground of interested party When contacted the companys Mumbaibased spokesperson Mr Jimmy Mogal declined to comment on the reports about the decision taken by the DPC Boar d We have nothing to say on the reports emanating from London We will expre ss our views after a few days he said However Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh on Thursday termed the DPC boards decision as unfortunate We have already requested the company not to take any harsh decision Mr Deshmukh said in Mumbai Official sources in the State Energy Ministry interpreted the DPC Boards decision as a pressure tactic employed by the Enron subsidiary to force the MSEB to clear the pending power bills without any further delay Through it s tough posture the DPC wants to make its position stronger before it can formally agree for renegotiations with the MSEB the Centre and the State Government for cutting the price of power supplied by it to the State electricity board The sources said that the DPCs reported decision to authorise its managing director to stop electricity supply to the MSEB did not mean that the Enron subsidiary would actually go ahead with the scrappi ng of the power contract with the MSEB If anything the DPCs reported decision is to mount additional pressure o n the MSEB for clearance of pending power bills and put itself in a stronger position in settling its dispute with the MSEB As part of its plan to arm itself with powers to break a contract in case situation goes beyond its control the DPC had recently served a political force majeure to the MSEB the Centre and the State Government the sources saidNot surprisingly th e DPCs London decision comes on the heels of the Maharashtra Governments decision to set up a highlevel committee comprising representatives of th e MSEB the Centre and the State Government to renegotiate with the Enrons subsidiary company for reducing the cost of power supplied to the State electricity boardMeanwhile amidst the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head the MSEB on Thursday made a protest payment o f the Rs crore disputed amount towards March bill of Rs crore to D PC riday April THE TELEGRAPH Friday April ENRON SIGNAL TO SWITCH OFF DABHOL POWER Enron today took the first decisive step out of the controversyridden Dabh ol Power Company when it won an authorisation from the companys board to s top sale of power to Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB The meeting of the company of which the Houstonbased energy giant holds per cent and the MSEB per cent was attended by state energy secretary V M Lal and MSEB technical director P Paunikar and it came days after its lende rs discussed payment problems and a possible terminationThe Centres liabi lity if Enron decides to snap the agreement will be a years power bill and a termination fee of million However the company will have to wait fo r six months from the day it serves the notice before it pulls the plugThe Centre shrugged off the move saying there would not be any adverse effect on foreign investment in power if Enron walks out We do not see FDI inflo ws into the power sector being hit power minister Suresh Prabhu saidMSEB officials said the ball is now in the court of DPC which said its corporat e policy did not allow it to comment on proceedings at board meetings The decision coincided with a Rs crore protest payment by the cash strapped power board as part of the March bill worth Rs crore There was speculation that MSEB coughed up the amount to cool frayed temper s at Enrons hub in Houston and because it was rattled by the sudden turn of events in the past few days during which the dispute had come to a head MS EB officials brushed away the allusions saying the cheque was ready on Wednesday but could not be handed over to DPC because of the statewide bandh We have a disputed payment of Rs crore which will be take n up at the disputeresolution forum a board official said Last week DPC told the state government and MSEB it would no longer accept protest payments in a move to fortify its legal position MSEB officials say Bechtel and General Electric the other partners who hol d around per cent in DPC are willing to go along with Enron Corp in terminating the deal but financial institutions such as IDBI are not game because it puts their loans at risk Investments made by Indian institution s are not covered under the Centres and states counterguarantees un like those made by international lendersMaharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh called Enrons decision unfortunate We had told state gove rnment officials attending the Enron board meeting to stop the company from windin g up its operations in the state as it will harm both parties THE STATESMAN Friday April Enron threatens to pull out The Enron crisis deepened with the Board of Directors of the Dabhol Power Company deciding to authorise the managing director Mr K Wade Cline to serve a notice of termination on the contract for the first phase of the billion power projectThe decision which could lead to the cessation of Dabhols power supply to the state was taken at the meeting held yester day in London according to reports quoting the chairman of the Maharashtra Stat e Electricity Board Mr Vinay Bansal While DPC officials refuse to comment on anything it is learnt that MSEB w as itself prepared to serve a legal notice of termination just two days before the meetingMSEB was said to have been dissuaded by the Nationalist Congres s Party president Mr Sharad Pawar and union power minister Mr Suresh Prabhu who had talks in New Delhi with the Maharashtra chief minister Mr Vilasrao Deshmukh and an MSEB delegation last Monday The state government has been served two arbitration notices while the Cent re is ready to go for conciliation with the DPC for failing to honour its counterguaranteeFurther the DPC has already slapped a notice of politica l force majeure which protects itself against undeserved claims in the event of exigencies that force it to take an extreme stepThe union power minister Mr Suresh Prabhu contended in Delhi that since DPC contributed only per cent of the total energy output of the country its termination would not have such a phenomenal impact on the power situation However if terminations proceedings go through Enron Corp a per cent shareholder in the Dabhol Power Company would stand to net a hefty amount in damages The union power secretary has been quoted as saying that termination of the DPC would cost the Centre Rs crore which is the total of one years electricity bill and a termination fee of milli on According to an energy analyst Mr Pradyumna Kaul the total liability woul d not cross Rs crore However Mr Prabhu said in the Lok Sabha today that the that scrapping of the agreement would cost the Centre Rs croreIt is learnt that on April Mr Deshmukh had given the goahead to the MSEB to prepare a legal notice to be issued to Enron during the meeting of the DPC s Board of Directors on Wednesday At the meeting the energy minister Padamsinh Patil energy secretary Mr Vinay Mohan Lal and MSEB chairman Mr Vinay Bansal were also presentThe notice was prepared over the past weeke nd and taken by the delegation when they called on Mr Prabhu on April However the politicians convinced them that Enron would not get tough giv en its huge stake in the project and that such a notice would not be necessar y The meeting thus ended with the decision to renegotiate the power tariff with Enrons consent Among those present at the London meeting were Mr Lal Mr Bansal and MSEB technical director Mr P Paunikar in their capacity as directors However they abstained from voting since they were deemed an interested party The only vote to go against the decision was that of the IDBI which is also represented on the board it is learntThe chief minister Mr Vilasrao Deshmukh said the state was not in favour of terminating the project This could mean that the latest manoeuvre to armtwist the Indian authorities could achieve its immediate target of getting the arrears accumulated over the past three months clearedThe MSEB owes Enron Rs crore for March and Rs crore for December and January The Centre today p ut up a brave face on Enrons decision saying there would not be any advers e effect on foreign investment in power sector in the country PTI reported from New Delhi There will be no adverse impact as a result of any action by any domest ic or foreign company As far as we are concerned there will be no adverse impact on FDI in power sector Power Minister Suresh Prabhu told reporters whe n asked about DPCs decision to authorise management to issue a terminatio n notice to MSEBEmphasising that there would be no fallout of such decision Prabhu said after the meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs we are expecting cooperation from many Scandinavian countries as well a s European nations in the power sectorIn fact not only the Power Ministe r but also the Prime Minister of Norway was here to inaugurate a seminar on power and he promised lot of cooperation in the sector MID DAY DPC may not wind up Maharashtra Chief Secretary V Ranganathan has said that though Neil McGrego r managing director of the Dabhol Power Corporation DPC has been given complete powers with regard to DPCs operations in the state including the authority to wind up operations it does not necessarily mean that McGregor will issue such a termination notice McGregor was given the powers at a meeting of the DPC board in London on Wednesday Ranganathan said that stat e officials including Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB Chairman Vinay Bansal and Power Secretary V M Lal have reported back to him about t he meeting in London With regard to the states failure to pay Enron Ranganathan said Bills are prepared as per the Power Purchase Agreement PPA and DPC owes some money to us Our people informed Enron officials about this In fact ther e was no reason to give powers to the MD to slap a termination noticeIn the London meeting MSEB and Industrial Development Bank of India IDBI representatives insisted that the DPC must pay Rs crore since it could not supply power whenever needed Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh has already termed as unfortunate the decision of the board of the Enronpromoted DPC to give McGregor powers to wind up operations Deshmukh added We have already requested Enron not t o take any harsh decisionDeshmukh had earlier said We have directed stat e Government officials attending the DPC board meeting to desist the energy company from winding up operations in the state as it would be harmful to both of us Enron officials are keeping mum on the issue McGregor said I am not goi ng to give any comment MID DAY April Enron offers no comment on renegotiation H S Rao A crucial meeting of the Board of Directors of the Dabhol Power Company DPC promoted by the US energy major Enron was held here yesterday apparently to discuss fate of its million power project in Maharashtra but there was no official word on the Indian and state Governments decisio n to renegotiate the contract An Enron spokesman declined to divulge what transpired at the meeting sayi ng the issues discussed at the meeting were confidential We have not received any direct communication Unless we get it and evaluate the detail s we have no comments to make the spokesman said when asked about the proposed decision on renegotiation of the project in which the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB has per cent stake Asked whether the Board had taken a decision on empowering DPC Managing Director Neil McGregor to wind up its operations in India the spokesman sa id he had nothing to say on them Enron has reportedly authorised Mcgregor to look at various options including selling the companys stake in DPC Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh said in Mumbai that the state Government would pay up the undisputed dues to the company He said the Maharashtra government is not in favour of terminating the MW projec t but wanted an amicable solution to the imbroglio MID DAY Friday April Committee to renegotiate Enron deal A committee to renegotiate the Power Purchase Agreement with the Dabhol Pow er Company will be appointed by this evening Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh said today Addressing media persons after his meeting with the noted socia l reformer Anna Hazare at his official residence Varsha Deshmukh said the committee would be formed by this evening or by tomorrow at the mostHe termed as unfortunate the Enron board decision empowering DPC chief Neil McGregor to serve a preliminary termination notice on the Maharashtra State Electricity Board and said the state was willing to negotiate the issue wit h power company Renegotiations will be held as per the suggestions made by the Godbole committee and the center will also depute its representative on the renegotiating committee We dont want to take any hasty decision Deshmuk h saidHe pointed that the only bone of contention with the DPC had been its expensive tariff and hoped that the issue would be resolved amicablyWhen pointed that the Enron board had taken a decision to serve the notice despi te stateF s willingness to appoint a renegotiating committee Chief Ministe r said it was unfortunate Earlier in his meeting with Hazare Deshmukh promised to make necessary amendments to the Right to Information law recently passed by the state so that the information was easily accessed by the common people He also gave a patient hearing to Hazare on his complaints of corruption in various state departments and promised action against guilty after a thorough inquiry within three months AFTERNOON APRIL ENRONS ON State govt to renegotiate Dabhol Power Project By Hubert Vaz The US power giant Enron Power Corporations willingness to wrap up the Dabhol Power Project and leave the shores may not actually materialise though the Dabhol Power Company chief Mr Wade Cline has been authorised to do so since the lenders for the project would have a decisive say in the matter Disclosing this Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh confirmed this morning th at the state government would churn out a compromise formula by which the powe r project at Dabhol could be continued and at the same time Enron did not fe el slighted Enron has not yet conveyed to us about this decision We are waiting for their letter he said When asked what sort of compromise the state government plans to forge Mr Deshmukh said Let our officers come back After that we will decide a future course of action But we are definitely going in for renegotiation of the project It is very difficult to predict the outcome of Enrons decision but as of now the project is still on When asked whether the project could be moved to another state if wou nd up from Maharashtra Mr Deshmukh said that was not possible as per the terms of the agreement between the US company and the state government However it was difficult for the project to move out of the state itself he indicated He also confirmed that both parties would face considerable loss es if the project was terminated The board of directors of the Dabhol Power Company which met in London on Wednesday decided to put an end to all controversies surrounding the proje ct once and for all by empowering the DPC chief to terminate the project if h e deemed it fit However this decision as of now does not necessarily indicate the death knell for the project The Enron project which had been riddled with controversies right from its inception had been a pretext for the political parties in the state to drag each other on the mat from time to time The previous SenaBJP government which had been out to terminate the project however chose to continue with it following renegotiations with Enrons top visiting officials like Ms Rebecca Mark And the Democratic Front government inherited the controversial project when the governments changed hands a year and a half ago Meanwhile State Energy Minister Dr Padamsinh Patil when contacted at the Osmanabad Circuit House said the state government and the central governme nt have decided to appoint a joint committee to renegotiate the project with Enron It is not easy for them to walk out of the project just like that They will have to go in for litigation and this would prove costly for both sides he said In case the project is terminated the government can stil l manage the power needs of the state though it would be a bit tough job he added

would be able to renegotiate the Dabhol power project promoted by the US energy major Enron may turn out to be misplaced The US energy major says that the Godbole committees suggest ions were unacceptable In response to a query from ET the company said in a statement that the published terms of the Godbole report do not repres ent an acceptable basis for further discussions The statement said that i t would be meeting the committee next week as a matter of courtesy Since the purpose of our meeting is to hear out the committee and understand thei r thoughts we will not present any proposals the statement said Accord ing to highlyplaced sources in the government the company has informed the Madhav Godbole panel that it would be meeting on May Earlier reports ha d indicated that the discussions with the panel would take place on May According to sources Enron would be meeting the panel with representatives of its lenders and shareholders The Godbole committee that studied the current power purchase agreement has called for cancellation of the presen t tariff structure renegotiation of the LNG and shipping contract removal o f dollar denomination as far as fixed charges of the tariff is concerned deb t restructuring and the formation of a committee to renegotiate the power purchase agreement These suggestions it seems may not be acceptable to Enron The Maharashtra government accepted the report and asked the Godbole committee to renegotiate The committee has been given a months time to renegotiate on behalf of the state government with DPC for a new PPA The committee has opined that since the LNG facility of mmpta is far in excess of what is required by the plant only mmpta of which mmpta is on take or pay it should be separated into a distinct facility whose capital costs should not be reflected in the fuel charge not as take or pa y It should instead be only in proportion to the fuel regassified for the pow er generation Using the entire allocated gas requires an unusually high PLF Instead the surplus gas can be sold to other players like Petronet or Enro n s own Metgas It is important to distribute the cost over the entire capacity and not just the amount sold to the power plant says the committee Similarly it has been suggested that Enron could lease out the harbour facilities as a common facility to other LNG importers On the LNG contract negotiated by Enron for longterm supplies it has said that since the LNG market has witnessed great changes particularly as far as prices a re concerned the power company should take advantage of spot buys and renegotiate the contract accordingly THE TIMES OF INDIA Friday May Enron ready to take part in PPA talk Nitin Yeshwantrao The Enron management has finally agreed to participate in a discussion with the Madhav Godboleled renegotiation committee setup to facilitate the restructuring of the Power Purchase Agreement PPA signed between the US power major and the state governmentOfficials of Dabhol Power Company DPC a subsidiary of Enron alongwith their team of shareholders and lenders will arrive here on May for talks with the ninemember Godbole panelThough the DPC spokesperson was reluctant to give a confirmation a k ey Mantralaya official told The times of India that the team had expressed willingness for talks with the experts committee in a bid to end the imbroglio Enrons response is viewed as a welcome development to amicably resolve the controversy which had been raging for the last few weeks with the board of directors of Enron authorising its India MD K Wade Cline to serve a termination notice to MSEB The state government on its part too adopted a confrontational position by slapping a Rs crore rebate charge on DPC fo r defaulting on power supplyHowever the sudden change of heart by the Enron management is largely attributed to the stand taken by its local lenders le d by Industrial Development Bank of India IDBI which had recently opposed t he move to pull out of the project This was in contradiction to the stand tak en by the foreign lenders of the DPC who were in favour of slamming the brakes on disbursement of funds to DPC The Congressled Democratic Front governme nt had publicly declared that it would impress upon the Enron management to renegotiate the PPA as scrapping the project would not be in the interest o f both the parties Last week the state government constituted a ninemember panel of experts under former bureaucrat Madhav Godbole Godbole had written to the DPC management inviting it for talks to renegotiate the PPA on May For the delayed response from Enron the meeting has been rescheduled to May The issues which would be debated at the meeting include the separation of the LNG facility from the power plant renegotiating LNG supply and shipping agreements redefining the DPC tariff and to convert it into a twopart tariff The Godbole panel will bargain hard for removal of dollar denomination in the fixed charge component and to allow the Maharashtra government to sell power to third parties THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS Friday May DPC team to appear before Godbole panel on May A battery of Dabhol Power Company DPC officials and foreign lenders will appear before the Madhav Godbole renegotiations committee on May as a matter of courtesyand not for presenting any

officials from the Enron Corp Bechtel General Electric its Liquefied Natural Gas suppliers Oman LNG and Abu Dhabi LNG and a Trustee Bank ABN Amro for the proposed May meeting it is reliably learnt Mantralaya sources said that the DPC had earlier expressed its inability to appear before the Godbole committee on May fixed earlier on account of the nonarrival of its team from Houston and other

board had almost decided to call it quits and proceed with the termination of the billion power projec t at Dabhol the veto exercised by the company chairman Kenneth Lay has save d the project at least for the timebeing Sources said the meeting held on Tuesday at the energy majors headquarters in Houston could have sounded th e death knell for the only big foreign investment in the Indian power sector Although the future of the project is still pretty uncertain with the lende rs unwilling to continue disbursements unless payment obligations are not honoured and contractual obligations left unfulfilled the veto exercised a t this juncture by the chairman of the parent company has come as a big boost to the Indian venture Company sources said We do not know what went on there but it is true that as of now we are not pulling out With the engineering procurement and construction contractors GE and equipment suppliers Bechtel too in a cautious mode mode DPC was finding it even mor e difficult to continue the construction of the project as per the schedules Sources said the stand taken by the rest of the directors on the board woul d be in view of the backlash that the company would have to face from its shareholders if the project actually floppedEnron had similar bitter experiences in Pakistan and it was difficult for the parent company to then justify such investments to the shareholders Enron which had planned a major investments in Indias infrastructure sectors such as oil and gas LNG gas transportation telecom and broadband network has already pulled out most of their personnel from some of these operations The companys MoUs with various other majors like Indian Oil Corporation too is in a limbo and the US majors stake in the oil and gas venture is up for

already mooted this suggestion but a favourable reply is yet to come from the Union power ministry the official said The official said that the Centre which was also responsible for DPC project as it has provided counter guarantee to Enron India should form a special purpose vehicle for sale of the excess power to other states The state governments reaction comes in wake of Uni on power minister Suresh Prabhus discussion with Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh in Delhi few days ago It was learnt that Prabhu told Deshmukh there is no question of NTPC buying power from the project since long term PPAs have been signed by NTPC with the buying states Deshmukh had suggested that the Central power utility should sell excess power over and above the mw needed for the state from the DPCs mw phaseI and soon to be commissioned phaseII of mw to other nee dy states Considering the high cost of power generated from DPC which duri ng the recent months has hovered around Rs per unit as against an average co st of Rs a unit from Central and state utilities there would be fe w takers for the power from Dabhol the power minister reportedly said Deficit states will buy DPC power only when the cost of power is brought down he said adding power ministry would facilitate wheelng of this pow er to the buyers BUSINESS STANDARD Monday May Reliance allowed to hawk power from Patalganga to third parties Arijit De S Ravindran Renni Abraham in Mumbai In an unusual departure from normal practice the Maharashtra government h as allowed the Reliance group to sell power generated by its mw Patalgan ga power project directly to third parties if the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB does not lift power The projects power purch ase agreement PPA has a clause to this effect The state governments permission to Reliance to hawk power to third parties has to be seen in th e context of its dithering on forwarding to the Centre the Dabhol Power Companys bid for mega power status so that it could sell power to thir d parties DPC sources told Business Standard several weeks ago that the companys application had been pending with the Chief Ministers office for months Only now has the state government authorised the Godbole committee to negotiate with DPC on third party sales outside the state The DPC project is facing the threat of closure following MSEBs inability to buy power from it thanks to the Boards weak financial position Not only can the Reliance group sell power to third parties within Maharashtra but it can sell power to utilities outside the state The PPA does not expressly bar it from doing so Nor does it specify the category of customers to whom power can be sold So in effect this suggests that the group could sell power t o industrial and commercial customers in Maharashtra and emerge as a rival t o the MSEBThe state electricity board derives over per cent of its reven ue from such consumers Apart from captive power plants independent power producers in India are allowed to sell power only to state electricity boards They can sell powe r outside the state only if they qualify for mega power project status With its mw capacity the Patalganga project is not eligible for such status because mega power rojects are supposed to have a minimum capacity of mw Speaking on the sidelines of a press conference last week Reliance Industries managing director Anil Ambani told Business Standard A provisi on in third parties Ambani was answering a question on whether the MSEBs weak financials and inability to offer escrow cover to the project as emphasised in the Godbole committee report set up to defuse the Dabhol crisis would derail the Patalganga project The PPA does not have any express restriction as to third party sale outsid e the state a Reliance spokesperson confirmed on Friday in a faxed response to questions A senior MSEB official explained that the state government cleared private power projects some years ago on the basis of the unrealistically high demand projections contained in a report by a former MSEB official Subsequently it was realised that the state would be stuck with excess power So the Reliance group was permitted to sell power to thi rd parties he said The Patalganga project along with the Ispat groups mw Bhadravati project has been put on hold till the Godbole committee submi ts its second report THE ECONOMIC TIMES MAY No need of Patalganga Bhadravati power MSEB THE AXE seems to have finally fallen on the muchdelayed Reliance Industriespromoted Patalganga and Ispat Industries Bhadravati Power projects in Maharashtra as the state electricity board has firmly told the government that there is no need of these projects nor their power The lossmaking board has communicated to the government that MSEB had no interest in Patalganga and Bhadravati as it did not have escrowable capacity and also that industrial demand for power had slowed down tremendously in Maharashtra state government sources said here on Sunday In last November itself MSEB had sent an official intimation to the state government informing its decision in favour of cancellation of the two projects on several grounds including they being unviable and unaffordable sources said Reliances project is no different from that of DPCs Patalganga is also naphthabased and its PPA is on similar lines After the Enron experience MSEB cannot even dream of another gasbased power plant in the state a senior MSEB official said He said MSEB has already asked the state government not to provide escrow to both the m w Patalganga and the mw coalbased Bhadravati as the US energy major has almost squeezed us of all over finances When contacted MSEB chairman Vinay Bansal said Reliance and Ispat projects have been put on hold as pe r the Godbole Committees recommendations but expressed inability to give further details Currently Bhadravati and Patalganga projects have been put on hold as per Godbole Committee report which was set up to review the DPCMSEB PPA and energy scenario in Maharashtra Can you go ahead with the project without an escrow cover the committee was believed to have asked Ispat and Reliance representatives to which the reply had been negative sources added Sources said as of now both the projects have not been able to achieve financial closure as leading financial institutions were not willing to fund the projects which do not have a guaranteed payment mechanism from MSEB which incidentally it has promised to DPC All the three were clear ed as fasttrack projects but other than Enron Reliance and Ispat have bee n caught in a quagmire especially Bhadravati which has been hanging afire since last nine years they added Moreover the MSEB official opined that given the current situation if DPC calls it quits from India Bhadravati was a safer bet than Reliances Patalganga Patalgangas power would be mere paise less than that of DPC s that ranges anywhere around approximately Rs per unit to as high as R s while Bhadravatis cost could be around Rs to Rs per unit he informed MSEBs installed capacity ended on March was mw a nd it has generated million units with transmission and distribution losses as high as per cent PTI BUSINESS STANDARD MAY Global bankers ask govt to honour DPC obligations Tamal Bandyopadhyay Surajeet Dasgupta Santosh

GE may pull out as DPC supplier S Ravindran in Mumbai After USbased Bechtel it is now the turn of General Electric to review it s participation as equipment supplier to the controversial mw power project in Maharashtra being set up by the Dabhol Power CompanyBechtel is the EPC contractor to the project while GE has supplied the equipment primarily turbinesGeneral Electric like Bechtel also holds per cent i n Dabhol Power Company DPC And both Bechtel and General Electric are worri ed about future payments from DPC Sources familiar with the project said that so far DPC has not defaulted in its payments to General Electric What is worrying General Electric is the possible scenario after June when about mw power will be commissioned after the second phase trial runs DPC and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB have been locked in a payments dispute for months If MSEB continues with its stance DPC in turn may not be able to pay General Electric In such a situation GE may walk o ut of the project A final decision will be taken only in June said sources General Electric did not respond to a faxed questionnaire sent by Business Standard Senior executives at its public relations agency Burson Marsteller Roger Pereira said that only DPC executives were authorised to speak on the issue The DPC spokesman declined to comment on the issue The first phase of the mw

operational by April MSEB has refused to do this Earlier DPC had invoked the political force majeure clause in its contract with the board MSEB is now arguing that the invocation of this clause has absolved DPC of all its liabilities Consequently it will not operationalise the escrow account This casts a further shadow over DPCs ability to pay General Electric and Bechtel T his is worrying the

would be able to renegotiate the Dabhol power project promoted by the US energy major Enron may turn out to be misplaced The US energy major says that the Godbole committees suggest ions were unacceptable In response to a query from ET the company said in a statement that the published terms of the Godbole report do not repres ent an acceptable basis for further discussions The statement said that i t would be meeting the committee next week as a matter of courtesy Since the purpose of our meeting is to hear out the committee and understand thei r thoughts we will not present any proposals the statement said Accord ing to highlyplaced sources in the government the company has informed the Madhav Godbole panel that it would be meeting on May Earlier reports ha d indicated that the discussions with the panel would take place on May According to sources Enron would be meeting the panel with representatives of its lenders and shareholders The Godbole committee that studied the current power purchase agreement has called for cancellation of the presen t tariff structure renegotiation of the LNG and shipping contract removal o f dollar denomination as far as fixed charges of the tariff is concerned deb t restructuring and the formation of a committee to renegotiate the power purchase agreement These suggestions it seems may not be acceptable to Enron The Maharashtra government accepted the report and asked the Godbole committee to renegotiate The committee has been given a months time to renegotiate on behalf of the state government with DPC for a new PPA The committee has opined that since the LNG facility of mmpta is far in excess of what is required by the plant only mmpta of which mmpta is on take or pay it should be separated into a distinct facility whose capital costs should not be reflected in the fuel charge not as take or pa y It should instead be only in proportion to the fuel regassified for the pow er generation Using the entire allocated gas requires an unusually high PLF Instead the surplus gas can be sold to other players like Petronet or Enro n s own Metgas It is important to distribute the cost over the entire capacity and not just the amount sold to the power plant says the committee Similarly it has been suggested that Enron could lease out the harbour facilities as a common facility to other LNG importers On the LNG contract negotiated by Enron for longterm supplies it has said that since the LNG market has witnessed great changes particularly as far as prices a re concerned the power company should take advantage of spot buys and renegotiate the contract accordingly THE TIMES OF INDIA Friday May Enron ready to take part in PPA talk Nitin Yeshwantrao The Enron management has finally agreed to

spokesperson was reluctant to give a confirmation a k ey Mantralaya official told The times of India that the team had expressed willingness for talks with the experts committee in a bid to end the imbroglio Enrons response is viewed as a welcome development to amicably resolve the controversy which had been raging for the last few weeks with the board of directors of Enron authorising its India MD K Wade Cline to serve a termination notice to MSEB The state government on its part too adopted a confrontational position by slapping a Rs crore rebate charge on DPC fo r defaulting on power supplyHowever the sudden change of heart by the Enron management is largely attributed to the stand taken by its local lenders le d by Industrial Development Bank of India IDBI which had recently opposed t he move to pull out of the project This was in contradiction to the stand tak en by the foreign lenders of the DPC who were in favour of slamming the brakes on disbursement of funds to DPC The Congressled Democratic Front governme nt had publicly declared that it would impress upon the Enron management to renegotiate the PPA as scrapping the project would not be in the interest o f both the parties Last week the state government constituted a ninemember panel of experts under former bureaucrat Madhav Godbole Godbole had written to the DPC management inviting it for talks to renegotiate the PPA on May For the delayed response from Enron the meeting has been rescheduled to May The issues which would be debated at the meeting include the separation of the LNG facility from the power plant renegotiating LNG supply and shipping agreements redefining the DPC tariff and to convert it into a twopart tariff The Godbole panel will bargain hard for removal of dollar denomination in the fixed charge component and to allow the Maharashtra government to sell power to third parties THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS Friday May DPC team to appear before Godbole panel on May A

officials from the Enron Corp Bechtel General Electric its Liquefied Natural Gas suppliers Oman LNG and Abu Dhabi LNG and a Trustee Bank ABN Amro for the proposed May meeting it is reliably learnt Mantralaya sources said that the DPC had earlier expressed its inability to appear before the Godbole committee on May fixed earlier on account of the nonarrival of its team from Houston and other parts of the world However the company has ultimately decided to meet the Godbole committee o n May DPC spokesman Jimmy Mogal said We confirm that DPC has been invited to meet the recently formed

MSEB contract THE ENRON power project crisis on Thursday deepened with the board of Dabho l Power Company authorising the management to issue a termination notice to t he Maharashtra State Electricity Board even while international lenders to the project asked Enron to renegotiate power purchase agreement signed with the MSEB The decision to authorise managing director Neil McGregor to issue notice of termination on the contract to sell MW of power was taken after the board prevented MSEB from voting on the ground that it was an interested party The decision was taken with six votes in favour and the single opposition vote was cast by IDBI sources said According to reports financial institutions such as ANZ Investment Bank Credit Suisse First Boston Citibank ABNAmro and the State Bank of India have on Wednesday advised Enron against terminating its PPA with MSEB MSEB chairman Vinay Bansal who with two other directors attended the meeting on Wednesday representing Maharashtras per cent stake in the near bi llion project said The Indian side told them that it would be unfortunate if Enron broke the contract While Bansal declined comment on the board decision the sources said the

made a protest payment of Rs crore disputed amount towards March bill of Rs crore to Dabhol We were ready with the payment on Wednesday itself but DPC officials could not collect the cheque due to the statewide bandh a senio r MSEB official said We have disputed payment of Rs crore and it woul d be now taken up at the disputes resolution forum of which Enron India managing director K Wade Cline and Krishna Rao are members MSEB sources said Last week DPC had dashed off a communication to the government and MSEB th at it would not accept protest payments anymore Cline had said the energy major shall treat such payments as an election to pay the sums which MSEB in fact owed DPC in full and that the company would also not recognise the purported protest or reservation MSEB had paid a Rs crore

Wednesday authorised the managing director of Enron India to iss ue a notice for terminating the power purchase agreement to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board and the state government The board has authori sed Wade Cline to serve the termination notice However this does not mean tha t the termination notice will be served immediately It is only an enabling provision and will be used only if the situation arises a state govern ment source told Business Standard from London He said DPC was under pressure from its lenders The DPC spokesperson here refused to comment on the issue The hardening of the boards stand is in sharp contrast to the advice of DPCs lenders w ho had warned Enron not to precipitate matters by issuing a termination notice The lenders had arrived at a consensus that the termination notice need not be served at this stage Serving of the notice requires a nod from the lenders who have an exposure of about billion in the project Sources said given the lenders strong opposition to termination of the contract t he Enron boards enabling resolution did not have much significance beyond conveying a hardening of its stand with regard to the current imbroglio Th e Maharashtra Chief Minister had warned Enron not to scuttle the process of crisis resolution by issuing a termination notice The state government is to nominate an expert group to renegotiate the

stage is also set for a preliminary termination notice to be served by DPC to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB within the next four weeksThis follows the authorisation given to Enron Indias managing director K Wade Cline and DPC president CEO Neil McGregor to serve the termination notice and transfer notices to MSEB following Wednesdays DPC board meeting in London The essence of the message from the international lenders following the London meeting with DPC board is Emotions do not work Contractual obligations and payments have to be met We are convinced that the MSEB has failed to meet its obligations There is no point in Enron continuing with the project and the company should get out of itThe structuring of DPC s debt has created two classes of lenders In phaseI international lenders are covered by a sovereign guarantee while in phaseII no lender is However all lenders have a parri passu charge making attachment of assets a messy affair Sources in international banks were quick to point out that local lenders t o phaseII of the project are worried that an awry DPC project will affect their interests more given that they have no security other than asset s like a sovereign cover It was this desperation that made local lenders like IDBI slash the interest rates a few months back to per cent from per cent a leading foreign banker pointed outThree points that were m ade clear and stressed in no uncertain terms by international lenders were a there are contractual obligations b MSEB was not punctual in its payments to DPC and c MSEB adopted a confrontational position by slapping a Rs cro re rebate charge on DPC for misdeclaration and default on the availability of power While local lenders led by IDBI with MSEB parroting the same were of the view that the current situation is a temporary one international lenders were steadfast that pulling out of the project is the only way out This is despite the stance taken by IDBI and MSEB that authorisation for terminatio n given to Mr Cline and Mr McGregor was not called for International bankers pointed out that they will now have to look at the issue of charges and protection for their loans in the event of the power project being scrapped in its present formThe points of contention are a that phaseI of DPC is backed by a sovereign guarantee b phaseII is not and c to the extent tha t phaseII is covered by assets cancellation of phaseII may see all assets even those under phaseI getting attached Therefore an examination o n the segregation of assets under phaseI and phaseII is now warranted PTI adds In a significant move DPC board has empowered its management to sever power supply agreement with MSEB a move that could inflict a financi al liability of about Rs crore on the Centre A decision to authorise DPC president Neil McGregor to issue a termination notice to MSEB for sale of power was taken by the board at its meeting on Wednesday THE INDIAN EXPRESS Friday April Enron Dabhol chief gets powers to end deal with the MSEB THE BOARD of Dabhol Power Company a subsidiary of Houstonbased Enron Corp has decided to warn the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB that it intends to pull the plug on its Guhagarbased projectIn a board meeting he ld in London on Wednesday the board decided to authorise DPC President and CE O Neil McGregor and Enron Indias managing director K Wade Cline to serve a preliminary termination notice for sale of power to the MSE B within the next four weeksThe Dabhol project has been mired in disputes since MSEB began missing payments last year MSEB owes Dabhol Power million for power delivered in December and January The payment ran into a dispute aft er MSEB slapped penalty notices of Rs crore on DPC for its failure to supp ly power within three hours of the demand being placedBut MSEB has paid million for February And a payment of million was made for March on Thursday The billion Dabhol project is the largest foreign investment made in Ind ia to date Issuing the preliminary termination notice could enable Dabhol to suspend deliveries as it negotiates payment disputesWhile a preliminary termination notice is the first of three steps that could potentially lead to the abandonment of the project by Enron analysts have described the decisi on as a procedural move consistent with DPCs negotiating s trategy to recover overdue payments from the MSEB After the company issues the preliminary termination notice step two would be an official termination notice and step three would be a notice that th e company is surrendering control of the project If the project is terminate d the government of India will have to take a hit of million besides paying bills of Rs crore for the next one year to Enron as penalty Our Centres liability if Dabhol power project is terminated would be one years electricity bill and a termination fee of million Power Secretary A K Basu saidContractually the Centre will have to pay one year s electricity bill totalling at present prices about Rs crore and take over DPCs debt which stands at around million if the pr oject was terminated Basu said in Delhi Dabhol Power is in the process of completing the second phase of the megawatt powerplant project whic h is per cent through While the international lenders to the project are pressurising the company to get out of the project Indian lenders led by IDBI are asking the company to reconsider its decision on its termination notice During the meeting in London MSEB which holds a per cent stake in the project had strongly opposed DPCs move to authorise Cline and McGregor to issue not ices for termination MSEB Chairman Vinay Bansal and technical director Prem Paunikar both directors on the DPC board and the state principal secretary energy VM Lal an invitee to the board raised the issue at the board meeting in London MSEB claimed that DPC was needlessly threatening to issue various arbitration notices and thereby interpreting the clauses of PPA in isolationIn recent weeks Dabhol has raised the stakes in its spat with th e MSEB delivering a notice of political force majeure to Maharashtra a step typically invoked to dissolve a contract in case of an emergency like a war coup or a similar radical political event In this case DPCs move was viewed as a threat to stop providing electricityDPC has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power Critics object to the company charging Rs a kilowatthour for its power compared with around Rs a kilowatthour charged by other suppliers THE HINDU Friday April Offer of renegotiation too late Enron By Mahesh Vijapurkar MUMBAI APRIL The Enronsponsored Dabhol Power Company which last nigh t authorised its local management to issue a notice of termination of its Pow er Purchase Agreement PPA with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board has decided to keep a stiff upper lip This in turn has stoked speculation th at the switching off of power from its Phase I plant was imminent while in reality a lengthy procedure has to be followed as prescribed within the PP A As one source familiar with the PPA told The Hindu it is not sudden deat h of the project and in all probability the DPC vexed with the developments including sharp and pointed observations by the Godbole Committee has chosen to only arm itself with a serious option This woul d only eventually come into effect It is not an overnight operation and a lo t of legal work is involved Apparently the DPC intends to do some armtwisting At the board of directors meeting in London which Maharashtra was initiall y disinclined to attend but later used the forum to put across its contention s on the project the DPC squarely told the MSEB nominees on the board that t he offer of renegotiation had come rather too late It also said it did no t see any room for optimism about the outcome It did not however rule out the option of talks thus underscoring the possibility that the decision to authorise termination was a new weapon The Maharashtra Chief Minister Mr Vilasrao Deshmukh had hoped that DPC would not take any harsh step which would cause lot of damage to the interests of both the independent power producer and the Government and tod ay he expressed his dismay In fact the mandate of the team that went on the strength of its stake in the DPC was to put across the idea that negotiati on was the requirement and not confrontation Echo in LS The Enron issue also echoed in the Lok Sabha today where the Power Minister Mr Suresh Prabhu said that scrapping of the agreement would cost the Cent re Rs crores whose liability in the project agreement was limited The Centres liability in case of termination is one years electricity bill an d a termination fee of million Blow to FIs The termination could prove to be a serious blow to the Indian Financial Institutions FIs which under the leadership of the IDBI were trying to convince the other lenders of the project against the notice The exposure of Indian FIs in the project is understood to be not covered by any guarantee either of the Centre or the State THE TIMES OF INDIA Friday April Enron ready to pull out but lenders say wait The Dabhol Power Company board which met on Wednesday in London authorise d the company management to issue a termination notice to the Maharashtra Sta te Electricity Board The company however may not pull out of the project ye t considering its lenders who met on Monday opposed such a move and favoure d renegotiations Sources present during both the meetings said that though foreign lenders supported Enron on the termination issue domestic financia l institutions led by the Industrial Development Bank of India prevailed ov er the deliberations to oppose any such drastic move Enron needs the lenders consent to file a pretermination notice for pulling out from the project The decision to empower DPC chief Wade Cline to issue a termination notice was taken with six votes in favour against a single IDBI vote against such a move Another significant development during the entire proceedings was that the financial institutions made it clear that further funding of Phase II of th e project will depend on the Government of India assuring payment mechanisms Institutions are yet to disburse about per cent of the sanctioned packag e which is crucial for completing the Phase II expansion project The board has given powers to Wade Cline to issue a pretermination notice But the meeting quite unanimously felt the need of the hour is not to terminate the project but to initiate serious renegotiation proceedings said MSEB Chairman Vinay Bansal who attended the board meeting MSEB presented the ir views to the board members and it was understood by Enron which also includ ed the Rs crore penalty issue which is heading for arbitration proceedings We have also made it clear that the tariff structure of Enron is quite hi gh and a downward revision of tariffs is unavoidable Bansal added They cannot issue a termination notice without our consent since our exposure in the project is quite large and the lenders should approve any plans in that direction said a top banker who was present during the lenders meet There is a general consensus that the project must be completed and the proposal to terminate the PPA should be kept in abeyance he added The global arrangers for the DPC include ANZ Investment Bank Credit Suisse First Boston ABNAMRO Citibank and the State Bank of India where all these parties conducted separate meetings with the company officials However some bankers said the company can file a termination notice even if one lender with a minimum per cent exposure on the project favours such proceedings Meanwhile in a clear reversal of roles Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasra o Deshmukh said that the state government was not keen on terminating the PPA We will ask them to refrain from taking any such harsh steps since that would be bad news for all of us including DPC Deshmukh said Deshmukh w as echoing Union Power Minister Suresh Prabhus sentiments who said that the government wanted an amicable settlement of the payment row He however added that termination of the project would not hurt foreign investments a nd dismissed warnings by analysts that winding up the billion project wou ld be a blow to Indias efforts to woo foreign investors The DPC has already slapped one conciliation notice on the Centre and three arbitration notices on the state government over nonpayment of dues amounting to Rs crore and interest towards the bills due for December and January Meanwhile MSEB officials said in Mumbai that the March bills amounting to Rs crore was paid on Thursday as protest payment despite the dispute over the amount When asked on the future course of action Bansal said it was up to the DPC THE HINDU BUSINESSLINE Friday April DPC board authorises MD to issue PPA termination notice THE board of directors of Dabhol Power Company DPC has authorised the Managing Director Mr Neil McGregor to issue the notice of intent to terminate its power purchase agreement PPA with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB at an appropriate time The decision was taken at a board meeting held in London yesterday While MSEB which is an interested party was not allowed to vote it made a presentation clarifying its stand on the matter a senior State Government official said The resolution to authorise the management to issue the termination notice was carried by six votes to one IDBI voted against the decision the official said The serving of the preliminary termination notice will lead to a sixmonth suspension period According to clause of the Termination Procedure of the PPA Following the giving of a preliminary termination notice the parties shall consult for a period of six months o r such longer period as they may agree as to what step shall be taken with a view to mitigating the consequences of the relevant event having regard to all the circumstances IDBI and State Bank of India the principal Indian lenders had earlier persuaded the overseas lenders to hold their consent to the termination notice for some more time At least one lender has to consent for the compa ny to serve termination notice It is understood that overseas lenders are in favour of termination of the project and are prepared to consent However domestic lenders are worried about the security of their advances if the PP A is abandoned midway According to institutional sources Indian lenders are trying to get all th e parties concerned to thrash out outstanding issues The Maharashtra and Central Governments too are in favour of a conciliation Mr Vilasrao Deshmukh Chief Minister of Maharashtra yesterday went on record that the State did not want the project terminated Mr Yashwant Sinha Union Finance Minister is also understood to be of the same opinion The DPC will now have to decide what is the appropriate time to serve the notice the official said MSEB pays Rs crore Meanwhile MSEB has paid DPC Rs crore towards its March bill MSEB officials confirmed that the bill w as paid in protest today morning They DPC had billed us for an amount of Rs crore We do not agree with some of the items included a senior MSEB official said THE PIONEER Friday April Enron testing Maharashtras nerves T N Raghunatha Dabhol Power Company DPC has begun to put fresh pressure on the Maharasht ra State Electricity Board MSEB the Maharashtra State Government and the Centre for an early resolution to the prolonged dispute between them if th e DPC Board of Directors decision to authorise its managing director to serv e a contract termination notice to the MSEB is any indication The DPC Board in its meeting in London on Wednesday empowered the company management to sever its power supply agreement with MSEB a move that could inflict a financial liability of Rs crore on the Centre The decision to authorise the DPC management to issue a termination notice to MSEB was taken by a vote of six to one after the Maharasthra Government representatives were prevented from voting on the ground of interested party When contacted the companys Mumbaibased spokesperson Mr Jimmy Mogal declined to comment on the reports about the decision taken by the DPC Boar d We have nothing to say on the reports emanating from London We will expre ss our views after a few days he said However Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh on Thursday termed the DPC boards decision as unfortunate We have already requested the company not to take any harsh decision Mr Deshmukh said in Mumbai Official sources in the State Energy Ministry interpreted the DPC Boards decision as a pressure tactic employed by the Enron subsidiary to force the MSEB to clear the pending power bills without any further delay Through it s tough posture the DPC wants to make its position stronger before it can formally agree for renegotiations with the MSEB the Centre and the State Government for cutting the price of power supplied by it to the State electricity board The sources said that the DPCs reported decision to authorise its managing director to stop electricity supply to the MSEB did not mean that the Enron subsidiary would actually go ahead with the scrappi ng of the power contract with the MSEB If anything the DPCs reported decision is to mount additional pressure o n the MSEB for clearance of pending power bills and put itself in a stronger position in settling its dispute with the MSEB As part of its plan to arm itself with powers to break a contract in case situation goes beyond its control the DPC had recently served a political force majeure to the MSEB the Centre and the State Government the sources saidNot surprisingly th e DPCs London decision comes on the heels of the Maharashtra Governments decision to set up a highlevel committee comprising representatives of th e MSEB the Centre and the State Government to renegotiate with the Enrons subsidiary company for reducing the cost of power supplied to the State electricity boardMeanwhile amidst the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head the MSEB on Thursday made a protest payment o f the Rs crore disputed amount towards March bill of Rs crore to D PC riday April THE TELEGRAPH Friday April ENRON SIGNAL TO SWITCH OFF DABHOL POWER Enron today took the first decisive step out of the controversyridden Dabh ol Power Company when it won an authorisation from the companys board to s top sale of power to Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB The meeting of the company of which the Houstonbased energy giant holds per cent and the MSEB per cent was attended by state energy secretary V M Lal and MSEB technical director P Paunikar and it came days after its lende rs discussed payment problems and a possible terminationThe Centres liabi lity if Enron decides to snap the agreement will be a years power bill and a termination fee of million However the company will have to wait fo r six months from the day it serves the notice before it pulls the plugThe Centre shrugged off the move saying there would not be any adverse effect on foreign investment in power if Enron walks out We do not see FDI inflo ws into the power sector being hit power minister Suresh Prabhu saidMSEB officials said the ball is now in the court of DPC which said its corporat e policy did not allow it to comment on proceedings at board meetings The decision coincided with a Rs crore protest payment by the cash strapped power board as part of the March bill worth Rs crore There was speculation that MSEB coughed up the amount to cool frayed temper s at Enrons hub in Houston and because it was rattled by the sudden turn of events in the past few days during which the dispute had come to a head MS EB officials brushed away the allusions saying the cheque was ready on Wednesday but could not be handed over to DPC because of the statewide bandh We have a disputed payment of Rs crore which will be take n up at the disputeresolution forum a board official said Last week DPC told the state government and MSEB it would no longer accept protest payments in a move to fortify its legal position MSEB officials say Bechtel and General Electric the other partners who hol d around per cent in DPC are willing to go along with Enron Corp in terminating the deal but financial institutions such as IDBI are not game because it puts their loans at risk Investments made by Indian institution s are not covered under the Centres and states counterguarantees un like those made by international lendersMaharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh called Enrons decision unfortunate We had told state gove rnment officials attending the Enron board meeting to stop the company from windin g up its operations in the state as it will harm both parties THE STATESMAN Friday April Enron threatens to pull out The Enron crisis deepened with the Board of Directors of the Dabhol Power Company deciding to authorise the managing director Mr K Wade Cline to serve a notice of termination on the contract for the first phase of the billion power projectThe decision which could lead to the cessation of Dabhols power supply to the state was taken at the meeting held yester day in London according to reports quoting the chairman of the Maharashtra Stat e Electricity Board Mr Vinay Bansal While DPC officials refuse to comment on anything it is learnt that MSEB w as itself prepared to serve a legal notice of termination just two days before the meetingMSEB was said to have been dissuaded by the Nationalist Congres s Party president Mr Sharad Pawar and union power minister Mr Suresh Prabhu who had talks in New Delhi with the Maharashtra chief minister Mr Vilasrao Deshmukh and an MSEB delegation last Monday The state government has been served two arbitration notices while the Cent re is ready to go for conciliation with the DPC for failing to honour its counterguaranteeFurther the DPC has already slapped a notice of politica l force majeure which protects itself against undeserved claims in the event of exigencies that force it to take an extreme stepThe union power minister Mr Suresh Prabhu contended in Delhi that since DPC contributed only per cent of the total energy output of the country its termination would not have such a phenomenal impact on the power situation However if terminations proceedings go through Enron Corp a per cent shareholder in the Dabhol Power Company would stand to net a hefty amount in damages The union power secretary has been quoted as saying that termination of the DPC would cost the Centre Rs crore which is the total of one years electricity bill and a termination fee of milli on According to an energy analyst Mr Pradyumna Kaul the total liability woul d not cross Rs crore However Mr Prabhu said in the Lok Sabha today that the that scrapping of the agreement would cost the Centre Rs croreIt is learnt that on April Mr Deshmukh had given the goahead to the MSEB to prepare a legal notice to be issued to Enron during the meeting of the DPC s Board of Directors on Wednesday At the meeting the energy minister Padamsinh Patil energy secretary Mr Vinay Mohan Lal and MSEB chairman Mr Vinay Bansal were also presentThe notice was prepared over the past weeke nd and taken by the delegation when they called on Mr Prabhu on April However the politicians convinced them that Enron would not get tough giv en its huge stake in the project and that such a notice would not be necessar y The meeting thus ended with the decision to renegotiate the power tariff with Enrons consent Among those present at the London meeting were Mr Lal Mr Bansal and MSEB technical director Mr P Paunikar in their capacity as directors However they abstained from voting since they were deemed an interested party The only vote to go against the decision was that of the IDBI which is also represented on the board it is learntThe chief minister Mr Vilasrao Deshmukh said the state was not in favour of terminating the project This could mean that the latest manoeuvre to armtwist the Indian authorities could achieve its immediate target of getting the arrears accumulated over the past three months clearedThe MSEB owes Enron Rs crore for March and Rs crore for December and January The Centre today p ut up a brave face on Enrons decision saying there would not be any advers e effect on foreign investment in power sector in the country PTI reported from New Delhi There will be no adverse impact as a result of any action by any domest ic or foreign company As far as we are concerned there will be no adverse impact on FDI in power sector Power Minister Suresh Prabhu told reporters whe n asked about DPCs decision to authorise management to issue a terminatio n notice to MSEBEmphasising that there would be no fallout of such decision Prabhu said after the meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs we are expecting cooperation from many Scandinavian countries as well a s European nations in the power sectorIn fact not only the Power Ministe r but also the Prime Minister of Norway was here to inaugurate a seminar on power and he promised lot of cooperation in the sector MID DAY DPC may not wind up Maharashtra Chief Secretary V Ranganathan has said that though Neil McGrego r managing director of the Dabhol Power Corporation DPC has been given complete powers with regard to DPCs operations in the state including the authority to wind up operations it does not necessarily mean that McGregor will issue such a termination notice McGregor was given the powers at a meeting of the DPC board in London on Wednesday Ranganathan said that stat e officials including Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB Chairman Vinay Bansal and Power Secretary V M Lal have reported back to him about t he meeting in London With regard to the states failure to pay Enron Ranganathan said Bills are prepared as per the Power Purchase Agreement PPA and DPC owes some money to us Our people informed Enron officials about this In fact ther e was no reason to give powers to the MD to slap a termination noticeIn the London meeting MSEB and Industrial Development Bank of India IDBI representatives insisted that the DPC must pay Rs crore since it could not supply power whenever needed Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh has already termed as unfortunate the decision of the board of the Enronpromoted DPC to give McGregor powers to wind up operations Deshmukh added We have already requested Enron not t o take any harsh decisionDeshmukh had earlier said We have directed stat e Government officials attending the DPC board meeting to desist the energy company from winding up operations in the state as it would be harmful to both of us Enron officials are keeping mum on the issue McGregor said I am not goi ng to give any comment MID DAY April Enron offers no comment on renegotiation H S Rao A crucial meeting of the Board of Directors of the Dabhol Power Company DPC promoted by the US energy major Enron was held here yesterday apparently to discuss fate of its million power project in Maharashtra but there was no official word on the Indian and state Governments decisio n to renegotiate the contract An Enron spokesman declined to divulge what transpired at the meeting sayi ng the issues discussed at the meeting were confidential We have not received any direct communication Unless we get it and evaluate the detail s we have no comments to make the spokesman said when asked about the proposed decision on renegotiation of the project in which the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB has per cent stake Asked whether the Board had taken a decision on empowering DPC Managing Director Neil McGregor to wind up its operations in India the spokesman sa id he had nothing to say on them Enron has reportedly authorised Mcgregor to look at various options including selling the companys stake in DPC Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh said in Mumbai that the state Government would pay up the undisputed dues to the company He said the Maharashtra government is not in favour of terminating the MW projec t but wanted an amicable solution to the imbroglio MID DAY Friday April Committee to renegotiate Enron deal A committee to renegotiate the Power Purchase Agreement with the Dabhol Pow er Company will be appointed by this evening Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh said today Addressing media persons after his meeting with the noted socia l reformer Anna Hazare at his official residence Varsha Deshmukh said the committee would be formed by this evening or by tomorrow at the mostHe termed as unfortunate the Enron board decision empowering DPC chief Neil McGregor to serve a preliminary termination notice on the Maharashtra State Electricity Board and said the state was willing to negotiate the issue wit h power company Renegotiations will be held as per the suggestions made by the Godbole committee and the center will also depute its representative on the renegotiating committee We dont want to take any hasty decision Deshmuk h saidHe pointed that the only bone of contention with the DPC had been its expensive tariff and hoped that the issue would be resolved amicablyWhen pointed that the Enron board had taken a decision to serve the notice despi te stateF s willingness to appoint a renegotiating committee Chief Ministe r said it was unfortunate Earlier in his meeting with Hazare Deshmukh promised to make necessary amendments to the Right to Information law recently passed by the state so that the information was easily accessed by the common people He also gave a patient hearing to Hazare on his complaints of corruption in various state departments and promised action against guilty after a thorough inquiry within three months AFTERNOON APRIL ENRONS ON State govt to renegotiate Dabhol Power Project By Hubert Vaz The US power giant Enron Power Corporations willingness to wrap up the Dabhol Power Project and leave the shores may not actually materialise though the Dabhol Power Company chief Mr Wade Cline has been authorised to do so since the lenders for the project would have a decisive say in the matter Disclosing this Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh confirmed this morning th at the state government would churn out a compromise formula by which the powe r project at Dabhol could be continued and at the same time Enron did not fe el slighted Enron has not yet conveyed to us about this decision We are waiting for their letter he said When asked what sort of compromise the state government plans to forge Mr Deshmukh said Let our officers come back After that we will decide a future course of action But we are definitely going in for renegotiation of the project It is very difficult to predict the outcome of Enrons decision but as of now the project is still on When asked whether the project could be moved to another state if wou nd up from Maharashtra Mr Deshmukh said that was not possible as per the terms of the agreement between the US company and the state government However it was difficult for the project to move out of the state itself he indicated He also confirmed that both parties would face considerable loss es if the project was terminated The board of directors of the Dabhol Power Company which met in London on Wednesday decided to put an end to all controversies surrounding the proje ct once and for all by empowering the DPC chief to terminate the project if h e deemed it fit However this decision as of now does not necessarily indicate the death knell for the project The Enron project which had been riddled with controversies right from its inception had been a pretext for the political parties in the state to drag each other on the mat from time to time The previous SenaBJP government which had been out to terminate the project however chose to continue with it following renegotiations with Enrons top visiting officials like Ms Rebecca Mark And the Democratic Front government inherited the controversial project when the governments changed hands a year and a half ago Meanwhile State Energy Minister Dr Padamsinh Patil when contacted at the Osmanabad Circuit House said the state government and the central governme nt have decided to appoint a joint committee to renegotiate the project with Enron It is not easy for them to walk out of the project just like that They will have to go in for litigation and this would prove costly for both sides he said In case the project is terminated the government can stil l manage the power needs of the state though it would be a bit tough job he added

April todaystateaspMenuD MSEB revenue collections up at Rs crore in March Renni Abraham THE FINANCIAL EXPRESSApril Godboles report unearths absurd calculations Maharashtra could use th is to wriggle out of the Dabhol project Sucheta Dalal It is finally Quit India time for Enron Though the controversial multinational has denied plans to sell its stake in Dabhol Power Company DPC informed sources say that it has sent feelers to China Light Power and others to offload its majority holdingGetting out of India may be the best course for Enron Though it has threatened a fight and invoked politic al force majeure the Energy Review Committee headed by Madhav Godbole will certainly weaken its case The committee points out that the many infirmities in the DPC approval process brings into question the propriety of the decisions It is clear that the m that Enron spent on educating Indias policymakers and bureaucrats did not even teach them the basics of technoeconomic appraisal or due procedure with regard to large internation al contracts The committee says it is troubled with the failure of govern ance that seems to have characterised almost every step of the decision making process on matters relating to DPC The failure of governance has been broa d across different governments at different points of time at both the state and the central level and across different agencies associated with examining the project and at both the administrative and political levels It strains belief to accept that such widespread and consistent failure to execute assigned responsibilities is purely coincidental Though the committee decided that it is not the proper forum to investigate these infirmities its two key members Mr Godbole and former secretary in the Ministry of Finance EAS Sarma have asked for a judicial inquiry into the process of clearing the DPC project Other members felt a judicial inquiry would delay the negotiation process and not serve any purpose There may be some merit in an argument against a further delay in renegotiating tariffs or facilitating Enrons exit but the report certa inly provides the Central Vigilance Commission CVC with all the grounds that i t needs to start an investigation CVC N Vittal has already received innumerable requests to investigate the deal especially the beneficiaries of its education campaign Though the political establishment may be reluctant to set up a judicial inquiry the CVC can establish whether there are lapses on the part of government functionaries including political executives and ensure appropriate action against them If it is indeed able to establish undue influence in signing the contract then Maharashtra may be able to get out of a deal patently against the public interest without any monetary liability The Godbole committee has vindicated the stand of antiEnron activists who have been opposed it since negotiations began in It establishes that Enron power is expensive per se and the project needs to be renegotiated regardless of the causes for the Maharashtra State Electricity Boards MSEB financial distress Also that DPCs extortionate tariffs are not merely because of the steep rise in petroproduct prices and rupee depreciation b ut mainly on account of its sweetheart deal with the state government Enron s contract is clearly onesided it deliberately uses expensive raw material ignoring World Bank warnings has worked on fanciful demandsupply estimates and several legal requirements and permissions In fact the committee has found that the MSEB has been paying Enron Rs crore more than it should every year This comprises overcharging of Rs crore on account of the large regassification plant of which only per ce nt of the capacity is used for DPC Theres also a Rs crore extra billi ng to the MSEB for shipping and harbour charges although the cost of these facilities had been included in the capital recovery charge By charging mo re than twice the operations maintenance rate stipulated by the government o f India Enron collects approximately Rs crore extra every year It has also been collecting Rs crore every year through inflated fuel consumption claims Enron has been charging at kcalkwh under the powe r purchase agreement PPA although the equipment manufacturer has guaranteed it a much lower consumption rate This gives it a fat fuel arbitrage opportunity at the cost of the people of Maharashtra The committee has also pointed to the strange practice of using four different exchange rates for different aspects of the project negotiation a rate of Rs per dollar was assumed for calculating debt service of rupee loans Rs per dollar as reference rate for PhaseI Rs per dolla r as reference rate for PhaseII and a curious Rs per dollar for calculati ng Government of India tariff Forcing a reduction of these excessive charges has nothing to do with contract cancellation All it needs is tough negotiation and public pressure on the political establishment The Godbole committee has established that DPCs tariffs can easily be h alved if excess payments are eliminated and unfair conditions such as the dollarisation of payments the takeorpay clause and escrow facility whic h is in fact hampering MSEBs reform particularly in power distribution a re scrappedThe security of future payments to DPC under the restructured tari ff would be based on increased cash flows from a reformed distribution system The committee also gives Enron a difficult escape route It says that if th e multinational finds the conditions for restructuring too onerous it should free MSEB from its contractual obligations and find buyers outside Maharashtra The committee has tried to establish another precedent on all projects negotiated by government The public has a right to know what is being contracted on their behalf and has recommended that all documents including contracts related to all Independent Power Projects IPPs particularly DPC should be published by the Maharashtra government within two months Also having established that demandsupply estimates by the state governme nt were fanciful the committee has asked MSEB to defer all negotiations with power producers until demand levels in the state permit full absorption of power generation from such IPPs It recommends that such negotiations shoul d be in accordance with the leastcost plan spelt out by the report This should also end the hectic lobbying by Reliance Patalganga Mittals Bhadravati the BSES Saphale and others to set up IPPs in Maharashtra THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS April DPC board set to authorise president Enron MD to issue notice of termination Sanjay Jog Scrapping of Power Purchase Agreement The board of directors of Dabhol Power Company DPC which has already tak en an aggressive posture has proposed to authorise the Enron India managing director K Wade Cline and DPC president and chief executive officer Neil McGregor to issue notices for the termination of power purchase agreement PPA and transfer of Dabhol project in view of continuing default by the state and Central governments and Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB The board of directors which would meet on April in London also plans to appoint Mr Cline as its true and lawful Attorneyinfact and author ise him to represent the company in the negotiation of all project contracts and financing agreements and their amendments and modificationsTop sources tol d The Financial Express that DPC would authorise Mr Cline andor Mr McGregor to serve the preliminary termination notices and transfer notices to the state and Central governments and MSEB under clause and schedule of the PPA In response to the continuing default by the MSEB of its payment obliga tions under the PPA the failure of the Government of Maharashtra to honour obligations under its guarantee and state support agreement and failure of the Government of India to honour obligations under its counter guarantee the company has sought recourse to dispute resolution and has initiated conciliation and arbitration proceedings the company resolution said Consistent with this recourse to contractual remedies the company now seeks the authority to serve preliminary termination notices and transfer notices pursuant to clause and schedule of the PPA from time to time and at a ny time upon the occurrence of an event giving rise to its right to serve such notices as determined by the company the resolution added According to the resolution the directors the company secretary and officers of the company and each of them acting individually are authorise d and empowered to execute and deliver such documents and instruments and tak e such other actions as they deem fit to effect the purpose of the resolution in the name and for and on behalf of the company Against this backdrop th e state government and MSEB have been exploring the possibilities of issuing termination notice to the DPC for its failure to meet the contractual obligations under the PPA The state government and MSEB sources said that such a notice could be served by the MSEB as DPC has not paid the rebate penalty of Rs crore for misdeclaration and default on the availabilit y of power on January and February The state government and MSEB which reviewed its position on Saturday at a meeting convened by the Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh are of the view that they have a strong case and substantial grounds to slap the terminatio n notice to the DPC The DPCs move to appoint Mr K Wade Cline as its true and lawful Attorneyinfact deserves importance especially when the state government proposes to set up a negotiating committee to cut the per unit cost and gauge the possibility of sale of Dabhol power to the power deficit states Mr Cline would also be authorised to dispose of equipment that is worn out or obsolete or other equipment or fuel no longer expected to be used in the ordinary course in amounts exceeding Rs crore or the equivalent in forei gn currency in any financial year Furthermore Mr Cline would be in a positio n to enter into contracts and take any other actions for purpose relating to the daytoday operation of the companys business or exercise its right s and discharge its obligations under the project contracts and the financing agreements BUSINESS STANDARD Monday

issue of serving a termination notice to the Maharshtra State Electricity Board MSEB DPC cannot go ahead with this unless it gets the go ahead from the lenders While bankers said the lenders meeting is about the second phase of the project which is still under construction state government officials clarified that since there is only one PPA covering both phases of the project the lenders decision will be applicable to the existing Phase I also The second phase of the project involves MW generation capacity whereas Phase I of MW is already operationalAccording to the loan agreement even if only four per cent of the lenders agree to terminate the contract then DPC can do so highly placed sources in the lenders consortium said from London This in effect means that only one lender has to agree for DPC to serve a preliminary termination noticeFollowing the notice there is a cooling off period of six months for both parties the MSEB and DPC to find a mutually acceptable solution which may take the form of a renegotiated PPA source s added Sources also said that there are two separate meetings scheduled wit h lenders The Monday meeting will be attended by all the lenders

Confirming that there was no proposal from the state government to handover the project to the Centre Mr Prabhu said that the situation of the electricity boards in the country was precarious The Centre had decided to assist Maharashtra upto Rs crore every year to improve customer services OUTLOOK Monday April The Real Story Of Dabhol If a judicial probe suggested by the committee i s ordered into the Enron deal it could embarrass three governments RANJIT BHUSHAN The Committee has prima facie found infirmities in several decisions taken in respect of the Enron project at different points of time by successive governments and agencies in the Centre and state Energy Review Committee headed by former home secretary Madhav Godbole This could well be the real Enron story A fivemember highpowered committee headed by Madhav Godboleand includ ing former Union economic affairs secretary EAS Sarma hdfc chairman Deepak Parekh teri chairman RajendraPachauri and Maharashtra government official Vinay Mohan Lalhas recommended a judicial probe into the entire Enron p ower project deal saying it signified the utter failure of governance that seem s to have characterised almost every step of the decisionmaking process relating to the Dabhol project The report which was submitted to the Maharashtra government last fortnight and has been acquired by Outlook is severely critical of former chief minister Sharad Pawar with the Congress then the day bjpled Union government which reworked the deal in Shiv Sena supremo Balasaheb Thackeray and his government in Maharashtra headed by Manohar Joshi The utter failure of governance seems to have characterised almost every step of decisionmaking relating to the Dabhol project Madhav Godbole Committee Report An investigation if ordered could embarrass at least these three governments The report clearly upholds the allegations of money being paid by Enron to politicians and bureaucrats for clinching the deal According to t he committee the deal reveals failure of governance both at the Centre and state and across different agencies It strains belief to accept that suc h widespread and consistent failure to execute responsibilities is purely coincidental the report said proposing a set of measures to be implement ed if something of the project was to be retrieved Godbole and Sarma also fel t that the panel should categorically recommend the government of India to order a judicial inquiry This was finally adopted by it Says a Congress leader Enron could well become the biggest political issue in Maharashtra and put to question liberalisation particularly in the power sector The proposal has already struck panic Says ncps Praful Patel If the Enr on decision has at all been detrimental it is because of the haste with which phase was cleared by the Shiv Senabjp government Now with the state having already entered into an agreement with Enron the important thing is to resolve it amicably A judicial inquiry will be an eyewash because its not an issue of corruption but that of perception Promarket Congressmen privately admit that it was their governments at the Centre and the state which invited Enron even though the second phase was cleared by the bjpShiv Sena combine Says Congress spokesperson Jaipal Reddy Right now were too involved with the Parliament deadlock over Tehelka Proliberalisation Congress MPs also fear that such witchhunting could send wrong signals to foreign investors NonCongress MPs from Maharashtra meanwhile claim that the Godbole Committee was instituted wit h the express purpose of politicising the Enron issue I think I know Vilasr ao Deshmukhs gameplan says an MP from the state But some MPs like Congress Prithviraj Chavan question the cloak of secrecy thats surrounded the deal Ive maintained for long that there should be a judicial committee to examine this The committee report also says that had the Enron project been subjected to a technoeconomic appraisal as envisaged under provisions of the Electricity supply Act of and related legislations the infirmities could have bee n avoidedSince this wasnt done questions about a concerted effort towards exercising undue influence at every stage of the project are bound to arise the exhaustive page report points out Id highlight the speed with which the day Vajpayee government cleared the project minutes before it quit says Congress MP Prithviraj Chavan The Enron project had been held out as an exemplar of the impending liberalisation in the early s and despite several controversies is now an established power project at Dabhol km south of Mumbai In July Enron signed an MoU with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board mseb to set up a MW station as part of the governments fast track projects Subsequently when the ShivSenabjp came to power in Maharashtra it filed a writ against the project This curiously led to renegotiations with Enron The committee has quoted a Bombay High Court order on the renegotiated deal Once it GoM decided to revive the project it acted in the very same manner its predecessors in office had done It forgot all about competitive bidding and transparency The speed with which the negotiating group studie d the project and made its proposal for renegotiatons which was accepted by Dabhol is unprecedented Says Chavan I would particularly like to highlight the speed with which the day Vajpayee government at Centre endorsed the renegotiated project minutes before it resigned Since the commissioning of the plant in May the mseb has paid Rs crore for the power it has bought from Dabhol If the same watttage of powe r had been bought from Indianbuilt power plants fired by indigenous coal th e payment would have been approximately Rs crore In the first yearandahalf of its operation itself the dpc had drained the Maharashtr a exchequer of nearly Rs crore The Central Electricity Authority cea in fact pointed out that the Dabh ol plant was not the least costly option The mseb had other inexpensive alternatives like the four units of Kaparkheda but they were in a preliminary stage The report notes if the mseb had made efforts to seriously pursue these projects they might not have remained in their preliminary stages It adds that the members were of the opinion that the mseb and the Maharashtra government erred seriously based on information available at that time in proceeding with the dpc as a baseload factor ev en when its capacity was reduced The failure seems to have been compounded b y the laxity of the Union power ministry finance ministry and the cea It quotes the cea as saying that since the Union finance ministry found the tariff reasonable no further examination was required Strangely Bal Thackerays Shiv Sena when it came to power together with t he BJP in Maharashtra filed a writ in the court and then renegotiated the dea l After the new Shiv Senabjp government took over its CM Manohar Joshi appointed a renegotiating committee in which made the right noises actually managing to reduce the tariff But certain things remained inexplicable No fresh clearances were required from the cea which also sa id that since no cost increase was involvedfresh formal clearance wasnt necessary Says the committee This only adds strength to the suspicion that the cea didnt consider the economic aspects of the project at all Indeed given the nonavailability of any official record of the meeting on June with the Committee and the nature of this letter dated December the Committee is doubtful whether the economic aspects o f dpc were discussed at all The credibility of the Shiv Senabjp government has been seriously questioned The Committee finds it unexplicable sic why there was no mention of any reduction in capital cost of the project from million to million as agreed by dpc in the summary report of the renegotiati ng committee the panel observesSays lawyer Prashant Bhushan It is strange that the Shiv Senabjp government first filed a writ in the court and then coolly renegotiated the deal The committee further spells out the losses incurred through the deal Subsequent to the commissioning of the dpc the financial deterioration of mseb has been rapid While the mseb was in profi t in it plunged into huge losses of Rs crore in Significantly the World Bank in had predicted the systems inherent weaknesses In a letter written to the then power secretary R Vasudevan a top bank official had said that after a detailed review of the analytical framework and costing assumptions we reconfirm our earlier conclusion that the Dabhol project as presently formulated is not economically justified and that in our assessment the project is too large to enter the mseb syst em in The proposed baseload operation could result in uneconomic plant dispatch as already existing lower variable cost coal power would be replaced by the higher cost lng power Enrons persistence and the gullibility of the Indian side can be gauged from highranking Enron official Joe Suttons letter to a key Indian official Ajit Nimbalkar I recently met with the World Bank and have been following the articles in the India papers I feel that the World Bank opinion can be changed Well engage a PR firm and hopefully manage the med ia from here on The project has solid support from all other agencies in Washington The key question in the Enron deal is whether a developed state like Maharashtra needs outside intervention in the power sector at all For the first time the Godbole committee has raised objections about the viability of such a project According to the report the mseb has been one of the bette r performing boards in the country and has despite a faulty transmission and distribution T and D system managed to consistently earn net revenue surpluses on an accrual basis Maharashtra accounts for nearly onefourth of the gross value of Indias industrial sector Its one of the few states to achieve per cent electrification Since the mseb has been adding to its generation Th is improvement which has been largely due to renovation and modernisation undertaken by the mseb exceeded its own expectations at a time when the dp c was being considered the report points out Following a policy of crosssubsidy roughly nine out of its ten users are subsidised But the gap between the average cost of supply and average realisation hasn t been much In fact the subsidy claim decreased from Rs crore in to Rs crore in until in it increased nearly fivefol d to Rs crore due to the sudden increase in the gap by paise per uni t from to paisean increase of per cent The increase in the su bsidy claim by Rs crore is due to the increase in the gap principally becau se of the increase in power purchase costs says the committee adding Without the dpc and without problems of T and D loss the mseb could be financially healthy But can that happen now since Enron is here to stay The committee has come up with some farreaching recommendations make public all Dabholrelated documents and agreements restructure the Dabhol project itself to bring do wn the cost of power restructure dpc financially allow sale of dpc power outside Maharashtra reexamine ppas in accordance with leastcost plans a nd thoroughly reform the msebThe committee know this can become reality only with political consensus and through forming of public opinion The questio n is can that be achieved in an unstable political environment With Priya Sahgal Making Of A Scam Centre invites Enron to set up fast track power project Dec First PPA signed with MSEB Enron starts construction SenaBJP govt scraps Enron State govt renegotiates project day Vajpayee govt approves counterguarantee May State cabinet clears PPA May Phase I commissioned Jul Financial closure for Phase II Oct MSEB defaults on payment subsequently stops paying monthly bil ls Feb Enron invokes Central governments counterguarantee BUSINESS STANDARD Monday April MSEB revenue collections up at Rs crore in March Renni Abraham The Maharashtra State Electricity Boards MSEB revenue collections in Mar ch stood at a record Rs crore This was largely due to the disconnection drive on defaulter connections pegged at nearly disconnections a month which resulted in compliance by consumers With t he Dabhol Power Company DPC monthly financial burden issue now a topic of discussion among arbitrators on the negotiating table the MSEB has turned to putting its house in order As if to ward of any criticism of its fiscal condition that could be termed as the facilitator to the entire DPC tariff crisis the state electricity board has put matters relating to its performance on record For instance MSEB has recorded the highest power generation in the year ended March at units compared with the previous years units making it the top SEB of the country in this respect Similarly its power stations recorded the highest availability percentage at up from per cent last fiscal Plant load factor is up to per cent compared with per cent in The Parli power station has recorded the highest ever generation in the ten years of its life time in at million units which made it eligibl e for the meritorious productivity award under the eligibility guidelines issued by the Government of India carrying a cash award of Rs lakh Al l other power stations in the state without exception also fulfill the eligibility criteria for the cash award a senior MSEB official said Similarly the Chandrapur power station became the first power station of a ny state electricity board to get the ISO certification A senior MSEB official said Earlier MSEB was suffering from too much interference in its day to day functioning The agriculturists were touted as the major reason for its deteriorating accruals while theft of electricity during the transmission and distribution stage was conveniently camouflaged under this head In the recent past the government has authorised MSEB to take steps to curb this misuse of power by its own officials many of whom including a chief engineer have suffered suspensions

to cancel MSEB contract THE ENRON power project crisis on Thursday deepened with the board of Dabho l Power Company authorising the management to issue a termination notice to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board even while international lenders t o the project asked Enron to renegotiate power purchase agreement signed wi th the MSEB The decision to authorise managing director Neil McGregor to issue notice of termination on the contract to sell MW of power was taken after the board prevented MSEB from voting on the ground that it was an interested p arty The decision was taken with six votes in favour and the single opposi tion vote was cast by IDBI sources said According to reports financial institutions such as ANZ Investment Bank C redit Suisse First Boston Citibank ABNAmro and the State Bank of India h ave on Wednesday advised Enron against terminating its PPA with MSEB MSEB chairman Vinay Bansal who with two other directors attended the meeting on Wednesday representing Maharashtras per cent stake in the near bill ion project said The Indian side told them that it would be unfortunate if Enron broke the contract While Bansal declined comment on the board de cision the sources said the Indian side had expressed its interest to hold s talks on the issue rather than terminating the project and there were pos sibilities of a fresh power purchase agreement between the company and the state PTI THE ECONOMIC TIMES Friday Apr MSEB pays Rs cr under protest to DPC DESPITE the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head M aharashtra State Electricity Board on Thursday made a protest payment of Rs crore disputed amount towards March bill of Rs crore to Dabh ol We were ready with the payment on Wednesday itself but DPC officials could not collect the cheque due to the statewide bandh a senior MSEB off icial said We have disputed payment of Rs crore and it would be now taken up at the disputes resolution forum of which Enron India managing d irector K Wade Cline and Krishna Rao are members MSEB sources said Last week DPC had dashed off a communication to the government and MSEB th at it would not accept protest payments anymore Cline had said the energ y major shall treat such payments as an election to pay the sums which MSE B in fact owed DPC in full and that the company would also not recognise th e purported protest or reservation MSEB had paid a Rs crore Februa ry bill in protest last month On April last both domestic and internat ional lenders of DPC had met in London and held exhaustive discussions the multinationals move to issue a termination notice to MSEB and state govern ment PTI BUSINESS STANDARD Friday April Enron India MD authorised to terminate PPA The board of the Enronpromoted Dabhol Power Company DPC at its meeting in London on Wednesday authorised the managing director of Enron India to issue a notice for terminating the power purchase agreement to the Maharash tra State Electricity Board and the state government The board has author ised Wade Cline to serve the termination notice However this does not mea n that the termination notice will be served immediately It is only an ena bling provision and will be used only if the situation arises a state gov ernment source told Business Standard from London He said DPC was under pr essure from its lenders The DPC spokesperson here refused to comment on the issue The hardening of the boards stand is in sharp contrast to the advice of DPCs lenders who had warned Enron not to precipitate matters by issuing a termination notic e The lenders had arrived at a consensus that the termination notice need not be served at this stage Serving of the notice requires a nod from the lenders who have an exposure of about billion in the project Sources s aid given the lenders strong opposition to termination of the contract th e Enron boards enabling resolution did not have much significance beyond conveying a hardening of its stand with regard to the current imbroglio T he Maharashtra Chief Minister had warned Enron not to scuttle the process o f crisis resolution by issuing a termination notice The state government i s to nominate an expert group to renegotiate the terms of the Dabhol contra ct Enron holds per cent in DPC while USbased GE and Bechtel hold per c ent each The balance per cent is held by MSEB through a special purpose vehicle Maharashtra Power Development Corporation The MSEB representativ es were not allowed to vote at the meeting since they were an interested pa rty The IDBI representative protested against the boards decision The me eting was attended by state energy secretary VM Lal The meeting was held a gainst the backdrop of a dispute between MSEB and DPC over payment of bills After MSEB failed to pay Rs crore towards the December bill DPC i nvoked the state governments guarantee and then the Union governments cou nter guarantee When payment of the Rs crore January bill became overdu e DPC again invoked the state governments guarantee MSEB retaliated on J anuary by slapping a Rs crore penalty for nonsupply of electr icity at adequate levels It demanded that DPC adjust the bills against thi s penalty This stand of MSEB was explained to DPC at the board meeting a state government official said The Centre also supported MSEBs stand an d refused to honour the counter guarantee The power company then invoked t he political force majeure clause A process of conciliation and arbitratio n between the Centre and DPC is currently on THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS Friday April Foreign lenders slam brakes on disbursements to DPC Sanjay Jog Raghu Mo han Global banks comfortable with Enron pullout Lenders to the Dabhol Power Company DPC are a sharply divided lot Intern ational lenders in direct contrast to the stand taken by local ones led by the the Industrial Develoment Bank of India IDBI are categorical that a dditional assistance to DPCs phaseII will be held in abeyance despite the completion of per cent of the project workThe stage is also set for a preliminary termination notice to be served by DPC to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB within the next four weeksThis follows the autho risation given to Enron Indias managing director K Wade Cline and DPC pres ident CEO Neil McGregor to serve the termination notice and transfer not ices to MSEB following Wednesdays DPC board meeting in London The essence of the message from the international lenders following the Lon don meeting with DPC board is Emotions do not work Contractual obligation s and payments have to be met We are convinced that the MSEB has failed to meet its obligations There is no point in Enron continuing with the proje ct and the company should get out of itThe structuring of DPCs debt has c reated two classes of lenders In phaseI international lenders are covere d by a sovereign guarantee while in phaseII no lender is However all le nders have a parri passu charge making attachment of assets a messy affair Sources in international banks were quick to point out that local lenders t o phaseII of the project are worried that an awry DPC project will affect their interests more given that they have no security other than assets like a sovereign cover It was this desperation that made local lenders l ike IDBI slash the interest rates a few months back to per cent from per cent a leading foreign banker pointed outThree points that were made clear and stressed in no uncertain terms by international lenders were a there are contractual obligations b MSEB was not punctual in its paym ents to DPC and c MSEB adopted a confrontational position by slapping a Rs crore rebate charge on DPC for misdeclaration and default on the avail ability of power While local lenders led by IDBI with MSEB parroting the same were of th e view that the current situation is a temporary one international lenders were steadfast that pulling out of the project is the only way out This i s despite the stance taken by IDBI and MSEB that authorisation for terminat ion given to Mr Cline and Mr McGregor was not called for International ban kers pointed out that they will now have to look at the issue of charges an d protection for their loans in the event of the power project being scrapp ed in its present formThe points of contention are a that phaseI of DPC is backed by a sovereign guarantee b phaseII is not and c to the extent that phaseII is covered by assets cancellation of phaseII may see all a ssets even those under phaseI getting attached Therefore an examinat ion on the segregation of assets under phaseI and phaseII is now warrante d PTI adds In a significant move DPC board has empowered its management to sever power supply agreement with MSEB a move that could inflict a financi al liability of about Rs crore on the Centre A decision to authorise DPC president Neil McGregor to issue a termination notice to MSEB for sale of power was taken by the board at its meeting on Wednesday THE INDIAN EXPRESS Friday April Enron Dabhol chief gets powers to end deal with the MSEB THE BOARD of Dabhol Power Company a subsidiary of Houstonbased Enron Corp has decided to warn the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB that i t intends to pull the plug on its Guhagarbased projectIn a board meeting held in London on Wednesday the board decided to authorise DPC President a nd CEO Neil McGregor and Enron Indias managing director K Wade Cline to se rve a preliminary termination notice for sale of power to the MSEB with in the next four weeksThe Dabhol project has been mired in disputes since MSEB began missing payments last year MSEB owes Dabhol Power million f or power delivered in December and January The payment ran into a dispute after MSEB slapped penalty notices of Rs crore on DPC for its failure t o supply power within three hours of the demand being placedBut MSEB has p aid million for February And a payment of million was made for Mar ch on Thursday The billion Dabhol project is the largest foreign investment made in Ind ia to date Issuing the preliminary termination notice could enable Dabhol to suspend deliveries as it negotiates payment disputesWhile a preliminary termination notice is the first of three steps that could potentially lead to the abandonment of the project by Enron analysts have described the de cision as a procedural move consistent with DPCs negotiating strategy to recover overdue payments from the MSEB After the company issues the preliminary termination notice step two would be an official termination notice and step three would be a notice that t he company is surrendering control of the project If the project is termin ated the government of India will have to take a hit of million besid es paying bills of Rs crore for the next one year to Enron as penalty Our Centres liability if Dabhol power project is terminated would be one years electricity bill and a termination fee of million Pow er Secretary A K Basu saidContractually the Centre will have to pay one years electricity bill totalling at present prices about Rs crore and take over DPCs debt which stands at around million if th e project was terminated Basu said in Delhi Dabhol Power is in the proc ess of completing the second phase of the megawatt powerplant projec t which is per cent through While the international lenders to the project are pressurising the company to get out of the project Indian lenders led by IDBI are asking the com pany to reconsider its decision on its termination notice During the meeti ng in London MSEB which holds a per cent stake in the project had stro ngly opposed DPCs move to authorise Cline and McGregor to issue notices fo r termination MSEB Chairman Vinay Bansal and technical director Prem Paunikar both dire ctors on the DPC board and the state principal secretary energy VM Lal an invitee to the board raised the issue at the board meeting in London MSEB claimed that DPC was needlessly threatening to issue various arbit ration notices and thereby interpreting the clauses of PPA in isolationIn recent weeks Dabhol has raised the stakes in its spat with the MSEB deliv ering a notice of political force majeure to Maharashtra a step typically invoked to dissolve a contract in case of an emergency like a war coup o r a similar radical political event In this case DPCs move was viewed as a threat to stop providing electricityDPC has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power Critics object to the company chargi ng Rs a kilowatthour for its power compared with around Rs a kilo watthour charged by other suppliers THE HINDU Friday April Offer of renegotiation too late Enron By Mahesh Vijapurkar MUMBAI APRIL The Enronsponsored Dabhol Power Company which last nigh t authorised its local management to issue a notice of termination of its P ower Purchase Agreement PPA with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board has decided to keep a stiff upper lip This in turn has stoked speculati on that the switching off of power from its Phase I plant was imminent whi le in reality a lengthy procedure has to be followed as prescribed within the PPA As one source familiar with the PPA told The Hindu it is not sudden deat h of the project and in all probability the DPC vexed with the developm ents including sharp and pointed observations by the Godbole Committee ha s chosen to only arm itself with a serious option This would only eventu ally come into effect It is not an overnight operation and a lot of legal work is involved Apparently the DPC intends to do some armtwisting At the board of directors meeting in London which Maharashtra was initiall y disinclined to attend but later used the forum to put across its contenti ons on the project the DPC squarely told the MSEB nominees on the board th at the offer of renegotiation had come rather too late It also said it did not see any room for optimism about the outcome It did not however rule out the option of talks thus underscoring the possibility that the de cision to authorise termination was a new weapon The Maharashtra Chief Minister Mr Vilasrao Deshmukh had hoped that DPC w ould not take any harsh step which would cause lot of damage to the int erests of both the independent power producer and the Government and today he expressed his dismay In fact the mandate of the team that went on the strength of its stake in the DPC was to put across the idea that negotiat ion was the requirement and not confrontation Echo in LS The Enron issue also echoed in the Lok Sabha today where the Power Minister Mr Suresh Prabhu said that scrapping of the agreement would cost the Ce ntre Rs crores whose liability in the project agreement was limited The Centres liability in case of termination is one years electricity b ill and a termination fee of million Blow to FIs The termination could prove to be a serious blow to the Indian Financial In stitutions FIs which under the leadership of the IDBI were trying to co nvince the other lenders of the project against the notice The exposure of Indian FIs in the project is understood to be not covered by any guarantee either of the Centre or the State THE TIMES OF INDIA Friday April Enron ready to pull out but lenders say wait The Dabhol Power Company board which met on Wednesday in London authorise d the company management to issue a termination notice to the Maharashtra S tate Electricity Board The company however may not pull out of the proje ct yet considering its lenders who met on Monday opposed such a move and favoured renegotiations Sources present during both the meetings said tha t though foreign lenders supported Enron on the termination issue domestic financial institutions led by the Industrial Development Bank of India p revailed over the deliberations to oppose any such drastic move Enron need s the lenders consent to file a pretermination notice for pulling out fro m the project The decision to empower DPC chief Wade Cline to issue a term ination notice was taken with six votes in favour against a single IDBI vot e against such a move Another significant development during the entire proceedings was that the financial institutions made it clear that further funding of Phase II of th e project will depend on the Government of India assuring payment mechanism s Institutions are yet to disburse about per cent of the sanctioned pac kage which is crucial for completing the Phase II expansion project The board has given powers to Wade Cline to issue a pretermination notice Bu t the meeting quite unanimously felt the need of the hour is not to termina te the project but to initiate serious renegotiation proceedings said M SEB Chairman Vinay Bansal who attended the board meeting MSEB presented their views to the board members and it was understood by Enron which also included the Rs crore penalty issue which is heading for arbitration p roceedings We have also made it clear that the tariff structure of Enron is quite high and a downward revision of tariffs is unavoidable Bansal a dded They cannot issue a termination notice without our consent since our expo sure in the project is quite large and the lenders should approve any plans in that direction said a top banker who was present during the lenders meet There is a general consensus that the project must be completed an d the proposal to terminate the PPA should be kept in abeyance he added The global arrangers for the DPC include ANZ Investment Bank Credit Suiss e First Boston ABNAMRO Citibank and the State Bank of India where all t hese parties conducted separate meetings with the company officials Howeve r some bankers said the company can file a termination notice even if one lender with a minimum per cent exposure on the project favours such proce edings Meanwhile in a clear reversal of roles Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasra o Deshmukh said that the state government was not keen on terminating the P PA We will ask them to refrain from taking any such harsh steps since th at would be bad news for all of us including DPC Deshmukh said Deshmuk h was echoing Union Power Minister Suresh Prabhus sentiments who said tha t the government wanted an amicable settlement of the payment row He howe ver added that termination of the project would not hurt foreign investmen ts and dismissed warnings by analysts that winding up the billion pro ject would be a blow to Indias efforts to woo foreign investors The DPC has already slapped one conciliation notice on the Centre and three arbitration notices on the state government over nonpayment of dues amoun ting to Rs crore and interest towards the bills due for December a nd January Meanwhile MSEB officials said in Mumbai that the March bi lls amounting to Rs crore was paid on Thursday as protest payment desp ite the dispute over the amount When asked on the future course of action Bansal said it was up to the DPC THE HINDU BUSINESSLINE Friday April DPC board authorises MD to issue PPA termination notice THE board of directors of Dabhol Power Company DPC has authorised the Man aging Director Mr Neil McGregor to issue the notice of intent to terminat e its power purchase agreement PPA with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB at an appropriate time The decision was taken at a board meeting held in London yesterday While MSEB which is an interested pa rty was not allowed to vote it made a presentation clarifying its stand on the matter a senior State Government official said The resolution to authorise the management to issue the termination notice was carried by six votes to one IDBI voted against the decision the offic ial said The serving of the preliminary termination notice will lead to a sixmonth suspension period According to clause of the Terminatio n Procedure of the PPA Following the giving of a preliminary terminatio n notice the parties shall consult for a period of six months or such lon ger period as they may agree as to what step shall be taken with a view to mitigating the consequences of the relevant event having regard to all the circumstances IDBI and State Bank of India the principal Indian lenders had earlier per suaded the overseas lenders to hold their consent to the termination notice for some more time At least one lender has to consent for the company to serve termination notice It is understood that overseas lenders are in fav our of termination of the project and are prepared to consent However dom estic lenders are worried about the security of their advances if the PPA i s abandoned midway According to institutional sources Indian lenders are trying to get all th e parties concerned to thrash out outstanding issues The Maharashtra and C entral Governments too are in favour of a conciliation Mr Vilasrao Deshmuk h Chief Minister of Maharashtra yesterday went on record that the State d id not want the project terminated Mr Yashwant Sinha Union Finance Minist er is also understood to be of the same opinion The DPC will now have t o decide what is the appropriate time to serve the notice the official said MSEB pays Rs crore Meanwhile MSEB has paid DPC Rs crore to wards its March bill MSEB officials confirmed that the bill was paid in protest today morning They DPC had billed us for an amount of Rs crore We do not agree with some of the items included a senior MSE B official said THE PIONEER Friday April Enron testing Maharashtras nerves T N Raghunatha Dabhol Power Company DPC has begun to put fresh pressure on the Maharasht ra State Electricity Board MSEB the Maharashtra State Government and the Centre for an early resolution to the prolonged dispute between them if t he DPC Board of Directors decision to authorise its managing director to s erve a contract termination notice to the MSEB is any indication The DPC Board in its meeting in London on Wednesday empowered the company management to sever its power supply agreement with MSEB a move that coul d inflict a financial liability of Rs crore on the Centre The decisi on to authorise the DPC management to issue a termination notice to MSEB wa s taken by a vote of six to one after the Maharasthra Government representa tives were prevented from voting on the ground of interested party When contacted the companys Mumbaibased spokesperson Mr Jimmy Mogal de clined to comment on the reports about the decision taken by the DPC Board We have nothing to say on the reports emanating from London We will expr ess our views after a few days he said However Maharashtra Chief Minist er Vilasrao Deshmukh on Thursday termed the DPC boards decision as unfort unate We have already requested the company not to take any harsh decisi on Mr Deshmukh said in Mumbai Official sources in the State Energy Ministry interpreted the DPC Boards d ecision as a pressure tactic employed by the Enron subsidiary to force the MSEB to clear the pending power bills without any further delay Through it s tough posture the DPC wants to make its position stronger before it can formally agree for renegotiations with the MSEB the Centre and the State Government for cutting the price of power supplied by it to the State elect ricity board The sources said that the DPCs reported decision to authoris e its managing director to stop electricity supply to the MSEB did not mean that the Enron subsidiary would actually go ahead with the scrapping of th e power contract with the MSEB If anything the DPCs reported decision is to mount additional pressure o n the MSEB for clearance of pending power bills and put itself in a stronge r position in settling its dispute with the MSEB As part of its plan to ar m itself with powers to break a contract in case situation goes beyond its control the DPC had recently served a political force majeure to the MSEB the Centre and the State Government the sources saidNot surprisingly t he DPCs London decision comes on the heels of the Maharashtra Governments decision to set up a highlevel committee comprising representatives of t he MSEB the Centre and the State Government to renegotiate with the Enron s subsidiary company for reducing the cost of power supplied to the State electricity boardMeanwhile amidst the threat of a possible termination no tice hanging on its head the MSEB on Thursday made a protest payment of the Rs crore disputed amount towards March bill of Rs crore to D PC riday April THE TELEGRAPH Friday April ENRON SIGNAL TO SWITCH OFF DABHOL POWER Enron today took the first decisive step out of the controversyridden Dabh ol Power Company when it won an authorisation from the companys board to s top sale of power to Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB The meeting of the company of which the Houstonbased energy giant holds per cent and the MSEB per cent was attended by state energy secretary V M Lal and MSEB technical director P Paunikar and it came days after its lenders discussed payment problems and a possible terminationThe Centres liability if Enron decides to snap the agreement will be a years power b ill and a termination fee of million However the company will have to wait for six months from the day it serves the notice before it pulls th e plugThe Centre shrugged off the move saying there would not be any adve rse effect on foreign investment in power if Enron walks out We do not se e FDI inflows into the power sector being hit power minister Suresh Prabh u saidMSEB officials said the ball is now in the court of DPC which said its corporate policy did not allow it to comment on proceedings at board me etings The decision coincided with a Rs crore protest payment by the cashstrapped power board as part of the March bill worth Rs crore There was speculation that MSEB coughed up the amount to cool frayed temper s at Enrons hub in Houston and because it was rattled by the sudden turn of events in the past few days during which the dispute had come to a head MSEB officials brushed away the allusions saying the cheque was ready on Wednesday but could not be handed over to DPC because of the statewide ban dh We have a disputed payment of Rs crore which will be taken up a t the disputeresolution forum a board official said Last week DPC told the state government and MSEB it would no longer accept protest payments i n a move to fortify its legal position MSEB officials say Bechtel and General Electric the other partners who hol d around per cent in DPC are willing to go along with Enron Corp in ter minating the deal but financial institutions such as IDBI are not game beca use it puts their loans at risk Investments made by Indian institutions ar e not covered under the Centres and states counterguarantees unlike tho se made by international lendersMaharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmu kh called Enrons decision unfortunate We had told state government offic ials attending the Enron board meeting to stop the company from winding up its operations in the state as it will harm both parties THE STATESMAN Friday April Enron threatens to pull out The Enron crisis deepened with the Board of Directors of the Dabhol Power Company deciding to authorise the managing director Mr K Wade Cline to se rve a notice of termination on the contract for the first phase of the billion power projectThe decision which could lead to the cessation of D abhols power supply to the state was taken at the meeting held yesterday in London according to reports quoting the chairman of the Maharashtra Stat e Electricity Board Mr Vinay Bansal While DPC officials refuse to comment on anything it is learnt that MSEB w as itself prepared to serve a legal notice of termination just two days bef ore the meetingMSEB was said to have been dissuaded by the Nationalist Con gress Party president Mr Sharad Pawar and union power minister Mr Suresh Prabhu who had talks in New Delhi with the Maharashtra chief minister Mr Vilasrao Deshmukh and an MSEB delegation last Monday The state government has been served two arbitration notices while the Cent re is ready to go for conciliation with the DPC for failing to honour its c ounterguaranteeFurther the DPC has already slapped a notice of political force majeure which protects itself against undeserved claims in the event of exigencies that force it to take an extreme stepThe union power minist er Mr Suresh Prabhu contended in Delhi that since DPC contributed only per cent of the total energy output of the country its termination would not have such a phenomenal impact on the power situation However if terminations proceedings go through Enron Corp a per cent shareholder in the Dabhol Power Company would stand to net a hefty amount in damages The union power secretary has been quoted as saying that termi nation of the DPC would cost the Centre Rs crore which is the total of one years electricity bill and a termination fee of million Accor ding to an energy analyst Mr Pradyumna Kaul the total liability would not cross Rs crore However Mr Prabhu said in the Lok Sabha today that the that scrapping of the agreement would cost the Centre Rs croreIt is learnt that on April Mr Deshmukh had given the goahead to the MSEB to prepare a legal notice to be issued to Enron during the meeting of the DPC s Board of Directors on Wednesday At the meeting the energy minister Pa damsinh Patil energy secretary Mr Vinay Mohan Lal and MSEB chairman Mr Vi nay Bansal were also presentThe notice was prepared over the past weekend and taken by the delegation when they called on Mr Prabhu on April How ever the politicians convinced them that Enron would not get tough given its huge stake in the project and that such a notice would not be necessar y The meeting thus ended with the decision to renegotiate the power tariff with Enrons consent Among those present at the London meeting were Mr Lal Mr Bansal and MSEB t echnical director Mr P Paunikar in their capacity as directors However they abstained from voting since they were deemed an interested party The only vote to go against the decision was that of the IDBI which is also rep resented on the board it is learntThe chief minister Mr Vilasrao Deshmuk h said the state was not in favour of terminating the project This could mean that the latest manoeuvre to armtwist the Indian authorities could ac hieve its immediate target of getting the arrears accumulated over the past three months clearedThe MSEB owes Enron Rs crore for March an d Rs crore for December and January The Centre today put up a brave face on Enrons decision saying there would not be any adverse effec t on foreign investment in power sector in the country PTI reported from N ew Delhi There will be no adverse impact as a result of any action by any domestic or foreign company As far as we are concerned there will be no adverse imp act on FDI in power sector Power Minister Suresh Prabhu told reporters wh en asked about DPCs decision to authorise management to issue a terminatio n notice to MSEBEmphasising that there would be no fallout of such decisio n Prabhu said after the meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affai rs we are expecting cooperation from many Scandinavian countries as well a s European nations in the power sectorIn fact not only the Power Minister but also the Prime Minister of Norway was here to inaugurate a seminar on power and he promised lot of cooperation in the sector MID DAY DPC may not wind up Maharashtra Chief Secretary V Ranganathan has said that though Neil McGrego r managing director of the Dabhol Power Corporation DPC has been given complete powers with regard to DPCs operations in the state including the authority to wind up operations it does not necessarily mean that McGrego r will issue such a termination notice McGregor was given the powers at a meeting of the DPC board in London on Wednesday Ranganathan said that stat e officials including Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB Chairman Vinay Bansal and Power Secretary V M Lal have reported back to him about t he meeting in London With regard to the states failure to pay Enron Ranganathan said Bills are prepared as per the Power Purchase Agreement PPA and DPC owes some mo ney to us Our people informed Enron officials about this In fact there was no reason to give powers to the MD to slap a termination noticeIn the London meeting MSEB and Industrial Development Bank of India IDBI repre sentatives insisted that the DPC must pay Rs crore since it could not s upply power whenever needed Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh has already termed as unfortunate the deci sion of the board of the Enronpromoted DPC to give McGregor powers to wind up operations Deshmukh added We have already requested Enron not to ta ke any harsh decisionDeshmukh had earlier said We have directed state Government officials attending the DPC board meeting to desist the energy c ompany from winding up operations in the state as it would be harmful to b oth of us Enron officials are keeping mum on the issue McGregor said I am not goi ng to give any comment MID DAY April Enron offers no comment on renegotiation H S Rao A crucial meeting of the Board of Directors of the Dabhol Power Company DP C promoted by the US energy major Enron was held here yesterday apparent ly to discuss fate of its million power project in Maharashtra but th ere was no official word on the Indian and state Governments decision to r enegotiate the contract An Enron spokesman declined to divulge what transpired at the meeting sayi ng the issues discussed at the meeting were confidential We have not received any direct communication Unless we get it and evaluate the detail s we have no comments to make the spokesman said when asked about the pr oposed decision on renegotiation of the project in which the Maharashtra S tate Electricity Board MSEB has per cent stake Asked whether the Board had taken a decision on empowering DPC Managing Dir ector Neil McGregor to wind up its operations in India the spokesman said he had nothing to say on them Enron has reportedly authorised Mcgregor to look at various options including selling the companys stake in DPC Mahar ashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh said in Mumbai that the state Gover nment would pay up the undisputed dues to the company He said the Maharash tra government is not in favour of terminating the MW project but w anted an amicable solution to the imbroglio MID DAY Friday April Committee to renegotiate Enron deal A committee to renegotiate the Power Purchase Agreement with the Dabhol Pow er Company will be appointed by this evening Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshm ukh said today Addressing media persons after his meeting with the noted s ocial reformer Anna Hazare at his official residence Varsha Deshmukh said the committee would be formed by this evening or by tomorrow at the mostH e termed as unfortunate the Enron board decision empowering DPC chief Neil McGregor to serve a preliminary termination notice on the Maharashtra State Electricity Board and said the state was willing to negotiate the issue wi th power company Renegotiations will be held as per the suggestions made by the Godbole co mmittee and the center will also depute its representative on the renegotia ting committee We dont want to take any hasty decision Deshmukh saidHe pointed that the only bone of contention with the DPC had been its expensiv e tariff and hoped that the issue would be resolved amicablyWhen pointed t hat the Enron board had taken a decision to serve the notice despite state s willingness to appoint a renegotiating committee Chief Minister said it was unfortunate Earlier in his meeting with Hazare Deshmukh promised to make necessary am endments to the Right to Information law recently passed by the state so th at the information was easily accessed by the common people He also gave a patient hearing to Hazare on his complaints of corruption in various state departments and promised action against guilty after a thorough inquiry wi thin three months AFTERNOON APRIL ENRONS ON State govt to renegotiate Dabhol Power Project By Hubert Vaz The US power giant Enron Power Corporations willingness to wrap up the Da bhol Power Project and leave the shores may not actually materialise thoug h the Dabhol Power Company chief Mr Wade Cline has been authorised to do so since the lenders for the project would have a decisive say in the mat ter Disclosing this Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh confirmed this morning th at the state government would churn out a compromise formula by which the p ower project at Dabhol could be continued and at the same time Enron did n ot feel slighted Enron has not yet conveyed to us about this decision We are waiting for their letter he said When asked what sort of compromise the state government plans to forge Mr Deshmukh said Let our officers come back After that we will decide a future course of action But we are definitely going in for renegotiation of the project It is very difficult to predict the outcome of Enrons decision but as of now the project is sti ll on When asked whether the project could be moved to another state if wound up from Maharashtra Mr Deshmukh said that was not possible as per the terms of the agreement between the US company and the state government However it was difficult for the project to move out of the state itself he indicated He also confirmed that both parties would face considerable losses if the project was terminated The board of directors of the Dabhol Power Company which met in London on Wednesday decided to put an end to all controversies surrounding the proje ct once and for all by empowering the DPC chief to terminate the project i f he deemed it fit However this decision as of now does not necessarily indicate the death knell for the project The Enron project which had bee n riddled with controversies right from its inception had been a pretext f or the political parties in the state to drag each other on the mat from ti me to time The previous SenaBJP government which had been out to termina te the project however chose to continue with it following renegotiations with Enrons top visiting officials like Ms Rebecca Mark And the Democr atic Front government inherited the controversial project when the governme nts changed hands a year and a half ago Meanwhile State Energy Minister Dr Padamsinh Patil when contacted at the Osmanabad Circuit House said the state government and the central governm ent have decided to appoint a joint committee to renegotiate the project wi th Enron It is not easy for them to walk out of the project just like tha t They will have to go in for litigation and this would prove costly for b oth sides he said In case the project is terminated the government can still manage the power needs of the state though it would be a bit tough j ob he added

out of the Dabhol project Sucheta Dalal It is finally Quit India time for Enron Though the controversial multinati onal has denied plans to sell its stake in Dabhol Power Company DPC info rmed sources say that it has sent feelers to China Light Power and others to offload its majority holdingGetting out of India may be the best cours e for Enron Though it has threatened a fight and invoked political force m ajeure the Energy Review Committee headed by Madhav Godbole will certainly weaken its case The committee points out that the many infirmities in t he DPC approval process brings into question the propriety of the decision s It is clear that the m that Enron spent on educating Indias policymak ers and bureaucrats did not even teach them the basics of technoeconomic a ppraisal or due procedure with regard to large international contracts The committee says it is troubled with the failure of governance that seems t o have characterised almost every step of the decision making process on ma tters relating to DPC The failure of governance has been broad across dif ferent governments at different points of time at both the state and the c entral level and across different agencies associated with examining the p roject and at both the administrative and political levels It strains beli ef to accept that such widespread and consistent failure to execute assigne d responsibilities is purely coincidental Though the committee decided that it is not the proper forum to investigate these infirmities its two key members Mr Godbole and former secretary i n the Ministry of Finance EAS Sarma have asked for a judicial inquiry int o the process of clearing the DPC project Other members felt a judicial in quiry would delay the negotiation process and not serve any purpose Ther e may be some merit in an argument against a further delay in renegotiating tariffs or facilitating Enrons exit but the report certainly provides th e Central Vigilance Commission CVC with all the grounds that it needs to start an investigation CVC N Vittal has already received innumerable requests to investigate the d eal especially the beneficiaries of its education campaign Though the pol itical establishment may be reluctant to set up a judicial inquiry the CVC can establish whether there are lapses on the part of government function aries including political executives and ensure appropriate action again st them If it is indeed able to establish undue influence in signing the contract then Maharashtra may be able to get out of a deal patently again st the public interest without any monetary liability The Godbole committee has vindicated the stand of antiEnron activists who have been opposed it since negotiations began in It establishes that Enron power is expensive per se and the project needs to be renegotiated regardless of the causes for the Maharashtra State Electricity Boards MS EB financial distress Also that DPCs extortionate tariffs are not merely because of the steep rise in petroproduct prices and rupee depreciation but mainly on account of its sweetheart deal with the state government Enr ons contract is clearly onesided it deliberately uses expensive raw mate rial ignoring World Bank warnings has worked on fanciful demandsupply e stimates and several legal requirements and permissions In fact the committee has found that the MSEB has been paying Enron Rs crore more than it should every year This comprises overcharging of Rs crore on account of the large regassification plant of which only per cent of the capacity is used for DPC Theres also a Rs crore extra bil ling to the MSEB for shipping and harbour charges although the cost of thes e facilities had been included in the capital recovery charge By charging more than twice the operations maintenance rate stipulated by the governm ent of India Enron collects approximately Rs crore extra every year I t has also been collecting Rs crore every year through inflated fuel co nsumption claims Enron has been charging at kcalkwh under the power purchase agreement PPA although the equipment manufacturer has guaranteed it a much lower consumption rate This gives it a fat fuel arbitrage oppor tunity at the cost of the people of Maharashtra The committee has also pointed to the strange practice of using four differ ent exchange rates for different aspects of the project negotiation a rate of Rs per dollar was assumed for calculating debt service of rupee loan s Rs per dollar as reference rate for PhaseI Rs per dollar as reference rate for PhaseII and a curious Rs per dollar for calculating Government of India tariff Forcing a reduction of these excessive charges has nothing to do with contract cancellation All it needs is tough negoti ation and public pressure on the political establishment The Godbole committee has established that DPCs tariffs can easily be halv ed if excess payments are eliminated and unfair conditions such as the doll arisation of payments the takeorpay clause and escrow facility which is in fact hampering MSEBs reform particularly in power distribution are sc rappedThe security of future payments to DPC under the restructured tariff would be based on increased cash flows from a reformed distribution system The committee also gives Enron a difficult escape route It says that if the multinational finds the conditions for restructuring too onerous it sh ould free MSEB from its contractual obligations and find buyers outside Mah arashtra The committee has tried to establish another precedent on all pro jects negotiated by government The public has a right to know what is bei ng contracted on their behalf and has recommended that all documents incl uding contracts related to all Independent Power Projects IPPs particula rly DPC should be published by the Maharashtra government within two month s Also having established that demandsupply estimates by the state governme nt were fanciful the committee has asked MSEB to defer all negotiations wi th power producers until demand levels in the state permit full absorption of power generation from such IPPs It recommends that such negotiations sh ould be in accordance with the leastcost plan spelt out by the report Thi s should also end the hectic lobbying by Reliance Patalganga Mittals Bh adravati the BSES Saphale and others to set up IPPs in Maharashtra THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS April DPC board set to authorise president Enron MD to issue notice of terminati on Sanjay Jog Scrapping of Power Purchase Agreement The board of directors of Dabhol Power Company DPC which has already tak en an aggressive posture has proposed to authorise the Enron India managin g director K Wade Cline and DPC president and chief executive officer Neil McGregor to issue notices for the termination of power purchase agreement PPA and transfer of Dabhol project in view of continuing default by the st ate and Central governments and Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB The board of directors which would meet on April in London also plans to appoint Mr Cline as its true and lawful Attorneyinfact and authorise him to represent the company in the negotiation of all project contracts a nd financing agreements and their amendments and modificationsTop sources told The Financial Express that DPC would authorise Mr Cline andor Mr McGr egor to serve the preliminary termination notices and transfer notices to t he state and Central governments and MSEB under clause and schedule o f the PPA In response to the continuing default by the MSEB of its payment obligatio ns under the PPA the failure of the Government of Maharashtra to honour ob ligations under its guarantee and state support agreement and failure of th e Government of India to honour obligations under its counter guarantee th e company has sought recourse to dispute resolution and has initiated conci liation and arbitration proceedings the company resolution said Consist ent with this recourse to contractual remedies the company now seeks the a uthority to serve preliminary termination notices and transfer notices purs uant to clause and schedule of the PPA from time to time and at any t ime upon the occurrence of an event giving rise to its right to serve such notices as determined by the company the resolution added According to the resolution the directors the company secretary and offic ers of the company and each of them acting individually are authorised and empowered to execute and deliver such documents and instruments and take s uch other actions as they deem fit to effect the purpose of the resolution in the name and for and on behalf of the company Against this backdrop t he state government and MSEB have been exploring the possibilities of issui ng termination notice to the DPC for its failure to meet the contractual ob ligations under the PPA The state government and MSEB sources said that su ch a notice could be served by the MSEB as DPC has not paid the rebate pen alty of Rs crore for misdeclaration and default on the availability of power on January and February The state government and MSEB which reviewed its position on Saturday at a meeting convened by the Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh are of the view that they have a strong case and substantial grounds to slap the terminatio n notice to the DPC The DPCs move to appoint Mr K Wade Cline as its true and lawful Attorneyinfact deserves importance especially when the state government proposes to set up a negotiating committee to cut the per unit cost and gauge the possibility of sale of Dabhol power to the power deficit states Mr Cline would also be authorised to dispose of equipment that is worn out or obsolete or other equipment or fuel no longer expected to be used in the ordinary course in amounts exceeding Rs crore or the equivalent in fore ign currency in any financial year Furthermore Mr Cline would be in a pos ition to enter into contracts and take any other actions for purpose relati ng to the daytoday operation of the companys business or exercise its ri ghts and discharge its obligations under the project contracts and the fina ncing agreements BUSINESS STAND ARD Monday April DPC seeks OK to exit power project Tamal Bandyopadhyay S Ravindran The Enronpromoted Dabhol Power Company DPC is seeking the approval of it s lenders to pull

April in London to discuss the issue of serving a termination notice to the Maharshtra State Electricity Board MSEB DPC cannot go ahead with this unless it gets the go ahead from the lenders While bankers said the lenders meeting is about the second phase of the p roject which is still under construction state government officials clari fied that since there is only one PPA covering both phases of the project the lenders decision will be applicable to the existing Phase I also The second phase of the project involves MW generation capacity whereas Phase I of MW is already operationalAccording to the loan agreement even if only four per cent of the lenders agree to terminate the contract t hen DPC can do so highly placed sources in the lenders consortium said f rom London This in effect means that only one lender has to agree for DPC to serve a p reliminary termination noticeFollowing the notice there is a cooling off period of six months for both parties the MSEB and DPC to find a mutually acceptable solution which may take the form of a renegotiated PPA sourc es added Sources also said that there are two separate meetings scheduled with lenders The

Committee has prima facie found infirmities in several decisions taken in respect of the Enron project at different points of time by successive governments and agencies in the Centre and state Energy Review Committee headed by former home secretary Madhav Godbole This could well be the real Enron story A fivemember highpowered committee headed by Madhav Godboleand including former Union economic affairs secretary EAS Sarma hdfc chairman Deepak Parekh teri chairman RajendraPachauri and Maharashtra government official Vinay Mohan Lalhas recommended a judicial probe into the entire Enron pow er project deal saying it signified the utter failure of governance that s eems to have characterised almost every step of the decisionmaking process relating to the Dabhol project The report which was submitted to the Ma harashtra government last fortnight and has been acquired by Outlook is se verely critical of former chief minister Sharad Pawar with the Congress th en the day bjpled Union government which reworked the deal in S hiv Sena supremo Balasaheb Thackeray and his government in Maharashtra head ed by Manohar Joshi The utter failure of governance seems to have characterised almost every s tep of decisionmaking relating to the Dabhol project Madhav Godbole Comm ittee Report An investigation if ordered could embarrass at least these three governme nts The report clearly upholds the allegations of money being paid by Enron to politicians and bureaucrats for clinching the deal According to the co mmittee the deal reveals failure of governance both at the Centre and sta te and across different agencies It strains belief to accept that such w idespread and consistent failure to execute responsibilities is purely coin cidental the report said proposing a set of measures to be implemented i f something of the project was to be retrieved Godbole and Sarma also felt that the panel should categorically recommend the government of India to o rder a judicial inquiry This was finally adopted by it Says a Congress le ader Enron could well become the biggest political issue in Maharashtra a nd put to question liberalisation particularly in the power sector The proposal has already struck panic Says ncps Praful Patel If the Enr on decision has at all been detrimental it is because of the haste with wh ich phase was cleared by the Shiv Senabjp government Now with the state having already entered into an agreement with Enron the important thing i s to resolve it amicably A judicial inquiry will be an eyewash because it s not an issue of corruption but that of perception Promarket Congressmen privately admit that it was their governments at the Centre and the state which invited Enron even though the second phase was cleared by the bjpShiv Sena combine Says Congress spokesperson Jaipal Re ddy Right now were too involved with the Parliament deadlock over Tehel ka Proliberalisation Congress MPs also fear that such witchhunting coul d send wrong signals to foreign investors NonCongress MPs from Maharashtr a meanwhile claim that the Godbole Committee was instituted with the expr ess purpose of politicising the Enron issue I think I know Vilasrao Deshm ukhs gameplan says an MP from the state But some MPs like Congress Pri thviraj Chavan question the cloak of secrecy thats surrounded the deal I ve maintained for long that there should be a judicial committee to examin e this The committee report also says that had the Enron project been subjected to a technoeconomic appraisal as envisaged under provisions of the Electric ity supply Act of and related legislations the infirmities could have been avoidedSince this wasnt done questions about a concerted effort to wards exercising undue influence at every stage of the project are bound to arise the exhaustive page report points out Id highlight the speed with which the day Vajpayee government cleared the project minutes before it quit says Congress MP Prithviraj Chavan The Enron project had been held out as an exemplar of the impending liberal isation in the early s and despite several controversies is now an est ablished power project at Dabhol km south of Mumbai In July Enr on signed an MoU with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board mseb to set up a MW station as part of the governments fast track projects Subsequently when the ShivSenabjp came to power in Maharashtra it filed a writ against the project This curiously led to renegotiations with Enron The committee has quoted a Bombay High Court order on the renegotiated de al Once it GoM decided to revive the project it acted in the very sam e manner its predecessors in office had done It forgot all about competiti ve bidding and transparency The speed with which the negotiating group stu died the project and made its proposal for renegotiatons which was accepte d by Dabhol is unprecedented Says Chavan I would particularly like to highlight the speed with which the day Vajpayee government at Centre end orsed the renegotiated project minutes before it resigned Since the commissioning of the plant in May the mseb has paid Rs crore for the power it has bought from Dabhol If the same watttage of po wer had been bought from Indianbuilt power plants fired by indigenous coal the payment would have been approximately Rs crore In the first year andahalf of its operation itself the dpc had drained the Maharashtra ex chequer of nearly Rs crore The Central Electricity Authority cea in fact pointed out that the Dabh ol plant was not the least costly option The mseb had other inexpensive al ternatives like the four units of Kaparkheda but they were in a preliminar y stage The report notes if the mseb had made efforts to seriously pu rsue these projects they might not have remained in their preliminary stag es It adds that the members were of the opinion that the mseb and the Ma harashtra government erred seriously based on information available at tha t time in proceeding with the dpc as a baseload factor even when its capa city was reduced The failure seems to have been compounded by the laxity of the Union power ministry finance ministry and the cea It quotes the ce a as saying that since the Union finance ministry found the tariff reasonab le no further examination was required Strangely Bal Thackerays Shiv Sena when it came to power together with t he BJP in Maharashtra filed a writ in the court and then renegotiated the deal After the new Shiv Senabjp government took over its CM Manohar Joshi ap pointed a renegotiating committee in which made the right noises actu ally managing to reduce the tariff But certain things remained inexplicabl e No fresh clearances were required from the cea which also said that si nce no cost increase was involvedfresh formal clearance wasnt necessary Says the committee This only adds strength to the suspicion that the c ea didnt consider the economic aspects of the project at all Indeed give n the nonavailability of any official record of the meeting on June with the Committee and the nature of this letter dated December the Committee is doubtful whether the economic aspects of dpc were discu ssed at all The credibility of the Shiv Senabjp government has been seriously question ed The Committee finds it unexplicable sic why there was no mention of any reduction in capital cost of the project from million to million as agreed by dpc in the summary report of the renegotiating committ ee the panel observesSays lawyer Prashant Bhushan It is strange that t he Shiv Senabjp government first filed a writ in the court and then coolly renegotiated the deal The committee further spells out the losses incurr ed through the deal Subsequent to the commissioning of the dpc the finan cial deterioration of mseb has been rapid While the mseb was in profit in it plunged into huge losses of Rs crore in Significantly the World Bank in had predicted the systems inherent w eaknesses In a letter written to the then power secretary R Vasudevan a top bank official had said that after a detailed review of the analytical framework and costing assumptions we reconfirm our earlier conclusion tha t the Dabhol project as presently formulated is not economically justifie d and that in our assessment the project is too large to enter the mseb s ystem in The proposed baseload operation could result in uneconomic plant dispatch as already existing lower variable cost coal power would be replaced by the higher cost lng power Enrons persistence and the gullibility of the Indian side can be gauged from highranking Enron official Joe Suttons letter to a key Indian offici al Ajit Nimbalkar I recently met with the World Bank and have been follo wing the articles in the India papers I feel that the World Bank opinion c an be changed Well engage a PR firm and hopefully manage the media from h ere on The project has solid support from all other agencies in Washington The key question in the Enron deal is whether a developed state like Mahara shtra needs outside intervention in the power sector at all For the first time the Godbole committee has raised objections about the viability of suc h a project According to the report the mseb has been one of the better p erforming boards in the country and has despite a faulty transmission and distribution T and D system managed to consistently earn net revenue sur pluses on an accrual basis Maharashtra accounts for nearly onefourth of the gross value of Indias in dustrial sector Its one of the few states to achieve per cent electri fication Since the mseb has been adding to its generation This impr ovement which has been largely due to renovation and modernisation underta ken by the mseb exceeded its own expectations at a time when the dpc was b eing considered the report points out Following a policy of crosssubsid y roughly nine out of its ten users are subsidised But the gap between the average cost of supply and average realisation hasn t been much In fact the subsidy claim decreased from Rs crore in to Rs crore in until in it increased nearly fiv efold to Rs crore due to the sudden increase in the gap by paise per unitfrom to paisean increase of per cent The increase in the subsidy claim by Rs crore is due to the increase in the gap princ ipally because of the increase in power purchase costs says the committee adding Without the dpc and without problems of T and D loss the mseb c ould be financially healthy But can that happen now since Enron is here to stay The committee has come up with some farreaching recommendations make public all Dabholrelated documents and agreements restructure the Dabhol project itself to bring do wn the cost of power restructure dpc financially allow sale of dpc power outside Maharashtra reexamine ppas in accordance with leastcost plans a nd thoroughly reform the msebThe committee know this can become reality on ly with political consensus and through forming of public opinion The ques tion is can that be achieved in an unstable political environment With Priya Sahgal Making Of A Scam Centre invites Enron to set up fast track power project Dec First PPA

revenue collections up at Rs crore in March Renni Abraham The Maharashtra State Electricity Boards MSEB revenue collections in Mar ch stood at a record Rs crore This was largely due to the disconn

discussio n among arbitrators on the negotiating table the MSEB has turned to puttin g its house in order As if to ward of any criticism of its fiscal condition that could be termed as the facilitator to the entire DPC tariff crisis the state electricity board has put matters relating to its performance on record For instance MSEB has recorded the highest power generation in the year ended March at units compared with the previous years units making it the top SEB of the country in this respect Similarly its power station s recorded the highest availability percentage at up from per cen t last fiscal Plant load factor is up to per cent compared with per cent in The Parli power station has recorded the highest ever generation in the ten years of its life time in at million units which made it eligib le for the meritorious productivity award under the eligibility guidelines issued by the Government of India carrying a cash award of Rs lakh Al l other power stations in the state without exception also fulfill the el igibility criteria for the cash award a senior MSEB official said Similar ly the Chandrapur power station became the first power station of any stat e electricity board to get the ISO certification A senior MSEB official said Earlier MSEB was suffering from too much inte rference in its day to day functioning The agriculturists were touted as t he major reason for its deteriorating accruals while theft of electricity during the transmission and distribution stage was conveniently camouflaged under this head In the recent past the government has authorised MSEB to take steps to curb this misuse of power by its own officials many of whom including a chief engineer have suffered suspensions

board had almost decided to call it quits and proceed with the termination of the billion power projec t at Dabhol the veto exercised by the company chairman Kenneth Lay has save d the project at least for the timebeing Sources said the meeting held on Tuesday at the energy majors headquarters in Houston could have sounded th e death knell for the only big foreign investment in the Indian power sector Although the future of the project is still pretty uncertain with the lende rs unwilling to continue disbursements unless payment obligations are not honoured and contractual obligations left unfulfilled the veto exercised a t this juncture by the chairman of the parent company has come as a big boost to the Indian venture Company sources said We do not know what went on there but it is true that as of now we are not pulling out With the engineering procurement and construction contractors GE and equipment suppliers Bechtel too in a cautious mode mode DPC was finding it even mor e difficult to continue the construction of the project as per the schedules Sources said the stand taken by the rest of the directors on the board woul d be in view of the backlash that the company would have to face from its shareholders if the project actually floppedEnron had similar bitter experiences in Pakistan and it was difficult for the parent company to then justify such investments to the shareholders Enron which had planned a major investments in Indias infrastructure sectors such as oil and gas LNG gas transportation telecom and broadband network has already pulled out most of their personnel from some of these operations The companys MoUs with various other majors like Indian Oil Corporation too is in a limbo and the US majors stake in the oil and gas venture is up for grabs However even though Lay is still hoping to find a solution to the controversy back home both DPC and MSEB are still to get down to negotiations THE ECONOMIC TIMES MAY Maha sore over delay in naming Godbole nominee THE MAHARASHTRA government has expressed unhappiness over the Centres delay in appointing its nominee on the ninemember Godbole Committee to renegotiate the power purchase agreement signed between Enronpromoted Dabhol Power Company and state electricity board The committee which i s to hold discussions with Enron officials from Houston on May has only a months time for

officia l There are media reports that the solicitorgeneral Harish Salve would be appointed but we are yet to hear anything from their side he said The official said the state expected Centre to

THE TIMES OF INDIA May Maharashtra unhappy with delay in naming Godbole nominee The Maharashtra government has expressed unhappiness over the Centres delay in appointing its nominee on the ninemember Godbole committee to renegotiate the power purchase agreement PPA signed between Enron promote d Dabhol Power Company DPC and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB The committee which is to hold discussions with Enron officials from Houston on May has only a months time for renegotiations and wit h DPCs termination notice threat hanging on our head time is actually runni ng out Yet there

to hear anything from their side he said The official said that the state expected the Centre to announce their representative before May as it would appreciate his crucial presence i n the first session of discussions with Enron officials lenders and gas suppliers Sources in the Mantralaya added that the government had also bee n unhappy over the Centres rigid stand on not allowing stateowned National Thermal Power Corporation NTPC to buy the excess capacity of DPCs total mw project Let NTPC and Power Trading Corporation of India PTC co me together and sell DPCs surlpus power We have already mooted this suggestion but a favourable reply is yet to come from the Union power ministry the official said The official said that the Centre which was also responsible for DPC project as it has provided counter guarantee to Enron India should form a special purpose vehicle for sale of the excess power to other states The state governments reaction comes in wake of Uni on power minister Suresh Prabhus discussion with Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh in Delhi few days ago It was learnt that Prabhu told Deshmukh there is no question of NTPC buying power from the project since long term PPAs have been signed by NTPC with the buying states Deshmukh had suggested that the Central power utility should sell excess power over and above the mw needed for the state from the DPCs mw phaseI and soon to be commissioned phaseII of mw to other nee dy states Considering the high cost of power generated from DPC which duri ng the recent months has hovered around Rs per unit as against an average co st of Rs a unit from Central and state utilities there would be fe w takers for the power from Dabhol the power minister reportedly said Deficit states will buy DPC power only when the cost of power is brought down he said adding power ministry would facilitate wheelng of this pow er to the buyers BUSINESS STANDARD Monday May Reliance allowed to hawk power from Patalganga to third parties Arijit De S Ravindran Renni Abraham in Mumbai In an unusual departure from normal practice the Maharashtra government h as allowed the Reliance group to sell power generated by its mw Patalgan ga power project directly to third parties if the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB does not lift power The projects power purch ase agreement PPA has a clause to this effect The state governments permission to Reliance to hawk power to third parties has to be seen in th e context of its dithering on forwarding to the Centre the Dabhol Power Companys bid for mega power status so that it could sell power to thir d parties DPC sources told Business Standard several weeks ago that the companys application had been pending with the Chief Ministers office for months Only now has the state government authorised the Godbole committee to negotiate with DPC on third party sales outside the state The DPC project is facing the threat of closure following MSEBs inability to buy power from it thanks to the Boards weak financial position Not only can the Reliance group sell power to third parties within Maharashtra but it can sell power to utilities outside the state The PPA does not expressly bar it from doing so Nor does it specify the category of customers to whom power can be sold So in effect this suggests that the group could sell power t o industrial and commercial customers in Maharashtra and emerge as a rival t o the MSEBThe state electricity board derives over per cent of its reven ue from such consumers Apart from captive power plants independent power producers in India are allowed to sell power only to state electricity boards They can sell powe r outside the state only if they qualify for mega power project status With its mw capacity the Patalganga project is not eligible for such status because mega power rojects are supposed to have a minimum capacity of mw Speaking on the sidelines of a press conference last week Reliance Industries managing director Anil Ambani told Business Standard A provisi on in third parties Ambani was answering a question on whether the MSEBs weak financials and inability to offer escrow cover to the project as emphasised in the Godbole committee report set up to defuse the Dabhol crisis would derail the Patalganga project The PPA does not have any express restriction as to third party sale outsid e the state a Reliance spokesperson confirmed on Friday in a faxed response to questions A senior MSEB official explained that the state government cleared private power projects some years ago on the basis of the unrealistically high demand projections contained in a report by a former MSEB official Subsequently it was realised that the state would be stuck with excess power So the Reliance group was permitted to sell power to thi rd parties he said The Patalganga project along with the Ispat groups mw Bhadravati project has been put on hold till the Godbole committee submi ts its second report THE ECONOMIC TIMES MAY No need of Patalganga Bhadravati power MSEB THE AXE seems to have finally fallen on the muchdelayed Reliance Industriespromoted Patalganga and Ispat Industries Bhadravati Power projects in Maharashtra as the state electricity board has firmly told the government that there is no need of these projects nor their power The lossmaking board has communicated to the government that MSEB had no interest in Patalganga and Bhadravati as it did not have escrowable capacity and also that industrial demand for power had slowed down tremendously in Maharashtra state government sources said here on Sunday In last November itself MSEB had sent an official intimation to the state government informing its decision in favour of cancellation of the two projects on several grounds including they being unviable and unaffordable sources said Reliances project is no different from that of DPCs Patalganga is also naphthabased and its PPA is on similar lines After the Enron experience MSEB cannot even dream of another gasbased power plant in the state a senior MSEB official said He said MSEB has already asked the state government not to provide escrow to both the m w Patalganga and the mw coalbased Bhadravati as the US energy major has almost squeezed us of all over finances When contacted MSEB chairman Vinay Bansal said Reliance and Ispat projects have been put on hold as pe r the Godbole Committees recommendations but expressed inability to give further details Currently Bhadravati and Patalganga projects have been put on hold as per Godbole Committee report which was set up to review the DPCMSEB PPA and energy scenario in Maharashtra Can you go ahead with the project without an escrow cover the committee was believed to have asked Ispat and Reliance representatives to which the reply had been negative sources added Sources said as of now both the projects have not been able to achieve financial closure as leading financial institutions were not willing to fund the projects which do not have a guaranteed payment mechanism from MSEB which incidentally it has promised to DPC All the three were clear ed as fasttrack projects but other than Enron Reliance and Ispat have bee n caught in a quagmire especially Bhadravati which has been hanging afire since last nine years they added Moreover the MSEB official opined that given the current situation if DPC calls it quits from India Bhadravati was a safer bet than Reliances Patalganga Patalgangas power would be mere paise less than that of DPC s that ranges anywhere around approximately Rs per unit to as high as R s while Bhadravatis cost could be around Rs to Rs per unit he informed MSEBs installed capacity ended on March was mw a nd it has generated million units with transmission and distribution losses as high as per cent PTI BUSINESS STANDARD MAY Global bankers ask govt to honour DPC obligations Tamal Bandyopadhyay Surajeet Dasgupta Santosh Tiwary in MumbaiNewDelhi Global arrangers for the Dabhol Power Company have mounted fresh pressure o n the finance ministry to honour the Union governments counterguarante e and have also set strict conditions for reconsidering the termination of the power purchase agreement PPA between the DPC and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB In a related development the DPC has sent a not e to all lenders saying they would have to bear the consequences of the tur n of events as they have prevented the DPC from serving the PPA termination notice last month The lenders in their turn sent a statement prepared by the New Yorkbased legal firm White Case defending their stance saying they a re working in the best interest of the project The lenders are expected to meet in London over the next fortnight to take stock of the situationThe deadline for resolving the issues are drawing to a close as days of the threeweek reprieve have passed At the DPC board meeting in London on May the lenders had managed to stall the issuance of the termination notice and got three weeks time for themselves to convince the Centre a s well as the Maharashtra government to resolve the impasse on the controversial project In a letter to finance secretary Ajit Kumar dated April the global arrangers said the government must own up its responsibility and meet its obligations without further delay Among the stiff conditions set by the arrangers are the demand that the central government ensure payment of all the pending bills of MSEB for December January February and March which remain unpaid without any protest or reservation by May Monday Any payment previously made under protest should be made free and c lear of such protest or any other reservation and the Center should ensure time ly payment of future bills by MSEB they said Meanwhile sources said that t he finance secretary was expected to meet the international lenders to the Dabhol projects in London stand on the issue The lenders list of deman ds also include asking MSEB to take steps required under the existing contracts to activate the escrow arrangements put in place at the time of financial close of Phase II of the Project by May They have demanded that the Union government and the Maharashtra government should take all required actions to ensure that no government agency will take any step to impede the operation of Phase I or the construction and operation of Phase II without due cause The lenders have also asked them to ensure that the relevant customs authorities permit import of all goods and equipment required for the Project by May CSFB ANZ Export Finance Citi Bank Of America and ABN Amro are the global arrangers for both phase I as well as phase II of the project The State Bank of India which is also a global arranger for phase II did not sign the letter Ten days have passed since the lenders bought three weeks time from the company delaying its declaration of the termination of the PPA Since then nothing has moved at the material level barring MSEBs payment of the January bill to the tune of Rs crore under protest sai d a source among the global arrangers come forward to meet its obligations The lenders are planning to meet around midMay in London and this time they will be left with no choice but to give the goahead to the company to terminate the PPA unless the finance ministry comes forward to settle the issue the source added The lenders are however not ready to take the blame for any delay in the termination of PPA as implied by the company Th e White Case statement said the lenders are concerned about the fate of th e project and they are exploring all intermediate steps before choosing the last option termination of PPA BUSINESS STANDARD Saturday May GE may pull out as DPC supplier S Ravindran in Mumbai After USbased Bechtel it is now the turn of General Electric to review it s participation as equipment supplier to the controversial mw power project in Maharashtra being set up by the Dabhol Power CompanyBechtel is the EPC contractor to the project while GE has supplied the equipment primarily turbinesGeneral Electric like Bechtel also holds per cent i n Dabhol Power Company DPC And both Bechtel and General Electric are worri ed about future payments from DPC Sources familiar with the project said that so far DPC has not defaulted in its payments to General Electric What is worrying General Electric is the possible scenario after June when about mw power will be commissioned after the second phase trial runs DPC and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB have been locked in a payments dispute for months If MSEB continues with its stance DPC in turn may not be able to pay General Electric In such a situation GE may walk o ut of the project A final decision will be taken only in June said sources General Electric did not respond to a faxed questionnaire sent by Business Standard Senior executives at its public relations agency Burson Marsteller Roger Pereira said that only DPC executives were authorised to speak on the issue The DPC spokesman declined to comment on the issue The first phase of the mw has already been commissioned After the seco nd phase of mwis commissioned by December MSEB will have to pay DPC a minimum of Rs crore per month The escrow account for this was to have been made operational by April MSEB has refused to do this Earlier DPC had invoked the political force majeure clause in its contract with the board MSEB is now arguing that the invocation of this clause has absolved DPC of all its liabilities Consequently it will not operationalise the escrow account This casts a further shadow over DPCs ability to pay General Electric and Bechtel T his is worrying the lenders to the project as well The situation has taken a turn for the worse with DPC practically refusing to renegotiate the contra ct for the second phase with the Godbole panel constituted by the
