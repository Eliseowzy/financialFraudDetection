<8856120.1075852224003.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,bruce.mills@enron.com,2001-09-13 10:38:14,FW LeatherLadies and Gentlemen wear Leather If I could offer you only one tip for improving your life wearing leather would be it The long term benefits of leather have been proved by serious bikers over many highways and many years whereas wearing something unreliable like shorts and flipflops means you will experience a trip to the emergency room There uncaring nurses will scrub gravel out of your wounds and doctors will dispense ineffective painkillers and meaningless advice like telling you to trade that murdercycle in for a Camry Bullshit I will dispense some real advice right now Enjoy the power and beauty of your ride If you dont already you can fully enjoy it by doing blocklong smokey burnouts in the parking lot at the local drivein Pass slower bikers on the right inside of the uphill curve when they will not let you pass to the left Trust me in years youll look back at the photos of you and your pals on your bikes and recall in a way you cant grasp now how much fun you had and how fabulous you really looked hauling ass down the highway dressed in leather Leather is as sexy as you imagine Dont worry about what your Mom thinks or worry about what others think Know that worrying about what other people think is as effective as trying to scratch your nose in a blinding hailstorm at mph with a full face helmet and winter gloves on The real troubles in your life are apt to be Volvo stationwagons driven by some dipstick talking into his cell phone or doing her makeup the kind that blindside you at PM on some urban roadway and then claim you crashed into THEM Do one thing everyday that scares other drivers Lanesplit Ladies learn to ride and then ride often Nothing is more of an equalizer than a woman dressed in leather astride her own machine Gentlemen respect the ladies who ride for they could very well have been the rider that waxed your fanny in the mountian curves you just came through Sing into your helmet Use mouthwash first Keep mints handy Dont be reckless with other peoples bikes especially if you dont have insurance Dont put up with people who mess with yours in fact beat them with a chain Ride Fast Dont waste your money on chrome or fancy paintjobs spend it on racing or partying Sometimes youre fast sometimes youre slow Sometimes youre hungover The ride is long and in the end a cold beer tastes pretty damn good Remember the good rides youve had forget the cuts and bruises Watch cage drivers to not signal before pulling into your lane Be alert for brainless cage drivers to pull an opposing left turn in front of you May the fool on four wheels in front of you have working brake lights Try to wear out the sides of your tires before the middle if you succeed in doing this tell me how Keep your oil changed throw away old traffic citations Enjoy your bike use it every way you candont be afraid of it or what other people think of it its the greatest instrument of pleasure youll ever own not counting porn sites and a fast modem Take chances Dont feel guilty if you ride faster than the posted limit the most interesting people I know didnt know at how to ride conservatively all the most interesting year olds I know still dont Get plenty of saddle time Be kind to your passengers youll miss them if they fall off Maybe youll crash maybe you wont maybe youll have surgery maybe you wont maybe youll ride a cruiser off a cliff doing maybe youll get a new motocrosser for your th birthday whatever you ride dont congratulate yourself too much your choices are foreign domestic so are everyone elses Wrench even if you have nowhere to do it but in your hotel room Do not read American motorcycle magazines they will only make you wish youd bought a British one instead Read British motorcycle magazines and laugh at how the brits laugh at americans Stay away from German motorcycle magazines they are too serious and difficult to read Read the owners manual even though you wont remember any of it Get to know your brake pads you never know when theyll be gone for good Remember brake pads let you stop Be nice to your tires they are your link to the pavement and the things most likely to save your butt from a nasty highside Understand that mechanics comes and mechanics go but for a precious talented few you should pay them well and buy them sixpacks Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle because the older your bike gets the more youll need the mechanic who worked on it when it was young and still not paid off Ride in New York City once but leave before you get killed ride in Northern California whenever possible but leave a plausible excuse when calling in sick for work Ride in the Ozarks and learn the trick of the curve Ride the Blue Ridge Parkway and learn to be smooth Ride through Deals Gap and live to tell others about it Stop and watch others ride through Deals Gap and applaud when others do it well Do lurid wheelies Accept certain inalienable truths prices will rise traffic will get worse you too will get old and when you do youll fantasize that when you were young gasoline was cheap the highway patrol couldnt catch you and Harley owners werent all yuppies Respect your revlimiter Dont expect anyone else to see your bike unless it has really loud pipes Maybe your bike has a big gas tank maybe a smaller one but remember either way youll have to make bathroom stops Stop and offer help to the stranded motorcyclist along the open road for the next you come along could very well be yourself Dont mess too much with your carburetors or by the time your done youll be walking home and your pipes will be blue Be careful whose advice you buy and save your receipts Dont take advice from those who supply it for free especially if they own a Britbike Motorcycle restoration is a form of selftorture Doing it is a way of pulling the past from the dustbin degreasing it painting over the rusty parts and dumping way more money into it than its worth Indian restoration is a truely refined ailment that is only cured by death or an unlimited bank account But trust me on the leather

portions of these businesses to core or noncore as the analysis dictates Approximately MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter These include a gas LDC in Brazil EcoElectrica and our Indian EP assets Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of MMBn Given the current environment raising equity in the public markets would be inefficient McMahon says Shortterm liquidity is provided by the Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago the Bn of new debt and the Bn equity infusion from Dynegy Longerterm the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt McMahon described the major offbalancesheet vehicles Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets It was initially capitalized with MM of a debt and MM of equity raised from Enron and institutional investors The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix assets Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on the Enron topup obligation The date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated belowinvestmentgrade by any one of the three major agencies The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water As long as Wessex is worth at least Bn there will be no Enron topup required If we take a haircut to present book value Enron will have to provide MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt This MM would hit Enron cash income and equity balances Osprey contains energyrelated assets and other assets It was initially capitalized with Bn of a debt and MM in equity ENE and institutionals As with Marlin the entity is an assetbacked structure with an Enron topup guarantee The debt is supported by a the assets b Bn of convertible preferred ENE convertible into MM shares of ENE common and c additional ENE common as needed for topup Assuming the same hypothetical haircut to current book value Enron would have to deliver approx MM of topup fundswhich would hit ENE cash income and equity The debt must be retired by with the same cuttojunk early trigger provision as Marlin Yosemite and the CreditLinked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with large financial institutions The underlying transactions are already on Enrons balance sheet McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles McMahon says Our Q will be filed five days late The Q will include all of this detail regarding the offbalancesheet vehicles The special committee investigation is still ongoing The committee meets timesweek sometimes more often The outside auditors DT and external counsel hired by the committee are working virtually days a week Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation McMahon says its way too early to tell if any asset writedowns are called for That analysis is underway but it will not be complete for some time Osprey contains the European power projects Trakya and Saarlux some North American merchant investments and some Brazilian assets Under the merger agreement Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval However an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval Broadband is expected to be fully wound up sometime over the course of the next year Did not catch this part clearly The ENE topup obligation for Marlin represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level Current book value of the Osprey assets is Bn No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the Bn legal liability clause Yosemite and the CreditLinked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt this section somewhat unclear The underlying transactions represented volumes of crude oil and gas The transactions relate to the physical movement of these commodities The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longerterm products Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put longterm deals on hold last week Says that our first focus is on getting our shortterm business back up to normal levels It will be a couple of weeks before were able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding longterm deals with us McMahon There hasnt been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customerscredit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers But we have seen a return of some of the transactions some of the flows Whalley says that were hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure he says The cuts will certainly be deeper in our noncore businesses Whalley then quickly interjects some might say interrrupts with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business We will be looking at perhaps streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business McMahon The company is overlevered thats a facthence our pursuit of additional equity McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week ENE had approx Bn in cash as of which McMahon points out would be unusual for us As before give me a call at if youd like more color Patrick Tucker
