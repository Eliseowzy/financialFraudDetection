<4155346.1075854953635.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,lesliewmadams@aol.com,2001-10-16 09:30:32,HABITAT Cc Thank you all for your willingness to serve on our Habitat project All of you were chosen for some leadership position because of your skill and experience The biggest challenge with this project is the number of people who want to participate There is no doubt in my mind that we are going to complete the house probably ahead of schedule with this much manpower so long as Habitat has the supplies on hand From our standpoint the purpose of the project is as much ministry and fellowship as the end product which is why we didnt turn any volunteers away I encourage each of you to participate on as many Saturdays as possible We will need some continuity in leadership since so many volunteers will be participating for only one or two Saturdays and that may be a month apart At the same time there are enough leaders that you shouldnt feel guilty if you have other obligations When you are available you will be instrumental in keeping people organized safe and productive Thank you again Les
