surprise many of them when I say Most investors WONT make a dime this year in technology stocks Thats because the old game is over No more buying frenzy No return to the anythingworks days of And no easypickings Thats the BAD NEWS The GOOD NEWS Were already enjoying a new feast of profits that can make you to RICHER by this time next year But most investors sadly will miss out Thats because the technology boom has passed its revolutionary stageand turned into an EVOLUTIONARY process that will give most companies fits Good ideas and innovation are no longer enough Execution size and financial strength matter MUCH more today A ton more great companies with great technologies and great people will badly disappoint Wall Street in the coming months And any investor using the OLD rules for investing in tech stocks will get creamed YOU CAN SEE it in the oldtime tech giants like HewlettPackard and Ericsson that are uncompetitive today You can see it in notforprofit business model of Amazoncom And you can see it in all the little geewhiz technology companies that have tumbled like bowling pins on league night In my view betting on tech stocks today is like a trip to Vegas without any of the fun But and heres the good part you can still MAKE YOUR FORTUNE by investing in those few powerhouses that still lord above the rest in this incredibly competitive industry In fact since the beginning of October my entire POWERHOUSE portfolio thats every single stock I recommend not some madeup best of list is UP How about you Are you making money like this right now or are you missing out Take a look at some of the stocks my clients and I own and how well theyre doing RIGHT NOW Im sure by now youve heard of Amgens buyout of the fastgrowing biotech firm Immunex When that deal was announced it included a premium But weve done much better In fact we just sold for banked GAINS in just months time Analysts are jumping back on the cell phone bandwagon Why New personal security issues soaring sales in China and a generational shift in technologies Powerhouse Nokia is UP since in October st Were seeing a major shift in how microchips are manufactured thanks to the next generation of technological innovations And that means big profits for the top contract manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor Were UP over the same timeframe Of course security is a HUGE issue now And many of the answers that will make our lives and businesses more secure are technologybased Security POWERHOUSE Check Point Systems is UP Whats more were making money in nearly every tech sector thanks to our laserlike selectivity Even the beleaguered enterprise software sector has been good to us since the beginning of October our stake in Peoplesoft has SOARED As you can see weve made a TON of money already And so you might ask Is it TOO LATE for me No In fact you can match these profits in the coming months even beat them but there is ONE CATCH You must act now YOU CANT afford to disregard my invitation to join Technology Investing any longer As our recent gains prove we are in the midst of a POTENT profit run that can make you a small fortune in But not if you just

make your fortune several times over in the years to come Ive just put the finishing touches on an Urgent Profit Bulletin detailing this opportunity and in just a bit Ill tell you how to get your FREE

slowed down In fact it nearly came to a grinding halt That means there isnt nearly enough capacity or redundancy built into the system to accommodate a blip in demand Sources tell me that the government is very worried about this problem After all this is the second time its happened Back in July a tunnel fire in Baltimore slowed the Internet to a crawl for two full days That means our communications systems and therefore our economy are very very vulnerable Ten years ago it wouldnt have mattered But today commerce and security is COMPLETELY DEPENDENT on those systems Virtually nothing moves without it Thats how banks and brokerages transfer fundshow dispatchers route fleets of truckshow many Americans get paid through direct deposit And we are closer to the BREAKING POINT than of Americans even begin to understand Heres one example Qwest one of Americas biggest carriers recently said theyre loaded on their network That doesnt sound too baduntil you understand how these

packets of information The system locks Communications stops The nation comes to a standstill AMERICA IS FALLING BEHIND the rest of the developed world Internet traffic systems currently run faster in Australia Europe and even South America Thats because we push out more data than everyone else but were not increasing capacity at anywhere near the needed rate Weve got to catch up and weve got to

laid is dark that is its not activated And the company Im recommending is the supplier of the components needed to do the job Im looking at a DOUBLE possibly a TRIPLE by this time next year And I

<1827945.1075840327835.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,murphy@investorplace.com,2002-02-01 17:16:37,The MOSTHATED stock in AmericaPST Dear Investor Coming out of the stock market crash nearly every investor has a story about the stock Ive learned to hate For some folks names like Amazoncom and Yahoo make their BLOOD BOIL Others cringe at the mention of former industry leaders like Lucent Technology Still more wonder what the hecks wrong with Disney or Charles Schwab But theres one company in particular that leaves investors wondering WHAT WENT WRONG Not because that company plunged into bankruptcy or pulled a fast one like Enron But simply because this name seemed so full of promisethat investors were shocked saddened and hurt when it fell AND THATS THE STOCK Im writing to you about and urging you to buy today Its one I never owned up until now In fact you might say its a stock I used to hate But now when many investors have jumped this ship Im telling my Technology Investing clients to BUY with both hands And Im projecting MONEYDOUBLING gains in the next months plus a great shot at truly wealthbuilding profits over the next several years In just a moment youll learn how to get the name of my newest investment plus all the details on my other top holdings absolutely RISKFREE BUT FIRST let me share the highlights of this intriguing story with you now This wireless whippersnapper was the posterchild of the run tech stocks to the moon crowd The company and everyone associated with it touted its new communications technology as the most significant breakthrough since man first learned to talk No wonder the stock took off like a rocket Starting in January Wall Streets tech touts ran it all the way to on the strength of their glowing reviews In fact they told investors that the best was yet to come so every time the stock dipped people didnt sell they just bought more WHAT A MISTAKE I just shook my head at the nonsense and stayed the heck away You see I couldnt see any more basis for that mania than for buying whocares aboutprofits Amazoncom While the dream of its new technology sounded greatthe reality was a totally different thing indeed Simply put these guys talked a good game but their products DIDNT WORK I had a friend who learned this the hard way She won a few cellular licenses at auction about five years ago and chose this company as a supplier against my heartfelt advice So she went to their plant for a demonstration and NOTHING WORKED They claimed they were going to revolutionize the whole communications industry and she couldnt even make a simple phone call And trust me she wasnt the only one FOOLED Both Lucent and Motorola committed to supporting this technology as the new industry standard And they got HURT BAD when the whole thing unraveled Of course no one got hurt as bad as unsuspecting investors who saw the value of their holdings SLASHED SOME So you cant blame those folks if they hate this stock and say Never never again BUT THATS A CRYING SHAME Because this companys engineers have been working very very hard behind thescenes And guess what Now the technology DOES WORK Its knockyoursocksoff stuff just a few years later than promised And its going to make my Technology Investing clients you too I hope a pile of money just ahead Its funny really Telecom companies committed to this communications standard when they never should have But once they did they signed on for the long haul And now this companywhich Im finally buying will reap the rewards AND WELL PROFIT with them Up to very recently two competing technologies GSM and CDMA were still in the running for wireless supremacy across the globe They were battling to become the standard for next generation cell phones featuring Internet access email instant messaging and other broadband applications But now the battle is over This companys CDMA technology now that it finally works as promised has won out And not only is their technology used in many phones today it will be used in ALL future phones going forward The fun for investors starts now and lasts for many years to come Soon the day will come when this company is paid a royalty on every cell phone sold THATS HUGE Near term Im looking to DOUBLE OUR MONEY in the next months Longer term I hate to put a ceiling on how high this stock could go That would be like having put a limit on Microsoft Dell or Intel in the early days youre almost sure to miss on the low side DONT MISS OUT Get this companys name immediately online by accepting a RISKFREE trial subscription to my

technology today one that has individual investors completely in the dark about an opportunity of immense proportions A LOWRISK tech stock that can easily DOUBLE your money by this time next year then make your fortune several times over in the years to come Ive just put the finishing touches on an Urgent Profit Bulletin detailing this opportunity and in just a bit Ill tell you how to get your FREE copy But first back to technologys biggest lie Im talking about the socalled glut of fiber optic cable Heres the REAL story WHEN the World Trade Center got hit the Internet slowed down very noticeably slowed down In fact it nearly came to a grinding halt That means there isnt nearly enough capacity or redundancy built into the system to accommodate a blip in demand Sources tell me that the government is very worried about this problem After all this is the second time its happened Back in July a tunnel fire in Baltimore slowed the Internet to a crawl for two full days That means our communications systems and therefore our economy are very very vulnerable Ten years ago it wouldnt have mattered But today commerce and security is COMPLETELY DEPENDENT on those systems Virtually nothing moves without it Thats how banks and brokerages transfer fundshow dispatchers route fleets of truckshow many Americans get paid through direct deposit And we are closer to the BREAKING POINT than of Americans even begin to understand Heres one example Qwest one of Americas biggest carriers recently said theyre loaded on their network That doesnt sound too baduntil you understand how these networks operate You cant load a network much past In fact is virtually CATASTROPHIC because the network spends so much time searching for open channels it doesnt spend any time actually sending packets of information The system locks Communications stops The nation comes to a standstill AMERICA IS FALLING BEHIND the rest of the developed world Internet traffic systems currently run faster in Australia Europe and even South America Thats because we push out more data than everyone else but were not increasing capacity at anywhere near the needed rate Weve got to catch up and weve got to catch up fast Otherwise business the economy and our national security all go in the CRAPPER BUT WHY do we have this capacity problem amidst a fiber glut Because of all the fiber that has ever been laid is dark that is its not activated And the company Im recommending is the supplier of the components needed to do the job Im looking at a DOUBLE possibly a TRIPLE by this time next year And I fully expect to multiply our money fivetimes over by In fact this stock truly has tenbagger potential At the height of the boom this companys stock was nearly times higher So what changed Spending on

<13970886.1075855135870.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,murphy@investorplace.com,2001-12-19 06:16:45,The Great China Wireless SurpriseDear Investor By now the scope of the opportunity at least to most people is crystal clear China is one of the worlds last great growth markets An arena where nimble companies and savvy investors will reap OBSCENE PROFITS for years to come Chinas GDP is growing at a annual clip and its entry into the World Trade Organization and successful bid to host the Olympics legitimize its place in the modern world Name almost any industry and I can show you how it will profit from the China Phenomenon BUT IF YOU pushed me to select just oneto name the single industry where the profits will be virtually unlimited I would say this The Chinese WIRELESS explosion is your ticket to true wealth Mainland China passed the US this year in sheer number of wireless subscribers Yet the percentage of its population with access to telecom services is still just a paltry Spending on telecom infrastructure will EXPLODE over the next several years Chinas government plans to spend an additional BILLION by Whats more while spending in Europe and the US has dried up this year investment in China has SOARED Capital spending is some ahead of last years levels Demand is growing briskly At the end of China had million telecom subscribers By that number will reach MILLION And wireless the platform most favored by government and the general populace will grow nearly this year ITS OBVIOUS to anyone paying attentionthe OPPORTUNITY IS HUGE Butthe very biggest profits lifechanging profits will come from a source VERY SURPRISING to most investors Who do you think might be the biggest beneficiaries of all this growth Lucent which has really good technology in this area Texas Instruments the chip maker that supplies the chips used in most digital phones Or maybe one of the quasigovernmental Chinese companies with an inside track That my friend is the SURPRISING PART of this MONSTER GROWTH story The big winner wont be any one of those choices or any other bigname firm you might think of No indeed the BIG WINNER and a real prize for savvy investors who get in now will be a little but already profitable company headquartered in Alameda California ITS A NAME that of all investors have never heard of But its a name that you if you act now will remember with great fondness for the rest of your life The story starts with something called PHS technology You see the wireless technology youre used to in this country uses cellular networks that deploy large powerful base stations to service a wide area But PHS technology uses large amounts of small stations on telephone poles stop signs and the like to saturate densely populated urban areas And thats why this technology will dominate the China market of Chinese wireless subscribers are intracity users They dont often travel They spend most of their time living and working in the same densely populated area And that my friend is the perfect match for PHS technology WHATS MORE PHS is times cheaper than the other technologies That also makes it the perfect choice in a country where the average person earns less than a year No wonder the PHS market is booming I expect it to grow tentimes bigger over the next few years Its a spectacular opportunity And the little US company Im recommending to my California Technology Stock Letter CTSL subscribers right nowis the BEST WAY for investors like you to profit from the China wireless boom At CTSL we specialize in staying AHEAD OF THE CURVE and

<27072241.1075862599483.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,murphy@investorplace.com,2001-11-20 13:11:42,UP and still climbing Buy NOW or miss outDear Investor About weeks ago I emailed you about a stock I believe can make you filthy rich So far I havent heard back from you and thats a real shame Thats because we dont get many chances like this one where a small investment now can create true wealth in just a couple short years Think Im kidding This company just issued a small piece of good news yesterday and its stock POPPED Now today its up another at midday Thats GAINS in trading hours Whens the last time you made profits like that Best of all those gains are just the appetizer for the feast to follow So its not too late for you if you get in now So whats the story And why is it so powerful Well my friend this companys revolutionary communications breakthrough makes Federal Express look like the Pony Expressand could well make you RICHER by Im talking of a global network to deliver documents data video ondemand anything you can imagine anywhere in the worldat the SPEED OF LIGHT Yet the company behind this remarkable achievement a GEM rich in innovation and cash is priced at giveaway prices thanks to the market meltdown This ISNT some punk Internet stock struggling to stay afloat The company has a BILLION cash war chest and a list of PAYING CLIENTS that reads like the whos who of global communications Ive been professionally involved in global stock markets for years now and I can honestly say Ive seldom seen a story so dramatic At my California Technology Stock Letter we jumped on Intel in when most analysts scoffed at its prospects Three years later we sold for GAINS In July Power Integrations got knocked down to silly levels so I practically screamed at clients to BUY We better than tripled our money in less than six months time DUSA Pharmaceuticals was going begging in when we gobbled up all we could Our gains turned into more than THERE ARE MORE LIKE THESE But they dont come around every day Thats why Im pounding the table on this one Im expecting some of the EASIEST PROFITS weve ever made And if you MISS OUT youll kick yourself later Ive just put the finishing touches on an URGENT Profit Bulletin called You Can Be Richer By that Id like you to have It details the saga of the TOPDOG in global communications todayexplains why this company will dominate worldwide while others failand gives you hard evidence for PROFITS by And thats just to start Theres a great shot at TENFOLD GAINS in the next years because this company truly controls the destiny of global communications THE FUTURE OF COMMUNICATIONS IS FIBER OPTICS Think of nearly unlimited bandwidth at incredibly efficient prices Experience and research tells me this is an industry destined for greatness Ask yourself this Will we go back to rotary phones no Internet and scratchy longdistance calls Or will we go forward to faster connections Internet use throughout the worldand a wide array of data video conferencing etc services My friend man simply DOESNT go backwards Its human nature to want what your neighbor has Its human nature to want bigger better and more Thats why I believe the communications revolution isnt overits JUST GETTING STARTED There will be bumps bruises and shakeouts along the way But that just allows KINGPIN companies like this one to gobble up even more market share THIS COMPANY INVESTED more than billion to link companies with a revolutionary mile fiber optic network And in a real twist in todays world the project just finished on budgeton schedule Whats more this network isnt some empty shell it has real paying customers with contracts covering half the cost already Its customers already include major telecoms like Deutsche Telekom British Telecom and Qwest institutions like the British government and the US Navy and companies like Proctor Gamble American Express Direct TV and JP Morgan Chase And the company has already inked billion worth of new deals so far this year China is becoming a huge source of profits The country has pledged to spend billion to improve its infrastructure in preparation for the Olympics much of that for communications upgrades Whats more Chinas entry into the World Trade Organization will trigger another spending spree And this company will be one of the prime beneficiaries As youll see in your free report the China connection is HUGE This company has been on an earnings tear prior to the hit our entire economy has taken this fall EBITDA earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization rose in the nd quarter a phenomenal number And as the economy recovers I expect EBITDA to return to its blistering growth pace Whats more this company is set to be a big player in Virtual Private Networks VPNs that enable SECURE communications between groups of people anywhere in the world Virtual facetoface audio and video No need for airline travel Analysts expect this industry to grow quickly and become huge THERE WILL BE WINNERS AND LOSERS in the bandwidth game And Ill bet dollars to doughnuts this company will be the BIGGEST WINNER of all In todays weak economy the smaller outfits are teetering on the edge They cant raise capital But in the meantime this JUGGERNAUT is sitting on BILLION in cash I sense AMAZING OPPORTUNITY here But the opportunity wont last long Todays

<13816365.1075861163758.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,murphy@investorplace.com,2001-11-20 13:05:00,UP and still climbing Buy NOW or miss outDear Investor About weeks ago I emailed you about a stock I believe can make you filthy rich So far I havent heard back from you and thats a real shame Thats because we dont get many chances like this one where a small investment now can create true wealth in just a couple short years Think Im kidding This company just issued a small piece of good news yesterday and its stock POPPED Now today its up another at midday Thats GAINS in trading hours Whens the last time you made profits like that Best of all those gains are just the appetizer for the feast to follow So its not too late for you if you get in now So whats the story And why is it so powerful Well my friend this companys revolutionary communications breakthrough makes Federal Express look like the Pony Expressand could well make you RICHER by Im talking of a global network to deliver documents data video ondemand anything you can imagine anywhere in the worldat the SPEED OF LIGHT Yet the company behind this remarkable achievement a GEM rich in innovation and cash is priced at giveaway prices thanks to the market meltdown This ISNT some punk Internet stock struggling to stay afloat The company has a BILLION cash war chest and a list of PAYING CLIENTS that reads like the whos who of global communications Ive been professionally involved in global stock markets for years now and I can honestly say Ive seldom seen a story so dramatic At my California Technology Stock Letter we jumped on Intel in when most analysts scoffed at its prospects Three years later we sold for GAINS In July Power Integrations got knocked down to silly levels so I practically screamed at clients to BUY We better than tripled our money in less than six months time DUSA Pharmaceuticals was going begging in when we gobbled up all we could Our gains turned into more than THERE ARE MORE LIKE THESE But they dont come around every day Thats why Im pounding the table on this one Im expecting some of the EASIEST PROFITS weve ever made And if you MISS OUT youll kick yourself later Ive just put the finishing touches on an URGENT Profit Bulletin called You Can Be Richer By that Id like you to have It details the saga of the TOPDOG in global communications todayexplains why this company will dominate worldwide while others failand gives you hard evidence for PROFITS by And thats just to start Theres a great shot at TENFOLD GAINS in the next years because this company truly controls the destiny of global communications THE FUTURE OF COMMUNICATIONS IS FIBER OPTICS Think of nearly unlimited bandwidth at incredibly efficient prices Experience and research tells me this is an industry destined for greatness Ask yourself this Will we go back to rotary phones no Internet and scratchy longdistance calls Or will we go forward to faster connections Internet use throughout the worldand a wide array of data video conferencing etc services My friend man simply DOESNT go backwards Its human nature to want what your neighbor has Its human nature to want bigger better and more Thats why I believe the communications revolution isnt overits JUST GETTING STARTED There will be bumps bruises and shakeouts along the way But that just allows KINGPIN companies like this one to gobble up even more market share THIS COMPANY INVESTED more than billion to link companies with a revolutionary mile fiber optic network And in a real twist in todays world the project just finished on budgeton schedule Whats more this network isnt some empty shell it has real paying customers with contracts covering half the cost already Its customers already include major telecoms like Deutsche Telekom British Telecom and Qwest institutions like the British government and the US Navy and companies like Proctor Gamble American Express Direct TV and JP Morgan Chase And the company has already inked billion worth of new deals so far this year China is becoming a huge source of profits The country has pledged to spend billion to improve its infrastructure in preparation for the Olympics much of that for communications upgrades Whats more Chinas entry into the World Trade Organization will trigger another spending spree And this company will be one of the prime beneficiaries As youll see in your free report the China connection is HUGE This company has been on an earnings tear prior to the hit our entire economy has taken this fall EBITDA earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization rose in the nd quarter a phenomenal number And as the economy recovers I expect EBITDA to return to its blistering growth pace Whats more this company is set to be a big player in Virtual Private Networks VPNs that enable SECURE communications between groups of people anywhere in the world Virtual facetoface audio and video No need for airline travel Analysts expect this industry to grow quickly and become huge THERE WILL BE WINNERS AND LOSERS in the bandwidth game And Ill bet dollars to doughnuts this company will be the BIGGEST WINNER of all In todays weak economy the smaller outfits are teetering on the edge They cant raise capital But in the meantime this JUGGERNAUT is sitting on BILLION in cash I sense AMAZING OPPORTUNITY here But the opportunity wont last long Todays confusion about the economy has some real gems priced like baubles And this stock is a GLITTERING DIAMOND just waiting for you to scoop it up To get the name and full story see You Can Be Richer By To find out how please GO HERE jointodaypromocodeTPindexTPhtm Yours Sincerely Michael Murphy Editor California Technology Stock Letter PS Bill Gates is one smart guy and Microsoft recently inked a new

<18079649.1075840992169.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,murphy@investorplace.com,2002-01-10 16:23:06,FLASH ALERT Dont fall for Technologys biggest LIEPST Dear Investor Im writing to expose the biggest lie in technology today one that has individual investors completely in the dark about an opportunity of immense proportions A LOWRISK tech stock that can easily DOUBLE your money by this time next year then make your fortune several times over in the years to come Ive just put the finishing touches on an Urgent Profit Bulletin detailing this opportunity and in just a bit Ill tell you how to get your FREE copy But first back to technologys biggest lie Im talking about the socalled glut of fiber optic cable Heres the REAL story WHEN the World Trade Center got hit the Internet slowed down very noticeably slowed down In fact it nearly came to a grinding halt That means there isnt nearly enough capacity or redundancy built into the system to accommodate a blip in demand Sources tell me that the government is very worried about this problem After all this is the second time its happened Back in July a tunnel fire in Baltimore slowed the Internet to a crawl for two full days That means our communications systems and therefore our economy are very very vulnerable Ten years ago it wouldnt have mattered But today commerce and security is COMPLETELY DEPENDENT on those systems Virtually nothing moves without it Thats how banks and brokerages transfer fundshow dispatchers route fleets of truckshow many Americans get paid through direct deposit And we are closer to the BREAKING POINT than of Americans even begin to understand Heres one example Qwest one of Americas biggest carriers recently said theyre loaded on their network That doesnt sound too baduntil you understand how these networks operate You cant load a network much past In fact is virtually CATASTROPHIC because the network spends so much time searching for open channels it doesnt spend any time actually sending packets of information The system locks Communications stops The nation comes to a standstill AMERICA IS FALLING BEHIND the rest of the developed world Internet traffic systems currently run faster in Australia Europe and even South America Thats because we push out more data than everyone else but were not increasing capacity at anywhere near the needed rate Weve got to catch up and weve got to catch up fast Otherwise business the economy and our national security all go in the CRAPPER BUT WHY do we have this capacity problem amidst a fiber glut Because of all the fiber that has ever been laid is dark that is its not activated And the company Im recommending is the supplier of the components needed to do the job Im looking at a DOUBLE possibly a TRIPLE by this time next year And I fully expect to multiply our money fivetimes over by In fact this stock truly has tenbagger potential At the height of the boom this companys stock was nearly times higher So what changed Spending on communications networks dried up Now the government is ready to pump billion in emergency spending into the economy interest rates are practically zero and the need isnt just vital for the economy anymore its a question of NATIONAL SECURITY Please dont miss out Youll kick yourself bigtime if you miss out Get this companys name and full details in my urgent profit bulletin Times Richer By Ill
