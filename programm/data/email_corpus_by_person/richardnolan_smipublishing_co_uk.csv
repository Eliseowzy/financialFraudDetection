extend the capacity of the crude oil corridor from the central elhamra oil field to the Arzew terminal west of Algiers The extension will allow the company more time to evaluate the bids About six companiesgroups are understood to be bidding for the three contracts which are estimated to be worth m each They include CCC a consortium of Bonatti with Entrepose and Dragados Construcciones and Bechtel The first two contracts involve the construction of the pipelines with a third contract for six pumping stations The recent political changes in Algeria combined with internal administrative changes in Sonatrach are said to have contributed to the delay OIL PRICES RISE OVER ISRAELI CONFLICT London Oil prices soared on global markets last night following rising tensions in the Middle East London Brent blend futures rose cents to but remains short of a year high touched last month US light crude was up cents at helped by speculators returning to buy oil after a twoweek selloff Following Saudi Arabias warning that Riyadh and other Arab states would not watch with their hands tied if Israel attacked Lebanon or Syria the cost of a barrel of crude went up almost a dollar to o in New York Earlier the International Energy Agency set alarm bells ringing when it said the West was heading into winter with inventories well below the seasonal norm Oil prices have retreated from their year peaks last month after pressure from the G industrial nations on producers to pump more crude and the US decision to release m barrels from its strategic reserve After briefly dipping below prices

Palestinians and Israelis over the past days has killed at least people mostly Palestinians BUYBACK TERMS SET TO CHANGE Tehran In an interview with Petroleum Argus this month Mehdi Hosseini former
