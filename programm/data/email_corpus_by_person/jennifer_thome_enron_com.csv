from the west on October th Community Energy and Exelon Power Team executives announced the five largest retail wind purchases in Americas history to a large crowd of excited onlookers gathered for the dedication of two new Pennsylvania wind farms Amidst cheers and applause Mike Freeman of Exelon Power Team and Brent Alderfer of Community Energy announced that the University of Pennsylvania now leads the nation for the largest retail purchase of wind The Penn Quakers are buying million kilowatthours kWh the output of five turbines or the equivalent of percent of its electricity from the Community EnergyExelon Power Teams MW and MW wind farms at Mill Run and Somerset Township With these turbines only just beginning to turn multiple conversations were heard about the need to build even more wind farms to meet retail consumer demand for wind energy All those standing on the reclaimed mine land that is now a dairy farm could see before them the merging of wind power and the power of the retail marketplace Not far behind the Quakers in their purchase are the roaring Nittany Lions of Penn State University Penn State University is purchasing more than million kWh the production of three turbines from Community Energy For a land grant university its hard to beat clean energy made on a dairy farm In third place is Carnegie Mellon University which created crucial momentum by becoming the first major wind purchaser acquiring million kWh Having exercised real leadership and gotten this market moving Carnegie Mellon is seriously considering increasing its wind energy buy next year Rounding out the top five are the Philadelphia Suburban Water Company and Giant Eagle with purchases of about million and million kWh respectively We urge more companies and utilities to follow their examples If you are interested in buying wind energy contact Community Energy at wwwnewwindenergycom In fact if just institutions buy at least the output of one large wind turbine Pennsylvanias retail consumers can insure that MW of new wind energy are built and operating By harnessing the power of the retail market to wind power development that goal is very achievable Though not in the top five the Environmental Protection Agency Western Pennsylvania Conservancy and the White Dog Cafe in Philadelphia have all also made major purchases Every one of these purchasers understands the price of wind energy but more importantly they understand its environmental public health and energy security value showing that Oscar Wilde wasnt right about everyone when he said nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing Stunningly percent of the wind power from these two wind farms was sold out as soon as Public Utility Commission Chairman Glen Thomas and Department of Environmental Protection Secretary David Hess flipped the switch of the first of what are sixteen Enron Wind MW machines These turbines which make full revolutions per minute are the largest manufactured in the United States and their blades are longer than previously used to be more efficient in the moderatebutsteady wind at these locations All told they will generate enough electricity for homes or about million kWh of electricity with no soot mercury carbon dioxide nitrogen oxide or sulfur dioxide In contrast typical system power in this region would emit about million pounds of carbon dioxide pounds of sulfur dioxide and pounds per year of nitrogen oxide in order to provide the same amount of electricity But aside from the important environmental benefits the wind projects also reflect substantial economic development in Fayette and Somerset counties Both the Mill Run and Somerset turbines are on working farms with the owners receiving to for each tower erected on their land which they continue to farm Several of the Somerset turbines are situated on reclaimed strip and deep mines Construction of the two wind farms required about labor years of employment and will require about four fulltime equivalent workers to maintain and operate the sites The sites generate local property taxes and if yesterdays dedication ceremonies and the nearby Green Mountain wind farm in Garrett are any indication at least a modest tourist industry This was all made possible by a great project team and every member deserves a hearty well done Although construction only took about months project development by Atlantic Renewable Energy Corporation began about two years ago Zilkha Renewable Energy Atlantics development partner provided project financing as did The Reinvestment Funds Sustainable Development Fund with money made available as a result of the PECO Energy and Unicom merger settlement negotiated by PennFuture and others Exelon Power Team is the wholesaler and Community Energy markets wind energy to retail customers On a sad note Nick Humber an Enron Wind employee who was instrumental in moving the projects to fruition died when his hijacked plane crashed into the World Trade Center on Sept Another plane that crashed in Somerset County was only about miles from the wind farm Nicks contribution to the project leaves a stunning memorial reaching into the sky with clean affordable homegrown electricity that supports our communities We are glad that Nicks brother was able to attend the dedication As the tragic events of Sept spur renewed patriotism and interest in domestic safety it is important to recognize that the Community EnergyExelon wind farms will help to increase Americas energy independence and security More wind farms can only do us more good Conservation is a moral issue said President Teddy Roosevelt for it involves the patriotic duty to insure the safety and continuance of the nation In these

number of stat es rights stakeholders describing concerns about the Senators proposed leg islation This letter can also be found at the following link n galegislativeUpdateCLETTERDhtml aorgcdaimagesNGALOGOBWGIF September The Honorable Jef f BingamanChairmanEnergy and Natural Resources CommitteeSD Dirksen S enate Office BuildingWashington RE Electricity Legislation Dear Chairman BingamanThe undersigned groups representing state and loc al governments would like to begin a dialogue with you to discuss creative measures for responding to electricity restructuring issuesAs you know the National Governors Association passed the attached policy at their Annu al Meeting in Rhode Island earlier this month The National Governors Assoc iation NGA policy reaffirms the Governors opposition to a legislative pr oposal which would establish federal eminent domain authority over electric ity transmission facilities The Governors also agreed to establish a task force to provide a forum for states the private sector and the Administra tion to examine and discuss ways to ease bottlenecks in the transmission an d energy infrastructure system Late last year the National Conference of State Legislatures NCSL updated its National Energy Policy which was form ally adopted August at its Annual Meeting This policy reinforces its op position to Federal preemption of state authority over electric facility si ting Also at its Annual Meeting NCSL adopted an Energy Regionalism policy that supports states working together to address siting and reliability co ncerns on a regional basis In addition by letter addressed to you dated J uly the NCSL reiterated its strong opposition to federal eminent domain authority for electricity transmission lines And in July the National Association of Counties NACo adopted a Resolution on National En ergy Policy outlining county officials opposition to FERC eminent domain a uthority without the provision of specific requirements that strengthen the role of counties in planning for the siting of these lines The report pre pared for the Western Governors Association entitled Conceptual Plans for Electricity Transmission in the West also provides new avenues for devel opment of transmission facilities Finally as the attached Electricity Po licy Principles document organizations representing virtually every organ ization of state and local officials affected by electricity restructuring have spoken with one voice that the regulation of rights of way necessary f or expanded utility infrastructure should remain with state and local gover nmental officials In short action is occurring at the state and regional levelBefore any decision is made regarding federal siting legislation i ncluding eminent domain authority it should first be established through an independent analysis or study that it is in fact the action or inaction of state and local governments that is preventing electric transmission l ines from being sited Thus far only anecdotal information concerning these purported siting barriers has been conveyed to the Congress and the Admini stration primarily by electric transmission companies and their trade org anizationsWith this in mind the NGA Center for Best Practices has est ablished an Energy Task Force that in collaboration with other state and l ocal organizations will review and make recommendations about siting issue s along with electricity generation and regional market issues We ask tha t you give deference to this Task Force and its recommendations before movi ng forward with any legislative mandates or preemptive language in a legisl ative proposalSections and of S offer both a policy on regi onal coordination and federal support for such efforts This is a good star t worthy of serious consideration and analysis by the Congress However f ederal preemption is a draconian step completely inconsistent with reasonab le views of federalism and energy policy In fact many view the problems t hat have developed in restructuring as primarily failings at the federal le vel Enhanced federal authority in that situation may well be counterproduc tiveAdditionally certain proposals contained in your September draft legislation on electricity issues would unreasonably constrain state effort s to address electricity restructuring by increasing federal authority The proposals for enhanced federal jurisdiction over both bundled and unbundle d transmission services a legislative mandate to participate in RTOs emin ent domain authority for FERC along with several other provisions preempt ing State and local authority limit the important adjudicatory and regulat ory role of State commissions Governors legislators and local elected off icialsIn short we hope to work with you and the Committee to develop re asonable legislative proposals that recognize the unique role of state and local government We want to work with you to help solve problems not crea te new ones In that light we would propose a meeting between state and lo cal representatives and you and your staff as soon as possible We look for ward to meeting at your earliest convenience prior to mark up of the elect ricity title of your legislationThank you for your time and consideratio n in this important matterSincerelyNational Governors AssociationNat ional Conference of State

surprised this was so openly admitted Jennifer NGIs Daily Gas Price Index published June CA Regulators Push Forward on Gas Citing a newfound emphasis on the natural gas in the past eight months California regulators Thursday moved ahead on several key natural gas issues while delaying action on electricity issues that are caught up in concurrent state legislative proceedings The regulators also provided an exemption for rolling blackouts for the major petroleum refineries in the state The regulators authorized Southern California Gas Co to make Bcf of cushion and working gas from its idled Montebello underground storage facility available on the market this summer as part of authorization to proceed with selling the facility based on a settlement that concludes the facility is inefficient costly and in a nonstrategic location Were trying to develop additional sources of capacity storage and supply and the Montebello decision is really going to maximize gas resources this summer said Loretta Lynch CPUC president Traditionally California had only one natural gas peakin the winterbut now what were seeing is a dual peak with one in the summer also So freeing up more storage gas can alleviate any possible price spikes by allowing lowcost gas to be injected into the system just when it is most needed Montebello is an indication of the CPUCs new emphasis on natural gas in the last months in trying to develop additional sources of capacity storage and supply Freeing the cushion gas at Montebello is really good to maximize our instate gas resources this summer In other gas actions the regulators authorized SoCalGas to drill new wells and redesign two other underground storage fields La Goleta in Santa Barbara and Aliso Canyon in the northern end of Los Angeles County In redesigning those two fields there will be many positive consequences in the medium term meaning by the end of this year or early next Lynch said The expansion of the two storage fields will allow Bcf of gas to be reclassified so it can be used as working gas Also other work will lower the fields pressure to improve their performance The CPUC also ordered an investigation of the gas supply buying practices of Las Vegasbased Southwest Gas Corp which serves the high desert and mountain communities east of Los Angeles in which retail gas rates spiked this past winter causing a lot of consumer unrest in the areas around Victorville and Barstow CA about miles northeast of LA Some prospective action on natural gas items was postponed including the longstanding proposed settlements for the unbundling of the SoCalGas transmission and underground storage systems inside the state President Lynch said she now wants to develop an alternate order in the case Regarding the blackout exemption issues Gov Davis earlier in the month urged that the states refineries and ancillary facilities be awarded an exemption based on their critical role in assuring the states public safety and health drawing on a state law that years earlier determined that the petroleum industry is an essential element of the states economy and therefore is of vital importance to the health and welfare of all Californians The state energy commission also requested the exemptions for the refineries which represent about of the combined peak loads of Pacific Gas and Electric Co and Southern California Edison Co The CPUC action exempts the petroleum facilities that have been identified as vital by the energy commission On delaying the direct access vote the five commissioners agreed they need to act quickly but they are split strictly along partisan political lines with the three Democratic Davis appointees favoring a suspension while the two Republican holdovers favor keeping it One of the majority Commissioner Carl Wood argued that a combination of the governors longterm contracts and recently approved qualifying facility QF generation contracts that account for about of the states power supplies could end up being significantly above market meaning customers would have an incentive to flee if they had the choice of directaccess contracts His solution is to keep them captive so they can spread costs to a wider base of customers keeping the impact on individual customers lower In light of that it should be clear that direct access is not really a matter of choice it is a matter of avoiding regulatory decisions about the allocation of the burden of rates Wood said And especially during a time when we have had to raise rates rather steeply we should not be providing avenues of escape that saddle the rest of the customers with the burden of these costs Therefore I think we should put an end to direct access as quickly as possible However Lynch said to accommodate the legislature so it could explore some options in the very short term we are holding the item to the limit of our ability Eventually she said the CPUC must move quickly on direct access to facilitate the California Treasurer moving on the bonds

resplansummaryrecommendationspubgoodshtml Green energy sources seen as ripe for growth By Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer Published Sept Wind and hot water sunshine and rotting garbage They all could keep Californias lights on for a price Around the state more people are beginning to suggest that price is worth paying to help smooth out the ride on the states power roller coaster This week Sacramentos municipal utility will begin hearings on an ambitious year plan that would nearly triple its reliance on nonhydroelectric sources of renewable electric power such as wind farms and solar panels In the Legislature a hotly debated bill would require every power seller in the state to provide increasing amounts of green power rising to percent of their portfolios by That would roughly double current supplies This may be the silver lining of the energy crisis if we can get this passed said state Sen Byron Sher DPalo Alto author of SB More than a dozen states and many nations already have portfolio standards that require each utility or other power venders to provide a set share of electricity from renewable sources The amounts can be as low as percent or percent or as high as partly depending on what gets called renewable Environmental and some consumer groups have embraced the idea saying it would bring a constellation of advantages The air would be cleaner they say Finite resources such as coal natural gas and other fossil fuels would be used more sparingly And in California the state would be a little less vulnerable next time prices sail through the stratosphere for natural gas the chosen fuel for virtually all new power plants But freemarket advocates and some utilities are dubious They worry that a statemandated portfolio standard would drive up prices It could reward inefficiencies in energy sources that are otherwise too expensive to stand on their own And in the push to diversify from natural gas critics of such standards dont want to see the state turn its back on potentially lower cost power sources including coal nuclear power and new large dams Ignoring hydroelectric power is shortsighted and I think not considering nuclear options within the state at least giving it some public hearing is shortsighted said Karal Cottrell a Sacramento Municipal Utility District director It is a debate that will help shape Californias power future and it comes as the state has begun loading up on natural gas plants Just over half of instate electricity production now is fueled by natural gas but that could rise to percent by if all currently proposed gasfired plants are built said Mark Bernstein an energy analyst at RAND Long viewed as relatively cheap and comparatively clean natural gas still could pose risks if it dominates the states power picture We have a very hard time predicting the price of anything particularly energy these days said Bernstein What happens if the pressures on price are so great that they go way up That fear has been sobering for the Sacramento Municipal Utility District whose officials worry the utility might be becoming too dependent on two mainstays hydro power with its risks of short supplies in dry years and natural gas Already considered a leader in renewable power SMUD gets about percent of its electricity from nonhydro renewables In a series of workshops beginning Tuesday it will seek public feedback on a proposed year plan that would raise that amount to percent by and percent by If we commit to this this will be the largest renewable commitment I believe in the state right now General Manager Jan Schori told directors Renewable power would cost more but the benefits in diversification and price stability should be worth it said SMUD planning chief Jim Tracy His proposal calls for spending no more than an extra penny per kilowatthour for renewables At first SMUD plans to expand its Solano County wind farm continue subsidizing solar panels and consider working with the county to expand the Kiefer landfill plant which runs on methane seeping out of rotting garbage That should get the utility close to percent By staffers would return to the board with a study on how to reach the far more challenging second phase boosting green power another percent at a livable price The likeliest costeffective sources so far look like wind and geothermal power said Tracy Thats also the consensus among those who hope the state will pass its own portfolio standard before the Legislature adjourns Friday Wind turbines once disparaged as generating more tax breaks than electricity have become bigger more powerful and far more dependable in the past decade Aided by a federal tax credit they now can supply power at between cents and cents a kilowatthour depending on location according to the American Wind Energy Association At its lower end that makes wind nearly competitive with a new natural gas plant Geothermal power tapped by drilling into underground beds of hot steam or water runs between cents and cents a kilowatthour and could go lower if it too qualifies for the next round of federal credits plant developers say Both sources of power are plentiful in California The state is the th best source of wind in the nation with untapped wind resources along mountain ridges running almost the length of the state Geothermal power already makes up percent of the states supply and could rise by thousands of megawatts with rich beds in the Imperial Valley and elsewhere still not fully tapped By comparison solar power costs more than cents a kilowatthour although it can have special appeal to homeowners living far from power lines or those who want to produce their own electricity Both wind and geothermal could be a shooin economically if natural gas prices float higher said Matt Freedman of the Utility Reform Network a consumer group that usually advocates for lower power costs Today its also one of the biggest lobbyists for a renewable portfolio standard We think the standard is going to save consumers money or in the worst case its like an insurance policy said Freedman I think consumers are willing for that to be part of the mix these days But with only a week left to go Freedman said the enemy of Shers bill is time Thats actually just one of the enemies Others include Sempra Energy parent company of San Diego Gas Electric Co and the California Manufacturers Association which fear it would boost electric rates When a major thrust of the state is to reduce prices as much as possible is this really a good time for this asked Sempra spokesman Ed Van Herik Both Sempra and the Assemblys Republican caucus point out that more than million a year already is collected from consumers electric bills and funneled into a fund that supports renewable energy The portfolio standard could have Californians paying again up to the cents per kilowatthour cap in the bill for power that theyve already helped subsidize they say Renewable energies are becoming more efficient on their own said Assemblyman Dennis Hollingsworth RTemecula To artificially prop them up will stifle that innovation California already gets about percent of its total energy supply including imports from nonhydro renewables and an additional percent from small hydro The state Energy Commission predicts that current programs could boost that to percent by So to Sher author of the renewables bill raising that amount to percent by is actually a modest goal Were well on our way there he said

JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow JonesThe California Assembly is to consider a bill Friday to place a progressive tax on electricity sales in California the second windfall profits tax measure to be heard by legislators in a week Under Assembly Bill XX introduced by Assemblywoman Ellen Corbett DSan Leandro generators wouldnt be taxed on power priced below per megawatthour Prices above MWh would be subject to a gradually increasing tax The first charged by suppliers over the MWh baseline would be taxed at a rate The next would be taxed at Anything higher would be taxed at The tax would be retroactive to Jan and effective through Tax proceeds would be used to fund a state sales tax holiday on the first weekend in December Alternative energy suppliers or qualifying facilities as well as selfgenerators would be exempt from the tax Any excess receipts after the sales tax holiday would be used to provide tax credits to companies for building new generation AB XX will help Californians recoup and regain financial footing in an economy that is changing very quickly said Corbett This measure is a major step for California s recovery from this years disastrous energy crisis If the bill passes the Assembly floor it will move to the Senate for committee and floor votes The legislature is set to adjourn Sept Similar Bill On Assembly Floor Monday A second windfall profits tax bill is likely to be heard on the Assembly floor Monday said a spokesman for the bills sponsor Sen Nell Soto DOntario The bill passed out of the Assembly Appropriations Committee Thursday The bill SB XX would require state regulators to establish a costbased price for electricity for each plant in the state Sellers would be taxed on any sales from a plant that exceeded its costbased price and the money would be used for taxpayer rebates The costbased price would include up to a return on invested capital The tax which would be effective retroactively to Jan would apply to the last sale before electricity hits the power grid and so would include marketers as well as generators Cogeneration facilities and renewable generators would be exempt as would some state municipal utilities The bill has a good chance of passing the Assembly floor since only a majority vote is required and Democrats dominate the Assembly said Soto spokesman Paul Van Dyke Thus far the bill has passed the Senate and various committees in the Assembly on strict party lines If the bill does pass the Assembly floor it would go back to the Senate for concurrence and then to the governors desk to be signed Van Dyke said he did not know which windfall profits tax bill was more likely to pass out of both houses before the legislature adjourns nor whether the two might be cobbled together to form one bill Our bill is two steps from going to the governor the other bill has a ways to go Van Dyke said Sometimes two bills on the same issue will pass and go all the way to the governor and its up to him to choose A spokesman for Gov Gray Davis said last week that he was open to a windfall profits tax bill but would not indicate which bill he might prefer

the end of this article Do you know if they have come out with a formal proposal Would they try to push it via a bill introduced next session January right Thanks GreenEnergy Firms Seek an Outlet imagesstandardblackpixgifPower Generators want to expand but California continues to favor nonrenewable sources of electricity More than a mile beneath the Imperial Valley heat from magma boils a mixture of water salt and minerals into a briny soup Steel piping drilled into the desert floor taps this reservoir The superheated liquid flashes into steam spinning electric turbines that generate a small portion of the power that zips across Southern California Edisons massive transmission grid The steam condenses into water and is injected back below the surface allowing the cycle to start again CalEnergy Co owner of the Imperial Valley plant wants to expand its operation to take advantage of higher wholesale electricity prices and a pending change in the way SCE pays its suppliers of renewable energy Despite public pronouncements about the need to increase the amount of renewable energy supplies actions by state power officials have ensured that at least for the next few years conventional electricity generators will be favored over renewable providers such as CalEnergy When California began buying power this year for insolvent SCE a subsidiary of Edison International and bankrupt PGE Corp unit Pacific Gas Electric at the height of the energy crisis it rejected deals offered by CalEnergy and other renewable suppliers opting instead for longterm contracts with fossilfuel or nonrenewable generators such as Dynegy Inc and Mirant Corp Moreover after taking into account what the big utilities generate and purchase the state bought more electricity than Californias businesses and consumers are likely to use over the next three to four years according to several energy experts and some state power officials In essence the state played it safe and went with the conventional generators at the expense of the renewables despite the promise of renewable energys being immune to the type of natural gas price fluctuations and shortages that contributed to the crisis in the first place according to greenenergy advocates The combination of the states actions has left renewable generators without any way to expand Lenders wont finance new greenpower ventures if the companies dont have customers lined up And the big utilities look to have their needs covered by their own generation existing contracts with CalEnergy and its sister green companies and the power the state has purchased This turn of events comes at a time when the renewable power industrywhich includes wind and solar power as well as generation from geothermal biomass and small hydroelectric projectswas on an upswing After a slump in the mids renewable energy generation has climbed steadily in the state topping gigawatthours last year One gigawatthour can power about homes Encouraged by that growth the California Energy Commission wants to increase renewable energy from of the states consumption now to by One favorable development for greenenergy companies in the long term is expected to be a change in how they are paid which grew out of the way Pacific Gas Electric and SCE plan to resolve their financial problems Before the utilities insolvency payment for most renewable energy was tied to the price of natural gas a key component of conventional electricity generation That system was subject to huge fluctuations depending on whether there was a shortage or surplus of natural gas even though the fossil fuel played no role in renewable energy production During some periods the renewable energy companies earned just pennies per kilowatthour at other times prices were significantly higher Now greenenergy companies will get paid about cents a kilowatthour for the next five years Greenenergy producers which according to conservative estimates make up at least a billion industry in California prefer longterm fixedprice contracts because they provide financial stability and can be used to finance expansion and improvements said Kelly Lloyd chief financial officer of Enxco Inc a Danish company that operates a windenergy farm near Palm Springs And lacking a potential electricity surplus Lloyd said establishment of fixedprice contracts for green energy in the fallout from the energy crisis should have been a positive development for the industry This could be a catalyst to expand Lloyd said But in the near term it looks like there is no room for expansion for anyone Marwan Masri the California Energy Commissions manager of renewable energy acknowledged similar concern But he said some renewable ventures should be able move ahead These projects can last or years he said noting that the states power purchases will peak in the next two to three years and then decline making room for other power providers GreenEnergy Firms Seek New Contract Talks State policy still encourages renewable energy projects Masri said providing about million a year in various incentives The money is raised through a cent monthly fee in residential electricity bills Though the subsidies are helpful they are of little use if the renewable companies cant find customers for their energy Thats why John White executive director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technology in Sacramento would like the state to negotiate its way out of enough of the longterm power purchases to open the market to alternative power ventures If there is not some renegotiation of the longterm contracts the state has signed we fear there will be a greenenergy blackout White said Indeed there already is something close to a greenenergy blackout About of new energy generation in California through will be from natural gasfired plants according to the California Energy Commission Although Gov Gray Davis and S David Freeman chairman of the states power authority have in the past been friendly to green power White said it is their appointees who have thwarted industry expansion And this is taking place as the cost of producing renewable energy is falling Wind power for example has fallen from cents a kilowatthour in the s to about cents a price competitive with other forms of electricity said Masri of the energy commission Davis and Freeman talk the talk when it comes to renewable energy but judging by the actions of the state they have not walked the walk said Jonathan Weisgall spokesman for MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co the parent of CalEnergy Documents obtained by the Los Angeles Times show that state power officials balked at signing renewable energy generators to longterm contracts at a time when they were negotiating with the traditional providers In April MidAmerican offered a year contract to sell megawatts of geothermal generation from the Imperial Valley for cents a kilowatthour Much of the generation would have come from proposed new turbines MidAmerican a subsidiary of Warren Buffetts giant holding company Berkshire Hathaway Inc lowered the price to cents just two weeks later to be competitive with what the state was signaling it was willing to pay conventional generators under longterm contracts MidAmerican eventually lowered the price to cents and changed the lengths of the contracts and output to reduce generation by the end of near the expected peak in the states power purchases In each case various state officials indicated an interest in the proposals but never followed through with a contract Immediate Energy Need Played Role in Rejection Now the company is looking for other customers which are likely to be smaller municipal utilities not affected by the states power purchases We are in the process of trying to expand Weisgall said The biggest problem is trying to find a customer In passing up contracts from MidAmerican and other renewable energy producers state officials said they were focusing on electricity they could lock down quickly to stave off an expected shortage For what we needed at that point in time we needed real megawatts that we could pick up and put into the system said Pete Garris acting deputy director for the California Department of Water Resources the states powerbuying agency It wasnt like were ignoring them or saying theyre not needed An Oct memo from Department of Water Resources Director Thomas Hannigan to Freeman illustrates the problem facing the state Hannigan said the state has only a limited need for new sources of power and that Southern California which is where the MidAmerican energy would have gone already has excess resources This has left the renewable energy companies pondering their next step The state and some of the big generators have talked about revisiting the longterm contracts But with California officials also accusing many of the same companies of pricegouging during the height of the energy crisis no one is predicting the outcome of those proposed talks Another proposal would let greenenergy companies supply energy to residential and small commercial customers under a new direct access plan Direct access in which individuals and companies contract with independent power suppliers for electricity was intended to be a cornerstone of deregulation But the state abandoned direct access when energy prices spiked forcing customers to purchase power from the utilities that serve their areas The Legislature has rejected several efforts to reestablish direct access White is lobbying for a plan that would allow residential and small commercial customers to purchase power directly as long as the providers are renewable energy generators White said such a plan could help the state double the amount of renewable energy resources over years to of the states requirements But it also could add to the states excess energy supplies by reducing demand for the power that the state has contracted to purchase Additionally it could slow the return of Pacific Gas Electric and SCE to solvency The recovery plans for both companies rely on taking the difference between their cost of producing electricity and what they can charge customers to pay off billions of dollars of debts

Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow JonesThe California Assembly is to consider a bill Friday to place a progressive tax on electricity sales in California the second windfall profits tax measure to be heard by legislators in a week Under Assembly Bill XX introduced by Assemblywoman Ellen Corbett DSan Leandro generators wouldnt be taxed on power priced below per megawatthour Prices above MWh would be subject to a gradually increasing tax The first charged by suppliers over the MWh baseline would be taxed at a rate The next would be taxed at Anything higher would be taxed at The tax would be retroactive to Jan and effective through Tax proceeds would be used to fund a state sales tax holiday on the first weekend in December Alternative energy suppliers or qualifying facilities as well as selfgenerators would be exempt from the tax Any excess receipts after the sales tax holiday would be used to provide tax credits to companies for building new generation AB XX will help Californians recoup and regain financial footing in an economy that is changing very quickly said Corbett This measure is a major step for California s recovery from this years disastrous energy crisis If the bill passes the Assembly floor it will move to the Senate for committee and floor votes The legislature is set to adjourn Sept Similar Bill On Assembly Floor Monday A second windfall profits tax bill is likely to be heard on the Assembly floor Monday said a spokesman for the bills sponsor Sen Nell Soto DOntario The bill passed out of the Assembly Appropriations Committee Thursday The bill SB XX would require state regulators to establish a costbased price for electricity for each plant in the state Sellers would be taxed on any sales from a plant that exceeded its costbased price and the money would be used for taxpayer rebates The costbased price would include up to a return on invested capital The tax which would be effective retroactively to Jan would apply to the last sale before electricity hits the power grid and so would include marketers as well as generators Cogeneration facilities and renewable generators would be exempt as would some state municipal utilities The bill has a good chance of passing the Assembly floor since only a majority vote is required and Democrats dominate the Assembly said Soto spokesman Paul Van Dyke Thus far the bill has passed the Senate and various committees in the Assembly on strict party lines If the bill does pass the Assembly floor it would go back to the Senate for concurrence and then to the governors desk to be signed Van Dyke said he did not know which windfall profits tax bill was more likely to pass out of both houses before the legislature adjourns nor whether the two might be cobbled together to form one bill Our bill is two steps from going to the governor the other bill has a ways to go Van Dyke said Sometimes two bills on the same issue will pass and go all the way to the governor and its up to him to choose A spokesman for Gov Gray Davis said last week that he was open to a windfall profits tax bill but would not indicate which bill he might prefer
<10761009.1075851639834.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,jennifer.thome@enron.com,2001-09-10 06:40:35,Article on SB RPS Cc NonPrivilegedpst FYI An overview of the SMUD recommendations referenced in this article can be found at resplansummaryrecommendationspubgoodshtml Green energy sources seen as ripe for growth By Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer Published Sept Wind and hot water sunshine and rotting garbage They all could keep Californias lights on for a price Around the state more people are beginning to suggest that price is worth paying to help smooth out the ride on the states power roller coaster This week Sacramentos municipal utility will begin hearings on an ambitious year plan that would nearly triple its reliance on nonhydroelectric sources of renewable electric power such as wind farms and solar panels In the Legislature a hotly debated bill would require every power seller in the state to provide increasing amounts of green power rising to percent of their portfolios by That would roughly double current supplies This may be the silver lining of the energy crisis if we can get this passed said state Sen Byron Sher DPalo Alto author of SB More than a dozen states and many nations already have portfolio standards that require each utility or other power venders to provide a set share of electricity from renewable sources The amounts can be as low as percent or percent or as high as partly depending on what gets called renewable Environmental and some consumer groups have embraced the idea saying it would bring a constellation of advantages The air would be cleaner they say Finite resources such as coal natural gas and other fossil fuels would be used more sparingly And in California the state would be a little less vulnerable next time prices sail through the stratosphere for natural gas the chosen fuel for virtually all new power plants But freemarket advocates and some utilities are dubious They worry that a statemandated portfolio standard would drive up prices It could reward inefficiencies in energy sources that are otherwise too expensive to stand on their own And in the push to diversify from natural gas critics of such standards dont want to see the state turn its back on potentially lower cost power sources including coal nuclear power and new large dams Ignoring hydroelectric power is shortsighted and I think not considering nuclear options within the state at least giving it some public hearing is shortsighted said Karal Cottrell a Sacramento Municipal Utility District director It is a debate that will help shape Californias power future and it comes as the state has begun loading up on natural gas plants Just over half of instate electricity production now is fueled by natural gas but that could rise to percent by if all currently proposed gasfired plants are built said Mark Bernstein an energy analyst at RAND Long viewed as relatively cheap and comparatively clean natural gas still could pose risks if it dominates the states power picture We have a very hard time predicting the price of anything particularly energy these days said Bernstein What happens if the pressures on price are so great that they go way up That fear has been sobering for the Sacramento Municipal Utility District whose officials worry the utility might be becoming too dependent on two mainstays hydro power with its risks of short supplies in dry years and natural gas Already considered a leader in renewable power SMUD gets about percent of its electricity from nonhydro renewables In a series of workshops beginning Tuesday it will seek public feedback on a proposed year plan that would raise that amount to percent by and percent by If we commit to this this will be the largest renewable commitment I believe in the state right now General Manager Jan Schori told directors Renewable power would cost more but the benefits in diversification and price stability should be worth it said SMUD planning chief Jim Tracy His proposal calls for spending no more than an extra penny per kilowatthour for renewables At first SMUD plans to expand its Solano County wind farm continue subsidizing solar panels and consider working with the county to expand the Kiefer landfill plant which runs on methane seeping out of rotting garbage That should get the utility close to percent By staffers would return to the board with a study on how to reach the far more challenging second phase boosting green power another percent at a livable price The likeliest costeffective sources so far look like wind and geothermal power said Tracy Thats also the consensus among those who hope the state will pass its own portfolio standard before the Legislature adjourns Friday Wind turbines once disparaged as generating more tax breaks than electricity have become bigger more powerful and far more dependable in the past decade Aided by a federal tax credit they now can supply power at between cents and cents a kilowatthour depending on location according to the American Wind Energy Association At its lower end that makes wind nearly competitive with a new natural gas plant Geothermal power tapped by drilling into underground beds of hot steam or water runs between cents and cents a kilowatthour and could go lower if it too qualifies for the next round of federal credits plant developers say Both sources of power are plentiful in California The state is the th best source of wind in the nation with untapped wind resources along mountain ridges running almost the length of the state Geothermal power already makes up percent of the states supply and could rise by thousands of megawatts with rich beds in the Imperial Valley and elsewhere still not fully tapped By comparison solar power costs more than cents a kilowatthour although it can have special appeal to homeowners living far from power lines or those who want to produce their own electricity Both wind and geothermal could be a shooin economically if natural gas prices float higher said Matt Freedman of the Utility Reform Network a consumer group that usually advocates for lower power costs Today its also one of the biggest lobbyists for a renewable portfolio standard We think the standard is going to save consumers money or in the worst case its like an insurance policy said Freedman I think consumers are willing for that to be part of the mix these days But with only a week left to go Freedman said the enemy of Shers bill is time Thats actually just one of the enemies Others include Sempra Energy parent company of San Diego Gas Electric Co and the California Manufacturers Association which fear it would boost electric rates When a major thrust of the state is to reduce prices as much as possible is this really a good time for this asked Sempra spokesman Ed Van Herik Both Sempra and the Assemblys Republican caucus point out that more than million a year already is collected from consumers electric bills and funneled into a fund that supports renewable energy The portfolio standard could have Californians paying again up to the cents per kilowatthour cap in the bill for power that theyve already helped subsidize they say Renewable energies are becoming more efficient on their own said Assemblyman Dennis Hollingsworth RTemecula To artificially prop them up will stifle that innovation California already gets about percent of its total energy supply including imports from nonhydro renewables and an additional percent from small hydro The state Energy Commission predicts that current programs could boost that to percent by So to Sher author of the renewables bill raising that amount to percent by is actually a modest goal Were well on our way there he said

that Commission Wood openly admits that the DWRs contacts may be significantly above market and implies that therefore everyone not just potential DA customers should have to share the burden I was surprised this was so openly admitted Jennifer NGIs Daily Gas Price Index published June CA Regulators Push Forward on Gas Citing a newfound emphasis on the natural gas in the past eight months California regulators Thursday moved ahead on several key natural gas issues while delaying action on electricity issues that are caught up in concurrent state legislative proceedings The regulators also provided an exemption for rolling blackouts for the major petroleum refineries in the state The regulators authorized Southern California Gas Co to make Bcf of cushion and working gas from its idled Montebello underground storage facility available on the market this summer as part of authorization to proceed with selling the facility based on a settlement that concludes the facility is inefficient costly and in a nonstrategic location Were trying to develop additional sources of capacity storage and supply and the Montebello decision is really going to maximize gas resources this summer said Loretta Lynch CPUC president Traditionally California had only one natural gas peakin the winterbut now what were seeing is a dual peak with one in the summer also So freeing up more storage gas can alleviate any possible price spikes by allowing lowcost gas to be injected into the system just when it is most needed Montebello is an indication of the CPUCs new emphasis on natural gas in the last months in trying to develop additional sources of capacity storage and supply Freeing the cushion gas at Montebello is really good to maximize our instate gas resources this summer In other gas actions the regulators authorized SoCalGas to drill new wells and redesign two other underground storage fields La Goleta in Santa Barbara and Aliso Canyon in the northern end of Los Angeles County In redesigning those two fields there will be many positive consequences in the medium term meaning by the end of this year or early next Lynch said The expansion of the two storage fields will allow Bcf of gas to be reclassified so it can be used as working gas Also other work will lower the fields pressure to improve their performance The CPUC also ordered an investigation of the gas supply buying practices of Las Vegasbased Southwest Gas Corp which serves the high desert and mountain communities east of Los Angeles in which retail gas rates spiked this past winter causing a lot of consumer unrest in the areas around Victorville and Barstow CA about miles northeast of LA Some prospective action on natural gas items was postponed including the longstanding proposed settlements for the unbundling of the SoCalGas transmission and underground storage systems inside the state President Lynch said she now wants to develop an alternate order in the case Regarding the blackout exemption issues Gov Davis earlier in the month urged that the states refineries and ancillary facilities be awarded an exemption based on their critical role in assuring the states public safety and health drawing on a state law that years earlier determined that the petroleum industry is an essential element of the states economy and therefore is of vital importance to the health and welfare of all Californians The state energy commission also requested the exemptions for the refineries which represent about of the combined peak loads of Pacific Gas and Electric Co and Southern California Edison Co The CPUC action exempts the petroleum facilities that have been identified as vital by the energy commission On delaying the direct access vote the five commissioners agreed they need to act quickly but they are split strictly along partisan political lines with the three Democratic Davis appointees favoring a suspension while the two Republican holdovers favor keeping it One of the majority Commissioner Carl Wood argued that a combination of the governors longterm contracts and recently approved qualifying facility QF generation contracts that account for about of the states power supplies could end up being significantly above market meaning customers would have an incentive to flee if they had the choice of directaccess contracts His solution is to keep them captive so they can spread costs to a wider base of customers keeping the impact on individual customers lower In light of that it should be clear that direct access is not really a matter of choice it is a matter of avoiding regulatory decisions about the allocation of the burden of rates Wood said And especially during a time when we have had to raise rates rather steeply we should not be providing avenues of escape that saddle the rest of the customers with the burden of these costs Therefore I think we should put an end to direct access as quickly as possible However Lynch said to accommodate the legislature so it could explore some options in the very short term we are holding the item to the limit of our ability Eventually she said the CPUC must move quickly on direct access to facilitate the California Treasurer moving on the bonds
