approfondie concernant cette affaire Elle dispose de quatre mois compter de la prsente dcision pour prendre une dcision finale Amelia TORRES Michael TSCHERNY IPedf Brussels Octobre Commission opens indepth investigation into the joint control of EnBW by EDF and OEW The European Commission has decided to undertake a full second phase investigation of the proposed transaction by which Electricit de France EdF and Zweckverband Oberschwbische Elektrizittswerke OEW Germany acquire joint control over Energie BadenWrttemberg EnBW The Commission considers that the proposed jointventure raises serious doubts as it woul d remove a potential competitor to EdF on the French electricity market EDF is a wholly stateowned company whose principal activities are generation transmission distribution and supply of electricity in France It is the operator of the national transport grid EDF has shareholdings in electricity companies in many European countries Austria Belgium Italy Luxembourg Netherlands Portugal Spain Sweden Switzerland and the Unite d Kingdom Outside of France EDF is also active in electricity trading through EDF Trading Ltd which is jointly controlled by EDF and SA LouisDreyfus Cie Furthermore EDF is active in the construction operation and maintenance of electrical plants and power networks and provides waste recycling and street lightening services OEW is an association of nine public districts in the Southwest of Germany Its main purpose is to hold shares in companies active in the energy sectors EnBW is a vertically integrated electricity utility active in electricity generation transmission distribution and supply of electricity mainly in the Southwest of Germany Furthermore EnBW has activities in electricity trading Other business activities comprise the supply of gas and district heating telecommunication waste recycling and financial services On the basis of the information available to date the mergers primary effects will be felt on the French market EdF is by far the largest electricity generator in France The company has a monopoly in supplying final customers with electricity According to the French electricity laws which took effect in the year as a result of the implementation of the Electricity Directive aiming to liberalise the European electricity markets industrial customers with consumption in excess of GWhyear per site have the choice of their electricity supplier EnBW which has its supply area along the FrenchGerman border can be considered as potential entrant into the French electricity market approaching eligible customers The Commission accordingly has serious doubts about the operations compatibility with the common market in as much as the transaction could lead to the elimination of a potential competitor entering the French market The Commissions enquiries also gave grounds for concern on further closure effects of the French market that could be exercised by commonlyheld participations of EdF and EnBW in Swiss electricity operators which could enter the French market The Commission has accordingly decided to undertake a full investigation of the case It has a further four months from the date of that decision in which to make a final decision Amelia TORRES Michael TSCHERNY IPedf Brssel Oktober Kommission erffnet eingehende Untersuchung betreffend die Kontrolle von EnBW durch EdF und OEW Die Europische Kommission hat beschlossen die vertiefte Untersuchung der zweiten Phase betreffend ein Vorhaben zu erffnen mit dem Elecricit de France EdF und Zweckverband Oberschwbische Elektrizittswerke OEW die gemeinsame Kontrolle ber Engergie BadenWrtemberg EnBW zu erwerben beabsichtigen Fr die Kommission wirft dieses Vorhaben erhebliche Bedenken auf da hiermit ein potenzieller Wettbewerber auf dem franzsischen Strommarkt wegfallen wrde EdF ist eine vollstndig vom franzsischen Staat gehaltene Gesellschaft deren Hauptttigkeit die Stromerzeugung bertragung verteilung und endversorgung in Frankreich ist EdF ist Betreiberin des franzsischen Stromnetzes und hlt Beteiligungen an Stromerzeugern in Tsterreich Belgien Italien Luxemburg den Niederlanden Portugal Spanien Schweden der Schweiz und dem Vereinigten Knigreich Auerhalb von Frankreich ist EdF auch im Stromhandel ber EdF Trading Ltd ttig eine gemeinsam von EdF un d SA LouisDreyfus und Cie kontrollierte Gesellschaft Schlielich beteilig t sich EdF an dem Bau der Nutzung und Wartung von Stromnetzen und anlagen und erbringt Dienstleistungen bei der Verwertung von Abfllen und der Reinigung OEW ist ein Verband von neun Gebietskrperschaften in BadenWrtemberg die im Wesentlichen Anteile an Gesellschaften im Energiesektor hlt EnBW ist eine vertikal integrierte Stromerzeugungsgesellschaft der berwiegend in Sdwestdeutschland Strom erzeugt bertrgt verteilt und Endabnehmer versorgt Auerdem ist sie im Stromhandel ttig Zu ihren anderen Wirtschaftsttigkeiten zhlen die Versorgung mit Gas und Fernwrme die Telekommunikation die Abfallverwertung und Finanzdienstleistungen Nach den vorliegenden Informationen werden die Auswirkungen des Zusammenschlusses hauptschlich auf dem franzsischen Markt sprbar sein EdF ist der bei weitem wichtigste Stromerzeuger in Frankreich und hlt ein Monopol bei der Versorgung der Endabnehmer Nach den im Zuge der Richtlinie ber die Liberalisierung der Elektrizittsmrkte in Europa erlassenen und i m Verlauf des Jahres in Kraft getretenen franzsischen Gesetzesvorschriften knnen gewerbliche Kunden die je Standort mehr als GWhJahr Strom abnehmen ihren Lieferanten frei whlen EnBW dessen Versorgungsgebiet an Frankreich grenzt kann als potenzieller Zugnger auf dem franzsischen Markt der in Betracht kommenden Abnehmer angesehen werden Die Kommission hat deshalb ernsthafte Zweifel an der Vereinbarkeit dieses Vorhabens mit dem Gemeinsamen Markt da es zum Wegfallen eines potenziellen Wettbewerbers in Frankreich fhren knnte Die Untersuchung der Kommission hat auch Bedenken hinsichtlich der Abschottung des franzsischen Marktes aufgrund der von EdF und EnBW an bestimmten schweizerischen Stromunternehme n gehaltenen Beteiligungen ergeben die ebenfalls als potenzielle Zugnger zu m franzsischen Markt angesehen werden knnen Die Kommission hat deshalb beschlossen die vertiefte Untersuchungsphase in dieser Sache einzuleiten Sie verfgt ber vier Monate ab dem Datum

to reap its reward In FORTUNEs annual survey of the Most Powerful Women in Business there is a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly Says FORTUNE senior writer Pattie Sellers in Patient But Not Passive the story that accompanies the list By patience we mean staying with a company steadily building influence there and rising to power through determination and insider knowledge not promises and selfpromotion Fiorina who has claimed the top spot each year since FORTUNEs inaugural list in heads the biggest company billion in revenues last year run by a woman And she is still as audacious and impatient as ever Wall Street practically heckled her latest movea bold bet to buy Compaqbut Fiorina remains defiant In difficult times people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny she says As always the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time Last year power resided in the technology and Internet sectors but that influence was fleeting Gone from the list this year Deborah Hurricane Debby Hopkins who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at Lucent and lost her CFO job in May Ellen Hancock who failed at the startup Exodus and Morgan Stanleys Mary Meeker who influenced so many to buy into the Internet fizz But one Web warrior looks better than ever Meg Whitman No on the list She has never overpromised to investors instead she has diligently delivered

Raytheon While the economy and its points of power change the criteria we use to evaluate power remains the same Says Sellers We consider the size and importance of a womans business in the global economy her clout inside her company and the arc of her careerwhere she has been and where she is likely to go When appropriate we also weigh the womans influence on mass culture and society That factor lifts Oprah Winfrey to No on this years list The shifts on our list this year are dramatic with newcomers But one trend is especially intriguing Women are taking on bigger businesses than ever A few years ago responsibility for a billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list No more This years FORTUNE includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of billion or more which is a first In a related story It Took a Lady To Save Avon Katrina Brooker looks at Andrea Jung Chairman and CEO of Avon Says Brooker Jung knows what women want and how to sell
