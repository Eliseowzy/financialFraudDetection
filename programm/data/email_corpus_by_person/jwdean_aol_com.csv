<27891116.1075862096378.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,jwdean@aol.com,2001-09-14 06:47:23,Sample JD EnergyMichael Attached is a sample JD Energy monthly Emissions Allowance Price Forecast edited from our August publication A couple of quick comments You actually would be able to subscribe for yr instead of the full price because Enron already subscribes to some of our coal work The Monthly publication as you will notice often focuses heavily on interpreting shortterm events and placing them into a context for the next few years The Quarterly publication which forecasts for the longerterm obviously spends more time on market and cost fundamentals I will send you a Background Paper we did on NOx some time ago to give you a flavor of how we address the more technical issues indepth We had originally only sent this one out hard copy because we often use a large number of diagrams and other tables that dont always reproduce well but you will be able to get an idea of these papers from what I send you This year we are sending out all of our Background Papers in PDF Finally as I mentioned on the phone we encourage our clients to call us with questions and comments ranging from looking for specific information to simply brainstorming different scenarios Finally I make a point to get to see all of our clients in person each year and do not charge anything extra for an onsite presentation at a mutually agreeable time I look forward to hearing your reaction to our forecasting service Thanks again for your interest Best Regards John Dean JD Energy Inc Watersville Road Mt Airy MD Fax
