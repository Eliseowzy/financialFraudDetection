was August The actually delivery amount was metric tonnes a the cargo was loaded rd October ECAP is incorporated in Australia The deal was negotiated by our Harry Papadopoulos and the contract signed here in Sydney by myself Heidi Mason under delegated authority from Stuart Staley My delegated authority is based on Stus prior approval which in this case was received via email on th September We have a copy of the contract here in Sydney but as the coal was bought under LC and such LC was issued out of London all shipping documentation for this load was forwarded to London to the attention of

NRONDEVELOPMENT David MinnsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Wayne CT Robert CT Richard B CT Becky NRON Subject PT Kaltim Rima Coal v AES Barbers PointThirdparty subpoena on Enron Coal Company PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEYCLIENT COMMUNICATION ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCTURGENT Harry Heidi and David The abovereferenced lawsuit is filed in the Southern District of New York by PT Kaltim Rima Coal who allegedly had a longterm coal purchase agreement with AES Barbers Point for delivery to AES in Hawaii In brief PT contends that AES breached that agreement through the use of a bogus force majeure letter in order to allow AES to purchase coal from some Enron entity at a cheaper spot market price in September or October of this year PTs attorneys Lord Bissell Brook out of Chicago have served us with a subpoena on Enron Coal Company How they decided that Enron Coal Company was the correct entity is not something I yet know I have been advised that Enron Coal Company is a longdormant subsidiary of Enron Property Although using Enron Coal Companys name throughout the subpoena also references Harry Riaz Rizvi Allen Childress Stuart Staley andor John Bowman I understand that we probably did do a deal maybe more than one with AES but need to be corrected if I am wrong The subpoena requests that a corporate representative for Enron Coal Company appear with documents on January in Houston to be deposed about the deal with AES I would like to respond tomorrow by telefax to PTs attorneys and advise that Enron Coal Company is the wrong company If all I do is stall them however they can yank the information from us the hard way assuming that we did do the deal in question and eventually get what they want The suit is for about so it is worth the while of PTs attorneys to pursue this subpoena Accordingly I need one of you to tell me as soon as possible whether a we did such a deal with AES during the relevant time frame and if so the exact name of the Enron entity on the deal b who the trader on the deal was and c who has the documents regarding the deal Although I have briefly described the information I need I also need to get the name of the right person to telefax the subpoena to for review to see how broad the scope of the request for documentswitnesses really is I would greatly appreciate this preliminary information by the close of business tomorrow

CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEYCLIENT COMMUNICATION ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCTURGENT Harry Heidi and David The abovereferenced lawsuit is filed in the Southern District of New York by PT Kaltim Rima Coal who allegedly had a longterm coal purchase agreement with AES Barbers Point for delivery to AES in Hawaii In brief PT contends that AES breached that agreement through the use of a bogus force majeure letter in order to allow AES to purchase coal from some Enron entity at a cheaper spot market price in September or October of this year PTs attorneys Lord Bissell Brook out of Chicago have served us with a subpoena on Enron Coal Company How they decided that Enron Coal Company was the correct entity is not something I yet know I have been advised that Enron Coal Company is a longdormant subsidiary of Enron Property Although using Enron Coal Companys name throughout the subpoena also references Harry Riaz Rizvi Allen Childress Stuart Staley andor John Bowman I understand that we probably did do a deal maybe more than one with AES but need to be corrected if I am wrong The subpoena requests that a corporate representative for Enron Coal Company appear with documents on January in Houston to be deposed about the deal with AES I would like to respond tomorrow by telefax to PTs attorneys and advise that Enron Coal Company is the wrong company If all I do is stall them however they can yank the information from us the hard way assuming that we did do the deal in question and eventually get what they want The suit is for about so it is worth the while of PTs attorneys to

answers to your queries re the AES shipment Please do not hesitate to contact Harry or I if you need further information David Minns our inhouse counsel is actually on vacation until nd January and is not on email during this time You may also be interested to know that we understand Glencore a fellow Australian coal trading company has received a similar subpoena re trading with AES during this period Enron Coal Asia Pacific Pty Ltd ECAP was the counterparty to this deal ECAP sold to AES approx metric tonnes of coal as per the contract signed th September The effective date of the agreement was August The actually delivery amount was metric tonnes a the cargo was loaded rd October ECAP is incorporated in Australia The deal was negotiated by our Harry Papadopoulos and the contract signed here in Sydney by myself Heidi Mason under delegated authority from Stuart Staley My delegated authority is based on Stus prior approval which in this case was received via email on th September We have a copy of the contract here in Sydney but as the coal was bought under LC and such LC was issued out of London all shipping documentation for this load was forwarded to London to the attention of Claire Veijou and Cornelia Luptowitsch London office also issued the invoice to AES on behalf of ECAP and this was done by Rebecca Millerchip or Maya Beyhem Also for your information Harrry has prior travel plans that put him in China on the date of the hearing While these could be changed it would be less than desirable Will it be necessary for the trader to be the Enron rep who appears on behalf of the company or could it ideally be someone from Houston or London if needs be simply because this is a long way to go for one appearance John Bowman has resigned from Enron since the time this deal was done and therefore we have not advised him of this action With thanks Heidi Mason Chief Financial Officer Enron Australia Britt NRON AM To Harry PapadopoulosENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Heidi MasonENRON
