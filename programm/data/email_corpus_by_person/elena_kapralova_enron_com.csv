<30346496.1075859885329.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,elena.kapralova@enron.com,1999-05-27 12:25:00,Product Descriptions and Legal Issues Cc Bob following our phone conversation I am sending you the latest version of the Product Descriptions I attached Houston product descriptions as well Could you please review them both and let me know ASAP which format is preferable and any other comments you may have Also weve been working with lawyers on Enabling agreement that will be signed with counterparties offline The current structure is One page Internet Trading Access Agreement ITAA will be signed off line as prerequisite for getting a password Five page long Electronic Trading Agreement ETA will be accepted clicked through on the Website by each person authorised by the counterparty I attached here both documents for two jurisdictions UK and USA There are two important issues that require your input in the US document lawyers refer to services UK lawyers were not sure what it means and replaced it with access and utilisation of the Website assuming that what it is They asked to confirm whether it is correct or anything else we have to include Mark could you please advise on this On the Data protection issue UK lawyers wrote the following On reflection it will be more appropriate for relevant data protection wording to be on the Website itself rather than in the ITAA or ETA This is because the data protection concerns revolve around data subjects ie living individuals rather than corporate entities such as the Counterparty Before providing appropriate wording for this could you please let me know what information will be collected by you concerning living individuals either intentionally or unintentionally For example when a password is entered will you be able to identify a living individual by this or can you intentionally or unintentionally obtain that individuals email address or other information on them once they have entered the Site Again your prompt reply is appreciated Thank you Elena
<3716257.1075859885853.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,elena.kapralova@enron.com,1999-06-09 07:26:00,Legal Meeting June all these are the issues from the last legal meeting that need further attention European Jurisdictions Peculiarities Slovenia Cpoatia Romania must be added to Phase reviews Products that considered are gas and power both physical and financial Jurisdictions reviews are already received So far they do not reveal any fundamental problems with the overall structure There are few recommendations on the wording of PAA ETA and GTC to come CC Tim Hueges is summarising all the replies and will forward a list of problematic issues for each jurisdictions by Monday th lunch time Possible complications are All documents for French and Spanish customers may need translation into French and Spanish as part of these jurisdictions requirements Sweden and Italy have particularly strict regulations on checking validity of signatures it may need to be reflected in the business processes It was suggested to have PAA on the screen as well so that potential customers may print them out fill in and mail to Enron Read Only Access for some customers instead of ETA read only customers have to click on Read Only Agreement therefor it has to be drafted ASAP Product Descriptions A decision was made that they will be reviewed by internal legal team Justin Boyd Mark Taylor but not CC or SC Timetable GTCs in English should be finalised by the end of June First two weeks of July CC will spend validating marketing data Project timetable was promised to CC to be emailed yesterday Translation Translation of GTCs ETA and PPA will be done internally The first priority languages most likely will be French German and Spanish Actions Translations of those GTCs that we already have must be started ASAP Justin Boyd to coordinate Identify languages to translate into Elena Kapralova to coordinate with Justin and traders Taxes Questionnaires similar to the one that was sent to European jurisdictions must be sent to Canada Janine Juggins to coordinate Web Page Wording The words I accept and Delete in the box that appears after a customer clicked on price are to be changed into Submit and Clear Lawyers are comfortable with this Different Entities on Counterparty Side If there are a few different entities trading for the same company for ex Morgan Stanley International MSI and Morgan Stanley MS they should be treated in the system as two separate clients and be granted two separate System Administrator passwords This is necessary for tax considerations It is confirmed once again that there will be one ETA acceptance click per System Administrator Authorisation Risk Because Online Trading will be Enrons software all problems arising from authorisation errors for ex when customer that was supposedly authorised to trade only UK Gas was able to trade power will be entirely Enrons liability it highlights again an importance of very thorough testing of authorisation functionality of the system in July and August Written and Electronic Confirmations It appears to be a difference between UK and US practices in treating superiority of written vs electronic confirmations According to the UK law an electronic confirmation will overwrite a paper one generated and mailed by the Back Office similar to the current practice for transactions done over the telephone when phone conversation overwrites all paper conformations In the US the situation is opposite For the deals done over the phone written confirmations still take priority over the phone conversation tape In Texas anything that is not in writing is not enforceable The situation with priority of confirmations of Online trades in US must be investigated further Mark Taylor to coordinate The result should be reflected in US version of ETA This leads to a further question whether sending written confirmations in UK is still necessary UN ECommerce Directive There is a daft of UN Directive on ecommerce which currently has very strict rules regarding time when transaction is considered complete It requires mutual exchange of written confirmations etc Enron might be in position to lobby few items in this Directive Justin and Regulatory Dept Suspending Trades by Counterparty A few traders are very keen on being able to suspend trades by counterparty for instance in a situation when they see a counterparty making a number of deals in the same commodity It arises two issues IT the system should be able to put a name of the counterparty on the transaction summary page bottom of the price page Legal CC has to investigate and give a view whether it is permitted by law Price Check Idea Just a thought whether it is technically possible to amend a price check the one done when the customer submitted a price and database does credit GTC and price check in a way that customer is notified about the price change not for all changes but only when the price has moved against Enron ie if price moved in Enrons favour transaction should go forward at the price customer had agreed to earlier Legally it is OK Jay can the system do it Internal Issues still to be addressed Global Liquids Books management ie how responsibilities for price update will be managed between London and Houston desks FX conversion including IT business processes tax risk managment issues David Port Janine Juggins Jay Webb All comments are welcome Regards Elena

must be signed by the customer System Admin in the other company may be a Trader as well I assume and in addition it depends on this company internal policy how theyll manage ETA acceptance process Thank you for your comments decision about which alternative to choose for unknown customers has not been made yet Louise Re Marketing Pack Rahil is working on it David Port and Arfan are developing the forms First draft of Customer Registration form is attached herewith Enron Capital Trade Resources Corp Europe From Robert Campbell To Elena CT cc Louise CT Jay CT David CT Mark CT Paul CT Justin CT Rahil CT Subject Re Registration Process Questions Elena Some queriescomments Existing Enron Customers approx The first person from the customers company logging Online has to accept ETA After that ETA has to be available for viewing and printing for all other users The first person logging on will always be the Administrator to set up his users so how can a probable nontrading user accept ETAs for his traders PA Password Application right Hadnt heard of this until now Unknown Customers currently not trading with Enron willing to get Trading Access Alternative most closely mirrors what were doing for our existing customer base and so the procedures will already be in place for EOL Product Control System Admin to run this If the marketing pack mailing method is utilised we cut down on extra effort in a number of areas marketing pack will be signed off by legal business processes already there no extra development effort single point of reference Any chance of seeing what format the marketing pack application is in so far Well need to make sure that the information were requesting is comprehensive enough from a systems perspective Thanks Bob Elena Kapralova PM To Louise CT Jay CT Robert CT David CT Mark CT Paul CT Justin CT Rahil CT cc Subject Registration Process Questions Last two days showed that there is a big confusion on how exactly the registration process is going to work The issue is very important and urgent as it may cause changes to the scope for Agencycom and changes in the ETA and PA documents text The registration process appears to differ for different customer groups and to my understanding the latest was agreed as below Please provide your comments or any corrections to the following Existing Enron Customers approx will receive marketing Pack via mail approx weeks before the system goes live The Marketing Pack will include PA for an appropriate jurisdiction and Registration Forms with questions about the customer name address email taxable entity etc customers will fill in Registration Form sign PA and mail it back to Enron After the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron it will receive IDs and Passwords that customers Administrator will grant to individual traders in that company The first person from the customers company logging Online has to accept ETA After that ETA has to be available for viewing and printing for all other users Q Will PA be available as well as ETA for viewing and printing in the House Guest Users also referred to as Read Only Users Regulators Lawyers Brokers Potential Traders etc will phone or sent email possibly fill in a form online that will be automatically emailed to Enron System Administrator Customers will provide info on their name email address mailing address country of incorporation etc If Enron approves the customer as a Guest user the System Administrator will email customer Guest ID and Password When the customer logs in for the first time as a guest itll have to accept Read Only ETA on line Read Only ETA will depend on the guests place of incorporation ie the system has to recognise the customer when it logs in and display an appropriate Read Only ETA Without accepting Read Only ETA Guest user wont be able to view anything in the House Q Should Read Only ETA be printable and where What limitations will be imposed on the Guest User ie one log in session limited time etc This decision has to be made in order for CC to put an appropriate language into the Read Only ETA Read Only ETAs for all jurisdictions have to be finalised by July th In the Garden there must be a sentence to be drafted by CC to inform potential Guest User that his request for Read Only access may not be granted Is Read Only ETA accepted online or it should be signed and mailed back to Enron as a hard copy The latest agreed was that it will be signed off line but accepting it online should work as well and seems to be a cleaner way Unknown Customers currently not trading with Enron willing to get Trading Access There are two alternatives possible Alternative One Off Line Registration Potential Customer will email phone to express their willingness to trade online ie get the ID and Password Enron will mail Registration Pack to the Potential Customer with PA for appropriate jurisdiction Customer will fill in Registration Form sign PA and mail it back to Enron If the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron it will receive IDs and Passwords that customers Administrator will grant to individual traders in that company The first person from the customers company logging Online has to accept ETA After that ETA has to be available for viewing and printing for all other users Alternative Two Partial OnLine Registration Registration Pack including PAs for all jurisdictions will be available in the Garden Customer has to chose drop down box which jurisdiction he is in print out appropriate Registration Pack and PA fill in Registration Form sign PA and mail it to Enron If the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron it will receive IDs and Passwords that customers Administrator will grant to individual traders in that company The first person from the customers company logging Online has to accept ETA After that ETA has to be available for viewing and printing for all other users Q Alternative or In the Garden there must be a sentence to be drafted by CC to inform potential customers that there request for Read Only access may not be granted Should all ETAs and PAs be available and printable in the Garden CC prefers them to be available Regards Elena
