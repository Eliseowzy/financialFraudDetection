DWDM Enron Communications Description Building A Better Backbone And Business Plan Detail By Carol Wilson tive Week September AM PT The numbers are staggering Six major new national fiberoptic networks will come on line during the next two years at a cost of billion Those new networks are in addition to those already built and operated by the Big Three of longdistance ATT MCI WorldCom and Sprint Thousands of miles of fiberoptic cable are being installed in ducts to which new fiber can be easily added by companies such as Enron Communications Frontier Communications IXC Communications Level Communications Qwest Communications International and Williams Communications And thats just a piece of the story While competition in the backbone network business is booming new technologies coming into the market will make it much easier to increase bandwidth available on any fiberoptic network tenfold or more Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing DWDM systems now exist to put data traffic onto different wavelengths on a single fiberoptic cable Technology exists today to enable each of those wavelengths to transport gigabits per second of data Within two years that will reach gigabits per wavelength per second In effect the backbone of the Internet is being rebuilt The next step Recover all those costs of construction says analyst Peter Bernstein at Infonautics Consulting And that step may be more difficult than building the networks themselves The combination of major new network construction and new technology for adding network capacity has led industry analysts and executives to predict a bandwidth glut that is likely to drive down prices in backbone transport of data much as the price of longdistance telephony has plummeted in the past few years Frontier Communications admitted as much earlier this year when its secondquarter earnings werent up to expectations Rather than a free fall in prices however expect the market to quickly find new ways to use bandwidth both in terms of networkbased applications and bigger backbone networks to support the rapidly growing field of faster access via Digital Subscriber Line DSL and cable modems The challenge for network operators is to create new business models that capitalize on something other than cheaper bandwidth I think the danger isnt so much of a glut as a lack of planning for the backbone network that could cause some major problems says Claudia Bacco an analyst at TeleChoice who studies the development of DSL Once DSL starts selling as a volume service it will very quickly increase the demand for bandwidth in the backbone Service providers need to have planned ahead Its not surprising then to see a growing number of alliances between the new backbone builders and the competitive local exchange carriers CLECs that have been building DSL networks in major markets across the US Qwest invested in both Covad Communications and Rhythms NetConnections for instance and a third data CLEC NorthPoint Communications includes Enron Frontier and Level among its strategic partners That doesnt mean however that all of the companies investing billions in burying fiberoptic cable stand to reap rich rewards cautions Bernstein at Infonautics The problem isnt a glut of bandwidth but a glut of service providers he says If everyone has the same business model and is going after the same customers thats a problem In addition there are timing issues If you build it they will come but not necessarily when you need them to At least nine players have built or are building national fiberoptic backbone networks These look very similar says Fred Harris director of network planning and design at Sprint There are generally three EastWest routes and three or four NorthSouth routes that everyone builds he says New York to San Francisco Atlanta to Los Angeles Seattle to Boston everybody has fiber either in or near those corridors In earlier network deployments the fiber was buried never to be exhumed But todays fiber cables go into ducts allowing fibers to be pulled out or slid in later Capacity can be added without any backhoes Todays newer fiberoptic cable from companies such as Corning and Lucent Technologies is designed to support higher transmission speeds without the light dispersion problems that limited speeds or distances on other fiberoptic cables DWDM technology and optical amplifiers which boost the power of a lasers signal over a given wavelength enable bandwidth to be added and allow signals to travel farther without the need for as many repeaters to boost signals along the way Eliminating repeaters in a longdistance network wrings out installation maintenance and power costs As Harris points out if every company building a national backbone has fibers along each major route and each fiber can carry different wavelengths of light thats more than different signals Today most of those signals would be powered by Synchronous Optical Network SONET gear which operates at gigabits per second but a growing number have moved up to gear that operates at Gbps Both Lucent and Nortel Networks have announced equipment that supports wavelengths on a single cable and other vendors will have similar equipment within the next two years Also coming into the market by will be new SONET gear that quadruples the current transmission rates from Gbps to Gbps MCI WorldCom is testing these systems known as OC transmission systems and expects to have one commercially available by early says Rama Nune senior manager of optical and data network technology development Nune stresses however that whats more important than having all the bandwidth is knowing how to intelligently provision services over it and manage it New Models Not surprisingly most of the newer network operators have quickly moved to talking about services not bandwidth There are exceptions to this Enron is building a network that transmits Internet Protocol IPbased traffic directly over a fiberoptic network with no intervening transport systems or protocols But its network is built to provide backbone bandwidth for Internet service providers and content providers says Stan Hanks vice president of research and technology at the company At Level falling backbone service prices would be good news says spokesman David Powers We want to drive prices down by reducing the underlying cost of the network he says We think we can do it because we are building a greenfield network that doesnt have the cost of legacy technology like circuit switches Most other network operators are looking to add services to their mix including Web hosting to create a differentiated service MCI WorldCom through its UUnet subsidiary Frontier Qwest and others have announced Web hosting services Greater bandwidth and lower prices also will enable new video services to be delivered over the Internet says Vab Goel vice president of IP engineering and technology at Qwest One of the things Qwest is doing is building its own access rings in major markets Goel says We think this network will drive cost down and increase performance for valueadded applications which can be delivered over an IP network Today most video is compressed With faster access speeds you can watch TV shows over the Internet This becomes interesting when you talk about having access to any TV show broadcast anywhere around the globe In addition to enabling new services however the sudden availability of bandwidth will dramatically change the way services are priced and sold Its the next great challenge of the Internet deciding how you are going to bill customers and what they will be willing to pay for analyst Bernstein says Im not sure anyone knows yet Part of that challenge is matching a service that customers value with the need to recover the high costs of expanding a network George Gilder likes to say that bandwidth will be free well putting in channels of OC Gbps transmision isnt free it costs billions Sprints Harris says And the same thing goes when you build up the local copper network to do DSL or cable modems Already however DSL prices are dropping to to per month for a consumer service that offers up to megabits per second Businesses still typically pay to per month for higherspeed services that offer the same bandwidth in both upload and download modes That compares very favorably to the per month most companies paid for a T line until the past two years But with customers assuming bandwidth will be cheap how will nine backbone network providers recover their billions in investment I dont have a crystal ball says Nune at MCI With the access speeds going up whether it be ADSL Asymmetric DSL or gigabit Ethernet we anticipate many rich applications to drive the bandwidth of our customers Providing those applications or at least building into the network the right hooks for new services is the best hope for building a new revenue base Harris agrees There will still be room for charging higher rates as well for levels of reliability and transmission speeds says Qwests Goel but those charges will likely be packaged as part of the application cost In a world where everyone has access to the same technology it will be the business issues that ultimately decide who succeeds at building and sustaining the backbone of the next Internet
