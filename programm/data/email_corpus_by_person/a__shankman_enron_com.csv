<11506620.1075861374283.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,a..shankman@enron.com,2001-11-20 11:01:17,Cc As you guys go through working up a severance program I started thinking about some equity issues If the average tenure of an employee at Enron is about years why not come up with plans for long serving employees who have been long dedicated to the company and a second one for the more recently hired It doesnt make sense to me that someone who has been here under a year at base should be entitled to weeks even before they sign the waiver I would also not change the program in whatever form you ultimately settle on for the longer serving employees rather just scale back the program for the newer employees Regards Jeff
