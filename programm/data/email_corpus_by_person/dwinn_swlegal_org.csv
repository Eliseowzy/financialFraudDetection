<1486834.1075852458749.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,dwinn@swlegal.org,2001-10-16 08:31:37,FW Thoughts in Preparation for Special SWLF Meeting Cc For your consideration in preparation for Fridays meeting David Original Message From Bradford G Keithley mailto Sent Tuesday October AM To David Winn Cc Patrick H Martin Jim Armour Stuart Hollimon Tim West Janice Hartrick Subject Thoughts in Preparation for Special SWLF Meeting In anticipation of this Fridays meeting I thought I it might be useful to synthesize my thoughts on the Membership Committee report As you did with the responses on the Program Committee questionnaire please feel free to circulate these thoughts as appropriate I have copied these thoughts directly to the members of the Membership Committee Jim Stuart Tim and Janice if I have left anyone out I apologize in advance The general outline of the Committees report is great and I commend the Committee for its efforts I support expanding the scope of the Center moving to a simplified dues based membership and rotating with some modification the membership of the Executive Committee I have some concerns with some of the specifics inside that broad outline however a My perspective is somewhat parochial I am concerned primarily about preserving the Center as a vibrant forum for oil gas lawyers I concur in the recommendation of the Membership Committee to expand the scope of the Center to include a broad segment of the energy industry but we should be careful to find a way to do so which does not impair the ability also to maintain focus on specific segments of the industry As a way of accomplishing this goal my thought would be to provide for separate practice groups eg committees within the Center for oil gas power energy marketing trading emt and coal nuclear energy mining and possibly others There would be no limitation on belonging to more than one practice group As a side note this would actually serve to increase Jones Days participation because we would have separate lawyers on each committee who might not otherwise participate if we did not provide an opportunity for such pluralism b As part of the effort at maintaining pluralism my thought also is to provide for a seat on the Executive Committee for the chair of each practice group This would help avoid the potential that the Center might become dominated as occurred for example with the old SONREEL by one group or another To assist in institutionalizing the diversity the Executive Committee would be composed of the officers the chairs of the various committees program membership information etc and the chair of each practice group In order to preserve the rotation anticipated by the Membership Committee recommendations the chairs of the committees and practice groups could be limited to two year terms They would stay on the Executive Committee once their term as chair expired only if selected to an officer position within the Center The initial terms of the practice group chairs could be staggered so that not every chair would rotate off at the same time In order to provide maximum opportunity for participation in leadership positions the term of the officers could be set to a year c I think it is also important as a part of maintaining pluralism to ensure that the individual practice groups rather than an overall Program Committee serve as the primary focus for the development and presentation most of the Centers programs In other words the oil gas practice group would be responsible for the Annual Oil Gas Institute the power practice group would be responsible for developing an Annual Power Institute and so on This would ensure that the Centers programs remain responsive to the individual interests of the practice areas rather than become tilted in one direction or another The practice groups could decide to put on joint programs with each other and each year the overall program committee chair would decide whether to put on one or more overall programs such as an Introduction to Energy Law program d While I would leave it to the individual practice groups to decide on the location and length of the Institutes I must admit that I am uncomfortable with going to a oneday Annual Oil Gas Institute I think that such an approach would limit the ability of the chairs to provide quality programming and would limit the attractiveness of the programs Thinking personally for a moment I would be less inclined to incur the travel dollars or to authorize the travel dollars of others in the Firm if they are only going to buy a oneday program If we are going to incur CLErelated travel dollars especially to remote sites such as Calgary or London my view is that the bigger bang credits for the buck the better e Finally as a potential contributor I want to make certain that the significant contributors have some continuing role in the operation of the Center even if they dont have a representative on the Executive Committee I think that the Advisory Committee is well placed to serve that function To that end I would suggest that the Advisory Committee be composed of former officers in the manner suggested by the Membership Committee report plus a member designated by every companyfirm stepping up to a given dues level Unlike the Executive Committee the members of the Advisory Committee other than those participating in their status as former officers should not be required to rotate A companyfirm can maintain its same delegate to the Advisory Committee for as long as it desires This would preserve some continuity and also not interfere with decisions made by those bodies maintaining financial commitments to the Center Anyway these are my thoughts I look forward to the discussion Friday The

<1766404.1075861420326.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,dwinn@swlegal.org,2001-11-27 10:00:43,Rogers Award Ceremony Sponsorship Cc To the Executive Committee Ted has advised that Exxon Mobil prefers that the sponsors for the Rogers Award ceremony reception and dinner not be drawn solely from firms which represent Exxon Mobil I intend to contact as many as three firms which do a substantial amount of work for Exxon Mobil Fulbright Akin Gump and Baker Botts but I need to identify one or two other sponsors for the event which will be held at the Petroleum Club of Houston February The total financial sponsorship we seek is which should almost cover the direct out of pocket costs of the event So the amount of contributions needed which should be equally shared among the cosponsors will be each if we go with only two sponsors or if we go with three cosponsors or if we go with four cosponsors Please advise me ASAP this week whether your firm or organization is interested in cosponsoring the event this year in any of the above amounts The reason Id like to hear from you this week is that Id like to include recognition of the sponsors in the Institute brochure if possible and it is about ready to go to the printer To help you discuss the possibility of sponsorship with your partners further info about the Rogers Award and the benefits of sponsorship follows below In the last two years the ceremony has been a gala affair in the evening on the first night of the Institute including a reception and dinner instead of the Institute luncheon event of prior years As in prior years attendance at the ceremony was included in the tuition for the Institute so all Institute attendees were invited to attend without further cost and most of them did Since membership on our Advisory Board includes tuitionfree attendance at the Institute all Advisory Board members are also invited to attend the ceremony without charge and many of them did Attendees have been invited to bring spouses or other guests but there has been a charge for guests In we honored Sir John Browne at the Hall of State in Dallas the reception was sponsored by Jones Day which contributed for the reception In we honored Ken Lay at the Institute of Texan Cultures in San Antonio the reception was sponsored by Vinson Elkins which contributed for the reception The actual out of pocket expense for the entire event was over This year as you know we are endeavoring to make the Oil and Gas Institute including the Rogers Award ceremony like all CAIL programs selfsufficient financially Attendance at the award ceremony will again be included in the Institute tuition and all Advisory Board members will again be invited to attend costfree as well Because we are honoring Lee Raymond we want to continue the recent tradition of presenting the award at a gala evening event Accordingly wed like to obtain sponsorships for the Rogers Award ceremony reception and dinner this year of For their financial contribution sponsoring firms will get a sponsorship recognitionpublicity at the Rogers Award event in the form of a welcome sign in the written event program and orally from the podium b sponsorship recognition in literature at the Institute and probably oral announcements from the Institute podium c recognition in our annual list of contributors to the Institute for Energy Law how does that new name sound to you in our CAIL annual report and d the right to invite several guests to the event in addition to the firms attorneys who may already be attending the Institute Id like to also include e recognitionpublicity in the Institute brochure which will be mailed to about attorneys nationwide To get this additional recognition in the brochure however as I said we need to confirm the sponsors this week hence my request to hear from you if you are interested ASAP ideally today or tomorrow so Ill have time to line up the other cosponsors before the publication deadline As our Membership Committee advised at the October meeting many firms welcome sponsorship opportunities such as this as good marketing for the firm In this case it is also an opportunity to help celebrate Lee Raymonds outstanding career in the oil and gas industry to help continue the Annual Institutes tradition of excellence in oil and gas law education and to help the Institute for Energy Law grow into its new name Though not mandatory I would hope that the sponsors will either be or become members of the Institute for Energy Law In short please let me know ASAP if your firm or organization is willing to cosponsor the Rogers Award ceremony this year On two related matters Im happy to report that Strasburger Price has offered to sponsor the Deans of Oil and Gas Practice Lecture Luncheon on Friday this year in the amount of thanks Stuart and Jones Day Reavis Pogue has offered to sponsor as an experiment for the Institute a networking lunch no speaker on Thursday in the amount of thanks Brad Im also happy to report that the Institute program and faculty this year are excellent and that the program will again include several new features developed by the Institute cochairs thanks Brad and Jack Sorry for making this request at the last minute but Id like to see the sponsors recognized in the Institute brochure as well as in the other ways mentioned and I also want to get the brochure to the printer this week I certainly understand if this is too short notice to get the necessary approvals so quickly If we cant get the necessary sponsors identified this week well go ahead and print the brochure without this recognition and the sponsors will receive our recognition and thanks in the other ways mentioned Thanks much David

Message From MARK D CHRISTIANSEN mailto Sent Tuesday October AM To Cc David Winn Subject Re Membership ReportFriday Meeting In preparation for our meeting this Friday I wanted to describe my concerns with regard to one particular aspect of the Membership Committee report The issue that I am the most concerned about is the idea of forced rotation and limited terms on the Advisory Board To state up front the conclusion I try to explain below in what is admittedly too long of an explanation that probably tries to anticipate too many of the likely counterconcerns I would favor keeping in place the part of our current Advisory Board structure that enables key industry leaders as well as the same representative from a duespaying organization to remain in place on the Board for as long as both they wish to serve and they are providing sufficient personal time or financial support or both to provide value to the Center I do not oppose the removal of Advisory Board members who are providing neither service to the Center nor financial supportunless the staff of the Center advise that the appearance on our Advisory Board list of the names of certain key industry leaders has been of material value to the Center in recruiting involvement of others without regard for whether the former actually work on or financially support projects of the Center The underlying bias and beliefs from which my concerns arise are as follows While others may have reached the opposite conclusion I think the longtime participation in the SWLFs leadership by some of the top leaders in the oil and gas industry without forced rotation has been a key asset and has greatly benefitted the Center While the list of key leaders runs much longer than this I would note just by way of example that Sheila Hollis Jim Hardwick and Stuart Hollimon from the private practice sector Pat Martin and John Lowe from the academic sector and Ted Frois Ken Dickerson and Jim Derrick from the General Counsel sector are some of the individuals who have occupied leadership roles in the Foundation for about as long as I have followed its activities closely One of the attributes which caused me to want to become actively involved in this group was the observation that the SWLF had a group of key leaders in the industry who seemed to have embraced this organization as one in which they would make a longer term commitment and investment If we had a large group of new and effective leaders who were out there wanting to be involved in the leadership of the Center and if the continued participation by those who have been active for a number of years was somehow blocking these newer people out of leadership roles we might have a situation that needs to be addressed However the staff of the FoundationCenter have taken the lead in making sure that we have the opposite situation During the past or so years I have seen David Ellwanger David Winn and Mark Smith provide as much encouragement and as much of an open door as anyone could provide and they have indeed made a point to aggressively recruit active participation by those who show any inkling at all of maybe being slightly inclined to become active in this group Any new players who have wanted to become active are both encouraged to do so and are given leadership opportunities very quicklyand much more quickly than any other organization in which I have been involved Our current system is one which eagerly welcomes new participant leaders and the staff of the Center and a number of the Centers leaders have been making efforts for years to encourage participation by new leaders If we have a shortage of new leaders in the Center it is not due to a system or organization that discourages such participation because there are too many of us who have joined the leadership in the past years who can attest that this group welcomed early leadership participation as quickly as any group in which we have ever been involved Rather any shortage of new leader participants is due to other factors such as the declining number of oil and gas attorneys and the need to develop program content and a broader range of activities that will attract broader participation among other sectors of the energy industry that are growing instead of shrinking I have been involved in organizations that have had a forced rotation and up and out system and it has not worked well where there is not a continuing supply of new people who want to work hardnot just take on the name of the office and do nothing but actually work hardin carrying forward the initiatives of the organization While in theory the former hardworking and talented leaders are still welcome to remain active in a nonleadership capacity after they complete their cycle the general experience is that these leaders move on and choose to spend their energy with other organizations that still offer them leadership roles The ABA Section of Environment Energy and Resources has an up and out system John Lowe used to be the head of that Section John has not been active in that group since he completed his tenure as Section Chair and I think the Section is worse off for it I expect that Sheila Hollis the current Chair will be likely to greatly reduce the portion of her energies that the ABA receives when she completes her tenure as Chair and the ABA will be worse off for that as well And the ABA with this system has often had great difficulty finding energy lawyers who are willing to take on leadership roles and really work for the organization I think the ABA would be better off at least in the energy area if whenever they find an energy law leader who will work hard they hold on to that person as long as she or he will serve while still finding room for service in other leadership capacities for any new energy leaders who come along from time to time The up and out system may work in a satisfactory way for the State Bar of Texas because the Oil Gas and Mineral Law Section Council is relatively small in size and the State of Texas uniquely will always have enough new oil and gas attorneys who want to have those positions on their resume that there will always be a supply of new hardworking people to fill the positions of the outgoing officers of that Council However I am concerned that the Center has a much more limited supply of ongoing new hardworking leaders to take over under an up and out system I am betting that we would continue to do better with the current system that keeps the type of individuals named above around in leadership roles as long as they are willing to actively serve while quickly making room on the Board and other committees for new attorneys who show an interest in becoming leaders in the Center That is the approach that has been followed in recent years and it sure looks to me to be the better approach for this organization than any of the alternatives that have been discussed
