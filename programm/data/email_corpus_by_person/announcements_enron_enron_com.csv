coworkers On one desk an employee finds a note that reads Im not gone dont take my stuff Forgotten behind the headlines of smoking guns Aspen ski homes and shredded documents are almost employees who work on Enrons power plants and pipelines USA TODAY is the first to get a tour inside Enron since its collapse late last year and spend time with Stephen Cooper the new chief executive talking about his vision for the future On the th floor of executive suites decorated with rich carpets and velvetcovered chairs there is a sweeping view of Houston a city Enron helped shape with its philanthropy political donations and corporate muscle Cooper however is only focused on saving part of the company His plan faces monumental challenges In his words Everybodys betting against us While many American corporate icons have filed for Chapter bankruptcy protection in the past year Kmart Polaroid Bethlehem Steel the size speed and sordid details of Enrons collapse have sparked numerous investigations and lawsuits angered creditors demoralized employees and ruined its reputation But Cooper whose firm Zolfo Cooper worked on the troubles of such companies as Polaroid Sunbeam and Federated Department Stores is adamant Enron can emerge healthy from bankruptcy within a year Ive probably been in more Chapter s than anybody in the United States literally he says This company by way of business and asset base by way of management team by way of predictability of its future business has more of all of that than most distressed businesses Ive ever seen Coopers plans The company already has sold the energytrading business that was once considered its crown jewel to UBS Warburg Although a bankruptcy court and Enrons creditors must first approve any moves Coopers plans include Enron will likely have to give up this skyscraper for a more modest habitat Cooper says The companys new million building across the street from headquarters also is for sale Even Enrons name blazoned across the top of the nearby Major League Baseball stadium is going to have to go Out of the ashes there ought to be something everyone can be proud of a year or two or three from now he says Today the company still has a pipeline network that stretches from Canada to California and from Texas to Florida And Cooper is betting that business can power the light at the end of the tunnel He wants to keep the North American and South American pipelines and power plants and sell or shut down the rest of the companys businesses including its broadband network water utilities and the like That will mean cutting an additional to off Enrons payroll and returning the company to its natural gas pipeline roots of the s But to pull off his plan Cooper must not only sway his critics including giant Wall Street creditors but also motivate thousands of devastated employees Cooper and Enron President Jeff McMahon have one of the toughest jobs in business to keep the people there and keep them motivated says John Whitney a turnaround expert and professor at Columbia University To lock in key executives Enron offered million in retention bonuses Former Enron executives who went to UBS Warburg as part of the sale of the energytrading business also pocketed multimilliondollar payoffs And Coopers pay The New Yorkbased consulting firm Zolfo Cooper will receive million a year plus million for each of the eight executives he brought with him to Houston If Enron emerges from bankruptcy Coopers firm will get a million fee If Enron is liquidated Cooper will get a fee agreed upon by the creditors and court according to a filing in US Bankruptcy Court in New York Shattered morale Enrons fall from grace has shattered employee morale Its just so sad says one current employee who spoke on condition of anonymity On several floors it looks like the rapture It looks like people disappeared into space Theyre just gone This employee just two years away from retirement watched in retirement savings shrink to zero with Enrons stock price Now Im going to have to work as a greeter at WalMart until Im the employee says Its gone I just cant make it back Jorge Garcia a project controls manager laid off in December says his friends still at Enron say You can tell if youll be let go soon by your office accommodations If youve been moved to a cubicle you probably wont last long That kind of stress takes its toll Downstairs in the company gym Kathy Kissner a massage therapist says that as the company fell apart employees would call begging for any open appointment or even just five minutes between appointments Ive lost pounds in the last six months from long hours and lack of sleep says Mark Palmer vice president of communications Cooper knows his employees have been hurt financially and emotionally Its the hardest part of his job When people are looking at the prospect of losing enormous amounts of money they often times get heated They get emotional and upset he says Its never fun to be at the receiving end but Ive gotten used to it Blast voice mail To motivate the employees he is trying to focus them on future goals People have two choices We can spend all of our time living in the past which is a crazy way to spend your life You cant change it Or we can begin to move beyond the disappointment and the upset and the loss to focus on the future he says And he has opened up lines of communication Once a week he sends out a lengthy voice mail telling employees what has happened during the past week explaining management changes and timetables When employees call or send him email he will go find them in the building to answer their questions And next month he will hold a meeting with all of the employees in Houston to explain the details of his strategy to bring the company out of bankruptcy This kind of candid communication is essential he says We are not trying to eliminate bad news We are not trying to make it just good news What we are trying to do is to eliminate uncertainty he says People can live with either one of those good or bad What they cant live with is uncertainty And while some still say Enrons future is uncertain Cooper is certain of one thing The lives and reputations of people shouldnt be trash canned because a handful of geniuses decided to run wild he says People ought to keep in perspective that weve got a lot of really tremendous people here and for the sake of a couple bad apples we shouldnt blowtorch the entire field PHOTOS BW Michael Stravato Caption In Houston Turnaround CEO Stephen Cooper says

has slowed at the coffee shop on the ground floor of one Enron building No sweat The fitness center at Enron no longer gets as much of a workout by employees Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved Financial Desk The Nation Acting CEO Plans Legal Assault Amid Effort to Salvage Enron Litigation Those who helped fell the energy giant would be targeted Stephen Cooper says NANCY RIVERA BROOKS TIMES STAFF WRITER Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company HOUSTON Enron Corp is planning a broad legal assault against those who helped bring the company down according to acting Chief Executive Stephen Cooper the corporate rescue artist who was selected three weeks ago to put the company back on the road to solvency Cooper said in an interview that the litigation would be extensive and rapid although he declined to identify specific targets Enron may have causes of action against institutions and individuals that could represent a meaningful asset for the estate said Cooper a principal with Zolfo Cooper a New York consulting firm that specializes in corporate restructuring I think you will see something sooner as opposed to later The players were many in what has become a lurid corporate morality play and all are potential defendants Enron filed the largest Chapter bankruptcy in US history Dec following a series of damaging disclosures of questionable transactions with partnerships controlled by company employees The nations seventhlargest company collapsed less than seven weeks after it disclosed losses tied to the offthebooks partnerships wiping out billions of dollars in investor wealth and more than jobs An internal investigation by three Enron directors determined that abuses in accounting of partnership transactions masked at least billion in recent losses while a few company employees reaped millions of dollars in personal profits Directors and executives including former Chairman Kenneth L Lay and former Chief Executive Jeffrey K Skilling failed to curb the missteps of subordinates the report concluded It also pointed to poor advice from Andersen Enrons auditor and Vinson Elkins one of its outside law firms Still Sorting Out All the Issues Cooper who occupies Skillings old office on the th floor of Enrons mirrored office tower in downtown Houston said the company has not asked any former employees to repay the millions of dollars they earned from partnership transactions That would include former Chief Financial Officer Andrew S Fastow former Enron Global Finance executive Michael Kopper and former Treasurer Ben F Glisan I think that the recovery vehicle in the main will be litigation Cooper said Cooper and his team are still sorting out issues related to Enrons financial statements and the value of its trading book the contracts that were not included in the recent sale of its energy trading operation Since Enron filed for Bankruptcy Court protection the value of those contracts has eroded to about billion from about billion I certainly dont believe at this particular point in time that anybody is engaging in transactions that arent completely above board Cooper said We will be presenting to the creditors committee on a regular basis our financial statements which I believe in the main will be accurate Enron has not yet hired a new auditor to replace Andersen which it fired Enron already has filed a billion lawsuit against Dynegy Inc alleging that its crosstown rival withdrew from a proposed merger with Enron in late November as part of a plan to wreck the ailing company Dynegy has said it pulled out of the merger because Enron misrepresented the depths of its financial problems and lost its investmentgrade credit rating The Enron that Cooper envisions will look much different from the marketdominating energy trader that Lay and Skilling built The name will change and the company will focus on its natural gas pipelines and power plantsthe kind of hard assets Skilling said he disdained Coopers style too is unlike Lays grandfatherly and professorial demeanor and Skillings harddriving image Cooper insists on being called by his first name and dresses casually at the office complete with baseball cap He hasnt decorated Skillings woodpaneled deadbolted office To keep up employee morale Cooper said he visits workers in response to email and sends out weekly unscripted voicemail updates An allemployee meeting will be held soon he said Enrons overhaul is well underway Enron has agreed reluctantly to turn over to Dynegy its biggest pipeline mile Northern Natural Gas which was a condition of the billion that Dynegy invested in Enron as part of the aborted merger Enron also recently gave away its vaunted energytrading operation to New York investment banking firm UBS Warburg in a nocash deal that would supply Enron with a cut of any future profit What remains is an assortment of smaller natural gas pipelines including one that runs from Texas to California and electricity generating plants Enron has announced plans to shut down its remaining telecommunications operations and to unload Portland General its Oregon utility as well as many of the international power plants and other assets whose poor performance helped sink the company Cooper declined to detail which assets he is thinking of unloading because we havent settled on a final configuration yet But it will be substantially smaller by way of reported revenue than the old Enron The company if you remove the trading from the rest of the business its actually got a very good very solid very revenue and cashflow and earningspredictable business which is really its power and pipes business Cooper said So in my view there is an eminently reorganizable entity here Not Going to Wallow and Linger Cooper expects to present a fairly onpoint direction for reorganization to its creditors committee in the second quarter and to have settled on a new version of the company within a year Were going to move this process forward very quickly Were not going to wallow and linger in Chapter for a day longer than we have to Although many have speculated that Enron will never emerge from bankruptcy and will instead be carved up and sold Cooper said he is not of that mind adding that in his year career of reorganizing companies he has seen only a few instances in which liquidation made more sense for creditors than reorganizing the ongoing business Those cases all involved substantial amounts of valuable real estate he said Enron has a bit of that Although it leases its Houston headquarters Enron is building a tower nearly as tall next door It has received million in debtor financing to complete and sell that project Cooper flatly states that he is not interested in doing a postmortem on Enron but he did acknowledge the very laborintensive process of sorting through hundreds upon hundreds of socalled special purpose entities which are financial vehicles commonly used by corporations to finance projects separate from the companys balance sheet and for other legitimate purposes such as a sale and leaseback of a building Lawyers and accountants are examining the entities to determine the extent of Enrons liabilities and the economic value to Enron of each vehicle he said A team of about Zolfo Cooper employees an unusually large number is being assigned to Enron Cooper said Theres a difference between were the partnerships legitimate or not versus were they accounted for properly or not Both of these are being looked at Well just have to wait to see what the attorneys say as that gets sorted out Cooper said Special purpose entities are not good or bad theyre just instruments or vehicles which provide companies with financial flexibility to better manage their business to better manage their balance sheet to fit the needs of their business Cooper said The Enron phenomenon was the failure to transfer economic risk from Enron to the partnerships and the failure to disclose and the suspension of the corporate code of ethics and conduct that allowed people to get into a position where they had divided loyalties by working for both Enron and the partnerships he said What we saw here was a case where they werent constructed properly they werent reported properly and by allowing someone to be on both sides of the transaction you couldnt have really an armslength transaction Its kind of like having you negotiate both sides of a prenuptial agreement Despite its size the Enron reorganization is much like every other he has handled Cooper said Those included Federated Department Stores Inc Polaroid Corp and Malden Mills Unique to Enron however is the furor surrounding the rapid and stunning collapse of the business Cooper said Its become an enormous lightning rod for not only the upset of people directly involved in the company but its become a lightning rod to coalesce all of these other national interests involving such issues as accounting and corporate governance Cooper said I hope people will be able to relax and calm down and look at this as an opportunity for a fresh start for our external economic constituencies a fresh start by way of an investment and a fresh start for our employees Cooper said Its sort of like when your car breaks down and youre in the middle of nowhere and you end up hating the car Youre kicking the tires Youre kicking the bumpers After you get over it you realize that its still a good car You get the tire or whatever fixed and you just keep going PHOTO

Wednesday Feb The Good Morning America piece will be kicked off with a live feed from the Enron Building tomorrow morning at am CST Check local listings for the air time of World News Tonight While there is no guarantee that these stories will be glowing pieces about Enron the interest by ABC in running a positive story is encouraging We wanted to let you know about these stories before they air Additionally two articles featuring interviews with Interim CEO Steve Cooper ran yesterday in USA Today and the Los Angeles Times We are forwarding them to you for your information Thank you for your support as we work to turn the tide of media coverage and public perception of Enron and its employees MONEY New Enron CEO turns company focus to future While workers cope with loss and uncertainty Noelle Knox USA Today FINAL B Copyright HOUSTON Inside Enron headquarters employees walk by stacks of moving boxes as they scrounge for pens and Postit Notes from the empty desks of their laidoff coworkers On one desk an employee finds a note that reads Im not gone dont take my stuff Forgotten behind the headlines of smoking guns Aspen ski homes and shredded documents are almost employees who work on Enrons power plants and pipelines USA TODAY is the first to get a tour inside Enron since its collapse late last year and spend time with Stephen Cooper the new chief executive talking about his vision for the future On the th floor of executive suites decorated with rich carpets and velvetcovered chairs there is a sweeping view of Houston a city Enron helped shape with its philanthropy political donations and corporate muscle Cooper however is only focused on saving part of the company His plan faces monumental challenges In his words Everybodys betting against us While many American corporate icons have filed for Chapter bankruptcy protection in the past year Kmart Polaroid Bethlehem Steel the size speed and sordid details of Enrons collapse have sparked numerous investigations and lawsuits angered creditors demoralized employees and ruined its reputation But Cooper whose firm Zolfo Cooper worked on the troubles of such companies as Polaroid Sunbeam and Federated Department Stores is adamant Enron can emerge healthy from bankruptcy within a year Ive probably been in more Chapter s than anybody in the United States literally he says This company by way of business and asset base by way of management team by way of predictability of its future business has more of all of that than most distressed businesses Ive ever seen Coopers plans The company already has sold the energytrading business that was once considered its crown jewel to UBS Warburg Although a bankruptcy court and Enrons creditors must first approve any moves Coopers plans include Enron will likely have to give up this skyscraper for a more modest habitat Cooper says The companys new million building across the street from headquarters also is for sale Even Enrons name blazoned across the top of the nearby Major League Baseball stadium is going to have to go Out of the ashes there ought to be something everyone can be proud of a year or two or three from now he says Today the company still has a pipeline network that stretches from Canada to California and from Texas to Florida And Cooper is betting that business can power the light at the end of the tunnel He wants to keep the North American and South American pipelines and power plants and sell or shut down the rest of the companys businesses including its broadband network water utilities and the like That will mean cutting an additional to off Enrons payroll and returning the company to its natural gas pipeline roots of the s But to pull off his plan Cooper must not only sway his critics including giant Wall Street creditors but also motivate thousands of devastated employees Cooper and Enron President Jeff McMahon have one of the toughest jobs in business to keep the people there and keep them motivated says John Whitney a turnaround expert and professor at Columbia University To lock in key executives Enron offered million in retention bonuses Former Enron executives who went to UBS Warburg as part of the sale of the energytrading business also pocketed multimilliondollar payoffs And Coopers pay The New Yorkbased consulting firm Zolfo Cooper will receive million a year plus million for each of the eight executives he brought with him to Houston If Enron emerges from bankruptcy Coopers firm will get a million fee If Enron is liquidated Cooper will get a fee agreed upon by the creditors and court according to a filing in US Bankruptcy Court in New York Shattered morale Enrons fall from grace has shattered employee morale Its just so sad says one current employee who spoke on condition of anonymity On several floors it looks like the rapture It looks like people disappeared into space Theyre just gone This employee just two years away from retirement watched in retirement savings shrink to zero with Enrons stock price Now Im going to have to work as a greeter at WalMart until Im the employee says Its gone I just cant make it back Jorge Garcia a project controls manager laid off in December says his friends still at Enron say You can tell if youll be let go soon by your office accommodations If youve been moved to a cubicle you probably wont last long That kind of stress takes its toll Downstairs in the company gym Kathy Kissner a massage therapist says that as the company fell apart employees would call begging for any open appointment or even just five minutes between appointments Ive lost pounds in the last six months from long hours and lack of sleep says Mark Palmer vice president of communications Cooper knows his employees have been hurt financially and emotionally Its the hardest part of his job When people are looking at the prospect of losing enormous amounts of money they often times get heated They get emotional and upset he says Its never fun to be at the receiving end but Ive gotten used to it Blast voice mail To motivate the employees he is trying to focus them on future goals People have two choices We can spend all of our time living in the past which is a crazy way to spend your life You cant change it Or we can begin to move beyond the disappointment and the upset and the loss to focus on the future he says And he has opened up lines of communication Once a week he sends out a lengthy voice mail telling employees what has happened during the past week explaining management changes and timetables When employees call or send him email he will go find them in the building to answer their questions And next month he will hold a meeting with all of the employees in Houston to explain the details of his strategy to bring the company out of bankruptcy This kind of candid communication is essential he says We are not trying to eliminate bad news We are not trying to make it just good news What we are trying to do is to eliminate uncertainty he says People can live with either one of those good or bad What they cant live with is uncertainty And while some still say Enrons future is uncertain Cooper is certain of one thing The lives and reputations of people shouldnt be trash canned because a handful of geniuses decided to run wild he says People ought to keep in perspective that weve got a lot of really tremendous people here and for the sake of a couple bad apples we shouldnt blowtorch the entire field PHOTOS BW Michael Stravato Caption In Houston Turnaround CEO Stephen Cooper says the company probably will have to give up its main building and its new one in the background Core business Kenneth Wagoner works in the gas pipeline control center in Houston Fewer customers Business has slowed at the coffee shop on the ground floor of one Enron building No sweat The fitness center at Enron no longer gets as much of a workout by employees Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved Financial Desk The Nation Acting CEO Plans Legal Assault Amid Effort to Salvage Enron Litigation Those who helped fell the energy giant would be targeted Stephen Cooper says NANCY RIVERA BROOKS TIMES STAFF WRITER Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company HOUSTON Enron Corp is planning a broad legal assault against those who helped bring the company down according to acting Chief Executive Stephen Cooper the corporate rescue artist who was selected three weeks ago to put the company back on the road to solvency Cooper said in an interview that the litigation would be extensive and rapid although he declined to identify specific targets Enron may have causes of action against institutions and individuals that could represent a meaningful asset for the estate said Cooper a principal with Zolfo Cooper a New York consulting firm that specializes in corporate restructuring I think you will see something sooner as opposed to later The players were many in what has become a lurid corporate morality play and all are potential defendants Enron filed the largest Chapter bankruptcy in US history Dec following a series of damaging disclosures of questionable transactions with partnerships controlled by company employees The nations seventhlargest company collapsed less than seven weeks after it disclosed losses tied to the offthebooks partnerships wiping out billions of dollars in investor wealth and more than jobs An internal investigation by three Enron directors determined that abuses in accounting of partnership transactions masked at least billion in recent losses while a few company employees reaped millions of dollars in personal profits Directors and executives including former Chairman Kenneth L Lay and former Chief Executive Jeffrey K Skilling failed to curb the missteps of subordinates the report concluded It also pointed to poor advice from Andersen Enrons auditor and Vinson Elkins one of its outside law firms Still Sorting Out All the Issues Cooper who occupies Skillings old office on the th floor of Enrons mirrored office tower in downtown Houston said the company has not asked any former employees to repay the millions of dollars they earned from partnership transactions That would include former Chief Financial Officer Andrew S Fastow former Enron Global Finance executive Michael Kopper and former Treasurer Ben F Glisan I think that the recovery vehicle in the main will be litigation Cooper said Cooper and his team are still sorting out issues related to Enrons financial statements and the value of its trading book the contracts that were not included in the recent sale of its energy trading operation Since Enron filed for Bankruptcy Court protection the value of those contracts has eroded to about billion from about billion I certainly dont believe at this particular point in time that anybody is engaging in transactions that arent completely above board Cooper said We will be presenting to the creditors committee on a regular basis our financial statements which I believe in the main will be accurate Enron has not yet hired a new auditor to replace Andersen which it fired Enron already has filed a billion lawsuit against Dynegy Inc alleging that its crosstown rival withdrew from a proposed merger with Enron in late November as part of a plan to wreck the ailing company Dynegy has said it pulled out of the merger because Enron misrepresented the depths of its financial problems and lost its investmentgrade credit rating The Enron that Cooper envisions will look much different from the marketdominating energy trader that Lay and Skilling built The name will change and the company will focus on its natural gas pipelines and power plantsthe kind of hard assets Skilling said he disdained Coopers style too is unlike Lays grandfatherly and professorial demeanor and Skillings harddriving image Cooper insists on being called by his first name and dresses casually at the office complete with baseball cap He hasnt decorated Skillings woodpaneled deadbolted office To keep up employee morale Cooper said he visits workers in response to email and sends out weekly unscripted voicemail updates An allemployee meeting will be held soon he said Enrons overhaul is well underway Enron has agreed reluctantly to turn over to Dynegy its biggest pipeline mile Northern Natural Gas which was a condition of the billion that Dynegy invested in Enron as part of the aborted merger Enron also recently gave away its vaunted energytrading operation to New York investment banking firm UBS Warburg in a nocash deal that would supply Enron with a cut of any future profit What remains is an assortment of smaller natural gas pipelines including one that runs from Texas to California and electricity generating plants Enron has announced plans to shut down its remaining telecommunications operations and to unload Portland General its Oregon utility as well as many of the international power plants and other assets whose poor performance helped sink the company Cooper declined to detail which assets he is thinking of unloading because we havent settled on a final configuration yet But it will be substantially smaller by way of reported revenue than the old Enron The company if you remove the trading from the rest of the business its actually got a very good very solid very revenue and cashflow and earningspredictable business which is really its power and pipes business Cooper said So in my view there is an eminently reorganizable entity here Not Going to Wallow and Linger Cooper expects to present a fairly onpoint direction for reorganization to its creditors committee in the second quarter and to have settled on a new version of the company within a year Were going to move this process forward very quickly Were not going to wallow and linger in Chapter for a day longer than we have to Although many have speculated that Enron will never emerge from bankruptcy and will instead be carved up and sold Cooper said he is not of that mind adding that in his year career of reorganizing companies he has seen only a few instances in which liquidation made more sense for creditors than reorganizing the ongoing business Those cases all involved substantial amounts of valuable real estate he said Enron has a bit of that Although it leases its Houston headquarters Enron is building a tower nearly as tall next door It has received million in debtor financing to complete and sell that project Cooper flatly states that he is not interested in doing a postmortem on Enron but he did acknowledge the very laborintensive process of sorting through hundreds upon hundreds of socalled special purpose entities which are financial vehicles commonly used by corporations to finance projects separate from the companys balance sheet and for other legitimate purposes such as a sale and leaseback of a building Lawyers and accountants are examining the entities to determine the extent of Enrons liabilities and the economic value to Enron of each vehicle he said A team of about Zolfo Cooper employees an unusually large number is being assigned to Enron Cooper said Theres a difference between were the partnerships legitimate or not versus were they accounted for properly or not Both of these are being looked at Well just have to wait to see what the attorneys say as that gets sorted out Cooper said Special purpose entities are not good or bad theyre just instruments or vehicles which provide companies with financial flexibility to better manage their business to better manage their balance sheet to fit the needs of their business Cooper said The Enron phenomenon was the failure to transfer economic risk from Enron to the partnerships and the failure to disclose and the suspension of the corporate code of ethics and conduct that allowed people to get into a position where they had divided loyalties by working for both Enron and the partnerships he said What we saw here was a case where they werent constructed properly they werent reported properly and by allowing someone to be on both sides of the transaction you couldnt have really an armslength transaction Its kind of like having you negotiate both sides of a prenuptial agreement Despite its size the Enron reorganization is much like every other he has handled Cooper said Those included Federated Department Stores Inc Polaroid Corp and Malden Mills Unique to Enron however is the furor surrounding the rapid and stunning collapse of the business Cooper said Its become an enormous lightning rod for not only the upset of people directly involved in the company but its become a lightning rod to coalesce all of these other national interests involving such issues as accounting and corporate governance Cooper said I hope people will be able to relax and calm down and look at this as an opportunity for a fresh start for our external economic constituencies a fresh start by way of an investment and a fresh start for our employees Cooper said Its sort of like when your car breaks down and youre in the middle of nowhere and you end up hating the car Youre kicking the tires Youre kicking the bumpers After you get over it you realize that its still a good car You get the tire or whatever fixed and you just keep going PHOTO

support as we work to turn the tide of media coverage and public perception of Enron and its employees MONEY New Enron CEO turns company focus to future While workers cope with loss and uncertainty Noelle Knox USA Today FINAL B Copyright HOUSTON Inside Enron headquarters employees walk by stacks of moving boxes as they scrounge for pens and Postit Notes from the empty desks of their laidoff coworkers On one desk an employee finds a note that reads Im not gone dont take my stuff Forgotten behind the headlines of smoking guns Aspen ski homes and shredded documents are almost employees who work on Enrons power plants and pipelines USA TODAY is the first to get a tour inside Enron since its collapse late last year and spend time with Stephen Cooper the new chief executive talking about his vision for the future On the th floor of executive suites decorated with rich carpets and velvetcovered chairs there is a sweeping view of Houston a city Enron helped shape with its philanthropy political donations and corporate muscle Cooper however is only focused on saving part of the company His plan faces monumental challenges In his words Everybodys betting against us While many American corporate icons have filed for Chapter bankruptcy protection in the past year Kmart Polaroid Bethlehem Steel the size speed and sordid details of Enrons collapse have sparked numerous investigations and lawsuits angered creditors demoralized employees and ruined its reputation But Cooper whose firm Zolfo Cooper worked on the troubles of such companies as Polaroid Sunbeam and Federated Department Stores is adamant Enron can emerge healthy from bankruptcy within a year Ive probably been in more Chapter s than anybody in the United States literally he says This company by way of business and asset base by way of management team by way of predictability of its future business has more of all of that than most distressed businesses Ive ever seen Coopers plans The company already has sold the energytrading business that was once considered its crown jewel to UBS Warburg Although a bankruptcy court and Enrons creditors must first approve any moves Coopers plans include Enron will likely have to give up this skyscraper for a more modest habitat Cooper says The companys new million building across the street from headquarters also is for sale Even Enrons name blazoned across the top of the nearby Major League Baseball stadium is going to have to go Out of the ashes there ought to be something everyone can be proud of a year or two or three from now he says Today the company still has a pipeline network that stretches from Canada to California and from Texas to Florida And Cooper is betting that business can power the light at the end of the tunnel He wants to keep the North American and South American pipelines and power plants and sell or shut down the rest of the companys businesses including its broadband network water utilities and the like That will mean cutting an additional to off Enrons payroll and returning the company to its natural gas pipeline roots of the s But to pull off his plan Cooper must not only sway his critics including giant Wall Street creditors but also motivate thousands of devastated employees Cooper and Enron President Jeff McMahon have one of the toughest jobs in business to keep the people there and keep them motivated says John Whitney a turnaround expert and professor at Columbia University To lock in key executives Enron offered million in retention bonuses Former Enron executives who went to UBS Warburg as part of the sale of the energytrading business also pocketed multimilliondollar payoffs And Coopers pay The New Yorkbased consulting firm Zolfo Cooper will receive million a year plus million for each of the eight executives he brought with him to Houston If Enron emerges from bankruptcy Coopers firm will get a million fee If Enron is liquidated Cooper will get a fee agreed upon by the creditors and court according to a filing in US Bankruptcy Court in New York Shattered morale Enrons fall from grace has shattered employee morale Its just so sad says one current employee who spoke on condition of anonymity On several floors it looks like the rapture It looks like people disappeared into space Theyre just gone This employee just two years away from retirement watched in retirement savings shrink to zero with Enrons stock price Now Im going to have to work as a greeter at WalMart until Im the employee says Its gone I just cant make it back Jorge Garcia a project controls manager laid off in December says his friends still at Enron say You can tell if youll be let go soon by your office accommodations If youve been moved to a cubicle you probably wont last long That kind of stress takes its toll Downstairs in the company gym Kathy Kissner a massage therapist says that as the company fell apart employees would call begging for any open appointment or even just five minutes between appointments Ive lost pounds in the last six months from long hours and lack of sleep says Mark Palmer vice president of communications Cooper knows his employees have been hurt financially and emotionally Its the hardest part of his job When people are looking at the prospect of losing enormous amounts of money they often times get heated They get emotional and upset he says Its never fun to be at the receiving end but Ive gotten used to it Blast voice mail To motivate the employees he is trying to focus them on future goals People have two choices We can spend all of our time living in the past which is a crazy way to spend your life You cant change it Or we can begin to move beyond the disappointment and the upset and the loss to focus on the future he says And he has opened up lines of communication Once a week he sends out a lengthy voice mail telling employees what has happened during the past week explaining management changes and timetables When employees call or send him email he will go find them in the building to answer their questions And next month he will hold a meeting with all of the employees in Houston to explain the details of his strategy to bring the company out of bankruptcy This kind of candid communication is essential he says We are not trying to eliminate bad news We are not trying to make it just good news What we are trying to do is to eliminate uncertainty he says People can live with either one of those good or bad What they cant live with is uncertainty And while some still say Enrons future is uncertain Cooper is certain of one thing The lives and reputations of people shouldnt be trash canned because a handful of geniuses decided to run wild he says People ought to keep in perspective that weve got a lot of really tremendous people here and for the sake of a couple bad apples we shouldnt blowtorch the entire field PHOTOS BW Michael Stravato Caption In Houston Turnaround CEO Stephen Cooper says the company probably will have to give up its main building and its new one in the background Core business Kenneth Wagoner works in the gas pipeline control center in Houston Fewer customers Business has slowed at the coffee shop on the ground floor of one Enron building No sweat The fitness center at Enron no longer gets as much of a workout by employees Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved Financial Desk The Nation Acting CEO Plans Legal Assault Amid Effort to Salvage Enron Litigation Those who helped fell the energy giant would be targeted Stephen Cooper says NANCY RIVERA BROOKS TIMES STAFF WRITER Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company HOUSTON Enron Corp is planning a broad legal assault against those who helped bring the company down according to acting Chief Executive Stephen Cooper the corporate rescue artist who was selected three weeks ago to put the company back on the road to solvency Cooper said in an interview that the litigation would be extensive and rapid although he declined to identify specific targets Enron may have causes of action against institutions and individuals that could represent a meaningful asset for the estate said Cooper a principal with Zolfo Cooper a New York consulting firm that specializes in corporate restructuring I think you will see something sooner as opposed to later The players were many in what has become a lurid corporate morality play and all are potential defendants Enron filed the largest Chapter bankruptcy in US history Dec following a series of damaging disclosures of questionable transactions with partnerships controlled by company employees The nations seventhlargest company collapsed less than seven weeks after it disclosed losses tied to the offthebooks partnerships wiping out billions of dollars in investor wealth and more than jobs An internal investigation by three Enron directors determined that abuses in accounting of partnership transactions masked at least billion in recent losses while a few company employees reaped millions of dollars in personal profits Directors and executives including former Chairman Kenneth L Lay and former Chief Executive Jeffrey K Skilling failed to curb the missteps of subordinates the report concluded It also pointed to poor advice from Andersen Enrons auditor and Vinson Elkins one of its outside law firms Still Sorting Out All the Issues Cooper who occupies Skillings old office on the th floor of Enrons mirrored office tower in downtown Houston said the company has not asked any former employees to repay the millions of dollars they earned from partnership transactions That would include former Chief Financial Officer Andrew S Fastow former Enron Global Finance executive Michael Kopper and former Treasurer Ben F Glisan I think that the recovery vehicle in the main will be litigation Cooper said Cooper and his team are still sorting out issues related to Enrons financial statements and the value of its trading book the contracts that were not included in the recent sale of its energy trading operation Since Enron filed for Bankruptcy Court protection the value of those contracts has eroded to about billion from about billion I certainly dont believe at this particular point in time that anybody is engaging in transactions that arent completely above board Cooper said We will be presenting to the creditors committee on a regular basis our financial statements which I believe in the main will be accurate Enron has not yet hired a new auditor to replace Andersen which it fired Enron already has filed a billion lawsuit against Dynegy Inc alleging that its crosstown rival withdrew from a proposed merger with Enron in late November as part of a plan to wreck the ailing company Dynegy has said it pulled out of the merger because Enron misrepresented the depths of its financial problems and lost its investmentgrade credit rating The Enron that Cooper envisions will look much different from the marketdominating energy trader that Lay and Skilling built The name will change and the company will focus on its natural gas pipelines and power plantsthe kind of hard assets Skilling said he disdained Coopers style too is unlike Lays grandfatherly and professorial demeanor and Skillings harddriving image Cooper insists on being called by his first name and dresses casually at the office complete with baseball cap He hasnt decorated Skillings woodpaneled deadbolted office To keep up employee morale Cooper said he visits workers in response to email and sends out weekly unscripted voicemail updates An allemployee meeting will be held soon he said Enrons overhaul is well underway Enron has agreed reluctantly to turn over to Dynegy its biggest pipeline mile Northern Natural Gas which was a condition of the billion that Dynegy invested in Enron as part of the aborted merger Enron also recently gave away its vaunted energytrading operation to New York investment banking firm UBS Warburg in a nocash deal that would supply Enron with a cut of any future profit What remains is an assortment of smaller natural gas pipelines including one that runs from Texas to California and electricity generating plants Enron has announced plans to shut down its remaining telecommunications operations and to unload Portland General its Oregon utility as well as many of the international power plants and other assets whose poor performance helped sink the company Cooper declined to detail which assets he is thinking of unloading because we havent settled on a final configuration yet But it will be substantially smaller by way of reported revenue than the old Enron The company if you remove the trading from the rest of the business its actually got a very good very solid very revenue and cashflow and earningspredictable business which is really its power and pipes business Cooper said So in my view there is an eminently reorganizable entity here Not Going to Wallow and Linger Cooper expects to present a fairly onpoint direction for reorganization to its creditors committee in the second quarter and to have settled on a new version of the company within a year Were going to move this process forward very quickly Were not going to wallow and linger in Chapter for a day longer than we have to Although many have speculated that Enron will never emerge from bankruptcy and will instead be carved up and sold Cooper said he is not of that mind adding that in his year career of reorganizing companies he has seen only a few instances in which liquidation made more sense for creditors than reorganizing the ongoing business Those cases all involved substantial amounts of valuable real estate he said Enron has a bit of that Although it leases its Houston headquarters Enron is building a tower nearly as tall next door It has received million in debtor financing to complete and sell that project Cooper flatly states that he is not interested in doing a postmortem on Enron but he did acknowledge the very laborintensive process of sorting through hundreds upon hundreds of socalled special purpose entities which are financial vehicles commonly used by corporations to finance projects separate from the companys balance sheet and for other legitimate purposes such as a sale and leaseback of a building Lawyers and accountants are examining the entities to determine the extent of Enrons liabilities and the economic value to Enron of each vehicle he said A team of about Zolfo Cooper employees an unusually large number is being assigned to Enron Cooper said Theres a difference between were the partnerships legitimate or not versus were they accounted for properly or not Both of these are being looked at Well just have to wait to see what the attorneys say as that gets sorted out Cooper said Special purpose entities are not good or bad theyre just instruments or vehicles which provide companies with financial flexibility to better manage their business to better manage their balance sheet to fit the needs of their business Cooper said The Enron phenomenon was the failure to transfer economic risk from Enron to the partnerships and the failure to disclose and the suspension of the corporate code of ethics and conduct that allowed people to get into a position where they had divided loyalties by working for both Enron and the partnerships he said What we saw here was a case where they werent constructed properly they werent reported properly and by allowing someone to be on both sides of the transaction you couldnt have really an armslength transaction Its kind of like having you negotiate both sides of a prenuptial agreement Despite its size the Enron reorganization is much like every other he has handled Cooper said Those included Federated Department Stores Inc Polaroid Corp and Malden Mills Unique to Enron however is the furor surrounding the rapid and stunning collapse of the business Cooper said Its become an enormous lightning rod for not only the upset of people directly involved in the company but its become a lightning rod to coalesce all of these other national interests involving such issues as accounting and corporate governance Cooper said I hope people will be able to relax and calm down and look at this as an opportunity for a fresh start for our external economic constituencies a fresh start by way of an investment and a fresh start for our employees Cooper said Its sort of like when your car breaks down and youre in the middle of nowhere and you end up hating the car Youre kicking the tires Youre kicking the bumpers After you get over it you realize that its still a good car You get the tire or whatever fixed and you just keep going PHOTO
