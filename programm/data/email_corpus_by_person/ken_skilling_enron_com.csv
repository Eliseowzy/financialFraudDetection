<2104029.1075854194825.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,ken.skilling@enron.com,2001-03-13 08:17:00,California Energy Crisispower crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve ral months Unfortunately this debate has generated more heat than light We want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on California energy issues What happened in California The source of Californias current problem is as straightforward as supp ly and demand Californias economy grew percent since This incr eased the demand for electricity by percent At the same time regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state So demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added The resul t predictably is a shortage This summer peak capacity will be about percent shy of peak demand leading to further blackouts in the state In addition to the supply and demand imbalance there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis First the states regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market The spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile The way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo ng term medium term and short term to reduce exposure to this volatility I n California state regulation prevented this strategy This would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th e most volatile interest rate environment imaginable Everything was fine while the power surplus persisted but when shortages ensued every megawat t was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price Second retail markets were not deregulated Regulated retail rates remain ed in effect and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa le prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate They are now nearly bankrupt In short Californias problems were caused by regulation not deregulat ion Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market prevented new generation from being built and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices At the time California was developing its restructuring plan Enron warned the states policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives w hich if adopted would have averted the current crisis Enrons Role Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f ix the problem Power sellers including Enron have been vilified by the politicians and the media Here are the facts Other than a small amount of wind power Enron is not a generator in the state of California Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the same market available to other California purchasers Because we are a market maker not a generator we are not biased toward high prices We ar e interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc ts for our customers As a seller to enduse markets in the state we provided protection from the problems the states utilities and their customers now face We protected and still protect our customers from price volatility You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on the open market Early reports mischaracterized this as a turnback of our customers to the utilities Here are the facts As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California market it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct ly from the utilities This decision reduced EESs market price risk by allowing EES to access lower utility rates EES did not terminate any customer contracts and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them with other energyrelated products and services including assistance in reducing the demand for power particularly at peak times Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its crisis Enron continues to sign up customers in the state and Enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western power markets Enrons primary business is managing risk for our custom ers with solutions customized to meet their needs There has never been more demand for our products and services The Solution The solution to Californias crisis is also straightforward In summary the state must increase supply reduce demand reduce reliance on the spot mark et and shore up the financial stability of the states utilities Increasing Supply Californias process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of Byzantine Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les s than a year In California it often takes to years California simpl y must streamline this process Ironically while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants which emit times as much NOx California can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities Reducing Demand Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is An open retail market would trigger demand responses which would balance supply and deman d at lower prices than today California should fully open its retail market Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market In a truly deregulated market customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term fixedprice basis The state has instead left procurement in the han ds of the utilities which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the ir price risk Restoring the Financial Integrity of the States Institutions The utilities in California are not paying their bills This has led to greater uncertainty in the market higher costs and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions California must permit its utilities to recov er their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed Just as important as doing these things the state must avoid policies that while politically attractive do not fix the problem or even make matters worse Price caps have been proposed They dont work have never work ed and they will not work here Price caps succeed only in creating shortages which then have to be allocated among competing users Imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining for example whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall ey or Silicon Valley Price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in California There is no reason to believe and every reason to doubt that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in constructing operating and maintaining assets This will also result in California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation which the private sector can do instead of education road s and other public goods which the private sector cannot do As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t he crisis from the media its important for you to know this We at Enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state

particularly at peak times Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its crisis Enron continues to sign up customers in the state and Enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western power markets Enrons primary business is managing risk for our custom ers with solutions customized to meet their needs There has never been more demand for our products and services The Solution The solution to Californias crisis is also straightforward In summary the state must increase supply reduce demand reduce reliance on the spot mark et and shore up the financial stability of the states utilities Increasing Supply Californias process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of Byzantine Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les s than a year In California it often takes to years California simpl y must streamline this process Ironically while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants which emit times as much NOx California can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities Reducing Demand Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is An open retail market would trigger demand responses which would balance supply and deman d at lower prices than today California should fully open its retail market Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market In a truly deregulated market customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term fixedprice basis The state has instead left procurement in the han ds of the utilities which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the ir price risk Restoring the Financial Integrity of the States Institutions The utilities in California are not paying their bills This has led to greater uncertainty in the market higher costs and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions California must permit its utilities to recov er their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed Just as important as doing these things the state must avoid policies that while politically attractive do not fix the problem or even make matters worse Price caps have been proposed They dont work have never work ed and they will not work here Price caps succeed only in creating shortages which then have to be allocated among competing users Imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining for example whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall ey or Silicon Valley Price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in California There is no reason to believe and every reason to doubt that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in constructing operating and maintaining assets This will also result in California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation which the private sector can do instead of education road s and other public goods which the private sector cannot do As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t he crisis from the media its important for you to know this We at Enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state

Unfortunately this debate has generated more heat than light We want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on California energy issues What happened in California The source of Californias current problem is as straightforward as supply and demand Californias economy grew percent since This increased the demand for electricity by percent At the same time regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state So demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added The result predictably is a shortage This summer peak capacity will be about percent shy of peak demand leading to further blackouts in the state In addition to the supply and demand imbalance there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis First the states regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market The spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile The way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long term medium term and short term to reduce exposure to this volatility In California state regulation prevented this strategy This would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the most volatile interest rate environment imaginable Everything was fine while the power surplus persisted but when shortages ensued every megawatt was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price Second retail markets were not deregulated Regulated retail rates remained in effect and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate They are now nearly bankrupt In short Californias problems were caused by regulation not deregulation Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market prevented new generation from being built and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices At the time California was developing its restructuring plan Enron warned the states policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives which if adopted would have averted the current crisis Enrons Role Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix the problem Power sellers including Enron have been vilified by the politicians and the media Here are the facts Other than a small amount of wind power Enron is not a generator in the state of California Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the same market available to other California purchasers Because we are a market maker not a generator we are not biased toward high prices We are interested only in having a market that works so that we can package products for our customers As a seller to enduse markets in the state we provided protection from the problems the states utilities and their customers now face We protected and still protect our customers from price volatility You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on the open market Early reports mischaracterized this as a turnback of our customers to the

particularly at peak times Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its crisis Enron continues to sign up customers in the state and Enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western power markets Enrons primary business is managing risk for our custom ers with solutions customized to meet their needs There has never been more demand for our products and services The Solution The solution to Californias crisis is also straightforward In summary the state must increase supply reduce demand reduce reliance on the spot mark et and shore up the financial stability of the states utilities Increasing Supply Californias process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of Byzantine Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les s than a year In California it often takes to years California simpl y must streamline this process Ironically while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants which emit times as much NOx California can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities Reducing Demand Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is An open retail market would trigger demand responses which would balance supply and deman d at lower prices than today California should fully open its retail market Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market In a truly deregulated market customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term fixedprice basis The state has instead left procurement in the han ds of the utilities which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the ir price risk Restoring the Financial Integrity of the States Institutions The utilities in California are not paying their bills This has led to greater uncertainty in the market higher costs and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions California must permit its utilities to recov er their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed Just as important as doing these things the state must avoid policies that while politically attractive do not fix the problem or even make matters worse Price caps have been proposed They dont work have never work ed and they will not work here Price caps succeed only in creating shortages which then have to be allocated among competing users Imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining for example whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall ey or Silicon Valley Price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in California There is no reason to believe and every reason to doubt that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in constructing operating and maintaining assets This will also result in California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation which the private sector can do instead of education road s and other public goods which the private sector cannot do As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t he crisis from the media its important for you to know this We at Enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state

this debate has generated more heat than light We want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on California energy issues What happened in California The source of Californias current problem is as straightforward as supp ly and demand Californias economy grew percent since This incr eased the demand for electricity by percent At the same time regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state So demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added The resul t predictably is a shortage This summer peak capacity will be about percent shy of peak demand leading to further blackouts in the state In addition to the supply and demand imbalance there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis First the states regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market The spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile The way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo ng term medium term and short term to reduce exposure to this volatility I n California state regulation prevented this strategy This would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th e most volatile interest rate environment imaginable Everything was fine while the power surplus persisted but when shortages ensued every megawat t was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price Second retail markets were not deregulated Regulated retail rates remain ed in effect and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa le prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate They are now nearly bankrupt In short Californias problems were caused by regulation not deregulat ion Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market prevented new generation from being built and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices At the time California was developing its restructuring plan Enron warned the states policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives w hich if adopted would have averted the current crisis Enrons Role Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f ix the problem Power sellers including Enron have been vilified by the politicians and the media Here are the facts Other than a small amount of wind

this debate has generated more heat than light We want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on California energy issues What happened in California The source of Californias current problem is as straightforward as supp ly and demand Californias economy grew percent since This incr eased the demand for electricity by percent At the same time regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state So demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added The resul t predictably is a shortage This summer peak capacity will be about percent shy of peak demand leading to further blackouts in the state In addition to the supply and demand imbalance there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis First the states regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market The spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile The way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo ng term medium term and short term to reduce exposure to this volatility I n California state regulation prevented this strategy This would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th e most volatile interest rate environment imaginable Everything was fine while the power surplus persisted but when shortages ensued every megawat t was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price Second retail markets were not deregulated Regulated retail rates remain ed in effect and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa le prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate They are now nearly bankrupt In short Californias problems were caused by regulation not deregulat ion Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market prevented new generation from being built and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices At the time California was developing its restructuring plan Enron warned the states policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives w hich if adopted would have averted the current crisis Enrons Role Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f ix the problem Power sellers including Enron have been vilified by the politicians and the media Here are the facts Other than a small amount of wind power Enron is not a generator in the state of California Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the same market available to other California purchasers Because we are a market maker not a generator we are not biased toward high prices We ar e interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc ts for our customers As a seller to enduse markets in the state we provided protection from the problems the states utilities and their customers now face We protected and still protect our customers from price volatility You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on the open market Early reports mischaracterized this as a turnback of our customers to the utilities Here are the facts As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California market it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct ly from the utilities This decision reduced EESs market price risk by allowing EES to access lower utility rates EES did not terminate any customer contracts and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them with other energyrelated products and services including assistance in reducing the demand for power particularly at peak times Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its crisis Enron continues to sign up customers in the state and Enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western power markets Enrons primary business is managing risk for our custom ers with solutions customized to meet their needs There has never been more demand for our products and services The Solution The solution to Californias crisis is also straightforward In summary the state must increase supply reduce demand reduce reliance on the spot mark et and shore up the financial stability of the states utilities Increasing Supply Californias process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of Byzantine Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les s than a year In California it often takes to years California simpl y must streamline this process Ironically while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants which emit times as much NOx California can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities Reducing Demand Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is An open retail market would trigger demand responses which would balance supply and deman d at lower prices than today California should fully open its retail market Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market In a truly deregulated market customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term fixedprice basis The state has instead left procurement in the han ds of the utilities which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the ir price risk Restoring the Financial Integrity of the States Institutions The utilities in California are not paying their bills This has led to greater uncertainty in the market higher costs and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions California must permit its utilities to recov er their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed Just as important as doing these things the state must avoid policies that while politically attractive do not fix the problem or even make matters worse Price caps have been proposed They dont work have never work ed and they will not work here Price caps succeed only in creating shortages which then have to be allocated among competing users Imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining for example whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall ey or Silicon Valley Price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in California There is no reason to believe and every reason to doubt that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in constructing operating and maintaining assets This will also result in California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation which the private sector can do instead of education road s and other public goods which the private sector cannot do As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t he crisis from the media its important for you to know this We at Enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state

<3992784.1075848332190.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,ken.skilling@enron.com,2001-03-13 08:17:00,California Energy Crisispower crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve ral months Unfortunately this debate has generated more heat than light We want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on California energy issues What happened in California The source of Californias current problem is as straightforward as supp ly and demand Californias economy grew percent since This incr eased the demand for electricity by percent At the same time regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state So demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added The resul t predictably is a shortage This summer peak capacity will be about percent shy of peak demand leading to further blackouts in the state In addition to the supply and demand imbalance there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis First the states regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market The spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile The way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo ng term medium term and short term to reduce exposure to this volatility I n California state regulation prevented this strategy This would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th e most volatile interest rate environment imaginable Everything was fine while the power surplus persisted but when shortages ensued every megawat t was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price Second retail markets were not deregulated Regulated retail rates remain ed in effect and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa le prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate They are now nearly bankrupt In short Californias problems were caused by regulation not deregulat ion Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market prevented new generation from being built and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices At the time California was developing its restructuring plan Enron warned the states policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives w hich if adopted would have averted the current crisis Enrons Role Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f ix the problem Power sellers including Enron have been vilified by the politicians and the media Here are the facts Other than a small amount of wind power Enron is not a generator in the state of California Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the same market available to other California purchasers Because we are a market maker not a generator we are not biased toward high prices We ar e interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc ts for our customers As a seller to enduse markets in the state we provided protection from the problems the states utilities and their customers now face We protected and still protect our customers from price volatility You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on the open market Early reports mischaracterized this as a turnback of our customers to the utilities Here are the facts As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California market it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct ly from the utilities This decision reduced EESs market price risk by allowing EES to access lower utility rates EES did not terminate any customer contracts and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them with other energyrelated products and services including assistance in reducing the demand for power particularly at peak times Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its crisis Enron continues to sign up customers in the state and Enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western power markets Enrons primary business is managing risk for our custom ers with solutions customized to meet their needs There has never been more demand for our products and services The Solution The solution to Californias crisis is also straightforward In summary the state must increase supply reduce demand reduce reliance on the spot mark et and shore up the financial stability of the states utilities Increasing Supply Californias process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of Byzantine Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les s than a year In California it often takes to years California simpl y must streamline this process Ironically while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants which emit times as much NOx California can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities Reducing Demand Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is An open retail market would trigger demand responses which would balance supply and deman d at lower prices than today California should fully open its retail market Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market In a truly deregulated market customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term fixedprice basis The state has instead left procurement in the han ds of the utilities which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the ir price risk Restoring the Financial Integrity of the States Institutions The utilities in California are not paying their bills This has led to greater uncertainty in the market higher costs and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions California must permit its utilities to recov er their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed Just as important as doing these things the state must avoid policies that while politically attractive do not fix the problem or even make matters worse Price caps have been proposed They dont work have never work ed and they will not work here Price caps succeed only in creating shortages which then have to be allocated among competing users Imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining for example whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall ey or Silicon Valley Price caps are

<32716100.1075840903661.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,ken.skilling@enron.com,2001-03-13 19:17:00,California Energy Crisispst Californias power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several months Unfortunately this debate has generated more heat than light We want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on California energy issues What happened in California The source of Californias current problem is as straightforward as supply and demand Californias economy grew percent since This increased the demand for electricity by percent At the same time regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state So demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added The result predictably is a shortage This summer peak capacity will be about percent shy of peak demand leading to further blackouts in the state In addition to the supply and demand imbalance there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis First the states regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market The spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile The way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long term medium term and short term to reduce exposure to this volatility In California state regulation prevented this strategy This would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the most volatile interest rate environment imaginable Everything was fine while the power surplus persisted but when shortages ensued every megawatt was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price Second retail markets were not deregulated Regulated retail rates remained in effect and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate They are now nearly bankrupt In short Californias problems were caused by regulation not deregulation Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market prevented new generation from being built and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices At the time California was developing its restructuring plan Enron warned the states policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives which if adopted would have averted the current crisis Enrons Role Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix the problem Power sellers including Enron have been vilified by the politicians and the media Here are the facts Other than a small amount of wind power Enron is not a generator in the state of California Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the same market available to other California purchasers Because we are a market maker not a generator we are not biased toward high prices We are interested only in having a market that works so that we can package products for our customers As a seller to enduse markets in the state we provided protection from the problems the states utilities and their customers now face We protected and still protect our customers from price volatility You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on the open market Early reports mischaracterized this as a turnback of our customers to the utilities Here are the facts As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California market it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers directly from the utilities This decision reduced EESs market price risk by allowing EES to access lower utility rates EES did not terminate any customer contracts and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them with other energyrelated products and services including assistance in reducing the demand for power particularly at peak times Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its crisis Enron continues to sign up customers in the state and Enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western power markets Enrons primary business is managing risk for our customers with solutions customized to meet their needs There has never been more demand for our products and services The Solution The solution to Californias crisis is also straightforward In summary the state must increase supply reduce demand reduce reliance on the spot market and shore up the financial stability of the states utilities Increasing Supply Californias process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of Byzantine Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less than a year In California it often takes to years California simply must streamline this process Ironically while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants which emit times as much NOx California can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities Reducing Demand Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is An open retail market would trigger demand responses which would balance supply and demand at lower prices than today California should fully open its retail market Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market In a truly deregulated market customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term fixedprice basis The state has instead left procurement in the hands of the utilities which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their price risk Restoring the Financial Integrity of the States Institutions The utilities in California are not paying their bills This has led to greater uncertainty in the market higher costs and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions California must permit its utilities to recover their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed Just as important as doing these things the state must avoid policies that while politically attractive do not fix the problem or even make matters worse Price caps have been proposed They dont work have never worked and they will not work here Price caps succeed only in creating shortages which then have to be allocated among competing users Imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining for example whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Valley or Silicon Valley Price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in California There is no reason to believe and every reason to doubt that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in constructing operating and maintaining assets This will also result in California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation which the private sector can do instead of education roads and other public goods which the private sector cannot do As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the crisis from the media its important for you to know this We at Enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state

its restructuring plan Enron warned the states policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives w hich if adopted would have averted the current crisis Enrons Role Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f ix the problem Power sellers including Enron have been vilified by the politicians and the media Here are the facts Other than a small amount of wind power Enron is not a generator in the state of California Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the same market available to other California purchasers Because we are a market maker not a generator we are not biased toward high prices We ar e interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc ts for our customers As a seller to enduse markets in the state we provided protection from the problems the states utilities and their customers now face We protected and still protect our customers from price volatility You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on the open market Early reports mischaracterized this as a turnback of our customers to the utilities Here are the facts As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California market it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct ly from the utilities This decision reduced EESs market price risk by allowing EES to access lower utility rates EES did not terminate any customer contracts and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them with other energyrelated products and services including assistance in reducing the demand for power particularly at peak times Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its crisis Enron continues to sign up customers in the state and Enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western power markets Enrons primary business is managing risk for our custom ers with solutions customized to meet their needs There has never been more demand for our products and services The Solution The solution to Californias crisis is also straightforward In summary the state must increase supply reduce demand reduce reliance on the spot mark et and shore up the financial stability of the states utilities Increasing Supply Californias process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of Byzantine Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les s than a year In California it often takes to years California simpl y must streamline this process Ironically while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants which emit times as much NOx California can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities Reducing Demand Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is An open retail market would trigger demand responses which would balance supply and deman d at lower prices than today California should fully open its retail market Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market In a truly deregulated market customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term fixedprice basis The state has instead left procurement in the han ds of the utilities which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the ir price risk Restoring the Financial Integrity of the States Institutions The utilities in California are not paying their bills This has led to greater uncertainty in the market higher costs and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions California must permit its utilities to recov er their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed Just as important as doing these things the state must avoid policies that while politically attractive do not fix the problem or even make matters worse Price caps have been proposed They dont work have never work ed and they will not work here Price caps succeed only in creating shortages which then have to be allocated among competing users Imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining for example whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall ey or Silicon Valley Price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in California There is no reason to believe and every reason to doubt that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in constructing operating and maintaining assets This will also result in California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation which the private sector can do instead of education road s and other public goods which the private sector cannot do As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t he crisis from the media its important for you to know this We at Enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state

Unfortunately this debate has generated more heat than light We want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on California energy issues What happened in California The source of Californias current problem is as straightforward as supp ly and demand Californias economy grew percent since This incr eased the demand for electricity by percent At the same time regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state So demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added The resul t predictably is a shortage This summer peak capacity will be about percent shy of peak demand leading to further blackouts in the state In addition to the supply and demand imbalance there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis First the states regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market The spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile The way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo ng term medium term and short term to reduce exposure to this volatility I n California state regulation prevented this strategy This would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th e most volatile interest rate environment imaginable Everything was fine while the power surplus persisted but when shortages ensued every megawat t was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price Second retail markets were not deregulated Regulated retail rates remain ed in effect and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa le prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate They are now nearly bankrupt In short Californias problems were caused by regulation not deregulat ion Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market prevented new generation from being built and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices At the time California was developing

<2947409.1075851707571.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,ken.skilling@enron.com,2001-03-13 08:17:00,California Energy Crisispower crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve ral months Unfortunately this debate has generated more heat than light We want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on California energy issues What happened in California The source of Californias current problem is as straightforward as supp ly and demand Californias economy grew percent since This incr eased the demand for electricity by percent At the same time regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state So demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added The resul t predictably is a shortage This summer peak capacity will be about percent shy of peak demand leading to further blackouts in the state In addition to the supply and demand imbalance there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis First the states regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market The spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile The way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo ng term medium term and short term to reduce exposure to this volatility I n California state regulation prevented this strategy This would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th e most volatile interest rate environment imaginable Everything was fine while the power surplus persisted but when shortages ensued every megawat t was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price Second retail markets were not deregulated Regulated retail rates remain ed in effect and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa le prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate They are now nearly bankrupt In short Californias problems were caused by regulation not deregulat ion Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market prevented new generation from being built and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices At the time California was developing its restructuring plan Enron warned the states policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives w hich if adopted would have averted the current crisis Enrons Role Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f ix the problem Power sellers including Enron have been vilified by the politicians and the media Here are the facts Other than a small amount of wind power Enron is not a generator in the state of California Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the same market available to other California purchasers Because we are a market maker not a generator we are not biased toward high prices We ar e interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc ts for our customers As a seller to enduse markets in the state we provided protection from the problems the states utilities and their customers now face We protected and still protect our customers from price volatility You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on the open market Early reports mischaracterized this as a turnback of our customers to the utilities Here are the facts As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California market it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct ly from the utilities This decision reduced EESs market price risk by allowing EES to access lower utility rates EES did not terminate any customer contracts and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them with other energyrelated products and services including assistance in reducing the demand for power particularly at peak times Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its crisis Enron continues to sign up customers in the state and Enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western power markets Enrons primary business is managing risk for our custom ers with solutions customized to meet their needs There has never been more demand for our products and services The Solution The solution to Californias crisis is also straightforward In summary the state must increase supply reduce demand reduce reliance on the spot mark et and shore up the financial stability of the states utilities Increasing Supply Californias process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of Byzantine Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les s than a year In California it often takes to years California simpl y must streamline this process Ironically while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants which emit times as much NOx California can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities Reducing Demand Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is An open retail market would trigger demand responses which would balance supply and deman d at lower prices than today California should fully open its retail market Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market In a truly deregulated market customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term fixedprice basis The state has instead left procurement in the han ds of the utilities which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the ir price risk Restoring the Financial Integrity of the States Institutions The utilities in California are not paying their bills This has led to greater uncertainty in the market higher costs and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions California must permit its utilities to recov er their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed Just as important as doing these things the state must avoid policies that while politically attractive do not fix the problem or even make matters worse Price caps have been proposed They dont work have never work ed and they will not work here Price caps succeed only in creating shortages which then have to be allocated among competing users Imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining for example whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall ey or Silicon Valley Price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in California There is no reason to believe and every reason to doubt that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in constructing operating and maintaining assets This will also result in California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation which the private sector can do instead of education road s and other public goods which the private sector cannot do As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t he crisis from the media its important for you to know this We at Enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state

power Enron is not a generator in the state of California Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the same market available to other California purchasers Because we are a market maker not a generator we are not biased toward high prices We ar e interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc ts for our customers As a seller to enduse markets in the state we provided protection from the problems the states utilities and their customers now face We protected and still protect our customers from price volatility You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on the open market Early reports mischaracterized this as a turnback of our customers to the utilities Here are the facts As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California market it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct ly from the utilities This decision reduced EESs market price risk by allowing EES to access lower utility rates EES did not terminate any customer contracts and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them with other energyrelated products and services including assistance in reducing the demand for power particularly at peak times Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its crisis Enron continues to sign up customers in the state and Enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western power markets Enrons primary business is managing risk for our custom ers with solutions customized to meet their needs There has never been more demand for our products and services The Solution The solution to Californias crisis is also straightforward In summary the state must increase supply reduce demand reduce reliance on the spot mark et and shore up the financial stability of the states utilities Increasing Supply Californias process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of Byzantine Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les s than a year In California it often takes to years California simpl y must streamline this process Ironically while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants which emit times as much NOx California can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities Reducing Demand Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is An open retail market would trigger demand responses which would balance supply and deman d at lower prices than today California should fully open its retail market Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market In a truly deregulated market customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term fixedprice basis The state has instead left procurement in the han ds of the utilities which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the ir price risk Restoring the Financial Integrity of the States Institutions The utilities in California are not paying their bills This has led to greater uncertainty in the market higher costs and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions California must permit its utilities to recov er their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed Just as important as doing these things the state must avoid policies that while politically attractive do not fix the problem or even make matters worse Price caps have been proposed They dont work have never work ed and they will not work here Price caps succeed only in creating shortages which then have to be allocated among competing users Imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining for example whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall ey or Silicon Valley Price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in California There is no reason to believe and every reason to doubt that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in constructing operating and maintaining assets This will also result in California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation which the private sector can do instead of education road s and other public goods which the private sector cannot do As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t he crisis from the media its important for you to know this We at Enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state

this debate has generated more heat than light We want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on California energy issues What happened in California The source of Californias current problem is as straightforward as supp ly and demand Californias economy grew percent since This incr eased the demand for electricity by percent At the same time regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state So demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added The resul t predictably is a shortage This summer peak capacity will be about percent shy of peak demand leading to further blackouts in the state In addition to the supply and demand imbalance there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis First the states regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market The spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile The way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo ng term medium term and short term to reduce exposure to this volatility I n California state regulation prevented this strategy This would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th e most volatile interest rate environment imaginable Everything was fine while the power surplus persisted but when shortages ensued every megawat t was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price Second retail markets were not deregulated Regulated retail rates remain ed in effect and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa le prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate They are now nearly bankrupt In short Californias problems were caused by regulation not deregulat ion Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market prevented new generation from being built and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices At the time California was developing its restructuring plan Enron warned the states policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives w hich if adopted would have averted the current crisis Enrons Role Many political leaders in the

the state have elected to fix blame rather than f ix the problem Power sellers including Enron have been vilified by the politicians and the media Here are the facts Other than a small amount of wind power Enron is not a generator in the state of California Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the same market available to other California purchasers Because we are a market maker not a generator we are not biased toward high prices We ar e interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc ts for our customers As a seller to enduse markets in the state we provided protection from the problems the states utilities and their customers now face We protected and still protect our customers from price volatility You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on the open market Early reports mischaracterized this as a turnback of our customers to the utilities Here are the facts As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California market it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct ly from the utilities This decision reduced EESs market price risk by allowing EES to access lower utility rates EES did not terminate any customer contracts and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them with other energyrelated products and services including assistance in reducing the demand for power particularly at peak times Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its crisis Enron continues to sign up customers in the state and Enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western power markets Enrons primary business is managing risk for our custom ers with solutions customized to meet their needs There has never been more demand for our products and services The Solution The solution to Californias crisis is also straightforward In summary the state must increase supply reduce demand reduce reliance on the spot mark et and shore up the financial stability of the states utilities Increasing Supply Californias process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of Byzantine Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les s than a year In California it often takes to years California simpl y must streamline this process Ironically while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants which emit times as much NOx California can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities Reducing Demand Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is An open retail market would trigger demand responses which would balance supply and deman d at lower prices than today California should fully open its retail market Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market In a truly deregulated market customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term fixedprice basis The state has instead left procurement in the han ds of the utilities which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the ir price risk Restoring the Financial Integrity of the States Institutions The utilities in California are not paying their bills This has led to greater uncertainty in the market higher costs and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions California must permit its utilities to recov er their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed Just as important as doing these things the state must avoid policies that while politically attractive do not fix the problem or even make matters worse Price caps have been proposed They dont work have never work ed and they will not work here Price caps succeed only in creating shortages which then have to be allocated among competing users Imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining for example whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall ey or Silicon Valley Price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in California There is no reason to believe and every reason to doubt that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in constructing operating and maintaining assets This will also result in California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation which the private sector can do instead of education road s and other public goods which the private sector cannot do As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t he crisis from the media its important for you to know this We at Enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state

Unfortunately this debate has generated more heat than light We want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on California energy issues What happened in California The source of Californias current problem is as straightforward as supp ly and demand Californias economy grew percent since This incr eased the demand for electricity by percent At the same time regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state So demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added The resul t predictably is a shortage This summer peak capacity will be about percent shy of peak demand leading to further blackouts in the state In addition to the supply and demand imbalance there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis First the states regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market The spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile The way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo ng term medium term and short term to reduce exposure to this volatility I n California state regulation prevented this strategy This would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th e most volatile interest rate environment imaginable Everything was fine while the power surplus persisted but when shortages ensued every megawat t was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price Second retail markets were not deregulated Regulated retail rates remain ed in effect and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa le prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate They are now nearly bankrupt In short Californias problems were caused by regulation not deregulat ion

Restoring the Financial Integrity of the States Institutions The utilities in California are not paying their bills This has led to greater uncertainty in the market higher costs and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions California must permit its utilities to recov er their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed Just as important as doing these things the state must avoid policies that while politically attractive do not fix the problem or even make matters worse Price caps have been proposed They dont work have never work ed and they will not work here Price caps succeed only in creating shortages which then have to be allocated among competing users Imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining for example whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall ey or Silicon Valley Price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in California There is no reason to believe and every reason to doubt that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in constructing operating and maintaining assets This will also result in California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation which the private sector can do instead of education road s and other public goods which the private sector cannot do As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t he crisis from the media its important for you to know this We at Enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state

<29790914.1075842825198.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,ken.skilling@enron.com,2001-03-13 08:17:00,California Energy Crisispower crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve ral months Unfortunately this debate has generated more heat than light We want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on California energy issues What happened in California The source of Californias current problem is as straightforward as supp ly and demand Californias economy grew percent since This incr eased the demand for electricity by percent At the same time regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state So demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added The resul t predictably is a shortage This summer peak capacity will be about percent shy of peak demand leading to further blackouts in the state In addition to the supply and demand imbalance there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis First the states regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market The spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile The way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo ng term medium term and short term to reduce exposure to this volatility I n California state regulation prevented this strategy This would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th e most volatile interest rate environment imaginable Everything was fine while the power surplus persisted but when shortages ensued every megawat t was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price Second retail markets were not deregulated Regulated retail rates remain ed in effect and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa le prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate They are now nearly bankrupt In short Californias problems were caused by regulation not deregulat ion Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market prevented new generation from being built and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices At the time California was developing its restructuring plan Enron warned the states policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives w hich if adopted would have averted the current crisis Enrons Role Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f ix the problem Power sellers including Enron have been vilified by the politicians and the media Here are the facts Other than a small amount of wind power Enron is not a generator in the state of California Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the same market available to other California purchasers Because we are a market maker not a generator we are not biased toward high prices We ar e interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc ts for our customers As a seller to enduse markets in the state we provided protection from the problems the states utilities and their customers now face We protected and still protect our customers from price volatility You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on the open market Early reports mischaracterized this as a turnback of our customers to the utilities Here are the facts As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California market it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct ly from the utilities This decision reduced EESs market price risk by allowing EES to access lower utility rates EES did not terminate any customer contracts and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them with other energyrelated products and services including assistance in reducing the demand for power particularly at peak times Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its crisis Enron continues to sign up customers in the state and Enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western power markets Enrons primary business is managing risk for our custom ers with solutions customized to meet their needs There has never been more demand for our products and services The Solution The solution to Californias crisis is also straightforward In summary the state must increase supply reduce demand reduce reliance on the spot mark et and shore up the financial stability of the states utilities Increasing Supply Californias process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of Byzantine Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les s than a year In California it often takes to years California simpl y must streamline this process Ironically while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants which emit times as much NOx California can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities Reducing Demand Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is An open retail market would trigger demand responses which would balance supply and deman d at lower prices than today California should fully open its retail market Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market In a truly deregulated market customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term fixedprice basis The state has instead left procurement in the han ds of the utilities which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the ir price risk Restoring the Financial Integrity of the States Institutions The utilities in California are not paying their bills This has led to greater uncertainty in the market higher costs and reduced

<13494202.1075853210773.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,ken.skilling@enron.com,2001-03-13 08:17:00,California Energy Crisispower crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve ral months Unfortunately this debate has generated more heat than light We want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on California energy issues What happened in California The source of Californias current problem is as straightforward as supp ly and demand Californias economy grew percent since This incr eased the demand for electricity by percent At the same time regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state So demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added The resul t predictably is a shortage This summer peak capacity will be about percent shy of peak demand leading to further blackouts in the state In addition to the supply and demand imbalance there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis First the states regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market The spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile The way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo ng term medium term and short term to reduce exposure to this volatility I n California state regulation prevented this strategy This would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th e most volatile interest rate environment imaginable Everything was fine while the power surplus persisted but when shortages ensued every megawat t was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price Second retail markets were not deregulated Regulated retail rates remain ed in effect and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa le prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate They are now nearly bankrupt In short Californias problems were caused by regulation not deregulat ion Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market prevented new generation from being built and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices At the time California was developing its restructuring plan Enron warned the states policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives w hich if adopted would have averted the current crisis Enrons Role Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f ix the problem Power sellers including Enron have been vilified by the politicians and the media Here are the facts Other than a small amount of wind power Enron is not a generator in the state of California Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the same market available to other California purchasers Because we are a market maker not a generator we are not biased toward high prices We ar e interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc ts for our customers As a seller to enduse markets in the state we provided protection from the problems the states utilities and their customers now face We protected and still protect our customers from price volatility You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on the open market Early reports mischaracterized this as a turnback of our customers to the utilities Here are the facts As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California market it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct ly from the utilities This decision reduced EESs market price risk by allowing EES to access lower utility rates EES did not terminate any customer contracts and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them with other energyrelated products and services including assistance in reducing the demand for power particularly at peak times Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its crisis Enron continues to sign up customers in the state and Enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western power markets Enrons primary business is managing risk for our custom ers with solutions customized to meet their needs There has never been more demand for our products and services The Solution The solution to Californias crisis is also straightforward In summary the state must increase supply reduce demand reduce reliance on the spot mark et and shore up the financial stability of the states utilities Increasing Supply Californias process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of Byzantine Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les s than a year In California it often takes to years California simpl y must streamline this process Ironically while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants which emit times as much NOx California can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities Reducing Demand Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is An open retail market would trigger demand responses which would balance supply and deman d at lower prices than today California should fully open its retail market Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market In a truly deregulated market customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term fixedprice basis The state has instead left procurement in the han ds of the utilities which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the ir price risk Restoring the Financial Integrity of the States Institutions The utilities in California are not paying their bills This has led to greater uncertainty in the market higher costs and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions California must permit its utilities to recov er their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed Just as important as doing these things the state must avoid policies that while politically attractive do not fix the problem or even make matters worse Price caps have been proposed They dont work have never work ed and they will not work here Price caps succeed only in creating shortages which then have to be allocated among competing users Imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining for example whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall ey or Silicon Valley Price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in California There is no reason to believe and every reason to doubt that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in constructing operating and maintaining assets This will also result in California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation which the private sector can do instead of education road s and other public goods which the private sector cannot do As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t he crisis from the media its important for you to know this We at Enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state

<618650.1075844710399.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,ken.skilling@enron.com,2001-03-13 08:17:00,California Energy Crisispower crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve ral months Unfortunately this debate has generated more heat than light We want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on California energy issues What happened in California The source of Californias current problem is as straightforward as supp ly and demand Californias economy grew percent since This incr eased the demand for electricity by percent At the same time regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state So demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added The resul t predictably is a shortage This summer peak capacity will be about percent shy of peak demand leading to further blackouts in the state In addition to the supply and demand imbalance there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis First the states regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market The spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile The way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo ng term medium term and short term to reduce exposure to this volatility I n California state regulation prevented this strategy This would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th e most volatile interest rate environment imaginable Everything was fine while the power surplus persisted but when shortages ensued every megawat t was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price Second retail markets were not deregulated Regulated retail rates remain ed in effect and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa le prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate They are now nearly bankrupt In short Californias problems were caused by regulation not deregulat ion Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market prevented new generation from being built and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices At the time California was developing its restructuring plan Enron warned the states policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives w hich if adopted would have averted the current crisis Enrons Role Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f ix the problem Power sellers including Enron have been vilified by the politicians and the media Here are the facts Other than a small amount of wind power Enron is not a generator in the state of California Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the same market available to other California purchasers Because we are a market maker not a generator we are not biased toward high prices We ar e interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc ts for our customers As a seller to enduse markets in the state we provided protection from the problems the states utilities and their customers now face We protected and still protect our customers from price volatility You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on the open market Early reports mischaracterized this as a turnback of our customers to the utilities Here are the facts As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California market it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct ly from the utilities This decision reduced EESs market price risk by allowing EES to access lower utility rates EES did not terminate any customer contracts and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them with other energyrelated products and services including assistance in reducing the demand for power particularly at peak times Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its crisis Enron continues to sign up customers in the state and Enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western power markets Enrons primary business is managing risk for our custom ers with solutions customized to meet their needs There has never been more demand for our products and services The Solution The solution to Californias crisis is also straightforward In summary the state must increase supply reduce demand reduce reliance on the spot mark et and shore up the financial stability of the states utilities Increasing Supply Californias process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of Byzantine Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les s than a year In California it often takes to years California simpl y must streamline this process Ironically while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants which emit times as much NOx California can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities Reducing Demand Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is An open retail market would trigger demand responses which would balance supply and deman d at lower prices than today California should fully open its retail market Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market In a truly deregulated market customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term fixedprice basis The state has instead left procurement in the han ds of the utilities which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the ir price risk Restoring the Financial Integrity of the States Institutions The utilities in California are not paying their bills This has led to greater uncertainty in the market higher costs and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions California must permit its utilities to recov er their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed Just as important as doing these things the state must avoid policies that while politically attractive do not fix the problem or even make matters worse Price caps have been proposed They dont work have never work ed and they will not work here Price caps succeed only in creating shortages which then have to be allocated among competing users Imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining for example whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall ey or Silicon Valley Price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in California There is no reason to believe and every reason to doubt that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in constructing operating and maintaining assets This will also result in California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation which the private sector can do instead of education road s and other public goods which the private sector cannot do As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t he crisis from the media its important for you to know this We at Enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state

a surefire way to make the current shortage worse The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in California There is no reason to believe and every reason to doubt that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in constructing operating and maintaining assets This will also result in California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation which the private sector can do instead of education road s and other public goods which the private sector cannot do As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t he crisis from the media its important for you to know this We at Enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state

<493330.1075845487448.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,ken.skilling@enron.com,2001-03-13 08:17:00,California Energy Crisispower crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve ral months Unfortunately this debate has generated more heat than light We want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on California energy issues What happened in California The source of Californias current problem is as straightforward as supp ly and demand Californias economy grew percent since This incr eased the demand for electricity by percent At the same time regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state So demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added The resul t predictably is a shortage This summer peak capacity will be about percent shy of peak demand leading to further blackouts in the state In addition to the supply and demand imbalance there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis First the states regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market The spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile The way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo ng term medium term and short term to reduce exposure to this volatility I n California state regulation prevented this strategy This would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th e most volatile interest rate environment imaginable Everything was fine while the power surplus persisted but when shortages ensued every megawat t was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price Second retail markets were not deregulated Regulated retail rates remain ed in effect and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa le prices in

this debate has generated more heat than light We want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on California energy issues What happened in California The source of Californias current problem is as straightforward as supp ly and demand Californias economy grew percent since This incr eased the demand for electricity by percent At the same time regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state So demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added The resul t predictably is a shortage This summer peak capacity will be about percent shy of peak demand leading to further blackouts in the state In addition to the supply and demand imbalance there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis First the states regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market The spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile The way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo ng term medium term and short term to reduce exposure to this volatility I n California state regulation prevented this strategy This would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th e most volatile interest rate environment imaginable Everything was fine while the power surplus persisted but when shortages ensued every megawat t was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price Second retail markets were not deregulated Regulated retail rates remain ed in effect and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa le prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate They are now nearly bankrupt In short Californias problems were caused by regulation not deregulat ion Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market prevented new generation from being built and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices At the time California was developing its

Unfortunately this debate has generated more heat than light We want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on California energy issues What happened in California The source of Californias current problem is as straightforward as supp ly and demand Californias economy grew percent since This incr eased the demand for electricity by percent At the same time regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state So demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added The resul t predictably is a shortage This summer peak capacity will be about percent shy of peak demand leading to further blackouts in the state In addition to the supply and demand imbalance there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis First the states regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market The spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile The way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo ng term medium term and short term to reduce exposure to this volatility I n California state regulation prevented this strategy This would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th e most volatile interest rate environment imaginable Everything was fine while the power surplus persisted but when shortages ensued every megawat t was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price Second retail markets were not deregulated Regulated retail rates remain ed in effect and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa le prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate They are now nearly bankrupt In short Californias problems were caused by regulation not deregulat ion Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market prevented new generation from being built and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices At the time California was developing its restructuring plan Enron warned the states policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives w hich if adopted would have averted the current crisis Enrons Role Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f ix the problem Power sellers including Enron have been vilified by the politicians and the media Here are the facts Other than a small amount of wind power Enron is not a generator in the state of California Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the same market available to other California purchasers Because we are a market maker not a generator we are not biased toward high prices We ar e interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc ts for our customers As a seller to enduse markets in the state we provided protection from the problems the states utilities and their customers now face We protected and still protect our customers from price volatility You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on the open market Early reports mischaracterized this as a turnback of our customers to the utilities Here are the facts As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California market it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct ly from the utilities This decision reduced EESs market price risk by allowing EES to access lower utility rates EES did not terminate any customer contracts and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them with other energyrelated products and services including assistance in reducing the demand for power particularly at peak times Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its crisis Enron continues to sign up customers in the state and Enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western power markets Enrons primary business is managing risk for our custom ers with solutions customized to meet their needs There has never been more demand for our products and services The Solution The solution to Californias crisis is also straightforward In summary the state must increase supply reduce demand reduce reliance on the spot mark et and shore up the financial stability of the states utilities Increasing Supply Californias process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of Byzantine Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les s than a year In California it often takes to years California simpl y must streamline this process Ironically while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants which emit times as much NOx California can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities Reducing Demand Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is An open retail market would trigger demand responses which would balance supply and deman d at lower prices than today California should fully open its retail market Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market In a truly deregulated market customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term fixedprice basis The state has instead left procurement in the han ds of the utilities which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the ir price risk Restoring the Financial Integrity of the States Institutions The utilities in California are not paying their bills This has led to greater uncertainty in the market higher costs and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions California must permit its utilities to recov er their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed Just as important as doing these things the state must avoid policies that while politically attractive do not fix the problem or even make matters worse Price caps have been proposed They dont work have never work ed and they will not work here Price caps succeed only in creating shortages which then have to be allocated among competing users Imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining for example whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall ey or Silicon Valley Price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in California There is no reason to believe and every reason to doubt that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in constructing operating and maintaining assets This will also result in California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation which the private sector can do instead of education road s and other public goods which the private sector cannot do As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t he crisis from the media its important for you to know this We at Enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state

state will be more effective than free markets at investing in constructing operating and maintaining assets This will also result in California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and

this debate has generated more heat than light We want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on California energy issues What happened in California The source of Californias current problem is as straightforward as supp ly and demand Californias economy grew percent since This incr eased the demand for electricity by percent At the same time regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state So demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added The resul t predictably is a shortage This summer peak capacity will be about percent shy of peak demand leading to further blackouts in the state In addition to the supply and demand imbalance there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis First the states regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market The spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile The way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo ng term medium term and short term to reduce exposure to this volatility I n California state regulation prevented this strategy This would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th e most volatile interest rate environment imaginable Everything was fine while the power surplus persisted but when shortages ensued every megawat t was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price Second retail markets were not deregulated Regulated retail rates remain ed in effect and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa le prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate They are now nearly bankrupt In short Californias problems were caused by regulation not deregulat ion Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market prevented new generation from being built and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices At the time California was developing its restructuring plan Enron warned the states policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives w hich if adopted would have averted the current crisis Enrons Role Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f ix the problem Power sellers including Enron have been vilified by the politicians and the media Here are the facts Other than a small amount of wind power Enron is not a generator in the state of California Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the same market available to other California purchasers Because we are a market maker not a generator we are not biased toward high prices We ar e interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc ts for our customers As a seller to enduse markets in the state we provided protection from the problems the states utilities and their customers now face We protected and still protect our customers from price volatility You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on the open market Early reports mischaracterized this as a turnback of our customers to the utilities Here are the facts As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California market it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct ly from the utilities This decision reduced EESs market price risk by allowing EES to access lower utility rates EES did not terminate any customer contracts and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them with other energyrelated products and services including assistance in reducing the demand for power particularly at peak times Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its crisis Enron continues to sign up customers in the state and Enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western power markets Enrons primary business is managing risk for our custom ers with solutions customized to meet their needs There has never been more demand for our products and services The Solution The solution to Californias crisis is also straightforward In summary the state must increase supply reduce demand reduce reliance on the spot mark et and shore up the financial stability of the states utilities Increasing Supply Californias process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of Byzantine Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les s than a year In California it often takes to years California simpl y must streamline this process Ironically while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants which emit times as much NOx California can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities Reducing Demand Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is An open retail market would trigger demand responses which would balance supply and deman d at lower prices than today California should fully open its retail market Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market In a truly deregulated market customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term fixedprice basis The state has instead left procurement in the han ds of the utilities which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the ir price risk Restoring the Financial Integrity of the States Institutions The utilities in California are not paying their bills This has led to greater uncertainty in the market higher costs and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions California must permit its utilities to recov er their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed Just as important as doing these things the state must avoid policies that while politically attractive do not fix the problem or even make matters worse Price caps have been proposed They dont work have never work ed and they will not work here Price caps succeed only in creating shortages which then have to be allocated among competing users

this debate has generated more heat than light We want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on California energy issues What happened in California The source of Californias current problem is as straightforward as supp ly and demand Californias economy grew percent since This incr eased the demand for electricity by percent At the same time regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state So demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added The resul t predictably is a shortage This summer peak capacity will be about percent shy of peak demand leading to further blackouts in the state In addition to the supply and demand imbalance there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis First the states regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market The spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile The way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo ng term medium term and short term to reduce exposure to this volatility I n California state regulation prevented this strategy This would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th e most volatile interest rate environment imaginable Everything was fine while the power surplus persisted but when shortages ensued every megawat t was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price Second retail markets were not deregulated Regulated retail rates remain ed in effect and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa le prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate They are now nearly bankrupt In short Californias problems were caused by regulation not deregulat ion Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market prevented new generation from being built and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices At the time California was developing its restructuring plan Enron warned the states policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives w hich if adopted would have averted the current crisis Enrons Role Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f ix the problem Power sellers including Enron have been vilified by the politicians and the media Here are the facts Other than a small amount of wind power Enron is not a generator in the state of California Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the same market available to other California purchasers Because we are a market maker not a generator we are not biased toward high prices We ar e interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc ts for our customers As a seller to enduse markets in the state we provided protection from the problems the states utilities and their customers now face We protected and still protect our customers from price volatility You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on the open market Early reports mischaracterized this as a turnback of our customers to the utilities Here are the facts As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California market it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct ly from the utilities This decision reduced EESs market price risk by allowing EES to access lower utility rates EES did not terminate any customer contracts and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them with other energyrelated products and services including assistance in reducing the demand for power particularly at peak times Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its crisis Enron continues to sign up customers in the state and Enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western power markets Enrons primary business is managing risk for our custom ers with solutions customized to meet their needs There has never been more demand for our products and services The Solution The solution to Californias crisis is also straightforward In summary the state must increase supply reduce demand reduce reliance on the spot mark et and shore up the financial stability of the states utilities Increasing Supply Californias process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of Byzantine Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les s than a year In California it often takes to years California simpl y must streamline this process Ironically while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants which emit times as much NOx California can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities Reducing Demand Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is An open retail market would trigger demand responses which would balance supply and deman d at lower prices than today California should fully open its retail market Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market In a truly deregulated market customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term fixedprice basis The state has instead left procurement in the han ds of the utilities which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the ir price risk Restoring the Financial Integrity of the States Institutions The utilities in California are not paying their bills This has led to greater uncertainty in the market higher costs and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions California must permit its utilities to recov er their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed Just as important as doing these things the state must avoid policies that while politically attractive do not fix the problem or even make matters worse Price caps have been proposed They dont work have never work ed and they will not work here Price caps succeed only in creating shortages which then have to be allocated among competing users Imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining for example whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall ey or Silicon Valley Price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in California There is no reason to believe and every reason to doubt that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in constructing operating and maintaining assets This will also result in California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation which the private sector can do instead of education road s and other public goods which the private sector cannot do As you are approached by people outside the company or are

cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities Reducing Demand Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is An open retail market would trigger demand responses which would balance supply and deman d at lower prices than today California should fully open its retail market Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market In a truly deregulated market customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term fixedprice basis The state has instead left procurement in the han ds of the utilities which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the ir price risk Restoring the Financial Integrity of the States Institutions The utilities in California are not paying their bills This has led to greater uncertainty in the market higher costs and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions California must permit its utilities to recov er their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed Just as important as doing these things the state must avoid policies that while politically attractive do not fix the problem or even make matters worse Price caps have been proposed They dont work have never work ed and they will not work here Price caps succeed only in creating shortages which then have to be allocated among competing users Imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining for example whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall ey or Silicon Valley Price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in California There is no reason to believe and every reason to doubt that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in constructing operating and maintaining assets This will also result in California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation which the private sector can do instead of education road s and other public goods which the private sector cannot do As you are approached by people outside the company or are

this debate has generated more heat than light We want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on California energy issues What happened in California The source of Californias current problem is as straightforward as supp ly and demand Californias economy grew percent since This incr eased the demand for electricity by percent At the same time regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state So demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added The resul t predictably is a shortage This summer peak capacity will be about percent shy of peak demand leading to further blackouts in the state In addition to the supply and demand imbalance there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis First the states regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market The spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile The way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo ng term medium term and short term to reduce exposure to this volatility I n California state regulation prevented this strategy This would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th e most volatile interest rate environment imaginable Everything was fine while the power surplus persisted but when shortages ensued every megawat t was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price Second retail markets were not deregulated Regulated retail rates remain ed in effect and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa le prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate They are now nearly bankrupt In short Californias problems were caused by regulation not deregulat ion Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market prevented new generation from being built and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices At the time California was developing its restructuring plan Enron warned the states policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives w hich if adopted would have averted the current crisis Enrons Role Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f ix the problem Power sellers including Enron have been vilified by the politicians and the media Here are the facts Other than a small amount of wind power Enron is not a generator in the state of California Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the same market available to other California purchasers Because we are a market maker not a generator we are not biased toward high prices We ar e interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc ts for our customers As a seller to enduse markets in the state we provided protection from the problems the states utilities and their customers now face We protected and still protect our customers from price volatility You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on the open market Early reports mischaracterized this as a turnback of our customers to the utilities Here are the facts As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California market it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct ly from the utilities This decision reduced EESs market price risk by allowing EES to access lower utility rates EES did not terminate any customer contracts and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them with other energyrelated products and services including assistance in reducing the demand for power

risks and capture opportunities in Western power markets Enrons primary business is managing risk for our custom ers with solutions customized to meet their needs There has never been more demand for our products and services The Solution The solution to Californias crisis is also straightforward In summary the state must increase supply reduce demand reduce reliance on the spot mark et and shore

this debate has generated more heat than light We want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on California energy issues What happened in California The source of Californias current problem is as straightforward as supp ly and demand Californias economy grew percent since This incr eased the demand for electricity by percent At the same time regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state So demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added The resul t predictably is a shortage This summer peak capacity will be about percent shy of peak demand leading to further blackouts in the state In addition to the supply and demand imbalance there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis First the states regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market The spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile The way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo ng term medium term and short term to reduce exposure to this volatility I n California state regulation prevented this strategy This would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th e most volatile interest rate environment imaginable Everything was fine while the power surplus persisted but when shortages ensued every megawat t was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price Second retail markets were not deregulated Regulated retail rates remain ed in effect and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa le prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate They are now nearly bankrupt In short Californias problems were caused by regulation not deregulat ion Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market prevented new generation from being built and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices At the time California was developing its restructuring plan Enron warned the states policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives w hich if adopted would have averted the current crisis Enrons Role Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f ix the problem Power sellers including Enron have been vilified by the politicians and the media Here are the facts Other than a small amount of wind power Enron is not a generator in the state of California Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the same market available to other California purchasers Because we are a market maker not a generator we are not biased toward high prices We ar e interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc ts for our customers As a seller to enduse markets in the state we provided protection from the problems the states utilities and their customers now face We protected and still protect our customers from price volatility You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on the open market Early reports mischaracterized this as a turnback of our customers to the utilities Here are the facts As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California market it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct ly from the utilities This decision reduced EESs market price risk by allowing EES to access lower utility rates EES did not terminate any customer contracts and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them with other energyrelated products and services including assistance in reducing the demand for power particularly at peak times Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its crisis Enron continues to sign up customers in the state and Enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western power markets Enrons primary business is managing risk for our custom ers with solutions customized to meet their needs There has never been more demand for our products and services The Solution The solution to Californias crisis is also straightforward In summary the state must increase supply reduce demand reduce reliance on the spot mark et and shore up the financial stability of the states utilities Increasing Supply Californias process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of Byzantine Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les s than a year In California it often takes to years California simpl y must streamline this process Ironically while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants which emit times as much NOx California can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities Reducing Demand Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is An open retail market would trigger demand responses which would balance supply and deman d at lower prices than today California should fully open its retail market Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market In a truly deregulated market customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term fixedprice basis The state has instead left procurement in the han ds of the utilities which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the ir price risk Restoring the Financial Integrity of the States Institutions The utilities in California are not paying their bills This has led to greater uncertainty in the market higher costs and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions California must permit its utilities to recov er their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed Just as important as doing these things the state must avoid policies that while politically attractive do not fix the problem or even make matters worse Price caps have been proposed They dont work have never work ed and they will not work here Price caps succeed only in creating shortages which then have to be allocated among competing users Imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining for example whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall ey or Silicon Valley Price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in California There is no reason to believe and every reason to doubt that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in constructing operating and maintaining assets This will also result in California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation which the private sector can do instead of education road s and other public goods which the private sector cannot do As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t he crisis from the media its important for you to know this We at Enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state
