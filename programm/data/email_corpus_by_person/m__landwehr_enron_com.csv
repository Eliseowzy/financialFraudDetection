occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process Although the panel notice showed that state commissioners would attend upon arriving in the hearing room we found that state commissioners were there and ready to claim their minutes of fame It was a long morning I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts Approximately to of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process that FERC was moving too quickly and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens In particular the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric While many would think that the session was extremely negative our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearingallowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis Heres some individual comments Catherine RileyMarylandshe started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens she was way overboard in the dramatics department She then stated that she was not at the meeting to help you FERC backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record It went on like this for about minutes The good part is that she was so personally negative that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her Sam ErvinNOrth Carolinahe was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens that customer choice is never coming to his state so he will never benefit from an RTO that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO and I bet if they do hell work to change the statutes and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC His comments were also pretty brutal but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor Arnetta McRaeDelwareshe kept on saying show me where the benefits for consumers are She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order Rory McMinnNew Mexicorepeatedly talked about how the west was different how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were Carl WoodCaliforniatried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments He delivered the same messages that weve been hearing foreverFERC should have acted sooner on price caps etc etc Glen ThomasPennsylvaniahe was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring its energy system into the new centurythat by opening its markets they have had an explosion in green power they have reduced costs all across the state etc He was very supportive of PJM makes sense because its in his back yard and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance Judy JonesOhiowas very parochial in her discussion but echoed Don Svandas comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed Ed GArveyMinnesotahe got the gold star for the day After very very lengthly comments from about commissioners he took about minute and said FERCjust get it donein essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward Other Commissioners who talked were ArthurConnecticut HadleyIndiana HuelsmanKentucky Nugent Maine all on the positive side Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do From the FERC commissioner standpoint the gold star went to Massey After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didnt feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back saying the there has been years of process and he wants a process that comes to an endyouve been talking for years and never could agree Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting Sue

Subject FW RTO Week Summary of Standards and Practices Panel Johnthis is the recap from Thursday afternoon of RTO week Although Andy did not focus on it in his report there was an individual who sat on the panel from Missouri that did a fantastic job of supporting FERC and market postitions despite the fact that he is a public power guy His name is Bil l Burks and he is the Associate General Manager of the City Utilities of Sp ringfield Missouri In his comments he stated that his utility was whole heartedly supporting FERC moving forward to push for on RTO and then went on to talk about how Missouri is going to continue to suffer from seams iss ues if FERC doesnt stick to their guns on just a few major RTOs He stated that flexible standardization would not work and that the FERC should put out a platform of standardized tariffs and if there was some uti lity or group of stakeholders that thought they were special or unique or d ifferent then the burden of proff should be on them to petition FERC for a n exemption not the other way around Im thinking that this gentlemen would be an excellent choice for a committ ee hearing if you have the opportunity to suggest folks to testify in the f uture IF you are able to get transcripts from RTO week it might also be w orth it to review his comments and pass them on as appropriate Original Message From Rodriquez Andy Sent Thu

Michael Perrino Dave Maurer L uiz Hueter Barbara A Landwehr Susan M Hoatson Tom Novosel Sarah Nicolay Christi L Yeung Charles Cc Subject RE RTO Week Summary of Standards and Practices Panel RTO Week Day October Afternoon Session Standardizing Markets Business and Other Practices Panelists for this discussion were Sarah Barpoulis PGE National Energy Group William P Boswell GISB Bill Burkes substituting for David J Chr istiano City Utilities of Springfield Missouri David N Cook NERC Gene ral Counsel Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection LeRoy Koppendrayer Minnes ota Public Utilities Commission and Marty Mennes Florida Power Light Co mpany General Observations The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time Massey left la te in the afternoon FERC Staff was active in the discussion however t he commissioners were very active as well asking perhaps as much as of all questions There was a general consensus that standards were needed much discussion focused simply on how much and by who The Commission seeme d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo rward and how far they needed to go Panelists urged the need to mover for ward as quickly as possible but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward There was d iscussion on identifying which industry group NERC or GISB would take the reins in the future On an interesting tangential note there was noticea ble conflict between NERC and GISB with veiled insults between the two org anizations somewhat common during the discussions FERC Deliverables A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne eded from the Commission Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical The first major topic was How many RTOs What is their scope All panel ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b y FERC in strong definitive language N o one offered any specific langua ge but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement The next topic was What will be standard market design Panelists varie d on this but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent Some urged f or one mandatory design for North America one supported a set of rigid sta ndard designs one supported a single design with requests for exceptions followed by an indepth review process and one seemed to prefer the curre nt situation The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha t the industry needed to move forward They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions asking questions like Do we need to issue a MegaOrder that addresses all these issues and How much detail do you need us to provide General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas Kormos and Burkes went so far as t o say FERC should Mandate as much as they felt comfortable and then go a little further Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea bu t in general did not oppose the concept citing only general warnings and t he need for cautious investigation One item of interest Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th e RTO Design and RTO Implementation section would address many of the que stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design Korm os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry The se ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote and asked the following questions Congestion Management When Operational Security Violations occu r how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i s nonetheless efficient Will LMP based systems be standard or will there be others that must be accommodated Transmission Service Are transmission services required to sch edule covered schedules only or are they risk management tools protect ing from congestion charges both covered and uncovered schedules are a llowed Loop Flows Are contractpath based or flowbased transmission services appropriate If contractpath based how are parallel path issues to be addressed Grandfathered Transmission Service Should contracts existing pr ior to RTO development be transferred or is there an equitable way to reti re those contracts Are there other solutions Energy Imbalance Markets How are imbalance markets to function Will they serve as realtime energy markets support unbalanced schedules be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service require balanced sche dules or will they be required at all Ancillary Services Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services required to schedule or will they be treated primarily as fina ncial instruments protecting against realtime POLR charges Losses Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce ss or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs but technical ly unwieldy NonJurisdictionals How are nonjurisdictionals to be integrate d into the new world Should systems be designed with the assumption that nonjurisdictional will be part of an RTO Or should they be designed to t reat each NJE as a separate entity Hopefully FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica l questions in an assertive manner and give some solid direction in which to move Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions pointing out that vague answers ie do congestion management will t ake a year or two to resolve but specific answers ie LMP with financi al hedging instruments will take only months The Commission asked Mike about moving forward and he told them that effectively it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed Now for a funny point One of the commissioners I think Breathitt refer red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest Kormos flat out said My profession is understanding how power systems work and I dont believe that that statement is true He then backpedaled a bit and said t hat it would need more study but he stood by his statement that the assert ion by the Northwest interests was false NERC and GISB A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standardse tting organization Massey went so far as to ask Are we looking at a bea uty contest between NERC and GISB Cook and Boswell then went into severa l short polite jabs at each others organizations Other participants cont inually reiterated the need for ONE INDEPENDENT organization Interesting ly Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI SB while Cook preferred to only talk about the new structure of NERC and did not focus on its history Brownell offered some nottoosubtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions ie were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder GISB was easily a ble to say they were not but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation Poin t Brownell Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC playing Dave Cooks yesm an He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERCs suppos ed successes such as TLR and ETag If staffers have tenure they will likely remember that these successes have not been so successful resulti ng in several filings and interventions We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues but general consensus was that I could not be done There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISBEISB The arguments began winding down after a some time and Boswell strongly ur ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward NERC s omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position In general I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top Let me know if you have any questions Andy Rodriquez Regulatory Affairs Enron Corp

week Although Andy did not focus on it in his report there was an individual who sat on the panel from Missouri that did a fantastic job of supporting FERC and market postitions despite the fact that he is a public power guy His name is Bil l Burks and he is the Associate General Manager of the City Utilities of Sp ringfield Missouri In his comments he stated that his utility was whole heartedly supporting FERC moving forward to push for on RTO and then went on to talk about how Missouri is going to continue to suffer from seams iss ues if FERC doesnt stick to their guns on just a few major RTOs He stated that flexible standardization would not work and that the FERC should put out a platform of standardized tariffs and if there was some uti lity or group of stakeholders that thought they were special or unique or d ifferent then the burden of proff should be on them to petition FERC for a n exemption not the other way around Im thinking that this gentlemen would be an excellent

Charles Cc Subject RE RTO Week Summary of Standards and Practices Panel RTO Week Day October Afternoon Session Standardizing Markets Business and Other Practices Panelists for this discussion were Sarah Barpoulis PGE National Energy Group William P Boswell GISB Bill Burkes substituting for David J Chr istiano City Utilities of Springfield Missouri David N Cook NERC Gene ral Counsel Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection LeRoy Koppendrayer Minnes ota Public Utilities Commission and Marty Mennes Florida Power Light Co mpany General Observations The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time Massey left la te in the afternoon FERC Staff was active in the discussion however t he commissioners were very active as well asking perhaps as much as of all questions There was a general consensus that standards were needed much discussion focused simply on how much and by who The Commission seeme d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo rward and how far they needed to go Panelists urged the need to mover for ward as quickly as possible but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward There was d iscussion on identifying which industry group NERC or GISB would take the reins in the future On an interesting tangential note there was noticea ble conflict between NERC and GISB with veiled insults between the two org anizations somewhat common during the discussions FERC Deliverables A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne eded from the Commission Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical The first major topic was How many RTOs What is their scope All panel ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b y FERC in strong definitive language N o one offered any specific langua ge but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement The next topic was What will be standard market design Panelists varie d on this but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent Some urged f or one mandatory design for North America one supported a set of rigid sta ndard designs one supported a single design with requests for exceptions followed by an indepth review process and one seemed to prefer the curre nt situation The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha t the industry needed to move forward They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions asking questions like Do we need to issue a MegaOrder that addresses all these issues and How much detail do you need us to provide General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas Kormos and Burkes went so far as t o say FERC should Mandate as much as they felt comfortable and then go a little further Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea bu t in general did not oppose the concept citing only general warnings and t he need for cautious investigation One item of interest Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th e RTO Design and RTO Implementation section would address many of the que stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design Korm os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry The se ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote and asked the following questions Congestion Management When Operational Security Violations occu r how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i s nonetheless efficient Will LMP based systems be standard or will there be others that must be accommodated Transmission Service Are transmission services required to sch edule covered schedules only or are they risk management tools protect ing from congestion charges both covered and uncovered schedules are a llowed Loop Flows Are contractpath based or flowbased transmission services appropriate If contractpath based how are parallel path issues to be addressed Grandfathered Transmission Service Should contracts existing pr ior to RTO development be transferred or is there an equitable way to reti re those contracts Are there other solutions Energy Imbalance Markets How are imbalance markets to function Will they serve as realtime energy markets support unbalanced schedules be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service require balanced sche dules or will they be required at all Ancillary Services Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services required to schedule or will they be treated primarily as fina ncial instruments protecting against realtime POLR charges Losses Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce ss or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs but technical ly unwieldy NonJurisdictionals How are nonjurisdictionals to be integrate d into the new world Should systems be designed with the assumption that nonjurisdictional will be part of an RTO Or should they be designed to t reat each NJE as a separate entity Hopefully FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica l questions in an assertive manner and give some solid direction in which to move Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions pointing out that vague answers ie do congestion management will t ake a year or two to resolve but specific answers ie LMP with financi al hedging instruments will take only months The Commission asked Mike about moving forward and he told them that effectively it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed Now for a funny point One of the commissioners I think Breathitt refer red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest Kormos flat out said My profession is understanding how power systems work and I dont believe that that statement is true He then backpedaled a bit and said t hat it would need more study but he stood by his statement that the assert ion by the Northwest interests was false NERC and GISB A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standardse tting organization Massey went so far as to ask Are we looking at a bea uty contest between NERC and GISB Cook and Boswell then went into severa l short polite jabs at each others organizations Other participants cont inually reiterated the need for ONE INDEPENDENT organization Interesting ly Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI SB while Cook preferred to only talk about the new structure of NERC and did not focus on its history Brownell offered some nottoosubtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions ie were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder GISB was easily a ble to say they were not but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation Poin t Brownell Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC playing Dave Cooks yesm an He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERCs suppos ed successes such as TLR and ETag If staffers have tenure they will likely remember that these successes have not been so successful resulti ng in several filings and interventions We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues but general consensus was that I could not be done There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISBEISB The arguments began winding down after a some time and Boswell strongly ur ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward NERC s omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position In general I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top Let me know if you have any questions Andy Rodriquez Regulatory Affairs Enron Corp

occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process Although the panel notice showed that state commissioners would attend upon arriving in the hearing room we found that state commissioners were there and ready to claim their minutes of fame It was a long morning I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts Approximately to of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process that FERC was moving too quickly and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens In particular the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric While many would think that the session was extremely negative our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearingallowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis Heres some individual comments Catherine RileyMarylandshe started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens she was way overboard in the dramatics department She then stated that she was not at the meeting to help you FERC backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record It went on like this for about minutes The good part is that she was so personally negative that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her Sam ErvinNOrth Carolinahe was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens that customer choice is never coming to his state so he will never benefit from an RTO that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO and I bet if they do hell work to change the statutes and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC His comments were also pretty brutal but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor Arnetta McRaeDelwareshe kept on saying show me where the benefits for consumers are She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order Rory

uncertainty would be removed Ed GArveyMinnesotahe got the gold star for the day After very very lengthly comments from about commissioners he took about minute and said FERCjust get it donein essence

negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do From the FERC commissioner standpoint the gold star went to Massey After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didnt feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough he stated that he was going to

occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process Although the panel notice showed that state commissioners would attend upon arriving in the hearing room we found that state commissioners were there and ready to claim their minutes of fame It was a long morning I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts Approximately to of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process that FERC was moving too quickly and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens In particular the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric While many would think that the session was extremely negative our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearingallowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis Heres some individual comments Catherine RileyMarylandshe started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens she was way overboard in the dramatics department She then stated that she was not at the meeting to help you FERC backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record It went on like this for about minutes The good part is that she was so personally negative that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her Sam ErvinNOrth Carolinahe was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens that customer choice is never coming to his state so he will never benefit from an RTO that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO and I bet if they do hell work to change the statutes and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC His comments were also pretty brutal but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor Arnetta McRaeDelwareshe kept on saying show me where the benefits for consumers are She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order Rory McMinnNew Mexicorepeatedly talked about how the west was different how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were Carl WoodCaliforniatried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments He delivered the same messages that weve been hearing foreverFERC should have acted sooner on price caps etc etc Glen ThomasPennsylvaniahe was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring its energy system into the new centurythat by opening its markets they have had an explosion in green power they have reduced costs all across the state etc He was very supportive of PJM makes sense because its in his back yard and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance Judy JonesOhiowas very parochial in her discussion but echoed Don Svandas comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed Ed GArveyMinnesotahe got the gold star for the day After very very lengthly comments from about commissioners he took about minute and said FERCjust get it donein essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward Other Commissioners who talked were ArthurConnecticut HadleyIndiana HuelsmanKentucky Nugent Maine all on the positive side Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do From the FERC commissioner standpoint the gold star went to Massey After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didnt feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back saying the there has been years of process and he wants a process that comes to an endyouve been talking for years and never could agree Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting Sue

Tom Micheletti of Exclesior Energy Inc regarding their propos al for the Mesaba Energy Project I basically went over the questions that I had expressed to you guys on Friday Ultimately they will need a tremen dous amount of political capital to get all the pieces of the deal included in legislation Please keep in mind that the Senate in Minnesota is contro lled by the Democrats and the House is controlled by the Republicans The Governor is independent and the primary agencies in his administration tha t would be involved in approvingpromoting this deal would the the Pollutio n Control Agency PCA the Dept of COmmerce the Enviromental Quality Board EQB and to some degree the Public Utilities Commission PUC The generation piece of their project is probably quite doable from a regul atory and legislative standpoint The site that they have identified and I understand they may have other possible sites is in a district of the state that is currently economically disavantaged The Iron Range legislat ive delegation is strong at the Capitol and the Majority leader of the Sen ate is from the Iron Range Roger Moe Because of the amount of jobs tha t would be created and the fact that the project would be considered a cle an fuel would go a long way to allowing regulatory approvals and incentive monies such as the funding proposed by the IRRRB and other state agencies Although we didnt specifically discuss tax incentives there could very possibly be some assistance provided as well There would most likely be an appetite for including language in a legislative package to either exempt or fast track the generation siting process that is currently cumbersome in the state The much larger issue is the transmission build out My understanding is t hat Excelsiors current strategy is to try to include in legislation a desi gnation of the right of way for the transmission to be built from the Iron Range into the load centersMinneapolis and St Paul In essence they hop e to have legislation that would circumvent the current siting statute and rules for transmission Their reasoning is that all of the Democrats would vote for this proposal and they would just need to pick up a handful of Re publicans There are several concerns about this reasoningthe enviromenta l community the local citiescounties that the line would run thru the n eighborhood groupsjust to name a few While I agree that most Democrats w ould vote party line because of jobs and I think that even more jobs are l ost in the next months due to economic downturns in the taconitesteel a nd paperpulp markets some of them will get picked off by the constituenc y groups Excelsior would need to get buy off from these groups which w ill be expensive hence the wind proposal in order to obtain their suppor t at the legislature This would be difficult A fall back position if Exc elsior was not able to circumvent the current siting and permitting process would be to have the legislation fast track the process The other significant issue is the PPA My understanding is the Excelsior invisions legislation that would force the utility most likely XcelNSP because they are the only IOU that has needs identified to buy the power u nder a PPA and that the rate or at least the parameters that the rate must fall within would be actually included in legislative language This is go ing to raise all kinds of protests from various groups not the least of wh ich would be the industrial buyers in the state who are active in PUC regul atory proceedingsthey will argue that they will bear the brunt of higher rates that would be incurred by such a contract rather then Xcel sourcing t hru a competitive bid From a simplistic standpoint it would seem that a better route would be to get the munis and coops in the state to bid on the output and avoid the significant obstacles that PPA language in the legisl ation would encounter Exclesior has not yet gotten strong sign off from either party or the Gover nors office They have met with the Senate leadership and have gotten a p reliminary blessing They have had meetings with Governor Venturas office and his Administrative agencies and my sense is that they will get some b acking from the PCA and the Dept of Commerce They may run into trouble wi th the PUC and the EQB Ultimately though if they convince Ventura the agencies will fall into line They have not yet pitched the idea to the Republicans They have hired a republican lobb yist who is knowledgeable in energy fights Somy assessment at this time would be as follows the development team has some credibilityJorgenson has a reputatio n as a good developer Michaletti is well known at the capitolhe has some strong ties to the range delegation but he also has some legislators that dont like him at all especially those on the enviromental side and some women They would need to supplement their efforts with one or more outsi de lobbyists they still have alot of work to do to see if the project is politica lly palatable to a wide range of constituencies The democrats and unions are the only natural constituencies for them The legislative session runs from January to May My bet would be that it would take sessions to get a deal of this size done unless that have STRONG support from the democra ts and republicans going into January wild card could be the munis and coops as well as the economy If t he munis and coops buy into the concept and want the transmission line buil t in order to serve their needs they have political grass roots in each an d every county of the state Minnesota has approx munis and coops If the economy takes an even bigger nose dive Democrats will be forced to support whether there are environmental consequences to the tranmission li nes or not I will try to call you in the morning to discuss Hope this is helpful and I am happy to discuss with other members of your team and obviously willin g to help in implementing strategy if you decide to move forward with a str onger look at the project

week Although Andy did not focus on it in his report there was an individual who sat on the panel from Missouri that did a fantastic job of supporting FERC and market postitions despite the fact that he is a public power guy His name is Bil l Burks and he is the Associate General Manager of the City Utilities of Sp ringfield Missouri In his comments he stated that his utility was whole heartedly supporting FERC moving forward to push for on RTO and then went on to talk about how Missouri is going to continue to suffer from seams iss ues if FERC doesnt stick to their guns on just a few major RTOs He stated that flexible standardization would not work and that the FERC should put out a platform of standardized tariffs and if there was some uti lity or group of stakeholders that thought they were special or unique or d ifferent then the burden of proff should be on them to petition FERC for a n exemption not the other way around Im thinking that this gentlemen would be an excellent choice for a committ ee hearing if you have the opportunity to suggest folks to testify in the f uture IF you are able to get transcripts from RTO week it might also be w orth it to review his

James D Subject FW RTO Week Summary of Standards and Practices Panel Johnthis is the recap from Thursday afternoon of RTO week Although Andy did not focus on it in his report there was an individual who sat on the panel from Missouri that did a fantastic job of supporting FERC and market postitions despite the fact that he is a public power guy His name is Bil l Burks and he is the Associate General Manager of the City Utilities of Sp ringfield Missouri In his comments he stated that his utility was whole heartedly supporting FERC moving forward to push for on RTO and then went on to talk about how Missouri is going to continue to suffer from seams iss ues if FERC doesnt stick to their guns on just a few major RTOs He stated that flexible standardization would not work and that the FERC should put out a platform of standardized tariffs and if there was some uti lity or group of stakeholders that thought they were special or unique or d ifferent then the burden of proff should be on them to petition FERC for a n exemption not the other way around Im thinking that this gentlemen would be an excellent choice for a committ ee hearing if you have the opportunity to suggest folks

substituting for David J Chr istiano City Utilities of Springfield Missouri David N Cook NERC Gene ral Counsel Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection LeRoy Koppendrayer Minnes ota Public Utilities Commission and Marty Mennes Florida Power Light Co mpany General Observations The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time Massey left la te in the afternoon FERC Staff was active in the discussion however t he commissioners were very active as well asking perhaps as much as of all questions There was a general consensus that standards were needed much discussion focused simply on how much and by who The Commission seeme d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo rward and how far they needed to go Panelists urged the need to mover for ward as quickly as possible but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward There was d iscussion on identifying which industry group NERC or GISB would take the reins in the future On an interesting tangential note there was noticea ble conflict between NERC and GISB with veiled insults between the two org anizations somewhat common during the discussions FERC Deliverables A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne eded from the Commission Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical The first major topic was How many RTOs What is their scope All panel ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b y FERC in strong definitive language N o one offered any specific langua ge but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement The next topic was What will be standard market design Panelists varie d on this but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent Some urged f or one mandatory design for North America one supported a set of rigid sta ndard designs one supported a single design with requests for exceptions followed by an indepth review process and one seemed to prefer the curre nt situation The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha t the industry needed to move forward They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions asking questions like Do we need to issue a MegaOrder that addresses all these issues and How much detail do you need us to provide General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas Kormos and Burkes went so far as t o say FERC should Mandate as much as they felt comfortable and then go a little further Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea bu t in general did not oppose the concept citing only general warnings and t he need for cautious investigation One item of interest Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th e RTO Design and RTO Implementation section would address many of the que stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design Korm os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry The se ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote and asked the following questions Congestion Management When Operational Security Violations occu r how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i s nonetheless efficient Will LMP based systems be standard or will there be others that must be accommodated Transmission Service Are transmission services required to sch edule covered schedules only or are they risk management tools protect ing from congestion charges both covered and uncovered schedules are a llowed Loop Flows Are contractpath based or flowbased transmission services appropriate If contractpath based how are parallel path issues to be addressed Grandfathered Transmission Service Should contracts existing pr ior to RTO development be transferred or is there an equitable way to reti re those contracts Are there other solutions Energy Imbalance Markets How are imbalance markets to function Will they serve as realtime energy markets support unbalanced schedules be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service require balanced sche dules or will they be required at all Ancillary Services Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services required to schedule or will they be treated primarily as fina ncial instruments protecting against realtime POLR charges Losses Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce ss or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs but technical ly unwieldy NonJurisdictionals How are nonjurisdictionals to be integrate d into the new world Should systems be designed with the assumption that nonjurisdictional will be part of an RTO Or should they be designed to t reat each NJE as a separate entity Hopefully FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica l questions in an assertive manner and give some solid direction in which to move Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions pointing out that vague answers ie do congestion management will t ake a year or two to resolve but specific answers ie LMP with financi al hedging instruments will take only months The Commission asked Mike about moving forward and he told them that effectively it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed Now for a funny point One of the commissioners I think Breathitt refer red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest Kormos flat out said My profession is understanding how power systems work and I dont believe that that statement is true He then backpedaled a bit and said t hat it would need more study but he stood by his statement that the assert ion by the Northwest interests was false NERC and GISB A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standardse tting organization Massey went so far as to ask Are we looking at a bea uty contest between NERC and GISB Cook and Boswell then went into severa l short polite jabs at each others organizations Other participants cont inually reiterated the need for ONE INDEPENDENT organization Interesting ly Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI SB while Cook preferred to only talk about the new structure of NERC and did not focus on its history Brownell offered some nottoosubtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions ie were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder GISB was easily a ble to say they were not but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation Poin t Brownell Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC playing Dave Cooks yesm an He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERCs suppos ed successes such as TLR and ETag If staffers have tenure they will likely remember that these successes have not been so successful resulti ng in several filings and interventions We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues but general consensus was that I could not be done There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISBEISB The arguments began winding down after a some time and Boswell strongly ur ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward NERC s omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position In general I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top Let me know if you have any questions Andy Rodriquez Regulatory Affairs Enron Corp

Landwehr Susan M Hueter Barbara A Townsend Christopher J CHI Subject Crains Article October ComEd seeks rate hike for biz Second proposal spurs opposition among regulators Crains October By Steve Daniels mailto Commonwealth Edison Co is pressing for another big hike in its charges for delivering electricity to customers of rival power suppliers The Chicago utilitys Aug filing with federal regulators to nearly double transmission rates for carrying electricity over its longhaul highvoltage lines for these customers has triggered opposition from state regulators That request followed a June proposal for a increase in distribution charges for moving power through the utilitys more local lowervoltage wires Crains June That bid is subject to approval by the Illinois Commerce Commission ICC If approved the two rate hikes together will increase transmission and distribution costs by about for business customers that leave the utility for competing power suppliers Perhaps more important the new rates would clear the way for delivery charge increases of the same magnitude on all Chicagoarea power users in three years when a freeze on ComEds rates expires Transmission and distribution rates account for to of a typical business customers total power bill so a typical bill could rise as much as with these increases Apart from the bottomline hit to businesses ComEd competitors and local government officials also warn that the hikes could stymie the nascent competitive market because they could prevent alternative suppliers from offering savings from the utilitys bundled rate AES NewEnergy Inc the largest alternative supplier in Illinois with more than customers says of its customers will see their bills increase if both proposals are approved What this means is that large numbers of customers would be down to the point where bundled utility service is cheaper or its so close that they wouldnt bother choosing an alternative provider says Philip OConnor president of AES NewEnergys Chicago office You cannot have competition being viable when your base of potential customers is so small Arlene Juracek ComEd vicepresident of regulatory and strategic services counters that few businesses actually will pay higher rates in the short term because the rise in delivery charges will be offset in many cases by a corresponding decrease in transition fees paid to the utility when customers use another supplier The Aug transmission rate proposal filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC surprised the Illinois Commerce Commission which asked FERC two weeks ago to block the rate hike The latest rate hike proposal incorporates a proposed change in ComEds account methodology in which the utility would wipe off its books more than million of accumulated depreciation of transmission assets and ask ratepayers to shoulder that investment again Unjust and unreasonable In its filing with FERC the ICC said the proposed change would result in artificially high transmission rates and an unjust and unreasonable windfall to ComEd at the expense of transmission ratepayers Theyre essentially changing the rules of the game halfway through the game says ICC Commissioner Terry Harvill ComEd responds that FERC itself in an order last year pushing utilities to combine their transmission assets into large regional networks said utilities could consider changing the accounting method ComEd believes we have an obligation to the shareholders of parent company Exelon Corp to receive compensation in accordance with what is permissible by law says Steven T Naumann ComEd vicepresident in charge of transmission services The commission will determine if this is what they meant in their order or if it is not what they meant Meanwhile the city of Chicago frustrated by ComEds resistance to sharing detailed financial data is poised to ask the ICC formally to order an outside audit of ComEds books for The state attorney generals office and the Cook County states attorneys office are joining the city in the petition which could be filed as early as Monday sources say The audit which ComEd opposes would be aimed at separating ordinary maintenance and improvement costs from the extraordinary measures ComEd took in and to beef up its distribution system after acknowledging it had neglected that infrastructure during the previous two decades The behindthescenes skirmishing spotlights how seriously local government officials are taking the regulatory proceedings While the new rates affect only those customers in the competitive market theyll be the benchmark used for the power delivery charges all other ComEd customers will pay in when the utilitys bundled rates are no longer frozen Setting the rules The company is very much aware of the fact that the rules for the future are getting set now says William Abolt commissioner of the citys Department of Environment Basically the next months are going to set an awful lot of the fees for the future Mr Abolt says the audit request is one option the city has to pressure ComEd into opening its books but says it wouldnt be necessary if the company agreed to do so voluntarily A ComEd executive says the data will be made available to those who sign a blanket confidentiality agreement which intervenors in the case including the city arent likely to sign Ms Juracek of ComEd says the utility already has sifted extraordinary costs associated with its billion infrastructure upgrade out of the rate base But she allows that most of those are minimal treetrimming expenses Large amounts of overtime paid to unionized workers as well as contractor expenses are included in the rates Theres no free lunch here she says Says Mr Abolt Now its time

Susan Kaufman Paul Robertson Linda Landwehr Susan M Badeer Robert Etringer Michael Cc Subject FW DWR Contracts FYI Appears that the two sides may be crawling toward renegotiation Best Jeff Battle lines drawn over longterm power deals SD Union Tribune In a perverse sign that normalcy is returning the states power crisis roared back to life last week with the California Public Utilities Commission as the focus This time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated even from a longrunning crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs In a span of three hours last week the fivemember panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business Consumer advocates celebrated when the PUC refused to rubber stamp statenegotiated longterm power contracts a move the governor said stalled the billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases But business leaders and the governor cheered the PUC for approving a billion rescue of Southern California Edison which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout As massive as the Edison deal is it may be less likely to affect customers of SDGE than the second reality that emerged last week Despite the PUC action on the contracts Californians still face the burden of paying more than billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity Or maybe not While electricity providers continue to defend the longterm power contracts as fair and key to resolving the states electricity crisis consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised renegotiated or canceled Critics argue that the deals were negotiated while the states economy was reeling blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through longterm deals Duress alleged Consumer advocates say the longterm contracts bind California to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need We should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically said Bill Ahern a senior analyst with Consumers Union the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine We did these agreements under duress and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal Ahern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation Michael Shames executive director of the Utility Consumers Action Network in San Diego notes that much of the power to be delivered under the agreements will come from new plants yet to be built in California The state has the ability through the siting process to modify those contracts Shames said The motivation to do so could grow soon he added Especially in an election year the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the cost of these contracts Shames said Shames noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pressed California to lock up much of its power under longterm contracts because it argued that excessive reliance on shortterm purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis Now it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the shortterm crisis Shames said Beyond the growing political pressure San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre is arguing in appellate court that Gov Gray Davis overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the longterm agreements in the first place He says Californias electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices To circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster said Aguirre who is suing electricity providers for overcharging There were other means to manage the emergency The PUC also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period First and foremost we should try to renegotiate try to get shorter terms said Gary Cohen general counsel for the PUC Willingness to deal At least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter Cohen said The PUC also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with FERC The federal commission regulates wholesale power markets and is legally mandated to ensure prices are just and reasonable FERC is considering refunds for prices paid by California in spot power markets during the crisis Cohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds longterm contracts should be subject to similar relief The PUC has made several filings pressing this point but has received no response from FERC For his part the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts In order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us and they have not done so said Steve Maviglio the governors spokesman We would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate But we have not been approached by anyone Some experts believe Davis wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements The same people speculate that the governor who blasted the PUC last week for failing to help implement the agreements may have privately welcomed the commissions action as a step toward revising the agreements Power providers meanwhile continue to support the agreements The contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market said William Highlander director of public relations for Calpine Corp The San Jose company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements with some billion in contracts Calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within California Sempra says contract fair The company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements said Highlander and he declined to say how Calpine would respond to such an overture San Diegobased Sempra Energy another major provider under the agreements also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state Michael Niggli president of Sempra Energy Resources said his company will provide power for about to cents per kilowatt hour based upon current natural gas prices Its pretty tough to say Lets renegotiate the lowest price contract Niggli said But V John White director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies said Sempras contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need and too much of the electricity comes from nonrenewable sources White says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing There are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to White said The generators say nobody asked us The governor says nobody has volunteered But the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate Why dont we ask State authority buying more power for Critics say its too costly perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss OC Register SACRAMENTO Californias new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices Moreover another state agency says the state will have enough power because of existing contracts and conservation to get through the hottest of summers next year The new power purchases which are being negotiated by the California Public Power and Financing Authority could add as much as megawatts of power to California enough for about million homes by June That would be in addition to the existing billion in longterm agreements the state has already inked with power generators Many observers even those supportive of the power authoritys goal to increase cleaner alternative energy sources in the state are balking at the agencys rapid pace saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run Were dumping power and authority Chairman David Freeman is buying more power Whats up with that Its absolutely ludicrous said Harry Snyder executive director of Consumers Union which publishes Consumer Reports A draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year Without the extra power being negotiated by the power authority even in a very hot summer the state would have about extra megawatts during peak periods when it needs megawatts about a percent cushion That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are In a normal summer such as this years the state would have extra megawatts above the average megawatts it needs roughly a percent surplus Power authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer The more we own of our own supply the more we can control the market said state Treasurer Phil Angelides an authority board member Said Freeman We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer That why we get paid the big bucks New contracts would increase green power In addition at least onethird of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy megawatts would come from solar wind and other renewable energy providers officials said Such generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts Bringing on more megawatts would increase the portion of the states energy derived from renewable resources to percent The longterm goal is percent The remaining

power there is under state contract the less likely lawmakers are to businesses go into the open market to buy the cheaper electricity they think they can get there Lawmakers they believe will want to force businesses to continue to buy power under the contracts theyve negotiated because if the businesses were allowed to pull out residential customers alone would be left paying the higher prices that those contracts dictate Lawmakers are reluctant to put any more burdens on the average consumer who they feel are the unintended victims of a severely flawed deregulation system I would just as soon not see them negotiate any more contracts said Jack Stewart president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association The state power authority was signed into law in May to build its own plants help others finance them and compete with the private power companies Leading the millionayear agency is Freeman the former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and one of

Susan Kaufman Paul Robertson Linda Landwehr Susan M Badeer Robert Etringer Michael Cc Subject FW DWR Contracts FYI Appears that the two sides may be crawling toward renegotiation Best Jeff Battle lines drawn over longterm power deals SD Union Tribune In a perverse sign that normalcy is returning the states power crisis roared back to life last week with the California Public Utilities Commission as the focus This time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated even from a longrunning crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs In a span of three hours last week the fivemember panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business Consumer advocates celebrated when the PUC refused to rubber stamp statenegotiated longterm power contracts a move the governor said stalled the billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases But business leaders and the governor cheered the PUC for approving a billion rescue of Southern California Edison which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout As massive as the Edison deal is it may be less likely to affect customers of SDGE than the second reality that emerged last week Despite the PUC action on the contracts Californians still face the burden of paying more than billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity Or maybe not While electricity providers continue to defend the longterm power contracts as fair and key to resolving the states electricity crisis consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised renegotiated or canceled Critics argue that the deals were negotiated while the states economy was reeling blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through longterm deals Duress alleged Consumer advocates say the longterm contracts bind California to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need We should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically said Bill Ahern a senior analyst with Consumers Union the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine We did these agreements under duress and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal Ahern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation Michael Shames executive director of the Utility Consumers Action Network in San Diego notes that much of the power to be delivered under the agreements will come from new plants yet to be built in California The state has the ability through the siting process to modify those contracts Shames said The motivation to do so could grow soon he added Especially in an election year the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the cost of these contracts Shames said Shames noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pressed California to lock up much of its power under longterm contracts because it argued that excessive reliance on shortterm purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis Now it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the shortterm crisis Shames said Beyond the growing political pressure San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre is arguing in appellate court that Gov Gray Davis overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the longterm agreements in the first place He says Californias electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices To circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster said Aguirre who is suing electricity providers for overcharging There were other means to manage the emergency The PUC also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period First and foremost we should try to renegotiate try to get shorter terms said Gary Cohen general counsel for the PUC Willingness to deal At least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter Cohen said The PUC also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with FERC The federal commission regulates wholesale power markets and is legally mandated to ensure prices are just and reasonable FERC is considering refunds for prices paid by California in spot power markets during the crisis Cohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds longterm contracts should be subject to similar relief The PUC has made several filings pressing this point but has received no response from FERC For his part the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts In order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us and they have not done so said Steve Maviglio the governors spokesman We would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate But we have not been approached by anyone Some experts believe Davis wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements The same people speculate that the governor who blasted the PUC last week for failing to help implement the agreements may have privately welcomed the commissions action as a step toward revising the agreements Power providers meanwhile continue to support the agreements The contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market said William Highlander director of public relations for Calpine Corp The San Jose company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements with some billion in contracts Calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within California Sempra says contract fair The company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements said Highlander and he declined to say how Calpine would respond to such an overture San Diegobased Sempra Energy another major provider under the agreements also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state Michael Niggli president of Sempra Energy Resources said his company will provide power for about to cents per kilowatt hour based upon current natural gas prices Its pretty tough to say Lets renegotiate the lowest price contract Niggli said But V John White director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies said Sempras contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need and too much of the electricity comes from nonrenewable sources White says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing There are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to White said The generators say nobody asked us The governor says nobody has volunteered But the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate Why dont we ask State authority buying more power for Critics say its too costly perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss OC Register SACRAMENTO Californias new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices Moreover another state agency says the state will have enough power because of existing contracts and conservation to get through the hottest of summers next year The new power purchases which are being negotiated by the California Public Power and Financing Authority could add as much as megawatts of power to California enough for about million homes by June That would be in addition to the existing billion in longterm agreements the state has already inked with power generators Many observers even those supportive of the power authoritys goal to increase cleaner alternative energy sources in the state are balking at the agencys rapid pace saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run Were dumping power and authority Chairman David Freeman is buying more power Whats up with that Its absolutely ludicrous said Harry Snyder executive director of Consumers Union which publishes Consumer Reports A draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year Without the extra power being negotiated by the power authority even in a very hot summer the state would have about extra megawatts during peak periods when it needs megawatts about a percent cushion That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are In a normal summer such as this years the state would have extra megawatts above the average megawatts it needs roughly a percent surplus Power authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer The more we own of our own supply the more we can control the market said state Treasurer Phil Angelides an authority board member Said Freeman We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer That why we get paid the big bucks New contracts would increase green power In addition at least onethird of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy megawatts would come from solar wind and other renewable energy providers officials said Such generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts Bringing on more megawatts would increase the portion of the states energy derived from renewable resources to percent The longterm goal is percent The remaining power purchased under the new contracts perhaps megawatts would be from socalled peaker plants less efficient jetenginelike generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages The emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers While not preferable to conventional generating plants they would

known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process Although the panel notice showed that state commissioners would attend upon arriving in the hearing room we found that state commissioners were there and ready to claim their minutes of fame It was a long morning I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts Approximately to of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process that FERC was moving too quickly and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens In particular the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric While many would think that the session was extremely negative our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearingallowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis Heres some individual comments Catherine RileyMarylandshe started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens she was way overboard in the dramatics department She then stated that she was not at the meeting to help you FERC backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record It went on like this for about minutes The good part is that she was so personally negative that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her Sam ErvinNOrth Carolinahe was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens that customer choice is never coming to his state so he will never benefit from an RTO that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO and I bet if they do hell work to change the statutes and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC His comments were also pretty brutal but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor Arnetta McRaeDelwareshe kept on saying show me where the benefits for consumers are She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order Rory McMinnNew Mexicorepeatedly talked about how the west was different how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were Carl WoodCaliforniatried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments He delivered the same messages that weve been hearing foreverFERC should have acted sooner on price caps etc etc Glen ThomasPennsylvaniahe was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring its energy system into the new centurythat by opening its markets they have had an explosion in green power they have reduced costs all across the state etc He was very supportive of PJM makes sense because its in his back yard and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance Judy JonesOhiowas very parochial in her discussion but echoed Don Svandas comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed Ed GArveyMinnesotahe got the gold star for the day After very very lengthly comments from about commissioners he took about minute and said FERCjust get it donein essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward Other Commissioners who talked were ArthurConnecticut HadleyIndiana HuelsmanKentucky Nugent Maine all on the positive side Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do From the FERC commissioner standpoint the gold star went to Massey After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didnt feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back saying the there has been years of process and he wants a process that comes to an endyouve been talking for years and never could agree

Twiggs Thane Walton Steve Kean Steven J Fulton Donna Cc Dernehl Ginger Thome Jennifer Subject RTO week Thursday Morning sessionMeeting with State Commissioners This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process Although the panel notice showed that state commissioners would attend upon arriving in the hearing room we found that state commissioners were there and ready to claim their minutes of fame It was a long morning I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts Approximately to of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process that FERC was moving too quickly and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens In particular the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric While many would think that the session was extremely negative our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearingallowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis Heres some individual comments Catherine RileyMarylandshe started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens she was way overboard in the dramatics department She then stated that she was not at the meeting to help you FERC backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record It went on like this for about minutes The good part is that she was so personally negative that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her Sam ErvinNOrth Carolinahe was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens that customer choice is never coming to his state so he will never benefit from an RTO that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO and I bet if they do hell work to change the statutes and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC His comments were also pretty brutal but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor Arnetta McRaeDelwareshe kept on saying show me where the benefits for consumers are She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order Rory McMinnNew Mexicorepeatedly talked about how the west was different how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were Carl WoodCaliforniatried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments He delivered the same messages that weve been hearing foreverFERC should have acted sooner on price caps etc etc Glen ThomasPennsylvaniahe was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring its energy system into the new centurythat by opening its markets they have had an explosion in green power they have reduced costs all across the state etc He was very supportive of PJM makes sense because its in his back yard and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance Judy JonesOhiowas very parochial in her discussion but echoed Don Svandas comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed Ed GArveyMinnesotahe got the gold star for the day After very very lengthly comments from about commissioners he took about minute and said FERCjust get it donein essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward Other Commissioners who talked were ArthurConnecticut HadleyIndiana HuelsmanKentucky Nugent Maine all on the positive side Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do From the FERC commissioner standpoint the gold star went to Massey After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didnt feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back saying the there has been years of process and he wants a process that comes to an endyouve been talking for years and never could agree Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting Sue
