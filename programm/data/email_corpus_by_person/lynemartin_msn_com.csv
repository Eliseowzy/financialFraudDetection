SCAM PLEASE READ I just got this email from my office You may want to alert everyone to this possibility TONY NESPOLI SIEMENS EN CORTELYOU AVE STATEN ISLAND NY VOICE FAX VERY IMPORTANTPLEASE READ Subject FW Area Code THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION PROVIDED TO US BY ATT DONT EVER DIAL AREA CODE This one is being distributed all over the US This is pretty scaryespecially given the way they try to get you to call Be sure you read this pass it on to all your friends and family so they dont get scammed MAJOR SCAM Dont respond to Emails phone calls or web pages which tell you to call an Phone Number This is a very important issue of ScamBusters because it alerts you to a scam that is spreading extremely quickly and can easily cost you or more and is difficult to avoid unless you are aware of it Wed like to thank Verizon for bringing this scam to our attention This scam has also been identified by the National Fraud Information Center and is costing victims a lot of money There are lots of different permutations of this scam HERES HOW IT WORKS You will receive a message on your answering machine or your pager which asks you to call a number beginning with area code The reason youre asked to call varies It can be to receive information about a family member who has been ill to tell you someone has been arrested died to let you know you have won a wonderful prize etc In each case you are told to call the number right away Since there are so many new area codes these days people unknowingly return these calls If you call from the US you will apparently be charged perminute Or youll get long recorded message The point is they will try to keep you on the phone as long as possible to increase the charges Unfortunately when you get your phone bill youll often be charged more than WHY IT WORKS The area code is located in the British Virgin Islands The Bahamas The area code can be used as a paypercall number similar to numbers in the US Since is not in the US it is not covered by US regulations of numbers which require that you be notified and warned of charges and rates involved when you call a paypercall number There is also no requirement that the company provide a time period during which you may terminate the call without being charged Further whereas many US homes that have number blocking to avoid these kinds of charges do not work in preventing calls to the area code We recommend that no matter how you get The message if you are asked to call a number with an area code that you dont recognize just disregard the message Be wary of email or calls asking you to call an area code number Its important to prevent becoming a victim of this scam since trying to fight the charges afterwards can become A real nightmare Thats because you did actually make the call If you complain both your local phone company and your long distance carrier will not want to get involved and will most likely tell you that they are simply providing the billing for the foreign company Youll end up dealing with a foreign company that argues they have done nothing wrong Please forward this entire message to your friends family and colleagues to help them become aware of this scam Sandi Van Handel ATT Field Service Manager Additional information can be obtained from the following ATT WebSite Important Notice to Recipients It is important that you
