GhoshHOUECT on PM Soma Ghosh PM To Sara CT cc Tana CT Cris CT Clement NRON Tim CT Subject Rehypothecation of securities Sara I have already had a brief discussion with Tana on some of the points below would appreciate your feedback and clarification on some specific issues We are currently looking at ability of Enron to rehypothecate securities principally Tbills received as collateral Clearly the ability to rehypothecate securities that we hold can provide significant benefits The free up of funds that are being used to post cash collateral to counterparties increases our BS liquidity reduces the total cost of borrowing associated with posting cash We are reviewing the use rehypothecation of all securities posting for all counterparties Clement is in the process of executing a domestic custody agreement with Chase Manhatten Bank which will facilitate rehypothecation More specifically we are looking at the ability to rehypothecate collateral related to the most recent Mahonia prepay structure very similar to Alberta prepay The collateral arrangement within Mahonia provides for back to back transfer of collateral right through the structure This results in a net zero cash position if all parties post cash However if Enron receives securities from Chase that we cannot reassign to Mahonia an SPE the cash collateral calls we are seeing are in the region of mm approx mmyr in interest expense to Enron In the past Chase have interchangeably used securities cash They are currently posting cash however they intend to post securities going forward for this specific deal The most pressing issues going forward Does the existing Chase ISDA permit rehypothecation of securities We are looking at this If it does not then we will need to negotiate an amendment to the credit support annex Accounting treatment there are issues around the accounting treatment for rehypothecation under the Mahonia transaction principally relating to the acceptability of the same securities posted by Chase being posted to Mahonia SPE Chase equity in SPE thus linking all the swaps potentially bringing the prepay back on BS We need to justify that we can rehypothecate Chase securities posted within the structure AAs key point is that linkage occurs as the securities posted are most likely to be registered to Chase these are then posted back to Mahonia SPE with Chase equity Our case to support the use of Chase securities within the Mahonia prepay structure relates to Tbills are highly liquid instruments effectively cash equivalent Securities posted by banks are typically registered to a street name ie a brokerage house ie not registered to Chase if there is no physical delivery We are verifying that this is the case with the securities posted by Chase Market standard contractual terms permit use of these posted securities Re the last point I have looked at our the standard ISDA credit support annexe para c relating to Use of Posted Collateral section i It appears

I would like to clarify ownership title to securities that are rehypothecated in the event of default if a Enron receives securities that are then rehypothecated Enron defaults b the third party receiving rehypothecated securities defaults We are aiming to have the Domestic Custody Agreement executed within the next days we would like to be in a position to assign securities posted to us
