<15698555.1075848221943.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,john.hardy@enron.com,2001-04-16 09:53:00,Dabhol Next Steps The Politics Cc We had a good meeting with OPIC last week They are sympathetic to our situation and inclined to support the PNT with certain particular concerns stemming from the fact they are a government agency as I am sure you have been briefed But an issue they raised how do we plan to proceed so as to get the Indian players to the table as we move to issuance of PNT is a critical one now to ponder as we ratchet up the signals through the legal steps we are taking If I might some thoughts on this process and I hope they help your thinking My conversations with the Embassy last week indicate that they understand the message we are sending and are eager to get into a dialogue beyond the discussions with Wade about the invocation of the counter guarantee for each months payment That is one reason they are eager to set up a meeting with Ken for the th with the Finance Minister The Ambassador I think reflecting a view of the Centre was seeking assurances that we were not going to leave the country but remain engaged with them in seeking a typically convoluted Indian solution to the problem His words I think at very senior levels the government does not want to be left having to sort out the solution themselves while also bearing the international political ramifications of the departure of a major American investor So I think the Centre wants now to engage with us in a dialogue to find a solution But I think they do not know quite where we stand at this point and whether we want to talk The legal steps certainly can point to an intent to leave and I think the Indians now need a signal from us preferably in private The Centre also does not genuinely know how to solve the problem So I think we need to have ready a proposal that can serve as the basis for concrete discussions and that we not give up a lot in the process But we need to convey to the Centre that we have concrete ideas for solving the problem There needs to be a political communication path between Delhi and Houston that parallels the legalpayment communication path Wade is so ably handling The Centre cannot differentiate the roles Wade is handling so I think they undervalue the more political messages They are looking for Ken and yourself to handle the higher level communications or an agent directly representing you to do so Only such a person will be able to meet with the Finance Minister at the end of the month I understand Prabu is viewed as competent technically but not a power within the BJP so a decision on negotiations will not be his The critical player at this point is Jashwant Singh the Minister of Foreign Affairs Defense and now also overseeing the Prime Ministers Office Sinha the Finance Minister will be more reluctant to engage on our issue because its politics are not in his realm except for the finance issues But the timing of his visit and willingness to meet are positive to moving the dialogue forward The GOM is the real problem The Embassy made some interesting comments about this issue It noted that we had not really called upon the support of the USG to date and then without directly saying so encouraged us to get the President and his Administration to weigh in The objective I think is to provide ammunition for the Prime Minister to call Deshmuck in and direct him to negotiate in the national interest We also need to underscore to the Centre that we have a window and that negotiations need to go forward now before we get boxed into our respective corners I hope this helps Thanks John

activities with the Washingtonbased financing institutions OPIC EXIM and the multilateral institutions the World Bank and IFC and the InterAmerican Development Bank Every project financing done by the company in the emerging markets over the past several years has involved these agencies and this year is no exception In the past six months we have supported five projects before these institutions Cuiaba Disbursement is now projected for midAugust OPIC is pleased with the progress We have had to tweak the process to keep the project moving forward that process has been successful We have also been heavily involved in the environmental aspects of the project working with the project team on the Environmental Health and Safety program the international NGOs and the Conservation Program to keep these aspects on track Gaza We have been heavily involved throughout the first half of the year getting OPIC to a Board vote which was successful in March We used the Department of State and other agencies to pressure OPIC politically to do the deal Since the board vote the developers have been focussed on the financing with Arab Bank but we are now in a process of pushing State to get OPIC to move forward to financial close on reasonable financial lterms and conditions Guatemala barge mounted plant at Puerto Quertzal OPIC and MARAD are to provide financing We have been working with the finance team to keep the project moving forward and are now looking at fijnancial close by the end of the summer Argentina water for the Province of Buenos Aires This office is pushing both the financing parties OPIC and IDB and Azurix to an end of September Board approval on a financing that started late spring the time frame is extremely short but unless we keep on schedule we will lose close to six months We are driving the schjedule and then overseeing all parties to keep the financing on track so far successfully RioGen We have been working with the Rio team to ensure that consultation on the environmental assessment is conducted properly to avoid Cuiaba type problems and help the IDB financing We are getting the requirements with the team sorted out so that the process will go forward in an appropriate manner In the past six months we have supported the development efforts of the following projects Nigeria We were heavily involved in getting the World Bank to back away from their opposition to our project as well as getting the State Department DOE and Treasury to aggressively support our efforts to conclude a deal in Lagos We finally persuaded the Bank to take the position that it was not fully current on the status of the project and so could not comment The USG supported our efforts and did help the process by which Enron was finally able to conclude a deal Camisea We were heavily involved in sorting out the environmental requirements for this project in Peru to go forward We spent considerable time educating the developer team on these requirements We met on several with the Peruvian Minister of Energy and had him meet with OPIC IDB and the World Bank to better understand the impact of environmental issues on financing Bulacan Biomass project

discussions with financing and other institutions re subsea fiber laying jproject including addressing licensing requirements of the FCC for international telecom projects SIEPAC We have had meetings with the project team on the status of this Central American electricity transmission project and how we might get involved Puerto Suarez We have been working with the project team to address environmental issues relating to the transmission line that is in the Pantanel in preparation for OPIC or IDB financing Cuiaba II We have been working with the team to develop a strategy to address the siting of compression stations so that the environmentalists will not create major problems This is a problem for both Phase I and II EES Projects in Southern Cone and Eastern Europe We have met with the IDB IFC and OPIC and have arrived at an agreed upon financing strucure which now awaits EES projects in these regions In the past six months we have also been involved in supporting our existing asset base on a variety of issues before these institutions as well as to agencies of the USG Dominican Republic Have been working with the DR team to broaden pressure on the government regarding our payment problems including the IFC and World Bank the IDB and the USG especially State Treasury and DOE Trakya Turkey We have been working with the asset team to mobilize USG support through OPIC EXIM state and Treasury to address payment problems the USG is now aggressively supporting Enron in our effort to get these issues under control We are also in discussion with OPIC and EXIM about the prospective selldown of our equity interest in Trakya as we are for Cuiaba and Dabhol In the past six months we have also been involved in a range of other issues of importance to the company Transfer issues I have developed a strategy as to how to approach OPIC EXIM MIGA and the other financing institutions in the event there is a transfer situation We are now awaiting whether it will be needed OPIC in Mexico As part of our overarching relationship with OPIC we have agreed to spearhead an initiastive to assist OIPIC develop a program in Mexico that effort has been very well
