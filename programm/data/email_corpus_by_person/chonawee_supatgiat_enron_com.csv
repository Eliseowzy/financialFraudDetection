this long but it kept getting longer and longer while I wrote it We can set up a meeting to discuss about it instead of reading this long email You know any individual product has two risk componentsunique risk and market risk Most products in energy industry have very high market risk and very low unique risk For example a price of gas produced from Texas is highly correlated with the Henry Hub spot price Since the market risk plays an important role in the energy commodities prices people buy and sell commodities or their derivatives mainly for hedging purposeto reduce their market risk However the movie market is quite different than other commodity markets The Gross Box Office receipt of The Little Mermaid has low correlation with the sum of Gross Box Office receipts of all movies releasing at the same period An individual movie has very high unique risk and very low market risk If you remember the consultant last Friday said that if we own about movies their combined total revenue would be pretty much accurately forecasted That means movies market risk is low and hedging is not important comparing to diversification Since the unique risk plays an important role in the movie market I would expect that most of our customers would buy and sell for diversification purpose not for hedging purpose The producer of some movies would sells part of their movies and buy part of the other movies to diversify their unique risk I think we are going into the right direction by creating this movie market so people who long on a small set of movies can sell part of them and buy some parts of other movies The buyers and sellers in this market can all just be the people who naturally long on some slates of movies They will sell some of their own and buy some of others I think the idea on grouping a small number of movies to increase liquidity is good but we need to make sure that diversification can still be done through this market If Enron wants to take some position I would recommend that we must be diversified enough movies as the consultant said We should avoid taking a position on a small number of movies Otherwise we will be just an inefficient gambler Like putting all the money into only one or two stocks We could have made the same expected return with a lot less risk by investing in SP For your questions about the bidask pricing system that I proposed in the previous email if there are no buyers the tentative bidask prices would be very low So we tell the seller to reduce their selling price to this level if they still want to sell to us We can set our bid price to be low enough by subtracting its unique risk premiuminsurance premiumso now we can take this position and behave like an insurance company But we need to have or expected to have a significant numbers of similar deals of other movies I agree that leaving open orders for several days might be a problem We can set the bidding period to be just only day eg every Monday and everything is cleared at the end of the day I have not seen other markets using this dynamic bidask pricing system and the idea was just came up by myself so I believe it is new I plan to write a memo explaining the details of this system and send it to you Dear everyone please correct me if I am wrong Thanks Chonawee From Richard NRON COMMUNICATIONS on PM To Chonawee NRON cc Key KasraviEnron nron Communications Subject Re calculating bidask prices Chonawee Thanks for your input This is similar to what I was thinking Our prices would be indicative only We could take positions but initially would try to find the other side of any deal wed do Thats why weve been spending a lot of brain cells trying to come up with an exhaustive list of the natural buyers and sellers To the extent we make the product more generic eg a slate of movies as opposed to an individual picture we may drive out more liquidity Im a little unclear on the settlement What if there are no buyers do we tell the sellers they didnt get done Also a buyer or seller would have to give us an open order which might be okay However leaving an order open for several days might be a problem Are you aware of any other markets which trade in the way you suggest Rich Chonawee NRON PM To Richard DiMicheleEnron nron Communications cc Chonawee NRON Cynthia HarknessEnron nron Communications

Kristin AlbrechtEnron nron Communications Kristina MordauntEnron nron Communications Martin LinContractorEnron nron Communications Paul RacicotEnron nron Communications Zachary McCarrollEnron nron Communications Martin LinContractorEnron nron Communications Subject calculating bidask prices I think we should let the price float with the market instead of trying to forecast it Otherwise if our forecast is not consistence with the market we may have an imbalance in the bidask orders and we may end up taking some positions You know as Russ and Martin pointed out we cannot fight with the studio and exhibitors because they have inside information and can game the price easily One way to ensure the balance of the bidask orders is to embed an exchange system inside our bidask prices front end Each week we have a trading period During the period instead of posting bidask prices we post tentative bidask prices then we ask our customers to submit their acceptable buying or selling price These tentative bidask prices get updated and are shown to the public Of course customers can revisewithdraw their bids anytime during the trading period At the end of the period we calculate and post the final bid and ask prices The seller who submits lower selling price than our final bid price gets paid at the bid price The buyer who submits higher buying price than our final ask price pays at the ask price Next week we repeat the same process This way we can manage our positions easily and we can also behave like a broker where we dont take any position at all We make profit from those bidask spread We dont have to worry about forecasting accuracy and insiders trading because we dont have to take any position Let the market be the one who decides the price If we maintain our net position as zero at the end when all the actual gross box office numbers are reported in those publications our customers with open longshort positions are perfectly matched Using the marktomarket charge can reduce credit risk Thanks Chonawee Forwarded by Chonawee SupatgiatCorpEnron on PM Chonawee Supatgiat PM To Richard DiMicheleEnron nron Communications Key KasraviEnron nron Communications cc Martin LinContractorEnron nron Communications Subject some more input Hi Rich and Key Again I think your idea is very good I think that we as a market maker can reduce our credit risk risk of default if we do the marktomarket charging That is each week when we release a new expected value of the gross box office receipt we balance all the opening positions the same way as in a regular future market This way we can give margin calls to the couterparties who are expected to owe us a lots of money In the last paragraph I think the gross box office can also be determined from the market itself ie if there are lots of buyers our offer price should go up We can offer other derivative products such as options as well Chonawee

this long but it kept getting longer and longer while I wrote it We can set up a meeting to discuss about it instead of reading this long email You know any individual product has two risk componentsunique risk and market risk Most products in energy industry have very high market risk and very low unique risk For example a price of gas produced from Texas is highly correlated with the Henry Hub spot price Since the market risk plays an important role in the energy commodities prices people buy and sell commodities or their derivatives mainly for hedging purposeto reduce their market risk However the movie market is quite different than other commodity markets The Gross Box Office receipt of The Little Mermaid has low correlation with the sum of Gross Box Office receipts of all movies releasing at the same period An individual movie has very high unique risk and very low market risk If you remember the consultant last Friday said that if we own about movies their combined total revenue would be pretty much accurately forecasted That means movies market risk is low and hedging is not important comparing to diversification Since the unique risk plays an important role in the movie market I would expect that most of our customers would buy and sell for diversification purpose not for hedging purpose The producer of some movies would sells part of their movies and buy part of the other movies to diversify their unique risk I think we are going into the right direction by creating this movie market so people who long on a small set of movies can sell part of them and buy some parts of other movies The buyers and sellers in this market can all just be the people who naturally long on some slates of movies They will sell some of their own and buy some of others I think the idea on grouping a small number of movies to increase liquidity is good but we need to make sure that diversification can still be done through this market If Enron wants to take some position I would recommend that we must be diversified enough movies as the consultant said We should avoid taking a position on a small number of movies Otherwise we will be just an inefficient gambler Like putting all the money into only one or two stocks We could have made the same expected return with a lot less risk by investing in SP For your questions about the bidask pricing system that I proposed in the previous email if there are no buyers the tentative bidask prices would be very low So we tell the seller to reduce their selling price to this level if they still want to sell to us We can set our bid price to be low enough by subtracting its unique risk premiuminsurance premiumso now we can take this position and behave like an insurance company But we need to have or expected to have a significant numbers of similar deals of other movies I agree that leaving open orders for several days might be a problem We can set the bidding period to be just only day eg every Monday and everything is cleared at the end of the day I have not seen other markets using this dynamic bidask pricing system and the idea was just came up by myself so I believe it is new I plan to write a memo explaining the details of this system and send it to you Dear everyone please correct me if I am wrong Thanks Chonawee From Richard NRON COMMUNICATIONS on PM To Chonawee NRON cc Key KasraviEnron nron Communications Subject Re calculating bidask prices Chonawee Thanks for your input This is similar to what I was thinking Our prices would be indicative only We could take positions but initially would try to find the other side of any deal wed do Thats why weve been spending a lot of brain cells trying to come up with an exhaustive list of the natural buyers and sellers To the extent we make the product more generic eg a slate of movies as opposed to an individual picture we may drive out more liquidity Im a little unclear on the settlement What if there are no buyers do we tell the sellers they didnt get done Also a buyer or seller would have to give us an open order which might be okay However leaving an order open for several days might be a problem

Communications Martin LinContractorEnron nron Communications Subject calculating bidask prices I think we should let the price float with the market instead of trying to forecast it Otherwise if our forecast is not consistence with the market we may have an imbalance in the bidask orders and we may end up taking some positions You know as Russ and Martin pointed out we cannot fight with the studio and exhibitors because they have inside information and can game the price easily One way to ensure the balance of the bidask orders is to embed an exchange system inside our bidask prices front end Each week we have a trading period During the period instead of posting bidask prices we post tentative bidask prices then we ask our customers to submit their acceptable buying or selling price These tentative bidask prices get updated and are shown to the public Of course customers can revisewithdraw their bids anytime during the trading period At the end of the period we calculate and post the final bid and ask prices The seller who submits lower selling price than our final bid price gets paid at the bid price The buyer who submits higher buying price than our final ask price pays at the ask price Next week we repeat the same process This way we can manage our positions easily and we can also behave like a broker where we dont take any position at all We make profit from those bidask spread We dont have to worry about forecasting accuracy and insiders trading because we dont have to take any position Let the market be the one who decides the price If we maintain our net position as zero at the end when all the actual gross box office numbers are reported in those publications our customers with open longshort positions are perfectly matched Using the marktomarket charge can reduce credit risk Thanks Chonawee Forwarded by Chonawee SupatgiatCorpEnron on PM Chonawee Supatgiat PM To Richard DiMicheleEnron nron Communications Key KasraviEnron nron Communications cc Martin LinContractorEnron nron Communications Subject some more input Hi Rich and Key Again I think your idea is very good I think that we as a market maker can reduce our credit risk risk of default if we do the marktomarket charging That is each week when we release a new expected value of the gross box office receipt we balance all the opening positions the same way as in a regular future market This way we can give margin calls to the couterparties who are expected to owe us a lots of money In the last paragraph I think the gross box office can also be determined from the market itself ie if there are lots of buyers our offer price should go up We can offer other derivative products such as options as well Chonawee Embedded StdOleLink
