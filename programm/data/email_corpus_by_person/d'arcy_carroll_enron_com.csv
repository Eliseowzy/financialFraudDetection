any discussion was Dave thanking me over the phone for the inputs and recognizing that he and John incorporated some of the content Weve never had what I had been expecting or at least presumed appropriate ie prior to any formal decision for the region entertaining an inperson detailed discussion of the examples and recommendations including a welcome cross examination of my observations that might conflict with official report or view John and Dave asked me to talk with Brett Kish and Gonzalez but if you look at my recommendations and also consider the overall performance in the region does this make the best sense Ive done this again and in fact had already introduced my ideas to each of them and the previous system prior to forwarding them to Houston Prior to having to leave Enron I wanted to make a best effort to get the authority to execute the recommendations Ive pretty consistently introduced since joining in late and tried to get Enron to implement under the previous management I have not had the opportunity to manage or influence the companys operations in South America this is my fault for not negotiating a more senior position but I made the attempt in the region and more recently with the new managers to demonstrate a need to open constructive critical discussion Anyway Ive tried to open the door to John Dave and you and others who are interested to brainstorm inlcuding the leadership in place in ESA to understand and perhaps leverage my applied experience both trading origination and importantly cultural My resume below should attest to my capabilities at least in terms of the potential value of my observations Thank you for your efforts extended in my behalf and good luck in your new position and working within Enrons unique dynamic ethic DArcy Louise CT PM To DArcy NRON cc Subject Re Brazil Commercial Update Version delete previous I have spoken to John Lavorato on this and he says that Dave and John have already spoken to you

DArcy Carroll PM To David W CT John J nron cc Kay CT Subject Brazil Commercial Update Version delete previous DavidJohn understand the trip will be delayed Proposal Outline has two texts I Commercial Strategy and II Historical Perspective The Org Charts will need some discussion particularly in regard to the strengths and weakness of employed personnel and urgent need for an improved structure Over the FH and within the new structure with Brett and Joao Carlos Albuquerque in place the Wholesale group and Trading desk seems to have made some important strides forward in terms of recruiting some good individuals and in trading terms finally executing some fundamental market supply demand and transmission analysis To get into the game quickly and aggressively though I think the commercial group needs to hire some senior local trading expertise I apoligize but was unable to get in contact with either of these two guys to set up a possible meeting this week However they have the local knowledge trading competencies and management experience which I consider needed to catalyze the regional effort Axel Hinsch Argentine and Cargill employee with several years and broad commodity and financial trading business development and management experience including senior trader for the Bear Stearns Emerging Markets equity desks in the late searly s Straight up no ego Argentine Country Manager Mark Hoffman SwissBrazilian and Glencore employee with several years energy energy distribution and sugar sector experience applied commodity and financial arbitrage experience in the Brazilian market Lot less straight forward but applied knowledge and expertise Senior OriginatorTrader Please forward any input about your interest in scheduling a meeting either open here or in Houston during the week of Nov For some perspective on my experience at Enron let me explaing that I have been working in Enron Networks in the region from Q and therefore much less formally invovled with the trading Brazil spot market and Wholesale pricing tarrif issues etc than at the end of FY when I was directly involved in developing our effort to get in the game in understanding the spot price formula calculations and exploring arbitrage opportunities in the wholesale market Ive attached my resume for some perspective on my background and capability to critically review the commercial

weeks old and has met with reasonable success The hits to the site continue to grow to several thousand per week however the issues outlined below referring to our need to establish appropriate commercial support to the site and proactively readying upgrades and next generations integrated to the commercial efforts have fallen short Forwarded by DArcy CarrollSAEnron on PM DArcy Carroll PM To Joe nron cc James M BannantineENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Diomedes nron Subject internet site Enron South America I wanted to forward some comments on the situation of the Enron South America internet site and Emphasize the need to accelerate and integrate the understanding of the leverage of the eplatform to the commercial business including the need to change the present priorities and responsibility of the commercial groups in the region towards aggressively supporting and promoting the internet tool and Offer some comment on lessons learned implementing version and recommendations for more effectively executing a version Comments The support functions email generated and internal allocation for prompt responses to customer inquiry text and content upgrades and editing etc is THE critical issue to realising the functional goal efficient customer capture of the site To my knowledge the issue outlined in the email below the most recent of several urging action and some decisionmaking remains unaddressed this almost month following the launch of the site From my perspective and commercial experience the present situation which has inquiries being directed directly into a generic email system with parttime support from the orginal PR staff is not acceptable nor advisable as was extensively discussed in the weeks prior to launch Though I understand that the commercial structure and strategy is in flux the clear indecision and lack of ownership reflects a lack of vision and understanding of the power of the ebusiness tool particularly in the Brazilian market I forward the information to you because its my view that the situation directly threatens Enrons credibility in the market at a time when some of Enrons competitors AES and Duke are not only established but have at the same time as Enrons launch at Oil Gas launched nd generation sites Version Brazil and South America I am convinced that the poor civil infrastructure and the physical distances restricting easy access to customers present enormous opportunities for ebusiness platform business Energy Financial Product and other commodities The best example of world class product and servicedriven sites to date our in my view the online banking sites Itau Bradesco They set a good healthy benchmark IT In the development of the site we need to consider technology constraints in the bandwidth capacity and computer screen graphics of targeted consumers in Brazil and elsewhere in the region The constraings limit the degree of dynamism Flash technology Sound d graphicsphotography etc that characterize worldleading sites familiar in the US ie for now there is a tradeoff between degree of sexyness of the site vs prohibitive time to load and navigate eBiz Expertise Enron UK has an inhouse internet consulting group that continues to develop but that provides comprehensive support and development services to the product lines Houston tends to outsource or contract much of the project work examples of the work they have produced are available impressive and much closer to cutting edge The Enron UK group should own the devleopment of version pls note that there is already a significant number of projects in their pipeline eBiz SupportOperationsThe operation of the site including specifically the IT component which addresses customer response and participation tracking hits voluem storing profile questionnaire email response etc is probably the critical determinant for the functional success of the site Cutting edge technologies and their timely implementation to site or versions launch needs to be absolutely mandatory with high deliverables Competition AES Duke Energy have both launched nd versions of their regional internet sites in the months between initial launch and today both have upgraded pretty completely in terms of offering and functionality Commercial The site is designed to streamline and deliver efficiencies and value directly to the Commercial Trading and Origination exercises these groups need to be formally accountable to sign on and contribute to a strategy to initial and sequential content and graphics language translations etc Either the Commercial groups drives the ebiz initiative or the ebiz initiative will fail Ownerhsip The breadth and integral importance of both commercial regulatory and IT issues complicate the ability to develop and execute the site effectively It is a Development business and as such needs a clear Project Manager s with the necessary authority establshed over the contributing groups Pls forward any all inputs and thank you for efforts extended to help address the issues Note Please be aware that I understand that to a large extent all of the above is outside of my responsibility but feel I need to bring responsible closure to my contributions to and participation in the launch of version Forwarded by DArcy CarrollSAEnron on AM DArcy Carroll PM To Jose BestardENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Joao nron cc Orlando nron Keith nron Miguel nron Steve nron Brett R nron Don nron Joe nron Subject candidate Monica Matias PR support for Enron SA site Keith though Commerical has the largest stake in the success or failure of the regional ebusiness product i understood that PR has the budget allocation and as agreed regarding the operational support of the site the policingrd party role to play ie ownership over this particular issue Gentlemen this site is launched as of last weeks OilGas Conference or certainly maintains an imminent broader launch For starters we need to execute the agenda item outlined below and in previous emails which allocates operational responsibility for commercial followup for the site Today the contact resource for Brazil is a voice mail which is temporary anyway and wasnt working until I called this morning asking about a message Id left on it last week in addition we havent trained the present operational support to understand how and to which groups to direct customer inquiries ebis the ebusiness platform needs to get elevated to the next level followup for customer capture responsible and timely response to inquiries etc not to mention more formal and public marketing of the site phase the natural consequence of having a product and first phase site is that there will be plenty of internal comments and reactive idea generation for a second phase site this is fine and natural but also will likely fall into the responsibilities of the same position initially at least in terms of information gathering and distribution if really necessary why dont the relevant parties copied on this wire have a minute conference call to make this and other related decisions so that we move forward pls consider prioritizing this so that we execute in the next few days Forwarded by DArcy CarrollSAEnron on PM DArcy Carroll PM To Jose BestardENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Subject candidate Monica Matias PR support for Enron SA site Jose here is the orginal communication The design of the site is to make progress toward alleviating the enormous bottleneck and inefficiencies in the marketing effort to contact the hundreds of small national power generators not to mention streamline the customer capture costs for the broader EES product line If we dont expect a need for a and eventually several fulltime commercial support for the site then the launch will be a dismal failure But with the site launching this week and following a lot of work yesterday and this morning cleaning up the kinks in the Monday version we need to be ready get her in position immediately Whats more shes does almost all of the work carrying the load for the assistants on the th floor that work needs anyway to get delegated to the other assistants ie they
