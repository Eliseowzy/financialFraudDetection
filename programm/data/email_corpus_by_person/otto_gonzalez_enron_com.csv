shareholder complaint Otto The following shareholder complaint about Smith Enrons plant in Puerto Pla ta was sent to Investor Relations and today forwarded to our attention requesting assistance with this matter The gentlemen sending the complain t owns a home in Costambar a residential community which according to his email has been negatively affected by our plant He mentions a disturbi ng noise level decreased air quality dwindling property value and power outages worse than prior to the plant going online The fact that we take any shareholder complaint very serious I am preparing a response to this letter and I am asking for your help Could you provide me with any background information on the alleged complaints and confirm or deny the issues at matter Are there any plans on the way to address any possible issues It had been my impression that the Smith Enron plant not only had no negative effects on the environment but that great efforts were made to improve the local community through community relations programs like the public park adoption supply of school materials shipment of medical supplies and the municipal nursery support Can you expand on this I realize that this matter has to be managed with extreme caution I clear ly will coordinate my reply with you and seek additional approval from legal prior to responding to the gentlemen Thank you in advance for your

shareholder through my holding company First Foundation Financial Services Inc Five or six years ago Smith Enron floated in and installed a power generati on plant at Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic generating power to sell to the Dominican power agency Presentations were made at the time to the loca l mostly American and Canadian residents in the community of Costambar whe re the plant was to be and was built that The noise would not exceed the sound of the ocean That there would be no air quality damage and That the power outs in Costambar would cease I have a home in Costambar about a half mile away and over a large hill fro m the plant The sound is audible in the entire neighborhood When they clear the boilers it is oppressiveear shattering for th e entire community of homes in spite of the retrofit silencers There is often molecular ash falling and on occasion well documented with pictures total black soot coverage down wind for a qua rter mile or more Costambar is on the countrys grid and has power outs for an av erage of two or more hours per day worse than before In other words all of the welldocumented and witnessed undertakings have been proven false I was proud of Enron at the beginning because there seemed to be a legitima te attempt to do the right thing As time has progressed however it has beco me clear that there is no solution to the continuing problems It is also obvious that the ONLY right thing is to pull up stakes and float the plant to the original alternate location down the coast or to another country The problems are insoluble You simply cant plop a large energy burning facility beside an upscale community without event For a company as knowledgeable as Enron should be concerning the effects to nearby residents it borders on inexcusable that the plant would have been built where it is in the first place Having attempted any number of solutions and now recognizi ng the absence of solution the continuing inexcusable action is to carry on regardless as ahs been the case for the past two or more years Enron has been sued by the adjacent large hotel which although only two or three years old when the plant was built had to shut down because of unending guest complaints and refund demands It now sits as a rotting monument to the problems Unfortunately for Enron the owners are a promine nt Dominican family I am told they already have a large judgement but are going for more If they havent already they surely will and they s urely should What was once an attractive and productive facility is useless and will remain fallow as long as the plant is there Soon it will fall totally beyond repair and there will be no alternative but to raze it Houses in the immediate area say mile homes have fallen to in value and houses in the community at large have fallen to in value dependent upon their proximity to the plant Whereas the hotel value is in the low millions and the ultimate award will likely be commensurate the loss in value to the homes is in the tens of millions Beyond these financi al events some of the people in the community are beginning to complain about new respiratory and other pollution related ailments The rough estimate of damages ranges between US million and million without considering the health issues The community has sensible and responsible leadership and has responded in a sensible and responsible way Dissatisfied with the failure to solve the problem in any approaching a timely fashion the homeowners have recently retained competent counsel Nearly homeowners have joined the class action to recover their lost property value The issue of determining lost value is about to formally begin and the total loss calculated Soon there will be no turning back because of the homeowners investment in the act ion If there were an announcement that the plant is to be moved the claim from the community would almost certainly go away with the possible exception of damages for the few homes that have changed hands during the plants li fe here If the plant remains the action will proceed and all things bei ng equitable which they ultimately become in the Dominican court system ther e will be large claims awarded I imagine they will massively overshadow the few million dollars to move or dismantle the plant I now take off my homeowners hat and return to my position as sharehold er The following italicized statements form part of the Enron Mission Statement As noted above the company has so far failed to implement these visions as noted environment In everything we do we operate safely and with concern for the environment The way we do a job will affect how our children and our neighbors childre n will live in the future This is a responsibility we take seriously in all the different places around the world where we do business The Costambar environment has been seriously effected from a noise and air pollution point of view integrity We work with customers and prospects openly honestly and sincerely When we say we will do something we will do it when we say we cannot or will not do something then we wont do it The community was seriously misled and Enron has been unable to develop solutions to restore or correct their documented assertions creativity We think the entrepreneurial approach stimulates creativity It calls for n ew insights new ways of looking at problems and opportunities and a strong sense of urgency The problems have persisted for several years with no recent new initiative s directed at solving them respect We treat others as we would like to be treated ourselves We do not tolerat e abusive or disrespectful treatment Ruthlessness callousness and arroganc e dont belong here The Golden Rule has long since gone wanting in this situation It is simply not responsible for Enron to continue with a facility that has and continues to damage a community financially and from a health point of view And it is not financially responsible of Enron management to risk the payment of tens of millions in claims arising from damages that can otherwi se be avoided at quantifiable and much lower cost Im sure the company has a thick file on this issue already Im equa lly sure however that the measure of damages is reaching a new phase and is approaching the point where there will be no will by the litigants to turn back The plant was constructed during the waning days of the environmental ly insensitive Beleaguer government The country has undergone substantial changes since then including changes in The Rule of Law and the judiciary There is now a new liberal government that is likely to be very generous wi th one of its previously model communities if the matter reaches the courts The loss to the
