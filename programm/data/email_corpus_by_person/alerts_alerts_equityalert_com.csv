Manufa cturing Costs By Offering Digitally Controlled Adjustments TUCSON Ariz Jun PRNewswire via COMTEX Texas Instruments TI Incorporated NYSE TXN today announced a smart programmable mA currentloop transmitter designed for temperature and bridge sensor applications as well as remote data acquisition weighing systems and industrial process control The highperformance XTR allows for digital calibration of sensor and transmitter errors via a standard digital serial interface eliminating expensive potentiometers or circuit value changes Calibration settings can be stored in an inexpensive external EEPROM for ea sy retrieval during routing operation See scaapxxxxu Digitallycontrolled adjustments dramatically reduce manufacturing costs an d allow companies to build a single sensor design to serve a wide range of ne eds Individual units can be stocked and later programmed and reprogrammed for a ny of hundreds of possible endcustomer specifications special temperature range s etc Sensors can also be reprogrammed in the field if necessary By allowing the user to digitally adjust the gain offset and linearity of the analog output the XTR eliminates the need for manual trimming of potentiometers and the costs associated with this process said John Brown strategic marketing engineer for TIs HighPerformance Linear products Furthermore among the very few similar ICs on the market the XTR prov ides more versatile multichannel input and excitation multiplexing Functionally a mA transmitter provides accurate transmission of analog signals from sensors used to monitor physical parameters in industrial processes such as temperature and pressure to remotely located measurement equipment The sensor signal is amplified linearized and transmitted in t he form of current no power supply required at the transmitter site mA current loops are not affected by line resistance and are much more immune to electrical interference The XTRs wide programmable gain amplifier PGA range allows full scale inputs from to mV The allanalog signal path contains a builtin subregulator voltage reference input multiplexer autozeroed PGA dual programmable currentsources linearization circuit internal oscillator control logic and an output current amplifier Current sources directed through the multiplexer can be used to excite RTD temperature sensors pressure bridges or other types of transducers The XTRs uncommitted op amp can be used to convert current into a voltage or for fourwire RTD circuits Available Today The XTR is available now and is packaged in an SSOP It is priced

AllCMOS Bluetooth Radi o MONTE CARLO Monaco Jun BUSINESS WIRE Bluetooth Congress BlutoniumTM Chip Combines Radio and Baseband Functions on Monolithic HighPerformance SingleChip Transceiver Broadcom Corporation NasdaqBRCM the leading provider of integrated circuits enabling broadb and communications today introduced the BroadcomR BCM singlechip tr ansceiver for BluetoothTM wireless applications Integrating previously d eveloped Bluetoothcompliant radio and baseband components onto a single h ighperformance integrated circuit the chip minimizes component counts and board space requirements while providing a highperformance solution to th e Bluetooth shortrange wireless connectivity challenges faced by equipment manufacturers The BlutoniumTM BCM achieves the highest performanc e of any singlechip Bluetooth transceiver in the industry combining Bluet oothqualified radio and baseband circuits onto a single monolithic chip O nboard FractionalN synthesizer technology allows the chip to work with pr actically any reference frequency available This is especially useful in c urrent and third generation G cellular phones in which a wide variety of crystal oscillators are available Featuring high levels of integration an d minimal offchip filters or other active components the BCM provides excellent performance in the presence of radio interferers and is ideally suited for harsh radio frequency RF environments such as inside mobile p hones and laptop computers In addition the chips unique design allows it to maintain its high performance even across the extended temperature rang e of between and degrees centigrade an accomplishment unparallele d in the industry With our previously announced Blutonium products we demonstrated our unique ability to achieve outstanding radio performance de signing chips in a standard digital CMOS process said KC Murphy Vice P resident and General Manager of Broadcoms RF and Advanced Mixed Signal Bus iness Unit Weve now applied Broadcoms wellknown integration expertise by combining RF and digital circuits onto a single substrate while maintain ing unmatched performance among Bluetooth transceivers As a result were unveiling the singlechip Bluetooth transceiver the industry has been waiti ng for with performance exceeding that of practically any other solution regardless of the process technology The BCM is based upon Broadcom s previous allCMOS standalone radios and basebands that have already ach ieved Bluetooth Version qualification and which exceed the Bluetooth sp ecification in most areas This means that devices such as mobile phones an d PC cards built using Blutonium components are compatible with the latest version of the Bluetooth specification easing the process by which these d evices can apply the Bluetooth logo to their products The BCM benefits from this previous development achieving strong performance in key areas such as linearity and receiver sensitivity attaining a sensitivity figure of better than dBm Integration of the previously developed circuits onto a single chip was made possible because the entire Blutonium line lik e all Broadcom chip products was developed in a standard digital CMOS or Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor manufacturing process No other pr ocess allows the combination of RF and digital circuits on a single transce iver By first proving our radio and baseband architectures in CMOS with standalone products weve chosen to emphasize performance in our Bluetoot h component development program said Scott Bibaud Director of Marketing for Broadcoms Bluetooth Products With these multiple Blutonium elements integrated onto a single costeffective chip we can now leverage Broadcom s proven reputation for operational excellence and provide these components in production quantities to our customers around the world Key Feature s The BCM has been designed to provide very high performance in Blueto oth applications with a single transceiver Notable features include Strong spurious emissions performance the BCM minimizes interfe rence from transmissions taking place in the bands used by mobile phone s providing robust connections between Bluetooth devices Excepti onal blocking performance the highly linear design eliminates the ne ed for costly offchip RF filtering to receive reliable signals from ot her Bluetooth devices FractionalN Synthesizer this synthesizer en ables the to use any existing frequency reference including those commonly available in mobile phones such as CDMA WCDMA GSM GPRS an d UMTS eliminating the need for an offchip crystal Extensive so ftware support the BCM is softwarecompatible with protocol stac ks developed by leading third party stack vendors as well as with Broa dcoms internal stack Costeffective memory architecture onchip m emory eliminates the need for offchip flash while allowing the use of additional memory when appropriate Requires minimal offchip comp onents by eliminating all external active components the BCM re quires just a few passive components providing very limited bill of ma terials BOM and board space impact on OEM equipment designs Avai lability The version of the BCM with no external memory bus is package d in a pin fine pitch Ball Grid Array fpBGA and the version with exter nal flash interfaces is packaged in a pin fpBGA The transceiver is sam pling now to early access customers About Broadcom Broadcom Corporation is the leading provider of highly integrated silicon solutions that enable broadband communications and networking of voice video and data services

Color Saturation For DLP Technology Sequential Color Recapture Technology Described At SID ConferenceDIllustrative images for this story may be found at dlpcomdlpresourcesresourcesasp DALLAS Jun BUSINESS WIRE At the annual conference of the Society for Information Display SID h eld at the San Jose McEnery Convention Center in San Jose California Tex as Instruments TI NYSETXN today announced an exciting innovation which will allow projectors featuring DLPTM technology to deliver images which can be up to brighter than is currently possible or which feature grea ter color saturation or a combination of increased brightness and increas ed color saturation In a paper entitled Sequential Color Recapture and Dynamic Filtering A Method of Scrolling Color authored by D Scott Dewald Steven M Penn and Michael Davis of Texas Instruments an innovative appr oach to increasing the efficiency of a single modulator display is describe d The current DLP singlepanel technology has only one color present on the surface of the DMD meaning that at any one time one third of the li ght is used while two thirds of the light is wasted said Scott Dewald of TIs DLPTM Products division who delivered the paper at the conference Sequential Color Recapture SCR is a technology that allows all three c olors to be present simultaneously such that a single panel DLP system can now be as efficient as potentially more efficient than a three panel s ystem but without the additional parts size weight and expense of three panel systems Although many solutions have been proposed to the challe nge of maximizing the efficiency of single modulator displays he continue d all have exhibited a high degree of mechanical complexity which would m ake manufacturability a real issue One of the key virtues of SCR is its si mplicity it is no more complex than what we have today requiring no addit ional moving parts The implementation of SCR technology requires a chan ge to the color wheel and light integrating element currently employed in s ingleDMD DLPTM subsystems together with changes in the DMD and the driv e electronics The optical capability of SCR has been made possible by adva nces in dichroic and metal thinfilm technologies the most important of th ese being the photolithographic patterning of dichroic coatings The SCR co lor wheel is created from RGB dichroic coatings arranged in a spiral of Ar chimedes pattern This is a tremendously exciting development for DLP t echnology said Dennis Fritsche Manager for Business Products at TIs DLP TM Products Division It has been a continuing goal to not only increase brightness but also to increase color saturation and SCR allows us to d o both On a paneltopanel basis DLP technology has always outperformed competing technologies With this invention we can now in all respects m atch threepanel modulators with a single DMD but in the small lightweigh t projectors that DLPTM technology uniquely enables because of its high s peed and digitally consistent mirror technology We are now investigating i mplementation plans and schedules to bring this revolutionary advancement t o the market place Today TI supplies DLPTM subsystems to more than t hirty of the worlds top projector manufacturers who then design manufact ure and market projectors based on DLPTM technology There are now over f ifty products based on DLPTM technology in the market Since early over DLPTM subsystems have been shipped Over the past four years DLPTM technologybased projectors have consistently won some of the aud iovisual industrys most prestigious awards including in June an E mmy Award from the Academy of Television Arts Sciences At the heart of TIs Digital Light ProcessingTM technology is the Digital Micromirror De vice
