n SubjectMandatory Setoff Language for Inclusion in all EWS Trading Contr acts One of the most important credit tools available to help Enron Wholesale Se rvices EWS manage counterparty credit risk is setoff rights This is par ticularly true as our trading business is expanding to include numerous com modity lines including gas power coal steel pulp and paper each of wh ich may be traded under different masters with a single counterparty This complexity is further increased as a result of EWS using multiple affiliat ed entities to trade the various commodities Absent express contractual s etoff rights EWS may be unable to setoff exposures under different master contracts A team of EWS lawyers has been working to assemble setoff language that will substantially enhance EWSs credit position with counterparties with w hom we trade multiple commodities This setoff language which is set fort h below must be in all EWS trading form contracts Similarly when negoti ating on third party paper we should request that this additional setoff l anguage be added MANDATORY SETOFF LANGUAGE FOR EWS TRADING CONTRACTS A Upon the designation or deemed designation of an Early Termination D ate the NonDefaulting Party X may at its option and in its discretio n setoff against any amounts Owed to the Defaulting Party Y by X or a ny Affiliate of X under this Agreement or under any other agreements ins truments or undertakings any amounts Owed by Y to X or any of Xs Affi liates under this Agreement or under any other agreements instruments or undertakings The obligations of Y and X under this Agreement in resp ect of such amounts shall be deemed satisfied and discharged to the extent of any such setoff exercised by X andor Xs Affiliates X will give Y not ice of any setoff effected under this section as soon as practicable after the setoff is effected provided that failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of the setoff For purposes of this Section Owed shall mean any amounts owed or otherwise accrued and payable regardless o f whether such amounts have been or could be invoiced as of the Early Term ination Date Amounts subject to the setoff permitted in this Section may be conver ted by X into any currency in which any obligation Owed is denominated at t he rate of exchange at which X acting in a reasonable manner and in good f aith would be able to purchase the relevant amount of the currency being c onverted If an obligation is unascertained X may in good faith estimate t hat obligation and setoff in respect of the estimate subject to the releva nt party accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained Nothi ng in this Section shall be effective to create a charge or other securit y interest except as may be provided under applicable law This setoff pr ovision shall be without prejudice and in addition to any right of setoff netting offset combination of accounts counterclaim lien or other righ t to which any party is at any time otherwise entitled whether by operatio n of law contract or otherwise Each of the parties represent and acknow ledge that the rights set forth in this Section are an integral part of the agreement between the parties and that without such rights the parties would not be willing to enter into Transactions The parties further ackno wledge that each is executing this Agreement on behalf of itself as princip al and with respect to this Section as agent on behalf of its Affilia tes which Affiliates shall receive the benefits of this Section and oth erwise be bound as if such Affiliates had directly signed this Agreement as it relates to Section B Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agre ement the NonDefaulting Party shall not be required to pay to the Default ing Party any amount under Section until the NonDefaulting Party receiv es confirmation satisfactory to it in its reasonable discretion which may include an opinion of its counsel that all other obligations of any kind w hatsoever of the Defaulting Party to make any payments to the NonDefaultin g Party or any of its Affiliates under this Agreement or under any other ag reements instruments or undertakings which are Owed as of the Early Termination Date have been fully and finally satisfied This new setoff language will provide EWS the right to setoff amounts du e and owing as of the Early Termination Date but does not include future p ayments between the counterparty and EWS and its affiliates triangular se toff after the designation of an Early Termination Date This language ha s been reviewed by US bankruptcy counsel and is appropriate under US l aws for commodity transactions with USbased counterparties Each group will need to review this language with their local counsel in each jurisdic tion in which EWS trades in order to ensure enforceability In addition prior to introducing this language into your forms changes will be require d to terminology andor to include terminations resulting from events other than Events of Default eg Affected Party under ISDA Finally when incorporating this setoff language into the EWS trading forms please be aw are that this language is not intended to override the payment netting term s monthly netting of receivables or the closeout netting procedures app licable upon the designation of an Event of Default both of which should remain in the trading forms Rather this language is only intended to add setoff rights to all EWS trading forms When incorporating this setoff la nguage into your trading forms you will need to review the forms to determ ine if there are any references to setoff or other similar concepts that wi ll need to be overridden andor coordinated Finally in order to assist a ll lawyers in negotiating these setoff provisions we are in the process of preparing a brief explanation of how this setoff works and why it is mutua lly beneficial to EWS and our counterparties which explanation you will be able to share with your counterparties This explanation will be distribut ed shortly If you have any questions please contact me at or Elizabet h Sager at

Commission Hearings on Rate Stabilization Plans You are undoubtedly aware of the critical energy situation in California Among other things the FERC has issued an order for the restructuring of the wholesale market and the California PUC is continuing hearings on rate relief for the investor owned utilities and other issues We are monitoring the hearings in both Washington and California and advising our friends and clients as developments occur The following is our most recent report Hearings on PGEs and SCEs rate stabilization plans continued on Friday with testimony by Walter Campbell Director of Business and Financial Planning at PGE who presented PGEs prima facie case and James Asseltine Managing Director at Lehman Brothers who testified as to PGEs financial condition President Lynch attended the hearings in the morning I understand that the Republican appointed Commissioners are on vacation and have been noticeably absent from the hearings Hearings will continue on Tuesday January with testimony from Edison Also on Tuesday an all party meeting will be held with Commissioner Wood presumably for the purpose of facilitating settlement negotiations on Thursday December Governor Davis facilitated a similar meeting between the utilities and consumer groups with little progress The Commission meeting is scheduled for Thursday January at which time the Commission is expected to issue a final order a copy of the final order may be posted on the Commissions website at wwwcpuccagov minutes prior to the meeting PGE is requesting An end to the rate freeze An explicit statement that procurement costs are recoverable in rates from retail customers Surprisingly Mr Campbell indicated that rate recovery on a going forward basis from the October or November billing periods may be a survivable outcome for PGE this was later downplayed on redirect examination A meaningful rate increase Mr Campbell indicated that PGE would be satisfied with a increase in rates Follow up means of subsequent rate increases Mr Campbell indicated that customers could expect rate increases totaling up to over the next two years depending on market conditions SCE who will be crossexamined on Tuesday is asking for a larger rate increasean average of immediately to be followed by an undetermined number of rate hikes over the next two years The following facts came out in the crossexamination of PGE PGE recovered billion in its transition cost recovery account during the transition period PGE transferred billion during the transition period to its parent PGE paid dividends of during the transition period PGE paid a dividend of million in October when it knew as soon as June that it was amassing a huge underrecovery of its procurement costs For the th quarter PGEs parent has declared a dividend a legal obligation of the parent PGE has not determined whether to declare a dividend PGEs parent has approximately million in cash which it could use to pay its declared dividend of the parent companys revenues came from PGE in PGE projects a borrowing need of billion in the first quarter of PGE will not have sufficient cash to purchase gas or electricity within to weeks PGE has not attempted to borrow from its parent and its parent has little or no borrowing power There is not enough time for its parent to consider selling assets of other subsidiaries PGE is fully borrowed under its commercial paper programs and bank lines PGE has not considered cutting back executive salaries Parent company subsidiaries made million on power trading in Western markets On Tuesday PGE will report on its generation revenues Mr Campbell indicated that approximately of the undercollections could be netted out by the generation revenues By the end of the year PGE estimated that its undercollections will total more than billion Based on the last several days I believe that the Commission is very reluctant to declare an end to the rate freeze particularly if this means that the Commission will lose rate control over the hydro assets Alternatively I believe that President Lynch feels that she has the necessary statutory authority to order interim emergency rate relief subject to refund In this regard in the last day of hearings I believe that PGE met its burden of establishing an emergency condition which will allow the Commission to act on an emergency basis Several months ago at an industry conference where Commissioner Wood spoke he indicated that he felt his only responsibility under the law was to consumers Thus I would expect Commissioner Wood to be on the low end on the percentage of rate increase allowed he does not seem to concerned about the utility entering bankruptcy Loretta Lynch takes her cue from Governor Davis and Governor Davis has publicly stated that a rate increase may be reasonable Commissioner Neepers term ends Sunday and he will not vote on the order As mentioned above Commissioners Duque and Bilas have been noticeably absent from these proceedings In any event given the way President Lynch controls the Commission you can expect her view to prevail and rate increases to be more in the range of I also believe that Commissioner Wood and President Lynch are inclined to find that the utilities undercollections to date are a risk they assumed under AB It is possible that the Commission will allow the recovery of past undercollections but would net out the undercollections with its generation revenues As far as subsequent rate increases on a going forward basis President Lynch has indicated that she is only willing to consider the issues which must be decided on an emergency basis She will likely reject any attempt by the utilities to obtain rate relief on an emergency basis for periods which could be the subject of a full rate hearing Please feel free to contact me at or Ed Feo at with any questions or requests for documents Milbank will plan to cover and issue a report on Tuesdays hearing and the

Subject Additional References Hello Sheila I am surprised that the people whom I listed did not speak about transactional work I suspect that part of it is that they tend to remember things we first did togetherfirst impressions are most readily recalled Therefore this time I will give some notes to accompany the names to help you jog their memories about things we worked on together First I would like you to talk again to Fergus Pilon at Columbia River PUD Ask him about the Coastal Corporation transactions That involved their biggest industrial customer who announced that they either wanted off the system or wanted a sweetheart deal I helped the PUD call the customers bluff and then we negotiated a mutually beneficial longterm power purchase agreement That transaction had a regulatory piece to it in that we had to set out the boundaries on the flexibility available to the industrial customer before we could negotiate from a position of relative strength But it was much more of a deal negotiation in that we put together a power supply arrangement for the customer that was unlike anything either party had ever done instead of cramming a short term victory through and creating an enemy that would leave the utility as soon as it was possiblewhich could have been in a few years The crux of the deal was putting together the contract I am sure this is very similar to a lot of the ENA origination work being done out of Portland Next ask Fergus about the work I did for them on the Iron Carbide project This was a proposed project that never came about It would have brought in a new large industrial customer to the utilitys system We drafted an MOU between the industrial customer the utility and the developer for an EPC project and then fleshed it out with project documents ownership agreement OM agreement etc The project fell apart when the customer changed its mind about building the new processing plant But we spent a significant amount of time creating the business terms for a deal and putting it all into contract form Next I suggest you talk to Walt Pollock at Portland General I imagine you at least know who Walt is Initially he might also think of some of our earlier regulatory work But ask him about the following The WPPSS negotiation The impetus for this was a massive lawsuit but the solution was a transaction that we put together It was a creative arrangement substituting phantom generating projects for real but dead projects and supplying the physical power when called upon with BPA system power and the rest of the time doing an imaginary power supply that was really a financial swap that offset the price that various parties paid Again we had to analyze preexisting contracts the law and the regulatory framework in which all the parties operated but the crux of this matter was a series of very complicated contracts creating both physical and financial transactions Also ask Walt about the transmission contracts we negotiated on behalf of BPAs large generating customers BPA wanted to and historically had dictated terms for access to and use of the BPA transmission facilities Utilities that had some of their own generation that they wanted to put onto the grid had to deal with BPA which viewed them as competitors more than customers although they were both I played on the customer roll and the fact that BPA would eventually lose them as customers if it persisted in its imperious conduct in order to negotiate the terms of transmission contracts in that other role as competitors Again there was certainly a regulatory aspect to this whole matter but it was essentially a transactional matter captured in contracts with BPA and leading to the second shoe fallingin the form of the generating project development and sales that the utility customers then were able to undertake and which I helped to negotiate at the same time Next contact Loren Baker President of Power Resource Managers th Ave NE Suite Bellevue Washington Phone I worked for PRM on a proposed package of generating resources that were being developed on behalf of a consortium of utilities Depending on the ultimate level of

Commission Hearings on Rate Stabilization Plans You are undoubtedly aware of the critical energy situation in California Among other things the FERC has issued an order for the restructuring of the wholesale market and the California PUC is continuing hearings on rate relief for the investor owned utilities and other issues We are monitoring the hearings in both Washington and California and advising our friends and clients as developments occur The following is our most recent report Hearings on PGEs and SCEs rate stabilization plans continued on Friday with testimony by Walter Campbell Director of Business and Financial Planning at PGE who presented PGEs prima facie case and James Asseltine Managing Director at Lehman Brothers who testified as to PGEs financial condition President Lynch attended the hearings in the morning I understand that the Republican appointed Commissioners are on vacation and have been noticeably absent from the hearings Hearings will continue on Tuesday January with testimony from Edison Also on Tuesday an all party meeting will be held with Commissioner Wood presumably for the purpose of facilitating settlement negotiations on Thursday December Governor Davis facilitated a similar meeting between the utilities and consumer groups with little progress The Commission meeting is scheduled for Thursday January at which time the Commission is expected to issue a final order a copy of the final order may be posted on the Commissions website at wwwcpuccagov minutes prior to the meeting PGE is requesting An end to the rate freeze An explicit statement that procurement costs are recoverable in rates from retail customers Surprisingly Mr Campbell indicated that rate recovery on a going forward basis from the October or November billing periods may be a survivable outcome for PGE this was later downplayed on redirect examination A meaningful rate increase Mr Campbell indicated that PGE would be satisfied with a increase in rates Follow up means of subsequent rate increases Mr Campbell indicated that customers could expect rate increases totaling up to over the next two years depending on market conditions SCE who will be crossexamined on Tuesday is asking for a larger rate increasean average of immediately to be followed by an undetermined number of rate hikes over the next two years The following facts came out in the crossexamination of PGE PGE recovered billion in its transition cost recovery account during the transition period PGE transferred billion during the transition period to its parent PGE paid dividends of during the transition period PGE paid a dividend of million in October when it knew as soon as June that it was amassing a huge underrecovery of its procurement costs For the th quarter PGEs parent has declared a dividend a legal obligation of the parent PGE has not determined whether to declare a dividend PGEs parent has approximately million in cash which it could use to pay its declared dividend of the parent companys revenues came from PGE in PGE projects a borrowing need of billion in the first quarter of PGE will not have sufficient cash to purchase gas or electricity within to weeks PGE has not attempted to borrow from its parent and its parent has little or no borrowing power There is not enough time for its parent to consider selling assets of other subsidiaries PGE is fully borrowed under its commercial paper programs and bank lines PGE has not considered cutting back executive salaries Parent company subsidiaries made million on power trading in Western markets On Tuesday PGE will report on its generation revenues Mr Campbell indicated that approximately of the undercollections could be netted out by the generation revenues By the end of the year PGE estimated that its undercollections will total more than billion Based on the last several days I believe that the Commission is very reluctant to declare an end to the rate freeze particularly if this means that the Commission will lose rate control over the hydro assets Alternatively I believe that President Lynch feels that she has the necessary statutory authority to order interim emergency rate relief subject to refund In this regard in the last day of hearings I believe that PGE met its burden of establishing an emergency condition which will allow the Commission to act on an emergency basis Several months ago at an industry conference where Commissioner Wood spoke he indicated that he felt his only responsibility under the law was to consumers Thus I would expect Commissioner Wood to be on the low end on the percentage of rate increase allowed he does not seem to concerned about the utility entering bankruptcy Loretta Lynch takes her cue from Governor Davis and Governor Davis has publicly stated that a rate increase may be reasonable Commissioner Neepers term ends Sunday and he will not vote on the order As mentioned above Commissioners Duque and Bilas have been noticeably absent from these proceedings In any event given the way President Lynch controls the Commission you can expect her view to prevail and rate increases to be more in the range of I also believe that Commissioner Wood and President Lynch are inclined to find that the utilities undercollections to date are a risk they assumed under AB It is possible that the Commission will allow the recovery of past undercollections but would net out the undercollections with its generation revenues As far as subsequent rate increases on a going forward basis President Lynch has indicated that she is only willing to consider the issues which must be decided on an emergency basis She will likely reject any attempt by the utilities to obtain rate relief on an emergency basis for periods which could be the subject of a full rate hearing Please feel free to contact me at or Ed Feo at with any questions or requests for documents Milbank will plan to cover and issue a report on Tuesdays hearing and the

Subject Additional References Hello Sheila I am surprised that the people whom I listed did not speak about transactional work I suspect that part of it is that they tend to remember things we first did togetherfirst impressions are most readily recalled Therefore this time I will give some notes to accompany the names to help you jog their memories about things we worked on together First I would like you to talk again to Fergus Pilon at Columbia River PUD Ask him about the Coastal Corporation transactions That involved their biggest industrial customer who announced that they either wanted off the system or wanted a sweetheart deal I helped the PUD call the customers bluff and then we negotiated a mutually beneficial longterm power purchase agreement That transaction had a regulatory piece to it in that we had to set out the boundaries on the flexibility available to the industrial customer before we could negotiate from a position of relative strength But it was much more of a deal negotiation in that we put together a power supply arrangement for the customer that was unlike anything either party had ever done instead of cramming a short term victory through and creating an enemy that would leave the utility as soon as it was possiblewhich could have been in a few years The crux of the deal was putting together the contract I am sure this is very similar to a lot of the ENA origination work being done out of Portland Next ask Fergus about the work I did for them on the Iron Carbide project This was a proposed project that never came about It would have brought in a new large industrial customer to the utilitys system We drafted an MOU between the industrial customer the utility and the developer for an EPC project and then fleshed it out with project documents ownership agreement OM agreement etc The project fell apart when the customer changed its mind about building the new processing plant But we spent a significant amount of time creating the business terms for a deal and putting it all into contract form Next I suggest you talk to Walt Pollock at Portland General I imagine you at least know who Walt is Initially he might also think of some of our earlier regulatory work But ask him about the following The WPPSS negotiation The impetus for this was a massive lawsuit but the solution was a transaction that we put together It was a creative arrangement substituting phantom generating projects for real but dead projects and supplying the physical power when called upon with BPA system power and the rest of the time doing an imaginary power supply that was really a financial swap that offset the price that various parties paid Again we had to analyze preexisting contracts the law and the regulatory framework in which all the parties operated but the crux of this matter was a series of very complicated contracts creating both physical and financial transactions Also ask Walt about the transmission contracts we negotiated on behalf of BPAs large generating customers BPA wanted to and historically had dictated terms for access to and use of the BPA transmission facilities Utilities that had some of their own generation that they wanted to put onto the grid had to deal with BPA which viewed them as competitors more than customers although they were both I played on the customer roll and the fact that BPA would eventually lose them as customers if it persisted in its imperious conduct in order to negotiate the terms of transmission contracts in that other role as competitors Again there was certainly a regulatory aspect to this whole matter but it was essentially a transactional matter captured in contracts with BPA and leading to the second shoe fallingin the form of the generating project development and sales that the utility customers then were able to undertake and which I helped to negotiate at the same time Next contact Loren Baker President of Power Resource Managers th Ave NE Suite Bellevue Washington Phone I worked for PRM on a proposed package of generating resources that were being developed on behalf of a consortium of utilities Depending on the ultimate level of demand the package was going to include a number of different generating projects I drafted the MOU among the utilities the prospective developers something like different developers at various times narrowing to at the point that negotiations got serious I then drafted ownership agreements OM agreements etc for the various proposed projects These projects were not developed ultimately because a critical mass of the utility sponsors dropped out of the package Probably more than for any single client I did project development work for the Eugene Water Electric Board I could give you the name of the project development manager there and he would give me a glowing recommendation I would rather not do that however because EWEB is still very close to Larry Cable and I would rather that at this point our conversations not get back to himas would certainly be the case if you contacted anyone at EWEB If you can adequately do your due diligence on me without talking to EWEB I would prefer
