BUSINESS RISK MANAGEMENT OR JUST PLAIN BUSINESS RISK THE BIG BANG IN was a year like no other The magnitude of events and economic repercussions have been difficult to manage for many We as industry participants have witnessed tremendous uncertainty and price volatility which resulted in stratospheric price increases and the collapse of energy markets As markets died actually returned to historical lows and as industry participants filed for bankruptcy we are left with the question What next INDUSTRY IN FLUX The industry is in a state of flux once again and floundering badly The California experiment and the Enron model proved to be economic disasters that may never be rivaled After the fallout who is left to blame Do we scapegoat it to the California regulators to those eager to make a buck or to an overriding failure of all us to recognize the complexity and unique nature of the energy industry CUTBACKS AND LAYOFFS The worrisome reaction of many industry participants coast to coast at this time has been to dramatically cut capital spending and reduce staff This may seem a safe option given the relative calm of energy prices in our opinion this strategy may be suspect in the longterm The forthcoming changes from regulators and from within the industry itself will be massive and will require significant resources to implement Will you be ready for the onslaught Business protocol must change and that change will be all encompassing US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan expressed confidence that there would be significant changes to accounting practices and corporate governance of the energy industry as a result of the EnronAnderson scandal THE CERTAINTY OF CONTINUED UNCERTAINTY If we have learned anything in the last six years since the opening of the Alberta Power Pool on January it is that the market is violently uncertain There is no indication that the industry will stabilize any time soon The other not so obvious observation is that those corporations operating in competitive markets with solid infrastructure effective trade and risk policy and the ability to intelligently analyze large amounts of data have come into in relatively good shape The industry as it is currently situated suggests a need for some level of conservatism without compromising corporate integrity Perhaps now is not the time to cutback but rather to shoreup while there is a break in the storm HOW ARE YOU POSITIONED What corporations should be asking is how actions I am taking today will impact tomorrows business opportunities We know many are cutting back on expenditures but is this at the cost of risk exposure or lost opportunity There is limited risk as long as prices are low but we all know that the industry has thus far behaved outside of anybodys expectations There is no reason why uncertainty will not continue to prevail ZE POWERGROUP CAN HELP We have spent the better part of the last six
