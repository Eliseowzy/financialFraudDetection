Harris is out of the office In reference to Arbitration we can agree to Arbitration in the English Courts Daniel will contact you tomorrow in reference to the remaining points I look forward to receiving the outstanding documentation Kind regards Talya Gordon Original Message From Shackleton Sara mailtoSara NRONcom Sent September To Harris Daniel ENRON Cc Heard Marie Glover Sheila Subject RE ECT Investments Inc account with Goldman Sachs International Daniel Thank you for your response Unfortunately the outstanding issues relating to the Terms of Business Letter impact our corporate policy If you insist upon arbitration it should be at either partys option and we can agree to arbitrate in accordance with the International Chamber of Commerce Rules Also as you mentioned below there may be nonprime brokerage issues that relate to the terms of business and therefore are not adequately addressed in the terms of business letter We do have other business relationships with GSI and again request inclusion of limitation of liability language in the terms of business letter I propose Neither party shall have any liability arising from this Letter or from any obligations which relate to this Letter for any indirect special punitive exemplary incidental or consequential loss or damage Please reconsider the foregoing with explanation I will be out of the office in the am All remaining documents have been completed and we will have them executed together with the terms of business letter Regards Sara Sara Shackleton Enron Wholesale Services Smith Street EBa Houston TX Ph Fax Original Message From Harris Daniel ENRON mailtoIMCEANOTESHarrisCDanielCDanielEHarrisgs EcomE NRONcom Sent Tuesday September AM To Shackleton Sara Subject RE ECT Investments Inc account with Goldman Sachs International Sara The terms of business are GSIs general terms and span your relationship with GSI generally There may be nonprime brokerage issues that relate to the terms of business Not everything in the TOBs intersects with the PB relationship certainly if you do other business with GSI Re the liability provision I think your concerns are adequately addressed in the documentation as drafted I would be grateful if you would come back to me as soon as possible so we can try to get this wrapped up today Kind regards Daniel Original Message From mailto Sent September To Subject RE ECT Investments Inc account with Goldman Sachs International Daniel Thanks for the message It seems to me that the terms of the PB conflict because J conflicts with A that is i J conflicts with Par requiring the conclusion that English courts will not apply to the Terms of Business agreement and ii A requires that English courts prevail Are you agreeing with this analysis Also there is nothing in the Terms of Business agreement to conflict with the limitation of liability language of the PB applicable to the PB except for silence on the matter You didnt address this point It is Enron Corp policy to include such language and I would like to limit the Terms of Business in the same manner Can you call me at am Houston time on Tuesday Sept or suggest a different time I am not trying to belabor execution of the the remaining documents Thanks Sara Shackleton Enron Wholesale Services Smith Street EBa Houston TX Ph Fax Original Message From Harris Daniel ENRON mailtoIMCEANOTESHarrisCDanielCDanielEHarrisgs Ecom E NRONcom Sent Monday September AM To Shackleton Sara Cc Heard Marie Subject RE ECT Investments Inc account with Goldman Sachs International Sara Actually I believe we resolved these when we spoke Arbitration more appropriate to general terms of business which principally contemplate the regulatory rules to which we are subject SFA rules In the event of inconsistency the terms of the PB agreement govern clause A I also amended the OSLA by side letter which I sent over Kind regards Daniel Original Message From Shackleton Sara mailtoSara NRONcom Sent September To Cc Heard Marie Subject ECT Investments Inc account with Goldman Sachs International Daniel Thanks for finalizing the Prime Brokerage Agreement the Agreement with my colleague Angela Davis I have two points with respect to the Terms of Business Letter relating to the changes made to the Agreement which I believe we discussed but were not in a position to resolve at the time These are Par Arbitration which should conform to Clause J Par of the Agreement I recall that we were discussing the possible use of arbitration in the Agreement and existence of arbitration in the OSLA so that we would not need to amend this particular paragraph of the Terms of Business Letter Since we ultimately agreed to English courts I think we need to conform the Terms of Business Letter which will prevail if in conflict with the Agreement Par Arbitration which should be limited in the same manner as Clause J Par as to limitation of liability I believe that you and Angela agreed to the revisions in the Agreement Why shouldnt these be mirrored in the Terms of Business Letter I look forward to hearing from you and completing the rest of the account documentation Regards Sara
