to general processes surrounding holding cash at a Canadian bank I know that Enron Canadas policy is to not take cash collateral by wire transfer into a bank account The primary reason for this policy involves risks associated with our Personal Property Registration System to perfect a security interest in a wire transfer requires the registration of a financing statement multijurisdictional
