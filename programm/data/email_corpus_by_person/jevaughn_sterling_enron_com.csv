<22899492.1075858662117.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,jevaughn.sterling@enron.com,2001-10-25 16:47:07,Re NJ Index plus Cc While it is highly desirable to standardize products across regions it is not often possible to maintain the same value proposition in all regions For example NJ does not have a post transition default service as is the case for Maryland New York may be able to offer ICAP and Ancillaries in the fixed basis At this point it appears that New Jerseys fixed basis will only include deal costs consumption credit billing scheduling fees and incentive repayment Therefore NJ fixed basis will differ from that of New Yorks We should await the final outcome of the Mark to Market issue before settling on the language for the NJ fixed basis On the subject of Excess Usage during the index period any excess usage on the part of the customer will mean more revenue for EES in the form of fixed basis times actual usage We should not impose an upper limit on an index product where actual volumes are passed through to the customer I agree however that there should be deficiency language to protect the fixed basis that is marked Thanks Enron Energy Services From Mike D Smith PM To Jevaughn ES cc Berney C nronXGate Phil ES Liqun ES Richard ES Michele nronXgate Jim ES Nina ES Christopher ES James M ES Bob ES Gillian ES Sean A ES Subject Re NJ Index plus Please see attached I am offering up some expanded language around the index we use so that it is more clear If we settle on that language the spot energy price may need to be modified accordingly I am trying to make this consistent with the NY offering which is similar in terms of how the index based price will work and what the basis will include I am not convinced that we cant express the basis as the Fixed Basis rather than a plug number in the EESI Energy Price definition so I have left it the way it was I am also not convinced that we can do away with excess and deficiency usage calculations during the index period I have added in the option to fix language but I am not sure it is necessary or desirable to have it It is really an optic customers always have the right to request a restructured price and Im not sure there is any reason to offer it in our form unless origination has as strong marketbased reason to do so MDS Embedded StdOleLink
<23711032.1075858663644.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,jevaughn.sterling@enron.com,2001-10-24 13:19:40,Re NJ Index plus Cc From a mark to market perspective the fixed basis as it is defined in the MD and NJ Index products include deal costs which are not considered market related thus MTM accounting rules do not apply By defining the index as PJM plus per kWh we effectively tie the deal cost to the index and mark the transactions accordingly Please see my note previous note on this issue EESI Energy Price means the sum of the weighted average weighted in accordance with the Accounts hourly usage or the Utility rate class usage profile of hourly Real Time Locational Marginal Price for the applicable Utility load zone as posted by the ISO plus per kWh All references to the fixed basis as a separate component of the EESI Energy Price should be removed from the contract language I have also changed the Contract Price language so that the incentive is given to the customer on his actual usage up to anticipated usage For each Billing Cycle from the commencement of the Transaction Term through July an amount equal to what the Utility Invoice would have been for such Account had you purchased the Accounts Actual Usage from the Utility under the Prevailing Utility Tariff Rate minus per kWh of Actual Usage up to the Anticipated Usage You will also be responsible for and pay or reimburse us if we have paid Special Utility Charges to the extent not already included in the Prevailing Utility Tariff Rate and Taxes Language that describes the customers option to enter a fixed price agreement with EES is also necessary To the extent a Fixed Energy Price has not already been agreed to you may request that we provide a fixed price quote for energy to replace the EESI Energy Price a Fixed Energy Price by contacting us between am and pm central time of any Business Day requesting a quote for such Fixed Energy Price Upon receipt of your request we will notify you of the Fixed Energy Price the length of time you have to either accept or reject the Fixed Energy Price and any additional credit terms or other contractual terms relative to such Fixed Energy Price If you accept such Fixed Energy Price within the specified time we will send to you for your execution a written confirmation or amendment to this Confirmation documenting any confirmed Fixed Energy Price any additional credit terms and any other applicable modifications to this Confirmation If such Fixed Energy Price is not confirmed by both you and us the EESI Energy Price will remain unchanged The Mid Form contracts will be needed and should read similarly The answer to your question below is that the difference between the two is the basis and the energy component is a wash IS THIS THE RIGHT DEFINITION OF SPOT ENERGY PRICE HOW IS IT DIFFERENT FROM THE INDEX PORTION OF THE EESI ENERGY PRICE IS IT JUST THE BASIS AND THE ENERGY COMPONENT IS A WASH Spot Energy Price means the weighted average weighted in accordance with the Accounts hourly usage or the Utility rate class usage profile of hourly Real Time Locational Marginal Price for the applicable Utility load zone as posted by the ISO plus all nonUtility charges arising from uplifts installed capacity ancillary services losses congestion and other ISO charges or administrative fees incurred in connection with delivery of energy to the Delivery Point There is no need for Excess Usage Language in the contract however deficiency language will apply as follows There will be no additional charges for Excess or Deficiency Usage through July From August through the end of the Transaction Term there will be no additional charges for Excess Usage however for each kWh of Deficiency Usage at each Account for each month you will pay us an amount equal to the per kWh multiplied by the Deficiency Usage Please contact me if you have further questions Jevaughn Enron Energy Services From Mike D Smith PM To Jevaughn ES cc Berney C nronXGate Phil ES Liqun ES Richard ES Michele nronXgate Jim ES Nina ES Christopher ES James M ES Bob ES Gillian ES Sean A ES Subject Re NJ Index plus Why is this formulation of the EESI Energy Price any different than saying plus the Fixed Basis and then defining the Fixed Basis as a kWh amount Isnt it exactly the same Weve written it the way it was before so it is easy to plug in the fixed basis number Why have you changed the calculations of excess and deficiency usage charges during the index period Why have you used the reference to a Management Fee in the new language Why are there no charges for Excess Usage during the index periodare you really giving them the fised basis position for unlimited usage Jevaughn Sterling PM To Berney C nronXGate Phil ES Liqun ES Richard ES Michele nronXgate Jim ES Nina ES Christopher ES cc NJ Team James M ES Mike D ES Bob ES Gillian ES Subject NJ Index plus Following todays discussions with the Transaction Accounting group to discuss fixed basis Mark to Market Product Management has modified the definition of the EESI Energy Price The conclusion of the discussion with Transaction Accounting was that the Index product does in fact create a commodity position that the commodity desk can choose to manage The revenue position that is created when the contract is signed with the customer will be settled based on the published PJM Zone LMP nevertheless the commodity desk may choose to manage their cost otherwise The proposed fixed basis will be treated as ONE with the index in determining the EESI Energy Price This approach is very similar in nature to the definition of the Plus that is defined in the ENovative Lite Energy Service Agreement for Gas products Therefore the EESI Energy Price will now read EESI Energy Price means the sum of the weighted average weighted in accordance with the Accounts hourly usage or the Utility rate class usage profile of hourly Real Time Locational Marginal Price for the applicable Utility load zone as posted by the ISO plus per kWh Please see the attached transaction confirmation and comment on the new definition of the fixed basis All references to the fixed basis Management Fee as a separate component of the EESI Energy Price should be removed from the contract language Please provide your comments accordingly Thanks Embedded StdOleLink
