vested at this point I will ask the Facility Planning folks to get started on providing a more detailed budget quality estimate of the cost to construct the interconnect and metering station With recent changes in FERC regulations concerning pregranted authority to construct delivery points TW can immediately proceed to build without the complication of a FERC prior notice filing as was required in the past Therefore the only limiting factor at this point is the time it takes to put together the estimate as well as the documentation well need in order to implement a new delivery point on the system To this end I see the following documents Letter Agreement authorizing TW to open a work order to proceed with the budget quality estimate This will involve a commitment by Big Sandy to reimburse TW for the cost of the engineering if Big Sandy ultimately pulls out of the project A Facilities Construction and Operating Agreement providing for the reimbursement by Big Sandy for TWs construction of the tap andor metering station This agreement would also provide for TWs operation of the metering station if Big Sandy elects to it to TW specification in order to avoid the CIAC An Operator Balancing Agreement OBA a standard tariff form agreement defining the role of Big Sandy as delivery point operator as well as the disposition of any volumetric imbalances that may accrue during the month From a timeline standpoint we can be in the position to get these documents completed within a relatively short time days depending on whether there are any sticking points in our negotiations By the way the only agreement that may take some time to work through is no on the list although with our recent experience in hooking up other plants on the system this past year weve already done a lot of the lawyering spade work Not that Im especially found of meetings but its been a while since weve met to discuss the physical requirements of the facilities Moreover weve got some new people in our Facility Planning and Engineering and Construction groups who would benefit from meeting their counter parties on the project side May I suggest a facetoface meeting where I can bring our planners and engineers to meet with their counter parties to kick off this project We can meet anywhere its convenient for you guys I look forward to working with you on this project Original Message From Kirk Ketcherside ENRON mailtoIMCEANOTESKirkKetchersideCiginctimesEnetE NRONcom Sent Wednesday March PM To Fawcett Jeffery Subject Re Big Sandy Project Jeff Well it has been a few weeks since we last discussed the Big Sandy Project and I want to move forward based on our last conversationemail Specifically I would like to formalize a more detailed interconnect MSAtap study and associated cost estimate for Big Sandy I also want to obtain from you a timeline including all the necessary documentsagreements based on a projected Big Sandy online date of At this point I am recommending that the Project look to TW for most if not all of its natural gas requirements and thus the pressure integration issue is not relevant We are simply looking for a TW tap with mainline pressure and a TW constructed MSA I understand the CIAC issue and as such the Project may elect to construct the MSA per TW specs to mitigate the tax implications Please let me know what additional information require to support this activity Thank you in advance for your efforts in bringing this project to commercialization Kirk wrote You betcha We look forward to working with you on this project Talk to you next week Kirk Ketcherside on PM To cc Subject Re Big Sandy Project Thanks Jeff for your prompt response I just got back in the office today I will contact you early next week to discuss our next steps Have a great weekend Kirk wrote Kirk Weve put together a quick estimate of the cost to install the interconnect and measurement facilities off Transwestern The estimate was based on the original operating conditions of Phase MMcfd and Phase MMcfd given to us early in discussions with George Briden The subject facilities will include a tiein to both TW mainlines a redundancy feature allowing continued use of one line if the other line is temporarily taken out of service for maintenance or is the subject of some type of failure mainline valves turbine meter gallagher flow conditioner telemetry flow control etc The order of magnitude estimated cost is Not knowing your design and proposed schematic showing joint operations with El Paso andor Southern Trails this estimate does not include a pressure control andor pressure let down equipment Consequently the project will have to control pressure in the lateral system As you know its operationally problematic to design for both pressure and flow control into a common header system accepting deliveries from multiple pipelines operating at different pressures However Transwestern will be amenable to working with the project and the other interstate pipelines to optimize the ultimate design of all metering and lateral pipeline facilities Also the K estimate does not include any build up for income tax If the project reimburses Transwestern for the cost of Transwestern constructing the interconnect and metering station Transwestern will recognize a taxable event Use approx as an effective corporate tax rate for purposes of calculating the price buildup As a means to avoid the tax consequence Transwestern is agreeable to the idea of the project building the metering station to Transwesterns specifications with Transwestern operating the facilities under an Operating Agreement We can discuss these structuring questions as the project develops and we get to the point of executing project documents for the provisioning of service to the project Our facility planners and I are available to answer questions for you Please give me a call Kirk Ketcherside on PM To cc

note I sent to Rick Moore Rick works for a company called Amerimex Rick and I worked together in gas supply at EPNG the early years Amerimex is a developer of trigeneration projects In addition to the subject project for Bloomfield another one is being considered for Santa Theresa NM If you recall we were introduced to trigeneration when we were discussing an electric generation plant on the site of a hydroponic tomato greenhouse near Gallup Trigeneration is an environmentally friendly technology that utilizes the byproducts of electric generation Cogeneration refers to the process where waste heatsteam generated during the combustion of gas turbines is sold commercially usually to manufacturing facilities for plant purposes Trigeneration on the other hand refers the process where not only is the waste heatsteam utilized but also the carbon dioxide Therefore trigeneration is a perfect fit for a greenhouse that requires both heat and carbon dioxide for the plants Amerimex has proposed a hydroponic lettuce greenhouse in the Bloomfield NM area The facility to be constructed turnkey by United Technologies would have a nominal rating of MW resulting in a gas burn of about MMcfd The plant would require gas deliveries at approx psig The outtake power would be sold both locally and on the grid using a TriStates kv transmission line that is proximate to the site Given the politically correct nature of these facilities the City of Farmington has agreed to fund construction with a MM bond As you can see were in the very earliest stages of conversation Well keep the group posted on

public funds a precursor to a formal bond issue to underpin the financing To refresh your memory this project is another trigeneration project Ameramex will use the waste steam from the electric generation turbines to heat a hydroponic lettuce farm as well as use the combustion carbon dioxide Weve previously provided a route map and estimate mi of pipe K directindirect cost to Ameramex Ameramexs financing deal is now dependent upon completion of the interconnect and commencement of service in approx months To this end Ameramax has requested a walk through of the potential route and a revised if necessary estimate of the cost to interconnect There are several other issues to be dealt with here including what is the final deal structure including whether TW may possibly providing interim financing until the issuance of the muni bonds Rick Moore would like to get together with myself and representatives of operations andor engineering to survey the route and decide on the ultimate designconfiguration of facilities Depending on the outcome of the survey hed like a formal proposal for TW for financing the construction of the lateral and interconnect facilities Ron since you provided all the prior facility planning support Id like for you to continue providing the liason support to TW Commercial on this project Ill also be calling on the San Juan Team to work with you

the suction side of Bloomfield CS The pipeline would start there a travel about miles to the northwest section of the proposed site see attached map A metering facility would be located at the beginning of the pipeline still inside of TWs property along with the other meter facilities Below is a breakdown of the facility cost Estimated costs are and would have to be refined miles of

NRON Subject Amerimex Bloomfield Project Attached see a note I sent to Rick Moore Rick works for a company called Amerimex Rick and I worked together in gas supply at EPNG the early years Amerimex is a developer of trigeneration projects In addition to the subject project for Bloomfield another one is being considered for Santa Theresa NM If you recall we were introduced to trigeneration when we were discussing an electric generation plant on the site of a hydroponic tomato greenhouse near Gallup Trigeneration is an environmentally friendly technology that utilizes the byproducts of electric generation Cogeneration refers to the process where waste heatsteam generated during the combustion of gas turbines is sold commercially usually to manufacturing facilities for plant purposes Trigeneration on the other hand refers the process where not only is the waste heatsteam utilized but also the carbon dioxide Therefore trigeneration is a perfect fit for a greenhouse that requires both heat and carbon dioxide for the plants Amerimex has proposed a hydroponic lettuce greenhouse in the Bloomfield NM area The facility to be constructed turnkey by United Technologies would have a nominal rating of MW resulting in a gas burn of about MMcfd The plant would require gas deliveries at approx psig The outtake power would be sold both locally and on the grid using a TriStates kv transmission line that is proximate to the site Given the politically correct nature of these facilities the City of Farmington has agreed to fund construction with a MM bond As you can see were in the very earliest stages of conversation Well keep the group posted on progress Forwarded by Jeffery FawcettETSEnron on AM Jeffery Fawcett AM To cc Ronald MatthewsET NRON Subject Amerimex Bloomfield

about engineering matters However since weve recently worked with our other power plants to get them up and running the data is still pretty fresh If Im speaking out of school here my operations andor engineering buddies will be quick to correct me At the proposed takeoff point to your Big Sandy Project flowing gas on TW is in the range of psig We provide a minimum of psig to the LDCs connected with us at the California border Therefore for purposes of your takeaway lateral pipeline design Id say that psig is probably a pretty good target number However I must stress that the psig is a flowing gas number and would surely be impacted by how the gas is taken That is to say that TW may provide the psig pressure if and only if all of the downstream operators folllow their schedules for delivery For example none of our new power plants can simply rampup without giving TW ample notice of startup and scheduling an appropriate quantity of gas We can get into more detail regarding the requirements for operating the Big Sandy delivery point and scheduling gas on TW to meet the plants requirements at a later date Suffice it to say that a plant the size of the Big Sandy project presents some unique operating challenges to TW TW has but Bcfd of gas flowing westward Directlyconnected gas turbines can quickly deplete TWs linepack However that being said we will do our best to work with Big Sandy as well as our other power plant partners to try and meet the loading requirements of the facilities My gas control coordinator is about go on his honeymoon during the middle weeks of May We should think about having our meeting after he returns after May so that we have not only our engineers but the proper operations and gas control personnel present also Check you calendar and let me know what dates might work for you guys Thanks Jeff Original Message From Kirk Ketcherside ENRON mailtoIMCEANOTESKirkKetchersideCiginctimesEnetE NRONcom Sent Tuesday May PM To Fawcett Jeffery Cc Tim Subject Big Sandy Project pressure information Jeff As a followup to my phone mail message of last Friday I wanted to verify for Tims work what the expected minimum inlet pressure would be off of your pipeline delivered into our proposed Project line at the proposed interconnect This information plays directly into the current engineering work that he is leading Per your good suggestion I also want to schedule a meeting to be held in the next couple of weeks in efforts to further our Project interconnect discussion Thank you Kirk wrote Kirk Great to hear that the project is moving forward I think TW feels its emotionally vested at this point I will ask the Facility Planning folks to get started on providing a more detailed budget quality estimate of the cost to construct the interconnect and metering station With recent changes in FERC regulations concerning pregranted authority to construct delivery points TW can immediately proceed to build without the complication of a FERC prior notice filing as was required in the past Therefore the only limiting factor at this point is the time it takes to put together the estimate as well as the documentation well need in order to implement a new delivery point on the system To this end I see the following documents Letter Agreement authorizing TW to open a work order to proceed with the budget quality estimate This will involve a commitment by Big Sandy to reimburse TW for the cost of the engineering if Big Sandy ultimately pulls out of the project A Facilities Construction and Operating Agreement providing for the reimbursement by Big Sandy for TWs construction of the tap andor metering station This agreement would also provide for TWs operation of the metering station if Big Sandy elects to it to TW specification in order to avoid the CIAC An Operator Balancing Agreement OBA a standard tariff form agreement defining the role of Big Sandy as delivery point operator as well as the disposition of any volumetric imbalances that may accrue during the month From a timeline standpoint we can be in the position to get these documents completed within a relatively short time days depending on whether there are any sticking points in our negotiations By the way the only agreement that may take some time to work through is no on the list although with our recent experience in hooking up other plants on the system this past year weve already done a lot of the lawyering spade work Not that Im especially found of meetings but its been a while since weve met to discuss the physical requirements of the facilities Moreover weve got some new people in our Facility Planning and Engineering and Construction groups who would benefit from meeting their counter parties on the project side May I suggest a facetoface meeting where I can bring our planners and engineers to meet with their counter parties to kick off this project We can meet anywhere its convenient for you

Subject Re Big Sandy Project Jeff Well it has been a few weeks since we last discussed the Big Sandy Project and I want to move forward based on our last conversationemail Specifically I would like to formalize a more detailed interconnect MSAtap study and associated cost estimate for Big Sandy I also want to obtain from you a timeline including all the necessary documentsagreements based on a projected Big Sandy online date of At this point I am recommending that the Project look to TW for most if not all of its natural gas requirements and thus the pressure integration issue is not relevant We are simply looking for a TW tap with mainline pressure and a TW constructed MSA I understand the CIAC issue and as such the Project may elect to construct the MSA per TW specs to mitigate the tax implications Please let me know what additional information require to support this activity Thank you in advance for your efforts in bringing this project to commercialization Kirk wrote You

office today I will contact you early next week to discuss our next steps Have a great weekend Kirk wrote Kirk Weve put together a quick estimate of the cost to install the interconnect and measurement facilities off Transwestern The estimate was based on the original operating conditions of Phase MMcfd and Phase MMcfd given to us early in discussions with George Briden The subject facilities will include a tiein to both TW mainlines a redundancy feature allowing continued use of one line if the other line is temporarily taken out of service for maintenance or is the subject of some type of failure mainline valves turbine meter gallagher flow conditioner telemetry flow control etc The order of magnitude estimated cost is Not knowing your design and proposed schematic showing joint operations with El Paso andor Southern Trails this estimate does not include a pressure control andor pressure let down equipment Consequently the project will have to control pressure in the lateral system As you know its operationally problematic to design for both pressure and flow control into a common header system accepting deliveries from multiple pipelines operating at different pressures However Transwestern will be amenable to working with the project and the other interstate pipelines to optimize the ultimate design of all metering and lateral pipeline facilities Also the K estimate does not include any build up for income tax If the project reimburses Transwestern for the cost of Transwestern constructing the interconnect and metering station Transwestern will recognize a taxable event Use approx as an effective corporate tax rate for purposes of calculating the price buildup As a means to avoid the tax consequence Transwestern is agreeable to the idea of the project building the metering station to Transwesterns specifications with Transwestern operating the facilities under an Operating Agreement We can discuss these structuring questions as the project develops and we get to the point of executing project documents for the provisioning of service to the project Our facility planners and I are available to answer questions for you Please give

drafting session There were only nine of us involved with Ed Ross Skip Simmons and Craig C hancellor representing the generators while Byron White Georgia Carter an d myself were there to represent the pipelines The others were with the A lliance Ed was his usual self He was confidently making the good econom ic case why the pipelines should consider the generators position and how why the FERC would likely side with them Craig tried to frame it commerci ally and Skip played peacemaker Byron and I played a little good copba d cop on behalf of the pipes with Byron being the bad cop Anyway sum and substance I think well be more pleased with the next draf t of this document than what was submitted to us recently The first sent ence was replaced with a more sweeping statement of intent and mission of t he parties that focused on the provisioning of the service being subject to physical operating considerations There emerged a realization that maybe two products are being contemplated here a product that blocks out a period of time for uniform deliveries say hours and a product th at basically provides the generator an option on when to take the agreed up on block of capacity It was agreed that the first product is likely to be less valuable than the second and priced accordingly Byron and I argued that segmenting hourly rights should not be mandated and in fact may be physically impossible along some locations of the pipeline The generators originally intended segmenting as possibly relating to how the NURF rights were carved up by hour ex an hr block of d could be repackaged as two hr blocks of d Im not sure whether we got consensus th ere or not well have to see the next draft The big ticket items nos got the most press I was troubled by the generators interpretation of both In the case of no the generators wanted to predesignate a mechanism whereby an existing customer holding a f irm service whether FT NNS or storage could pursuant to the conversion formula remarket their original firm service as NURF The generators were looking at this provision as throwing a bone to existing customers who m ight want to compete with the pipeline for NURF service using capacity ex seasonal that may not be fully utilized Obviously the predetermined co nversion factor was a huge problem for the pipelines as well as the whole notion of trying to fit a round peg into a square hole ie two or more dif ferent product types We pointed out the services were all different and in fact any combination of those services conceivably could be repackag ed under todays rules and sold as a proxy for NURF I believe we were suc cessful in taming that language down substantially However be on the loo kout for the next draft Finally with respect to no where the generators want receipts consider ed rateable with deliveries for purposes of NURF the generators had an int ersting slant Essentially Ed was saying that he didnt want the pipeline s to hold the generators hostage on rates for NURF if the pipelines were th e only ones who could offer NURF By requiring the pipelines to consider r ateable receipts as meeting the NURF criteria then Ed said the generators would receive the benefits of a competitive marketplace for NURFlike ser vice Skip pointed out that taking gas out of storage at Westar in West Te xas and using it as an hour by hour offset for deliveries to a power plant located at the California border was probably unworkable However he also posed the hypothet that if SoCalGas were to provide the same storage servi ce at the California border and those deliveries into SoCalGas could be adj usted to take into account the deliveries to the power plant a sort of div ersion of gas theory then the pipeline should be operationally indifferen t to whether it was providing NURF service or a rd party was providing a N URFlike service They just want others to have the ability to compete wit h the pipeline Of course the pipeline argued that operationally those products may not be the same Moreover accepting such a nomination from SoCalGas could conce ivably knock off other uses of the capacity the pipeline was counting on I T LFT etc as an offset which gave rise to the lower rate for the pipeli nes NURF service Skip scratched out a more tame version of no and Ed agreed to consider it Be on the lookout for what they come up with Overall as I said Im glad I was there as well as the other pipeline rep resentatives I hope that we were successful in getting the generators bac k on track here Ill be interested in seeing how much of our discussion t oday is embodied in the next generator draft I told the group they were in trouble on Thursday as we were sending in th e A team Good luck and call if you have any questions

particularly disappointed that FERC did not call for retroactive price refunds for California electric customers as was requested by Gov Gray Davis The utility also said it was especially troubled that FERC shortened the timeframe for the electric price cap from the end of to April leaving customers exposed during the highdemand summer season Sen Dianne Feinstein DCA said FERCs action was unacceptable Rome is burning our utilities are close to bankruptcy Californians are facing major blackouts and the Commission is fiddling Hoecker said similar competitive problems in states in the Pacific Northwest have led to pleas from governors and others for regional price caps But he pointed to the fact that FERC is severely limited in what it can do in that region For one it lacks authority over the Bonneville Power Authority and other federal operations there which make up a major portion of the market Further there is no Northwest spot market that can be capped in the way caps operate in California There also would be problems with the many purchasers who already had hedged or protected themselves in some way Hoecker strongly urged Energy Secretary Bill Richardson to convene a conference to try to identify regional problems and offered his help in this Commissioners Curt Hebert and Massey said they would issue concurring opinions Hoecker said he will submit a concurring opinion next week on items such as RTOs that are beyond the scope of the order The Commissions actions which went beyond recommendations it had made earlier see Daily GPI Nov came at an emergency meeting following a week of continuous power alerts and emergency measures to avoid rolling blackouts in the state The Commissions reforms call for No retroactive refunds for California

FERCs action was unacceptable Rome is burning our utilities are close to bankruptcy Californians are facing major blackouts and the Commission is fiddling Hoecker said similar competitive problems in states in the Pacific Northwest have led to pleas from governors and others for regional price caps But he pointed to the fact that FERC is severely limited in what it can do in that region For one it lacks authority over the Bonneville Power Authority and other federal operations there which make up a major portion of the market Further there is no Northwest spot market that can be capped in the way caps operate in California There also would be problems with the many purchasers who already had hedged or protected themselves in some way Hoecker strongly urged Energy Secretary Bill Richardson to convene a conference to try to identify regional problems and offered his help in this Commissioners Curt Hebert and Massey said they would issue concurring opinions Hoecker said he will submit a concurring opinion next week on items such as RTOs that are beyond the scope of the order The Commissions actions which went beyond recommendations it had made earlier see Daily GPI Nov came at an emergency meeting following a week of continuous power alerts and emergency measures to avoid rolling blackouts in the state The Commissions reforms call for No retroactive refunds for California customers Elimination of the requirement that Californias three investorowned utilities Pacific Gas and Electric San Diego Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison sell all of their power into the CalPX and buy all of their power from the CalPX This took effect Friday Return MW of generation to state regulation Termination of the CalPX wholesale rate schedule effective the close of the trading day on April Create a benchmark price for wholesale bilateral contracts to assess prices of fiveyear energy supply contracts Create penalties for underscheduling power loads A requirement that market participants schedule of their load prior to real time Violators will incur penalties for scheduling deviations exceeding the greater of MW or of their hourly load Begin market monitoring and price mitigation for the CalISO and PX spot markets FERC will hold a technical conference to develop a monitoring an mitigation program A proposed plan is to be submitted by March so that the measure can be in place by May A singlepriced auction to be used only for bids at or below MW Bids above MW will not set the market clearing price although they will be subject to FERC reporting requirements Replacing the current CalISO stakeholder governing board with a nonstakeholder board On Jan the CalISO governing board members will be required to turn over their decisionmaking power and operating control to the management of the CalISO The members will be permitted to function in an advisory capacity until the new board is selected FERC to discuss with California representatives a process for selecting new CalISO board members and Modify interconnection procedures The ISO and utilities must file generation interconnection procedures

parties The purpose of the meeting was to review the status of the Caithness Big Sandy Project and to establish the next steps for moving the project forward Caithness Corporation Caithness Corp is a privately held company based in New York with a variety of business interests The company is essentially a financial vehicle for private investors Their energy segment currently owns MW of generation through renewable assets in California geothermal at Coso wind in Tehachapi and Palm Springs and a gas fired plant in South Carolina jointlyowned by Florida Power Light Big Sandy Project The Big Sandy Project is a proposed power plant to be located near Wickieup Arizona The project would be built in two phases first phase would be MW with a gas load of approx MMBtud and phase would add another MW for a total of MW with a gas load of MMBtud The proposed location of the plant is approximately miles south of Transwesterns pipeline The takeoff point on Transwestern would be atnear valve station approximately miles downstream of compressor Station The current estimate includes an alignment that follows Arizona state highway south to a location miles southeast of Wickieup in the SW of Section TN RW Mohave County Arizona There is a KV transmission line owned by WAPA that crosses the property This line is one of the principal electric transmission systems in the Southwest and extends from the Phoenix area to the Mead substation near Boulder City NV Ive included a WAPA map below which indicates this line Also on the site is a water pipeline owned by the Cyprus Amax Bagdad mine Water for the plant will come from an encapusulated water table through deep wells They have currently dug the first two test wells each capable of cfm The power plant will require approximately cfm of water In addition to the wells the plant has several thousandacre feet of water rights to surface water from the Big Sandy River The project may also purchase water from the Cyprus Bagdad water pipeline The chief geological feature of this area is the Big Sandy River and associated wash The highway roadbed follows along the river The area includes rolling hills and is principally desert terrain with some limited agricultural and ranching interests Wickieup is a very small town with an estimated population of Project Schedule Gas Turbines ordered WestinghouseSeimens May Submit Environmental Impact Statement EIS August Arrange financing December EIS approval March Construction begins April Testing begins July Commercial Operation November There are two lead agencies for purposes of the projects EIS the Bureau of Land Management BLM Kingman office and the Western Area Power Administration WAPA There is only one endangeredthreatened species known to be present in the area Lateral Pipeline Alignment The most critical path item is the alignment of the lateral pipeline The alignment lateral pipeline route must be included in the EIS to be filed next month Caithness has spoken preliminarily with the Arizona Department of Transportation ADOT and the agency is amenable to granting an easement for the pipeline The problem appears to be in the limited amount of right of way available Measured from the shoulder to the fenceline there is only a ft right of way available for construction Typically pipelines require a ft temporary construction easement and ft of permanent right of way Preliminary discussions indicate another problem with this alignment may be the roadways routing within the wash of the riverbed If the highway corridor is unsuitable for the pipeline the second alternative appears to be running the pipeline down the adjacent NS section line The problem with this approach is that as the line nears the site the routing would have to contend with the river bed and wash areas possibly necessitating deep burial and anchoring The other route would involve following along the WAPA electric transmission corridor The only issue there aside from whether WAPA would permit the pipeline encroachment is whether there are safety andor corrosion concerns associated with a high pressure gas line located under a high voltage transmission system Other Preliminary Project Issues There are other fundamental issues to address The original concept was to interconnect the proposed Transwestern lateral with El Pasos northern mainline and the yettobeconstructed Questar Southern Trails Pipeline both of which lay adjacent to Transwesterns mainline Transwesterns original estimate to construct a lateral pipeline and meter station MM was based on the following specifications MMcfd psig delivery pressure psig inlet pressure The meeting resulted in a revised set of specifications that now include a higher psig minimum delivery pressure new technology Westinghouse turbines In addition our understanding is that EPNGs system operates at a pressure psig lower than Transwesterns In order to accommodate EPNG deliveries and to account for the new higher minimum pressure the design will likely change to a pipeline Next Steps responsible partydepartment Task Date Due PartyDept Pipeline Alignment Estimate to plot lateral pipeline route

There were only nine of us involved with Ed Ross Skip Simmons and Craig Chancellor representing the generators while Byron White Georgia Carter and myself were there to represent the pipelines The others were with the Alliance Ed was his usual self He was confidently making the good economic case why the pipelines should consider the generators position and howwhy the FERC would likely side with them Craig tried to frame it commercially and Skip played peacemaker Byron and I played a little good copbad cop on behalf of the pipes with Byron being the bad cop Anyway sum and substance I think well be more pleased with the next draft of this document than what was submitted to us recently The first sentence was replaced with a more sweeping statement of intent and mission of the parties that focused on the provisioning of the service being subject to physical operating considerations There emerged a realization that maybe two products are being contemplated here a product that blocks out a period of time for uniform deliveries say hours and a product that basically provides the generator an option on when to take the agreed upon block of capacity It was agreed that the first product is likely to be less valuable than the second and priced accordingly Byron and I argued that segmenting hourly rights should not be mandated and in fact may be physically impossible along some locations of the pipeline The generators originally intended segmenting as possibly relating to how the NURF rights were carved up by hour ex an hr block of d could be repackaged as two hr blocks of d Im not sure whether we got consensus there or not well have to see the next draft The big ticket items nos got the most press I was troubled by the generators interpretation of both In the case of no the generators wanted to predesignate a mechanism whereby an existing customer holding a firm service whether FT NNS or storage could pursuant to the conversion formula remarket their original firm service as NURF The generators were looking at this provision as throwing a bone to existing customers who might want to compete with the pipeline for NURF service using capacity ex seasonal that may not be fully utilized Obviously the predetermined conversion factor was a huge problem for the pipelines as well as the whole notion of trying to fit a round peg into a square hole ie two or more different product types We pointed out the services were all different and in fact any combination of those services conceivably could be repackaged under todays rules and sold as a proxy for NURF I believe we were successful in taming that language down substantially However be on the lookout for the next draft Finally with respect to no where the generators want receipts considered rateable with deliveries for purposes of NURF the generators had an intersting slant Essentially Ed was saying that he didnt want the pipelines to hold the generators hostage on rates for NURF if the pipelines were the only ones who could offer NURF By requiring the pipelines to consider rateable receipts as meeting the NURF criteria then Ed said the generators would receive the benefits of a competitive marketplace for NURFlike service Skip pointed out that taking gas out of storage at Westar in West Texas and using it as an hour by hour offset for deliveries to a power plant located at the California border was probably unworkable However he also posed the hypothet that if SoCalGas were to provide the same storage service at the California border and those deliveries into SoCalGas could be adjusted to take into account the deliveries to the power plant a sort of diversion of gas theory then the pipeline should be operationally indifferent to whether it was providing NURF service or a rd party was providing a NURFlike service They just want others to have the ability to compete with the pipeline Of course the pipeline argued that operationally those products may not be the same Moreover accepting such a nomination from SoCalGas could conceivably knock off other uses of the capacity the pipeline was counting on IT LFT etc as an offset which gave rise to the lower rate for the pipelines NURF service Skip scratched out a more tame version of no and Ed agreed to consider it Be on the lookout for what they come up with Overall as I said Im glad I was there as well as the other pipeline representatives I hope that we were successful in getting the generators back on track here Ill be interested in seeing how much of our discussion today is

questions raised in Drews email Heres what we found out Steves question What economics would determine if a developer could site a power plant in New Mexico maybe MW and build a line to the grid in California versus us expanding to deliver the gas to a power plant in California What youre really asking here is What are the comparative economics of energy delivered by wire versus energy delivered by pipeline In this analysis there are a few considerations original capital cost to construct facilities the operating cost of the facilities including energy loss and environmental and other permitting considerations Engineers tell us that as a rule of thumb high voltage transmission lines and tower facilities cost approximately to MMmile to construct turnkey This figure is comparable to the MMmile rule of thumb we use for turnkey construction of mainline diameter highpressure steel pipeline In terms of operating costs for anything over miles in length there are three basic sources of energy loss in electric transmission transformation loss radiation loss EFM and heat loss across the conductors A rule of thumb for electric transmission loss is This number is comparable to the actual fuel used for compression on Transwesterns pipeline The most critical issue impacting construction of high voltage transmission lines is in the area of permitting There just arent many new transmission lines being approved It was suggested by more than one source that an electric transmission project on the order posited in your example could take anywhere from to years to secure authorization The issues of electromagnetic field EMF radiation around high voltage power lines along with other wildlife endangerment concerns are significant obstacles in securing permits for rightofway In short the answer is that while the economics on face appear to be comparable for construction and operation of both natural gas pipelines and electric transmission lines the protracted permitting process for electric transmission lines tips the scale considerably towards the more immediate returns available on investment in natural gas pipeline infrastructure Drews questions What are the key factors that determine where a power plant developer puts his plant For purposes of this exercise Im assuming were talking gasfired generation Developers generally describe four considerations in deciding where to site a new electric power plant Market area demand distributive andor Transmission access to market Water rights for turbine cooling Ease of permitting environmental encroachment fedstatelocal regulations affected agenciesjurisdiction Proximity to natural gas pipelinesupply infrastructure Do the transmission access and pricing rules of the various utilitiespower pools vary all that much or are Order tariffs pretty much the same all over FERC Order and require public utilities to commit to standards of conduct and to file open access tariffs affecting transmission among and between other utilities andor power pools in the various operating regions FERC ordered public utility transmission owners to provide transmission access and comparable service to competitors and to functionally separate their transmissionreliability functions from their wholesale merchant functions The rulemaking is analogous to the open access requirements under FERC Order affecting interstate natural gas pipelines Its pretty obvious from the California example this past summer that with respect to the overall operation of a deregulated power market in individual states particularly as concerns the establishment and regulation of Independent System Operators ISOs there is substantial room for improvement and possible further FERC involvement In the open access final rule Order No the Commission issues a single pro forma tariff describing the minimum terms and conditions of service to bring about this nondiscriminatory open access transmission service All public utilities that own control or operate interstate transmission facilities are required to offer service to others under the pro forma tariff They must also use the pro forma tariffs for their own wholesale energy sales and purchases Order No also provides for the full recovery of stranded coststhat is costs that were prudently incurred to serve power customers and that could go unrecovered if these customers use open access to move to another supplier How do IPPs decide what fuel supply strategy works best ie buy bundled delivered fuel from someone vs buy gas storage transport etc separately In my experience there is no one size fits all formula or strategy For example in the past weve seen Calpine take a very handson approach to supplying its IPP projects In the mid to late s during the build out of several QFs cogens Calpine bought natural gas reserves in the ground and dedicated them to the project In todays market Calpine has scavenged the gas and basis traders from Statoil and setup a natural gas desk for the purchase and transportation management of gas supplies needed for its western US power projects In other projects developerowners and their lenders are satisfied with a less active role in securing gas supplytransportation to the project In short projects look at the liquidity of the gas supply transportation market in deciding whether they can achieve project economics and secure reliable supply by taking bids or RFPs for gas supplytransportation or whether to take a more handson approach ala Calpine What is the RTO Rule and why should we care Last December the FERC issued Order No a final rule on Regional Transmission Organizations RTOs Order builds on the foundation of Orders and issued in According to FERC Chairman Jim Hoecker Order makes a persuasive case for separating control of grid operations from the influence of electricity market participants Therefore Order can be seen as a natural outgrowth of the perceived limitations on the functional unbundling adopted in Orders and continuing balkanization of the electric transmission grid based on corporate not state or regional boundaries as well as pressure to provide guidance on acceptable forms of privatelyowned transmission companies FERC prescribes a voluntary approach to RTO participation The order initiates a regional collaborative process to foster RTO formation The Order also imposes filing requirements on the privately owned public utilities that are subject to FERC jurisdiction and requires these private utilities to describe in their filings how they have attempted to accommodate the needs of transmission owning statemunicipal cooperative and federally owned systems FERC believes that regardless of format RTOs will offer the following benefits alleviate stress on the bulk power system caused by structural changes in the industry improve efficiencies in transmission grid management through better pricing and congestion management improve grid reliability remove remaining opportunities for discriminatory practices improve market performance increase coordination among state regulatory agencies cut transaction costs facilitate the success of state retail access programs and facilitate lighterhanded regulation Critics point out that with its emphasis on flexibility voluntary RTO formation and transmission rate reforms ie incentives Order defers for casespecific disposition many of the tough issues that must be resolved in order to create an operational RTO Moreover Order does not compel any transmission owner to join an RTO but provides only regulatory guidance and incentives for willing participants as well as a veiled threat of further consequences for the holdouts As to the final part of the question why should we care presumably the development of a fullyfunctioning RTO network will promote both the efficiency and market transparency goals of the original FERC orders As FERC reads it the future of gasfired generation for both merchant and utility systems depends on an efficiently operated open access transmission system Therefore the promise of the RTO is to stimulate competition and the ongoing investment in new generation infrastructure Unfortunately sources tell me that the voluntary nature of the RTO program may ultimately cripple its effectiveness in meeting its stated goals Has mmbtu gas killed the gas fired power market Natural gas prices of MMBtu can only kill gasfired power plants in those instances where there are more economical alternatives to natural gas fuel demand for electric power is offset through demand side management or natural gas in an environment of short supply is expressly prohibited from use as a power plant fuel In the Western US marketplace particularly in California I see no viable alternative to natural gas fuel for electric power generation Renewable resources currently meet less than of the total electric resource requirements barrel oil prices give fuel oil no clear economic advantage over natural gas even at a MMBtu price Moreover California environmental and permitting regulations make the installation of new electric generation based on anything other than natural gas fuel or renewable resources virtually impossible While demand side management programs are the politically correct approach to meeting resource needs historically they have served only a minor role in offsetting the growth in electric power As to the final point Im unable to comment on the risk of future legalregulatory restrictions governing the use of natural gas as a boiler or turbine fuel Steven Harris AM To Kevin HyattET nron cc Jeffery FawcettET NRON Subject Re Electric Developments

Essentially it adopts the Interim Proposal with a few modifications The CPUC states that they are taking a cautious approach to deregulation in light of recent market events in both electrici ty and gas and therefore rejected the more robust reforms outlined in the Comprehensive Settlement The CS was offered by SoCal Gas and supported by many of the settlement parties including Enron and Transwestern The good news is that with respect to Hector Road the maximum volume at Hector is limited to MMcfd similar to the proposal made by the Comprehensive Settlement Ive included the section from the PD that deals with this issue for your convenience The full document is also attached excerpt at at page regarding Hector Road Receipt Points Intrastate Transmission As we have already discussed above we now judge that intrastate transmissi on unbundling is not wise at this time for the SoCalGas system However SoCalGas intrastate transmission system can still be made more accessib le and understandable to its users In R the record reflects dissatisfaction among customers and shippers with the lack of clarity on how SoCalGas schedules gas shipments through its windowing system and SoCalGas sole use of the Hector Road interconnection as a receipt point Exh in R pp Southern California Edison Company Market Conditions Report Panel Heari ng Testimony of Mr Paul Carpenter Southern California Edison Tr pp Jan Our decision in D directed investigatio n into using the Hector Road interconnection even on an interim basis and t he publication of SoCalGas windowing criteria in tariffs SoCalGas filed Advice Letter which detailed its process of basing a maximum amount o f gas scheduled for shipment through a receipt point on the prior days nominations except at the first of the month Early in the instant proceeding the ALJ held in abeyance active consideration of the windowing procedure tariff SoCalGas filed pending the resolution we reach today Prehearing Conference of September p We are approving on an interim basis the replacement of the current windowi ng process with a system under which SoCalGas will establish receipt point capacities subject to daily revision on the basis of the physical maximum s for each receipt point under the operating conditions expected for that day Customers and shippers will know the daily maximums because they will be posted on SoCalGas GasSelect system daily prior to the nomination deadlines If in the aggregate customers nominate more than the physical capacity at any receipt point gas will be scheduled based on the upstream pipelines capacity rights system For Wheeler Ridge at which more tha n one upstream pipeline delivers gas the maximum daily physical capacity would b e allocated between upstream sources pro rata on the basis of the prior day s scheduled deliveries from each source This system eliminates the mystery in how prorations are made provides continuity in capacity rights between the interstate and intrastate systems and provides flexibility for customers in nominating at the most costeffective receipt point on any given day We recognize that it does n ot provide for longterm planning but the alternative under the CS of paidfo r firm receipt point rights for the term of the settlement has the disadvanta ge of locking customers into a receipt point that may lose value over the term In this period of gas price volatility we believe that the more flexible plan is the right one Thus we direct SoCalGas to withdraw Advice Letter and file a new advi ce letter within business days implementing the proposed receipt point physical capacity system This may be the same as the exemplary tariff fil ed with the IS or updated as necessary pursuant to subsequent proceedings Th is tariff revision will be effective within days after the filing unless rejected by the Energy Division In R PGE and Edison particularly complained about the restrictions at Wheeler Ridge Exh in R pp PGE Rebuttal to Market Conditions Report and Exh in R pp Southern California Edison Market Conditions Report One response in th e IS to these complaints is the establishment of a formal receipt point at Hector Road for all customers subject to Wheeler Ridge access fees and surcharges Its capacity will be MMcfd or greater as long as there are nominations of that volume and Mojave Pipeline Company delivers that much i n response to those nominations This provision should allow greater flexibility for shippers and customers as well as leveling the playing fiel d between SoCalGas and others at this interconnection We will support SoCalGas application to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for approval of Hector Road as a formal delivery point by Mojave El Paso Natural Gas Company objected strongly to the provision in the IS fo r automatically expanding of Wheeler Ridge capacity While this was not an option specifically mentioned in D we do not choose to stand on that technicality to exclude it from consideration here Once a proceeding is open to settlement the dynamics of settlement talks may bring in matter s outside the delineated scope as they have done here with regard to Wheeler Ridge expansion and for instance pooling Both proposals respond to concerns raised in R see citations in text above as well as Pan el Hearing Testimony of Mr Benjamin C Campbell PGE Tr pp Jan and neither was specifically excluded from further consideration in D We therefore view them as within the scope of this proceeding To the extent that other receipt points are also viewed as constrained we welcome evidence to that effect in a future proceeding as well as proposal s for criteria to determine when expansion should be applied for by MMcf d if a certain number of curtailments occurred and for automatically allowin g the expenses of that expansion to be rolled into rates We do not wish to approve automatic rate increases for all ratepayers for a facility for whic h only some may have use but we believe that developing criteria for expansi on of receipt points is useful Hector Road may not entirely alleviate the problem of constraints on northern gas flowing to the south Therefore we approve that portion of Section III of the IS that sets forth criteria for expansion but provide that upon the meeting of that criteria SoCalGas shall submit an application for an expansion of the receipt point capacity That application shall be processed in the regular way with the issues of need in the context of the entire system and foreseeable market conditions considered Moreover rolledin or incremental rates allocati on of cost among classes and consequent rate design will remain open for decision in that proceeding Thus the modification to the IS that we make is in the first sentence of t he first full paragraph on page The words apply to should be inser ted after SoCalGas will We specifically disapprove the IS language in the middle on

EPNG attempted to deliver their gas through Mojave to the sam e markets Ive attached the recent press release regarding the La Paloma project for your information PGE CORPORATION UNIT BEGINS CONSTRUCTION OF CALIFORNIAS LARGEST GREENFIELD MERCHANT POWER PLANT La Paloma Facility Will Fill a Critical Need for New Electricity Supplies i n California San Francisco Welcoming the opportunity to provide competitive electri city to meet the growing electricity needs of California PGE Corporation NYSEPCG announced today that its National Energy Group has begun construction on the La Paloma Generating Plant La Paloma is a megawa tt natural gasfueled combinedcycle facility The plant is expected to begi n operating in the summer of PGE National Energy Group President CE O Tom Boren said The construction of the La Paloma facility is an important step in meeting the growing demand for electricity in the state We welcome the opportunity to further the growth of customer choice in Californias evolving competitive power market The California Independent System Operator ISO a nonprofit public benef it corporation responsible for maintaining transmission reliability and ensuri ng adequate electricity supplies hailed La Paloma as a welcome addition As North Americas only regional transmission operator relying on competiti ve market forces to maintain the critical balance between electricity supply a nd demand for Californias million electric customers the California IS O is very pleased that PGEs National Energy Group has stepped forward with the La Paloma facility to fill an essential consumer need said Cal ISO President CEO Terry Winter This investment shows that the market is responding to the growing demand for electricity As a highly efficient plant from both an energy and environmental standpoint California consumers will benefit added PGE Corps Boren The La Paloma Generating Plant provides highly competitive costs with a minimum of energy consumption and environmental impacts The La Paloma plant site is approximately miles west of Bakersfield Calif in western Kern County on an industrial site previously used for oil production When completed it will be the states largest facility desi gned from the ground up exclusively as a merchant power plant A merchant plant sells its electrical output to wholesale customers in a regional competitiv e bulk power market Those wholesale customers which include traditional utilities municipal utility districts retail energy services companies wholesale power marketers and electric cooperatives in turn arrange to ha ve the electricity delivered to retail consumers The La Paloma development team has selected ABB ALSTOM POWER Inc as the turnkey contractor for the project ABB ALSTOM POWER is responsible for the design and engineering work the procurement of equipment and management of subcontractors and the actual construction of the facility The La Paloma Generating Project received its California Energy Commission approval in October and the financing package for the project is being completed now The rigorous permitting process really laid the ground for an outstanding construction

version of the order Susan and I spoke with Jeff Dasovich and Mark Baldwin yesterday and the consensus of those conversations was that Transwestern should remain involved in this proceeding only for purposes of implementationdocumentation Jeff offered that he might send a letter to Governor Grays office expressing both dismay and indignation that the CPUC didnt complete their task and warning of the adverse outcome to California ratepayers if these more modest reforms are approved He may ask the other Comprehensive Settlement parties to join in signing the letter Susan Mar k and I spoke about this idea later and weve got some reservations about TW s role in admonishing the CPUC We should probably wait to see this letter first before committing to anything Bilas draft cautious toward SoCal competition Mindful of the current chaos over energy markets in the state California Public Utilities Commissioner Richard Bilas has recommended the adoption of a much more moderate approach to promoting competition on Southern California Gas SoCal sy stem In his draft decision Bilas advised the commission to reject the unbundlin g of intrastate transmission and instead approve the first settlement filed in the case th e less farreaching Interim Settlement IS submitted in December SoCal San Diego Gas a nd Electric and other parties filed two more settlements after the IS reaching a comprehensive agreement in April this year But since then gas and power prices skyrocketed in the state prompting a consumer backlash and giving competition a bad name The draft language notes that the first interim settlement was supported by more customer groups than the later agreements Recent events lead us to conclude that the centerpiece of this investigation the unbundling of intrastate transmission and the implementation of a system of firm tradable intrastate transmission rights should be delayed according t o the draft order This unbundling is the basis of the comprehensive settle ment and we cannot approve it We do not however wish to commit to paralysis until as the postinterim settlement would have us do Accordingly we believe Californians are better served at this juncture by the adoption with modifications of the IS The biggest change to the IS in the draft is the rejection of an automatic capacity expansion by SoCal at Wheeler Ridge Calif with rolledin rates if certain criteria are met El Paso Energy had objected to the provision in the IS that would have allowed SoCa l to automatically expand capacity at Wheeler Ridge by million cfd if a certain number of curtailments occurred El Paso objected to forcing all shippers to pay for the expansion at Wheele r when only certain customers would benefit The draft says SoCal can file a separate application for the Wheeler Ridge expansion but approval would be conditioned on a traditional hearing proce ss The draft decision would also End SoCals current windowing process which limits shipp ers ability to change nominations for deliveries between receipt points on the system It is replaced with an announced daily calculation of capacity available at each receipt point Establish Hector Road as a formal receipt point for nominations Institute an operational flow order OFO procedure Provides a foru m for more changes in OFO procedures if excessive OFOs are made Set up pools of gas on the SoCal transmission system that ar e intended to increase the liquidity of gas trading Make changes to balancing rules while retaining the current mon thly imbalance tolerance Make SoCals own gas acquisition unit subject to the same balanci ng rules and penalties as all other shippers Allow some limited imbalances trading as well as the right to assig n and reassign unbundled storage contract in a secondary market with a SoCal electronic bulletin board set up for it Unbundle from core transportation rates the storage capacity cost ex ceeding that required for core minimum reliability and Provide for rate recovery of up to million in implementation co sts In addition the draft would unbundle core interstate transportation from rates eliminate core contribution to noncore interstate transition cost surcharges elimina te the core subscription option as well as the caps for core aggregation programs The threshold fo r participating in core aggregation is reduced and billing options are offered to core aggregators Bilas draft also warned that the commission may come back in two years to open another investigation into gas competition taking into account any changes in mark et conditions Bilas gave a little more insight into his decision in the text of the draft The cost of gas as a commodity has vastly increased at the border show ing a differential between the basin and border prices that is more than the cost of transport and related services we question whether there will be an opportunity for discounting by markete rs if more competition is allowed Bilas wrote in the draft decision With half the state already committ ed to a restructured competitive natural gas industry it suddenly seems as if the benefits of such re structuring to enhance competition are speculative particularly at this time With one leg in the water the current has switched direction and it will be difficult if not foolhardy to reach our goals by forging ahead We choose to take a cautious approach again the draft continues Rather than proceeding to unbundle transmission in Southern California now we approve with modifications the settle ment suggesting smaller steps towards a competitive market Additionally w e unbundle core interstate transmission and once again urge the Legislature to pass consume r protection legisla tion aimed at unregulated marketers while we facilitate growth in core aggregation programs The CPUC would not rule out the unbundling of intrastate transmission and other restruc turing in the future but believe that at this point in time the certain benefits do not outweigh the costs to most ratepayers All drafts must be filed days before the meetings at which they will be discussed The draft decision is currently on the agenda for the CPUCs Dec meeting

parties The purpose of the meeting was to review the status of the Caithness Big Sandy Project and to establish the next steps for moving the project forward Caithness Corporation Caithness Corp is a privately held company based in New York with a variety of business interests The company is essentially a financial vehicle for private investors Their energy segment currently owns MW of generation through renewable assets in California geothermal at Coso wind in Tehachapi and Palm Springs and a gas fired plant in South Carolina jointlyowned by Florida Power Light Big Sandy Project The Big Sandy Project is a proposed power plant to be located near Wickieup Arizona The project would be built in two phases first phase would be MW with a gas load of approx MMBtud and phase would add another MW for a total of MW with a gas load of MMBtud The proposed location of the plant is approximately miles south of Transwesterns pipeline The takeoff point on Transwestern would be atnear valve station approximately miles downstream of compressor Station The current estimate includes an alignment that follows Arizona state highway south to a location miles southeast of Wickieup in the SW of Section TN RW Mohave County Arizona There is a KV transmission line owned by WAPA that crosses the property This line is one of the principal electric transmission systems in the Southwest and extends from the Phoenix area to the Mead substation near Boulder City NV Ive included a WAPA map below which indicates this line Also on the site is a water pipeline owned by the Cyprus Amax Bagdad mine Water for the plant will come from an encapusulated water table through deep wells They have currently dug the first two test wells each capable of cfm The power plant will require approximately cfm of water In addition to the wells the plant has several thousandacre feet of water rights to surface water from the Big Sandy River The project may also purchase water from the Cyprus Bagdad water pipeline The chief geological feature of this area is the Big Sandy River and associated wash The highway roadbed follows along the river The area includes rolling hills and is principally desert terrain with some limited agricultural and ranching interests Wickieup is a very small town with an estimated population of Project Schedule Gas Turbines ordered WestinghouseSeimens May Submit Environmental Impact Statement EIS August Arrange financing December EIS approval March Construction begins April Testing begins July Commercial Operation November There are two lead agencies for purposes of the projects EIS the Bureau of Land Management BLM Kingman office and the Western Area Power Administration WAPA There is only one endangeredthreatened species known to be present in the area Lateral Pipeline Alignment The most critical path item is the alignment of the lateral pipeline The alignment lateral pipeline route must be included in the EIS to be filed next month Caithness has spoken preliminarily with the Arizona Department of Transportation ADOT and the agency is amenable to granting an easement for the pipeline The problem appears to be in the limited amount of right of way available Measured from the shoulder to the fenceline there is only a ft right of way available for construction Typically pipelines require a ft temporary construction easement and ft of permanent right of way Preliminary discussions indicate another problem with this alignment may be the roadways routing within the wash of the riverbed If the highway corridor is unsuitable for the pipeline the second alternative appears to be running the pipeline down the adjacent NS section line The problem with this approach is that as the line nears the site the routing would have to contend with the river bed and wash areas possibly necessitating deep burial and anchoring The other route would involve following along the WAPA electric transmission corridor The only issue there aside from whether WAPA would permit the pipeline encroachment is whether there are safety andor corrosion concerns associated with a high pressure gas line located under a high voltage transmission system Other Preliminary Project Issues There are other fundamental issues to address The original concept was to interconnect the proposed Transwestern lateral with El Pasos northern mainline and the yettobeconstructed Questar Southern Trails Pipeline both of which lay adjacent to Transwesterns mainline Transwesterns original estimate to construct a lateral pipeline and meter station MM was based on the following specifications MMcfd psig delivery pressure psig inlet pressure The meeting resulted in a revised set of specifications that now include a higher psig minimum delivery pressure new technology Westinghouse turbines In addition our understanding is that EPNGs system operates at a pressure psig lower than Transwesterns In order to accommodate EPNG deliveries and to account for the

<29872200.1075844083161.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,jeffery.fawcett@enron.com,2000-11-27 01:20:00,Bad Proposed Decision Cc is the CPUCs proposed decision in the Gas Industry Restructuring proceeding Essentially it adopts the Interim Proposal with a few modifications The CPUC states that they are taking a cautious approach to deregulation in light of recent market events in both electrici ty and gas and therefore rejected the more robust reforms outlined in the Comprehensive Settlement The CS was offered by SoCal Gas and supported by many of the settlement parties including Enron and Transwestern The good news is that with respect to Hector Road the maximum volume at Hector is limited to MMcfd similar to the proposal made by the Comprehensive Settlement Ive included the section from the PD that deals with this issue for your convenience The full document is also attached excerpt at at page regarding Hector Road Receipt Points Intrastate Transmission As we have already discussed above we now judge that intrastate transmissi on unbundling is not wise at this time for the SoCalGas system However SoCalGas intrastate transmission system can still be made more accessib le and understandable to its users In R the record reflects dissatisfaction among customers and shippers with the lack of clarity on how SoCalGas schedules gas shipments through its windowing system and SoCalGas sole use of the Hector Road interconnection as a receipt point Exh in R pp Southern California Edison Company Market Conditions Report Panel Heari ng Testimony of Mr Paul Carpenter Southern California Edison Tr pp Jan Our decision in D directed investigatio n into using the Hector Road interconnection even on an interim basis and t he publication of SoCalGas windowing criteria in tariffs SoCalGas filed Advice Letter which detailed its process of basing a maximum amount o f gas scheduled for shipment through a receipt point on the prior days nominations except at the first of the month Early in the instant proceeding the ALJ held in abeyance active consideration of the windowing procedure tariff SoCalGas filed pending the resolution we reach today Prehearing Conference of September p We are approving on an interim basis the replacement of the current windowi ng process with a system under which SoCalGas will establish receipt point capacities subject to daily revision on the basis of the physical maximum s for each receipt point under the operating conditions expected for that day Customers and shippers will know the daily maximums because they will be posted on SoCalGas GasSelect system daily prior to the nomination deadlines If in the aggregate customers nominate more than the physical capacity at any receipt point gas will be scheduled based on the upstream pipelines capacity rights system For Wheeler Ridge at which more tha n one upstream pipeline delivers gas the maximum daily physical capacity would b e allocated between upstream sources pro rata on the basis of the prior day s scheduled deliveries from each source This system eliminates the mystery in how prorations are made provides continuity in capacity rights between the interstate and intrastate systems and provides flexibility for customers in nominating at the most costeffective receipt point on any given day We recognize that it does n ot provide for longterm planning but the alternative under the CS of paidfo r firm receipt point rights for the term of the settlement has the disadvanta ge of locking customers into a receipt point that may lose value over the term In this period of gas price volatility we believe that the more flexible plan is the right one Thus we direct SoCalGas to withdraw Advice Letter and file a new advi ce letter within business days implementing the proposed receipt point physical capacity system This may be the same as the exemplary tariff fil ed with the IS or updated as necessary pursuant to subsequent proceedings Th is tariff revision will be effective within days after the filing unless rejected by the Energy Division In R PGE and Edison particularly complained about the restrictions at Wheeler Ridge Exh in R pp PGE Rebuttal to Market Conditions Report and Exh in R pp Southern California Edison Market Conditions Report One response in th e IS to these complaints is the establishment of a formal receipt point at Hector Road for all customers subject to Wheeler Ridge access fees and surcharges Its capacity will be MMcfd or greater as long as there are nominations of that volume and Mojave Pipeline Company delivers that much i n response to those nominations This provision should allow greater flexibility for shippers and customers as well as leveling the playing fiel d between SoCalGas and others at this interconnection We will support SoCalGas application to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for approval of Hector Road as a formal delivery point by Mojave El Paso Natural Gas Company objected strongly to the provision in the IS fo r automatically expanding of Wheeler Ridge capacity While this was not an option specifically mentioned in D we do not choose to stand on that technicality to exclude it from consideration here Once a proceeding is open to settlement the dynamics of settlement talks may bring in matter s outside the delineated scope as they have done here with regard to Wheeler Ridge expansion and for instance pooling Both proposals respond to concerns raised in R see citations in text above as well as Pan el Hearing Testimony of Mr Benjamin C Campbell PGE Tr pp Jan and neither was specifically excluded from further consideration in D We therefore view them as within the scope of this proceeding To the extent that other receipt points are also viewed as constrained we welcome evidence to that effect in a future proceeding as well as proposal s for criteria to determine when expansion should be applied for by MMcf d if a certain number of curtailments occurred and for automatically allowin g the expenses of that expansion to be rolled into rates We do not wish to approve automatic rate increases for all ratepayers for a facility for whic h only some may have use but we believe that developing criteria for expansi on of receipt points is useful Hector Road may not entirely alleviate the problem of constraints on northern gas flowing to the south Therefore we approve that portion of Section III of the IS that sets forth criteria for expansion but provide that upon the meeting of that criteria SoCalGas shall submit an application for an expansion of the receipt point capacity That application shall be processed in the regular way with the issues of need in the context of the entire system and foreseeable market conditions considered Moreover rolledin or incremental rates allocati on of cost among classes and consequent rate design will remain open for decision in that proceeding Thus the modification to the IS that we make is in the first sentence of t he first full paragraph on page The words apply to should be inser ted after SoCalGas will We specifically disapprove the IS language in the middle on

T he very good news though is that TWs proposal was included in both settlements now thats hedging Thus the benefits to TW were preserve d under both proposals Congratulations Thats fantastichard work that paid off We will of course express out extreme dissappointment with the PD and poin t out that this decision condemns California to a th century infrastructure when the states st century economy demands much much better We should discuss Since the PD empowers the likes of Norm and Florio it will be important to play very close attention to implementation of Hector Sorry to have to be the one

of the order Susan and I spoke with Jeff Dasovich and Mark Baldwin yesterday and the consensus of those conversations was that Transwestern should remain involved in this proceeding only for purposes of implementationdocumentation Jeff offered that he might send a letter to Governor Grays office expressing both dismay and indignation that the CPUC didnt complete their task and warning of the adverse outcome to California ratepayers if these more modest reforms are approved He may ask the other Comprehensive Settlement parties to join in signing the letter Susan Mar k and I spoke about this idea later and weve got some reservations about TW s role in admonishing the CPUC We should probably wait to see this letter first before committing to anything Bilas draft cautious toward SoCal competition Mindful of the current chaos over energy markets in the state California Public Utilities Commissioner Richard Bilas has recommended the adoption of a much more moderate approach to promoting competition on Southern California Gas SoCal sy stem In his draft decision Bilas advised the commission to reject the unbundlin g of intrastate transmission and instead approve the first settlement filed in the case th e less farreaching Interim Settlement IS submitted in December SoCal San Diego Gas a nd Electric and other parties filed two more settlements after the IS reaching a comprehensive agreement in April this year But since then gas and power prices skyrocketed in the state prompting a consumer backlash and giving competition a bad name The draft language notes that the first interim settlement was supported by more customer groups than the later agreements Recent events lead us to conclude that the centerpiece of this investigation the unbundling of intrastate transmission and the implementation of a system of firm tradable intrastate transmission rights should be delayed according t o the draft order This unbundling is the basis of the comprehensive settle ment and we cannot approve it We do not however wish to commit to paralysis until as the postinterim settlement would have us do Accordingly we believe Californians are better served at this juncture by the adoption with modifications of the IS The biggest change to the IS in the draft is the rejection of an automatic capacity expansion by SoCal at Wheeler Ridge Calif with rolledin rates if certain criteria are met El Paso Energy had objected to the provision in the IS that would have allowed SoCa l to automatically expand capacity at Wheeler Ridge by million cfd if a certain number of curtailments occurred El Paso objected to forcing all shippers to pay for the expansion at Wheele r when only certain customers would benefit The draft says SoCal can file a separate application for the Wheeler Ridge expansion but approval would be conditioned on a traditional hearing proce ss The draft decision would also End SoCals current windowing process which limits shipp ers ability to change nominations for deliveries between receipt points on the system It is replaced with an announced daily calculation of capacity available at each receipt point Establish Hector Road as a formal receipt point for nominations Institute an operational flow order OFO procedure Provides a foru m for more changes in OFO procedures if excessive OFOs are made Set up pools of gas on the SoCal transmission system that ar e intended to increase the liquidity of gas trading Make changes to balancing rules while retaining the current mon thly imbalance tolerance Make SoCals own gas acquisition unit subject to the same balanci ng rules and penalties as all other shippers Allow some limited imbalances trading as well as the right to assig n and reassign unbundled storage contract in a secondary market with a SoCal electronic bulletin board set up for it Unbundle from core transportation rates the storage capacity cost ex ceeding that required for core minimum reliability and Provide for rate recovery of up to million in implementation co sts In addition the draft would unbundle core interstate transportation from rates eliminate core contribution to noncore interstate transition cost surcharges elimina te the core subscription option as well as the caps for core aggregation programs The threshold fo r participating in core aggregation is reduced and billing options are offered to core aggregators Bilas draft also warned that the commission may come back in two years to open another investigation into gas competition taking into account any changes in mark et conditions Bilas gave a little more insight into his decision in the text of the draft The cost of gas as a commodity has vastly increased at the border show ing a differential between the basin and border prices that is more than the cost of transport and related services we question whether there will be an opportunity for discounting by markete rs if more competition is allowed Bilas wrote in the draft decision With half the state already committ ed to a restructured competitive natural gas industry it suddenly seems as if the benefits of such re structuring to enhance competition are speculative particularly at this time With one leg in the water the current has switched direction and it will be difficult if not foolhardy to reach our goals by forging ahead We choose to take a cautious approach again the draft continues Rather than proceeding to unbundle transmission in Southern California now we approve with modifications the settle ment suggesting smaller steps towards a competitive market Additionally w e unbundle core interstate transmission and once again urge the Legislature to pass consume r protection legisla tion aimed at unregulated marketers while we facilitate growth in core aggregation programs The CPUC would not rule out the unbundling of intrastate transmission and other restruc turing in the future but believe that at this point in time the certain benefits do not outweigh the costs to most ratepayers All drafts must be filed days before the meetings at which they will be discussed The draft decision is currently on the agenda for the CPUCs Dec meeting

session There were only nine of us involved with Ed Ross Skip Simmons and Craig Chancellor representing the generators while Byron White Georgia Carter and myself were there to represent the pipelines The others were with the Alliance Ed was his usual self He was confidently making the good economic case why the pipelines should consider the generators position and howwhy the FERC would likely side with them Craig tried to frame it commercially and Skip played peacemaker Byron and I played a little good copbad cop on behalf of the pipes with Byron being the bad cop Anyway sum and substance I think well be more pleased with the next draft of this document than what was submitted to us recently The first sentence was replaced with a more sweeping statement of intent and mission of the parties that focused on the provisioning of the service being subject to physical operating considerations There emerged a realization that maybe two products are being contemplated here a product that blocks out a period of time for uniform deliveries say hours and a product that basically provides the generator an option on when to take the agreed upon block of capacity It was agreed that the first product is likely to be less valuable than the second and priced accordingly Byron and I argued that segmenting hourly rights should not be mandated and in fact may be physically impossible along some locations of the pipeline The generators originally intended segmenting as possibly relating to how the NURF rights were carved up by hour ex an hr block of d could be repackaged as two hr blocks of d Im not sure whether we got consensus there or not well have to see the next draft The big ticket items nos got the most press I was troubled by the generators interpretation of both In the case of no the generators wanted to predesignate a mechanism whereby an existing customer holding a firm service whether FT NNS or storage could pursuant to the conversion formula remarket their original firm service as NURF The generators were looking at this provision as throwing a bone to existing customers who might want to compete with the pipeline for NURF service using capacity ex seasonal that may not be fully utilized Obviously the predetermined conversion factor was a huge problem for the pipelines as well as the whole notion of trying to fit a round peg into a square hole ie two or more different product types We pointed out the services were all different and in fact any combination of those services conceivably could be repackaged under todays rules and sold as a proxy for NURF I believe we were successful in taming that language down substantially However be on the lookout for the next draft Finally with respect to no where the generators want receipts considered rateable with deliveries for purposes of NURF the generators had an intersting slant Essentially Ed was saying that he didnt want the pipelines to hold the generators hostage on rates for NURF if the pipelines were the only ones who could offer NURF By requiring the pipelines to consider rateable receipts as meeting the NURF criteria then Ed said the generators would receive the benefits of a competitive marketplace for NURFlike service Skip pointed out that taking gas out of storage at Westar in West Texas and using it as an hour by hour offset for deliveries to a power plant located at the California border was probably unworkable However he also posed the hypothet that if SoCalGas were to provide the same storage service at the California border and those deliveries into SoCalGas could be adjusted to take into account the deliveries to the power plant a sort of diversion of gas theory then the pipeline should be operationally indifferent to whether it was providing NURF service or a rd party was providing a NURFlike service They just want others to have the ability to compete with the pipeline Of course the pipeline argued that operationally those products may not be the same Moreover accepting such a nomination from SoCalGas could conceivably knock off other uses of the capacity the pipeline was counting on IT LFT etc as an offset which gave rise to the lower rate for the pipelines NURF service Skip scratched out a more tame version of no and Ed agreed to consider it Be on the lookout for what they come up with Overall as I said Im glad I was there as well as the other pipeline representatives I hope that we were successful in getting the generators back on track here Ill be interested in seeing how much of our discussion today is

drafting session There were only nine of us involved with Ed Ross Skip Simmons and Craig C hancellor representing the generators while Byron White Georgia Carter an d myself were there to represent the pipelines The others were with the A lliance Ed was his usual self He was confidently making the good econom ic case why the pipelines should consider the generators position and how why the FERC would likely side with them Craig tried to frame it commerci ally and Skip played peacemaker Byron and I played a little good copba d cop on behalf of the pipes with Byron being the bad cop Anyway sum and substance I think well be more pleased with the next draf t of this document than what was submitted to us recently The first sent ence was replaced with a more sweeping statement of intent and mission of t he parties that focused on the provisioning of the service being subject to physical operating considerations There emerged a realization that maybe two products are being contemplated here a product that blocks out a period of time for uniform deliveries say hours and a product th at basically provides the generator an option on when to take the agreed up on block of capacity It was agreed that the first product is likely to be less valuable than the second and priced accordingly Byron and I argued that segmenting hourly rights should not be mandated and in fact may be physically impossible along some locations of the pipeline The generators originally intended segmenting as possibly relating to how the NURF rights were carved up by hour ex an hr block of d could be repackaged as two hr blocks of d Im not sure whether we got consensus th ere or not well have to see the next draft The big ticket items nos got the most press I was troubled by the generators interpretation of both In the case of no the generators wanted to predesignate a mechanism whereby an existing customer holding a f irm service whether FT NNS or storage could pursuant to the conversion formula remarket their original firm service as NURF The generators were looking at this provision as throwing a bone to existing customers who m ight want to compete with the pipeline for NURF service using capacity ex seasonal that may not be fully utilized Obviously the predetermined co nversion factor was a huge problem for the pipelines as well as the whole notion of trying to fit a round peg into a square hole ie two or more dif ferent product types We pointed out the services were all different and in fact any combination of those services conceivably could be repackag ed under todays rules and sold as a proxy for NURF I believe we were suc cessful in taming that language down substantially However be on the loo kout for the next draft Finally with respect to no where the generators want receipts consider ed rateable with deliveries for purposes of NURF the generators had an int ersting slant Essentially Ed was saying that he didnt want the pipeline s to hold the generators hostage on rates for NURF if the pipelines were th e only ones who could offer NURF By requiring the pipelines to consider r ateable receipts as meeting the NURF criteria then Ed said the generators would receive the benefits of a competitive marketplace for NURFlike ser vice Skip pointed out that taking gas out of storage at Westar in West Te xas and using it as an hour by hour offset for deliveries to a power plant located at the California border was probably unworkable However he also posed the hypothet that if SoCalGas were to provide the same storage servi ce at the California border and those deliveries into SoCalGas could be adj usted to take into account the deliveries to the power plant a sort of div ersion of gas theory then the pipeline should be operationally indifferen t to whether it was providing NURF service or a rd party was providing a N URFlike service They just want others to have the ability to compete wit h the pipeline Of course the pipeline argued that operationally those products may not be the same Moreover accepting such a nomination from SoCalGas could conce ivably knock off other uses of the capacity the pipeline was counting on I T LFT etc as an offset which gave rise to the lower rate for the pipeli nes NURF service Skip scratched out a more tame version of no and Ed agreed to consider it Be on the lookout for what they come up with Overall as I said Im glad I was there as well as the other pipeline rep resentatives I hope that we were successful in getting the generators bac k on track here Ill be interested in seeing how much of our discussion t oday is embodied in the next generator draft I told the group they were in trouble on Thursday as we were sending in th e A team Good luck and call if you have any questions

questions raised in Drews email Heres what we found out Steves question What economics would determine if a developer could site a power plant in New Mexico maybe MW and build a line to the grid in California versus us expanding to deliver the gas to a power plant in California What youre really asking here is What are the comparative economics of energy delivered by wire versus energy delivered by pipeline In this analysis there are a few considerations original capital cost to construct facilities the operating cost of the facilities including energy loss and environmental and other permitting considerations Engineers tell us that as a rule of thumb high voltage transmission lines and tower facilities cost approximately to MMmile to construct turnkey This figure is comparable to the MMmile rule of thumb we use for turnkey construction of mainline diameter highpressure steel pipeline In terms of operating costs for anything over miles in length there are three basic sources of energy loss in electric transmission transformation loss radiation loss EFM and heat loss across the conductors A rule of thumb for electric transmission loss is This number is comparable to the actual fuel used for compression on Transwesterns pipeline The most critical issue impacting construction of high voltage transmission lines is in the area of permitting There just arent many new transmission lines being approved It was suggested by more than one source that an electric transmission project on the order posited in your example could take anywhere from to years to secure authorization The issues of electromagnetic field EMF radiation around high voltage power lines along with other wildlife endangerment concerns are significant obstacles in securing permits for rightofway In short the answer is that while the economics on face appear to be comparable for construction and operation of both natural gas pipelines and electric transmission lines the protracted permitting process for electric transmission lines tips the scale considerably towards the more immediate returns available on investment in natural gas pipeline infrastructure Drews questions What are the key factors that determine where a power plant developer puts his plant For purposes of this exercise Im assuming were talking gasfired generation Developers generally describe four considerations in deciding where to site a new electric power plant Market area demand distributive andor Transmission access to market Water rights for turbine cooling Ease of permitting environmental encroachment fedstatelocal regulations affected agenciesjurisdiction Proximity to natural gas pipelinesupply infrastructure Do the transmission access and pricing rules of the various utilitiespower pools vary all that much or are Order tariffs pretty much the same all over FERC Order and require public utilities to commit to standards of conduct and to file open access tariffs affecting transmission among and between other utilities andor power pools in the various operating regions FERC ordered public utility transmission owners to provide transmission access and comparable service to competitors and to functionally separate their transmissionreliability functions from their wholesale merchant functions The rulemaking is analogous to the open access requirements under FERC Order affecting interstate natural gas pipelines Its pretty obvious from the California example this past summer that with respect to the overall operation of a deregulated power market in individual states particularly as concerns the establishment and regulation of Independent System Operators ISOs there is substantial room for improvement and possible further FERC involvement In the open access final rule Order No the Commission issues a single pro forma tariff describing the minimum terms and conditions of service to bring about this nondiscriminatory open access transmission service All public utilities that own control or operate interstate transmission facilities are required to offer service to others under the pro forma tariff They must also use the pro forma tariffs for their own wholesale energy sales and purchases Order No also provides for the full recovery of stranded coststhat is costs that were prudently incurred to serve power customers and that could go unrecovered if these customers use open access to move to another supplier How do IPPs decide what fuel supply strategy works best ie buy bundled delivered fuel from someone vs buy gas storage transport etc separately In my experience there is no one size fits all formula or strategy For example in the past weve seen Calpine take a very handson approach to supplying its IPP projects In the mid to late s during the build out of several QFs cogens Calpine bought natural gas reserves in the ground and dedicated them to the project In todays market Calpine has scavenged the gas and basis traders from Statoil and setup a natural gas desk for the purchase and transportation management of gas supplies needed for its western US power projects In other projects developerowners and their lenders are satisfied with a less active role in securing gas supplytransportation to the project In short projects look at the liquidity of the gas supply transportation market in deciding whether they can achieve project economics and secure reliable supply by taking bids or RFPs for gas supplytransportation or whether to take a more handson approach ala Calpine What is the RTO Rule and why should we care Last December the FERC issued Order No a final rule on Regional Transmission Organizations RTOs Order builds on the foundation of Orders and issued in According to FERC Chairman Jim Hoecker Order makes a persuasive case for separating control of grid operations from the influence of electricity market participants Therefore Order can be seen as a natural outgrowth of the perceived limitations on the functional unbundling adopted in Orders and continuing balkanization of the electric transmission grid based on corporate not state or regional boundaries as well as pressure to provide guidance on acceptable forms of privatelyowned transmission companies FERC prescribes a voluntary approach to RTO participation The order initiates a regional collaborative process to foster RTO formation The Order also imposes filing requirements on the privately owned public utilities that are subject to FERC jurisdiction and requires these private utilities to describe in their filings how they have attempted to accommodate the needs of transmission owning statemunicipal cooperative and federally owned systems FERC believes that regardless of format RTOs will offer the following benefits alleviate stress on the bulk power system caused by structural changes in the industry improve efficiencies in transmission grid management through better pricing and congestion management improve grid reliability remove remaining opportunities for discriminatory practices improve market performance increase coordination among state regulatory agencies cut transaction costs facilitate the success of state retail access programs and facilitate lighterhanded regulation Critics point out that with its emphasis on flexibility voluntary RTO formation and transmission rate reforms ie incentives Order defers for casespecific disposition many of the tough issues that must be resolved in order to create an operational RTO Moreover Order does not compel any transmission owner to join an RTO but provides only regulatory guidance and incentives for willing participants as well as a veiled threat of further consequences for the holdouts As to the final part of the question why should we care presumably the development of a fullyfunctioning RTO network will promote both the efficiency and market transparency goals of the original FERC orders As FERC reads it the future of gasfired generation for both merchant and utility systems depends on an efficiently operated open access transmission system Therefore the promise of the RTO is to stimulate competition and the ongoing investment in new generation infrastructure Unfortunately sources tell me that the voluntary nature of the RTO program may ultimately cripple its effectiveness in meeting its stated goals Has mmbtu gas killed the gas fired power market Natural gas prices of MMBtu can only kill gasfired power plants in those instances where there are more economical alternatives to natural gas fuel demand for electric power is offset through demand side management or natural gas in an environment of short supply is expressly prohibited from use as a power plant fuel In the Western US marketplace particularly in California I see no viable alternative to natural gas fuel for electric power generation Renewable resources currently meet less than of the total electric resource requirements barrel oil prices give fuel oil no clear economic advantage over natural gas even at a MMBtu price Moreover California environmental and permitting regulations make the installation of new electric generation based on anything other than natural gas fuel or renewable resources virtually impossible While demand side management programs are the politically correct approach to meeting resource needs historically they have served only a minor role in offsetting the growth in electric power As to the final point Im unable to comment on the risk of future legalregulatory restrictions governing the use of natural gas as a boiler or turbine fuel Steven Harris AM To Kevin HyattET nron cc Jeffery FawcettET NRON Subject Re Electric Developments

Essentially it adopts the Interim Proposal with a few modifications The CPUC states that they are taking a cautious approach to deregulation in light of recent market events in both electrici ty and gas and therefore rejected the more robust reforms outlined in the Comprehensive Settlement The CS was offered by SoCal Gas and supported by many of the settlement parties including Enron and Transwestern The good news is that with respect to Hector Road the maximum volume at Hector is limited to MMcfd similar to the proposal made by the Comprehensive Settlement Ive included the section from the PD that deals with this issue for your convenience The full document is also attached excerpt at at page regarding Hector Road Receipt Points Intrastate Transmission As we have already discussed above we now judge that intrastate transmissi on unbundling is not wise at this time for the SoCalGas system However SoCalGas intrastate transmission system can still be made more accessib le and understandable to its users In R the record reflects dissatisfaction among customers and shippers with the lack of clarity on how SoCalGas schedules gas shipments through its windowing system and SoCalGas sole use of the Hector Road interconnection as a receipt point Exh in R pp Southern California Edison Company Market Conditions Report Panel Heari ng Testimony of Mr Paul Carpenter Southern California Edison Tr pp Jan Our decision in D directed investigatio n into using the Hector Road interconnection even on an interim basis and t he publication of SoCalGas windowing criteria in tariffs SoCalGas filed Advice Letter which detailed its process of basing a maximum amount o f gas scheduled for shipment through a receipt point on the prior days nominations except at the first of the month Early in the instant proceeding the ALJ held in abeyance active consideration of the windowing procedure tariff SoCalGas filed pending the resolution we reach today Prehearing Conference of September p We are approving on an interim basis the replacement of the current windowi ng process with a system under which SoCalGas will establish receipt point capacities subject to daily revision on the basis of the physical maximum s for each receipt point under the operating conditions expected for that day Customers and shippers will know the daily maximums because they will be posted on SoCalGas GasSelect system daily prior to the nomination deadlines If in the aggregate customers nominate more than the physical capacity at any receipt point gas will be scheduled based on the upstream pipelines capacity rights system For Wheeler Ridge at which more tha n one upstream pipeline delivers gas the maximum daily physical capacity would b e allocated between upstream sources pro rata on the basis of the prior day s scheduled deliveries from each source This system eliminates the mystery in how prorations are made provides continuity in capacity rights between the interstate and intrastate systems and provides flexibility for customers in nominating at the most costeffective receipt point on any given day We recognize that it does n ot provide for longterm planning but the alternative under the CS of paidfo r firm receipt point rights for the term of the settlement has the disadvanta ge of locking customers into a receipt point that may lose value over the term In this period of gas price volatility we believe that the more flexible plan is the right one Thus we direct SoCalGas to withdraw Advice Letter and file a new advi ce letter within business days implementing the proposed receipt point physical capacity system This may be the same as the exemplary tariff fil ed with the IS or updated as necessary pursuant to subsequent proceedings Th is tariff revision will be effective within days after the filing unless rejected by the Energy Division In R PGE and Edison particularly complained about the restrictions at Wheeler Ridge Exh in R pp PGE Rebuttal to Market Conditions Report and Exh in R pp Southern California Edison Market Conditions Report One response in th e IS to these complaints is the establishment of a formal receipt point at Hector Road for all customers subject to Wheeler Ridge access fees and surcharges Its capacity will be MMcfd or greater as long as there are nominations of that volume and Mojave Pipeline Company delivers that much i n response to those nominations This provision should allow greater flexibility for shippers and customers as well as leveling the playing fiel d between SoCalGas and others at this interconnection We will support SoCalGas application to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for approval of Hector Road as a formal delivery point by Mojave El Paso Natural Gas Company objected strongly to the provision in the IS fo r automatically expanding of Wheeler Ridge capacity While this was not an option specifically mentioned in D we do not choose to stand on that technicality to exclude it from consideration here Once a proceeding is open to settlement the dynamics of settlement talks may bring in matter s outside the delineated scope as they have done here with regard to Wheeler Ridge expansion and for instance pooling Both proposals respond to concerns raised in R see citations in text above as well as Pan el Hearing Testimony of Mr Benjamin C Campbell PGE Tr pp Jan and neither was specifically excluded from further consideration in D We therefore view them as within the scope of this proceeding To the extent that other receipt points are also viewed as constrained we welcome evidence to that effect in a future proceeding as well as proposal s for criteria to determine when expansion should be applied for by MMcf d if a certain number of curtailments occurred and for automatically allowin g the expenses of that expansion to be rolled into rates We do not wish to approve automatic rate increases for all ratepayers for a facility for whic h only some may have use but we believe that developing criteria for expansi on of receipt points is useful Hector Road may not entirely alleviate the problem of constraints on northern gas flowing to the south Therefore we approve that portion of Section III of the IS that sets forth criteria for expansion but provide that upon the meeting of that criteria SoCalGas shall submit an application for an expansion of the receipt point capacity That application shall be processed in the regular way with the issues of need in the context of the entire system and foreseeable market conditions considered Moreover rolledin or incremental rates allocati on of cost among classes and consequent rate design will remain open for decision in that proceeding Thus the modification to the IS that we make is in the first sentence of t he first full paragraph on page The words apply to should be inser ted after SoCalGas will We specifically disapprove the IS language in the middle on page beginning with the words This Settlement through t he end of the paragraph and the concomitant language in Appendix A setting the co st at million in dollars Forwarded by Jeffery FawcettETSEnron

adequate electricity supplies hailed La Paloma as a welcome addition As North Americas only regional transmission operator relying on competiti ve market forces to maintain the critical balance between electricity supply a nd demand for Californias million electric customers the California IS O is very pleased that PGEs National Energy Group has stepped forward with the La Paloma facility to fill an essential consumer need said Cal ISO President CEO Terry Winter This investment shows that the market is responding to the growing demand for electricity As a highly efficient plant from both an energy and environmental standpoint California consumers will benefit added PGE Corps Boren The La Paloma Generating Plant provides highly competitive costs with a minimum of energy consumption and environmental impacts The La Paloma plant site is approximately miles west of Bakersfield Calif in western Kern County on an industrial site previously used for oil production When completed it will be the states largest facility desi gned from the ground up exclusively as a merchant power plant A merchant plant sells its electrical output to wholesale customers in a regional competitiv e bulk

version of the order Susan and I spoke with Jeff Dasovich and Mark Baldwin yesterday and the consensus of those conversations was that Transwestern should remain involved in this proceeding only for purposes of implementationdocumentation Jeff offered that he might send a letter to Governor Grays office expressing both dismay and indignation that the CPUC didnt complete their task and warning of the adverse outcome to California ratepayers if these more modest reforms are approved He may ask the other Comprehensive Settlement parties to join in signing the letter Susan Mar k and I spoke about this idea later and weve got some reservations about TW s role in admonishing the CPUC We should probably wait to see this letter first before committing to anything Bilas draft cautious toward SoCal competition Mindful of the current chaos over energy markets in the state California Public Utilities Commissioner Richard Bilas has recommended the adoption of a much more moderate approach to promoting competition on Southern California Gas SoCal sy stem In his draft decision Bilas advised the commission to reject the unbundlin g of intrastate transmission and instead approve the first settlement filed in the case th e less farreaching Interim Settlement IS submitted in December SoCal San Diego Gas a nd Electric and other parties filed two more settlements after the IS reaching a comprehensive agreement in April this year But since then gas and power prices skyrocketed in the state prompting a consumer backlash and giving competition a bad name The draft language notes that the first interim settlement was supported by more customer groups than the later agreements Recent events lead us to conclude that the centerpiece of this investigation the unbundling of intrastate transmission and the implementation of a system of firm tradable intrastate transmission rights should be delayed according t o the draft order This unbundling is the basis of the comprehensive settle ment and we cannot approve it We do not however wish to commit to paralysis until as the postinterim settlement would have us do Accordingly we believe Californians are better served at this juncture by the adoption with modifications of the IS The biggest change to the IS in the draft is the rejection of an automatic capacity expansion by SoCal at Wheeler Ridge Calif with rolledin rates if certain criteria are met El Paso Energy had objected to the provision in the IS that would have allowed SoCa l to automatically expand capacity at Wheeler Ridge by million cfd if a certain number of curtailments occurred El Paso objected to forcing all shippers to pay for the expansion at Wheele r when only certain customers would benefit The draft says SoCal can file a separate application for the Wheeler Ridge expansion but approval would be conditioned on a traditional hearing proce ss The draft decision would also End SoCals current windowing process which limits shipp ers ability to change nominations for deliveries between receipt points on the system It is replaced with an announced daily calculation of capacity available at each receipt point Establish Hector Road as a formal receipt point for nominations Institute an operational flow order OFO procedure Provides a foru m for more changes in OFO procedures if excessive OFOs are made Set up pools of gas on the SoCal transmission system that ar e intended to increase the liquidity of gas trading Make changes to balancing rules while retaining the current mon thly imbalance tolerance Make SoCals own gas acquisition unit subject to the same balanci ng rules and penalties as all other shippers Allow some limited imbalances trading as well as the right to assig n and reassign unbundled storage contract in a secondary market with a SoCal electronic bulletin board set up for it Unbundle from core transportation rates the storage capacity cost ex ceeding that required for core minimum reliability and Provide for rate recovery of up to million in implementation co sts In addition the draft would unbundle core interstate transportation from rates eliminate core contribution to noncore interstate transition cost surcharges elimina te the core subscription option as well as the caps for core aggregation programs The threshold fo r participating in core aggregation is reduced and billing options are offered to core aggregators Bilas draft also warned that the commission may come back in two years to open another investigation into gas competition taking into account any changes in mark et conditions Bilas gave a little more insight into his decision in the text of the draft The cost of gas as a commodity has vastly increased at the border show ing a differential between the basin and border prices that is more than the cost of transport and related services we question whether there will be an opportunity for discounting by markete rs if more competition is allowed Bilas wrote in the draft decision With half the state already committ ed to a restructured competitive natural gas industry it suddenly seems as if the benefits of such re structuring to enhance competition are speculative particularly at this time With one leg in the water the current has switched direction and it will be difficult if not foolhardy to reach our goals by forging ahead We choose to take a cautious approach again the draft continues Rather than proceeding to unbundle transmission in Southern California now we approve with modifications the settle ment suggesting smaller steps towards a competitive market Additionally w e unbundle core interstate transmission and once again urge the Legislature to pass consume r protection legisla tion aimed at unregulated marketers while we facilitate growth in core aggregation programs The CPUC would not rule out the unbundling of intrastate transmission and other restruc turing in the future but believe that at this point in time the certain benefits do not outweigh the costs to most ratepayers All drafts must be filed days before the meetings at which they will be discussed The draft decision is currently on the agenda for the CPUCs Dec meeting

parties The purpose of the meeting was to review the status of the Caithness Big Sandy Project and to establish the next steps for moving the project forward Caithness Corporation Caithness Corp is a privately held company based in New York with a variety of business interests The company is essentially a financial vehicle for private investors Their energy segment currently owns MW of generation through renewable assets in California geothermal at Coso wind in Tehachapi and Palm Springs and a gas fired plant in South Carolina jointlyowned by Florida Power Light Big Sandy Project The Big Sandy Project is a proposed power plant to be located near Wickieup Arizona The project would be built in two phases first phase would be MW with a gas load of approx MMBtud and phase would add another MW for a total of MW with a gas load of MMBtud The proposed location of the plant is approximately miles south of Transwesterns pipeline The takeoff point on Transwestern would be atnear valve station approximately miles downstream of compressor Station The current estimate includes an alignment that follows Arizona state highway south to a location miles southeast of Wickieup in the SW of Section TN RW Mohave County Arizona There is a KV transmission line owned by WAPA that crosses the property This line is one of the principal electric transmission systems in the Southwest and extends from the Phoenix area to the Mead substation near Boulder City NV Ive included a WAPA map below which indicates this line Also on the site is a water pipeline owned by the Cyprus Amax Bagdad mine Water for the plant will come from an encapusulated water table through deep wells They have currently dug the first two test wells each capable of cfm The power plant will require approximately cfm of water In addition to the wells the plant has several thousandacre feet of water rights to surface water from the Big Sandy River The project may also purchase water from the Cyprus Bagdad water pipeline The chief geological feature of this area is the Big Sandy River and associated wash The highway roadbed follows along the river The area includes rolling hills and is principally desert terrain with some limited agricultural and ranching interests Wickieup is a very small town with an estimated population of Project Schedule Gas Turbines ordered WestinghouseSeimens May Submit Environmental Impact Statement EIS August Arrange financing December EIS approval March Construction begins April Testing begins July Commercial Operation November There are two lead agencies for purposes of the projects EIS the Bureau of Land Management BLM Kingman office and the Western Area Power Administration WAPA There is only one endangeredthreatened species known to be present in the area Lateral Pipeline Alignment The most critical path item is the alignment of the lateral pipeline The alignment lateral pipeline route must be included in the EIS to be filed next month Caithness has spoken preliminarily with the Arizona Department of Transportation ADOT and the agency is amenable to granting an easement for the pipeline The problem appears to be in the limited amount of right of way available Measured from the shoulder to the fenceline there is only a ft right of way available for construction Typically pipelines require a ft temporary construction easement and ft of permanent right of way Preliminary discussions indicate another problem with this alignment may be the roadways routing within the wash of the riverbed If the highway corridor is unsuitable for the pipeline the second alternative appears to be running the pipeline down the adjacent NS section line The problem with this approach is that as the line nears the site the routing would have to contend with the river bed and wash areas possibly necessitating deep burial and anchoring The other route would involve following along the WAPA electric transmission corridor The only issue there aside from whether WAPA would permit the pipeline encroachment is whether there are safety andor corrosion concerns associated with a high pressure gas line located under a high voltage transmission system Other Preliminary Project Issues There are other fundamental issues to address The original concept was to interconnect the proposed Transwestern lateral with El Pasos northern mainline and the yettobeconstructed Questar Southern Trails Pipeline both of which lay adjacent to Transwesterns mainline Transwesterns original estimate to construct a lateral pipeline and meter station MM was based on the following specifications MMcfd psig delivery pressure psig inlet pressure The meeting resulted in a revised set of specifications that now include a higher psig minimum delivery pressure new technology Westinghouse turbines In addition our understanding is that EPNGs system operates at a pressure psig lower than Transwesterns In order to accommodate EPNG deliveries and to account for the new higher minimum pressure the design will likely change to a pipeline Next Steps responsible partydepartment Task Date Due PartyDept Pipeline Alignment Estimate to plot lateral pipeline route

comprehensive agreement in April this year But since then gas and power prices skyrocketed in the state prompting a consumer backlash and giving competition a bad name The draft language notes that the first interim settlement was supported by more customer groups than the later agreements Recent events lead us to conclude that the centerpiece of this investigation the unbundling of intrastate

ment and we cannot approve it We do not however wish to commit to paralysis until as the postinterim settlement would have us do Accordingly we believe Californians are better served at this juncture by the adoption with modifications of the IS The biggest change to the IS in the draft is the rejection of an automatic capacity expansion by SoCal at Wheeler Ridge Calif with rolledin rates if certain criteria are met El Paso Energy had objected to the provision in the IS that would have allowed SoCa l to automatically expand capacity at Wheeler Ridge by million cfd if a certain number of curtailments occurred El Paso objected to forcing all shippers to pay for the expansion at Wheele r when only certain customers would benefit The draft says SoCal can file a separate application for

Elec Dereg Wed Sources Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LOS ANGELES Dow JonesEdison International EIX saying the current state of Californias power markets threatens the company with bankruptcy will call Wednesday for an end to Californias fouryear experiment with deregulation sources familiar with the issue told Dow Jones Newswires John Bryson chief executive of Edison International is expected to announce that the companys regulated utility unit Southern California Edison wont be able to recover more than billion in losses related to power purchases and continue serving its retail customers unless the states deregulated market structure is scrapped In a move tantamount to a call for reregulation Edison will propose to break ground on new power plants within days and reenter the powergeneration business Southern California Edison was required to exit under the states landmark deregulation law the sources said Edison plans to follow the announcement by filing a request with state regulators to increase retail electricity rates by as much as the sources said even though regulators rejected Edisons request for a rate increase of last week The utility has lined up the support of some state lawmakers for the broader proposal which would require action by the state legislature the sources said Southern California Edison with million customers is one of the countrys largest electric utilities Edison was the first of the states utilities to sign on to the deregulation effort and as it says on its Web site played a central role in the restructuring of the electric industry in California Among the concessions won by utilities in is the rate freeze which they demanded to help them recover costs related to deregulation but which is now producing huge losses Edisons current losses stem from an imbalance between the soaring prices it must pay to purchase power on the wholesale markets and the fixed rate at which it can sell power to its customers About half of those losses are offset the utilitys own power sales revenues which are accounted for separately and used to pay down deregulationrelated debt Rising power costs have produced a surplus in that account Edison wouldnt reveal the current size of the surplus but said previously that the California Power Exchange paid the utility billion over its generating costs for power through the end of September at a time when its powerpurchase losses were billion PowerPurchase Losses Mounting The net losses continue to mount Californias wholesale power prices hovered at record levels all summer and spiked even higher in the past two weeks as colder weather arrived in the Northwest at a time when much of Californias power supply was down for maintenance The price of power for delivery Wednesday in California hit an average of a megawatthour Tuesday up from a megawatthour a week ago the result of high demand and a decision by Californias wholesale market operator to lift its cap on prices The rate Southern California Edison can charge its retail customers however is fixed at MWh Last week Merrill Lynch Co MER downgraded its ratings for Edison International and PGE Corp PCG the parent of Californias other major utility Pacific Gas Electric to neutral saying the utilities may be forced to file for bankruptcy if the state doesnt allow them to raise their retail rates A Morgan Stanley Dean Witter MDW analyst drew the same conclusion Monday also cutting his rating to neutral Edison to this point has kept its powerpurchase losses off its earnings statement in hopes that a political or regulatory solution will allow them to be collected later The California Public Utilities Commission put the hope of such a solution further out of reach last week however when it ruled against rate increases sought by Edison and PGE Credit rating agency Fitch Inc on Monday lowered its ratings for Edison International and Southern California Edisons senior unsecured debt to the Aminus level citing increased liquidity pressure and uncertainty about the utilities ability to recover the costs of their power purchases The agency downgraded Edison International the parent because half its consolidated cash flow is provided by Southern California Edison Edison which sources said plans to remain in the retail electricity business said late last week that it has secured a billion line of credit and expects to have enough cash on hand to continue to pay for wholesale electricity for the next several months California paid more than billion for power last week sources said Some of that however was paid to Southern California Edison which still generates about megawatts of power in the state Shares in Edison International have fallen over the past three weeks They closed

Elec Dereg Wed Sources Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LOS ANGELES Dow JonesEdison International EIX saying the current state of Californias power markets threatens the company with bankruptcy will call Wednesday for an end to Californias fouryear experiment with deregulation sources familiar with the issue told Dow Jones Newswires John Bryson chief executive of Edison International is expected to announce that the companys regulated utility unit Southern California Edison wont be able to recover more than billion in losses related to power purchases and continue serving its retail customers unless the states deregulated market structure is scrapped In a move tantamount to a call for reregulation Edison will propose to break ground on new power plants within days and reenter the powergeneration business Southern California Edison was required to exit under the states landmark deregulation law the sources said Edison plans to follow the announcement by filing a request with state regulators to increase retail electricity rates by as much as the sources said even though regulators rejected Edisons request for a rate increase of last week The utility has lined up the support of some state lawmakers for the broader proposal which would require action by the state legislature the sources said Southern California Edison with million customers is one of the countrys largest electric utilities Edison was the first of the states utilities to sign on to the deregulation effort and as it says on its Web site played a central role in the restructuring of the electric industry in California Among the concessions won by utilities in is the rate freeze which they demanded to help them recover costs related to deregulation but which is now producing huge losses Edisons current losses stem from an imbalance between the soaring prices it must pay to purchase power on the wholesale markets and the fixed rate at which it can sell power to its customers About half of those losses are offset the utilitys own power sales revenues which are accounted for separately and used to pay down deregulationrelated debt Rising power costs have produced a surplus in that account Edison wouldnt reveal the current size of the surplus but said previously that the California Power Exchange paid the utility billion over its generating costs for power through the end of September at a time when its powerpurchase losses were billion PowerPurchase Losses Mounting The net losses continue to mount Californias wholesale power prices hovered at record levels all summer and spiked even higher in the past two weeks as colder weather arrived in the Northwest at a time when much of Californias power supply was down for maintenance The price of power for delivery Wednesday in California hit an average of a megawatthour Tuesday up from a megawatthour a week ago the result of high demand and a decision by Californias wholesale market operator to lift its cap on prices The rate Southern California Edison can charge its retail customers however is fixed at MWh Last week Merrill Lynch Co MER downgraded its ratings for Edison International and PGE Corp PCG the parent of Californias other major utility Pacific Gas Electric to neutral saying the utilities may be forced to file for bankruptcy if the state doesnt allow them to raise their retail rates A Morgan Stanley Dean Witter MDW analyst drew the same conclusion Monday also cutting his rating to neutral Edison to this point has kept its powerpurchase losses off its earnings statement in hopes that a political or regulatory solution will allow them to be collected later The California Public Utilities Commission put the hope of such a solution further out of reach last week however when it ruled against rate increases sought by Edison and PGE Credit rating agency Fitch Inc on Monday lowered its ratings for Edison International and Southern California Edisons senior unsecured debt to the Aminus level citing increased liquidity pressure and uncertainty about the utilities ability to recover the costs of their power purchases The agency downgraded Edison International the parent because half its consolidated cash flow is provided by Southern California Edison Edison which sources said plans to remain in the retail electricity business said late last week that it has secured a billion line of credit and expects to have enough cash on hand to continue to pay for wholesale electricity for the next several months California paid more than billion for power last week sources said Some of that however was paid to Southern California Edison which still generates about megawatts of power in the state Shares in Edison International have fallen over the past three weeks They closed

Edison Mission Energy Power Project Starts Construction After Expedited Approval By California Energy Commission Monday December pm Source Dow Jones Operation Targeted for August IRVINE Calif Dec PRNewswire Edison Mission Energy EME an Edison International company NYSE EIX started construction of its new Sunrise power plant on Thursday December having received expedited approval from the California Energy Commission CEC to proceed The power generation facility will be located in Kern County California and will bring both short and longterm generation capacity to the state which is in dire need of new power generation From the onset of the California power crisis we have sought to find means to bring new power to the California market said John E Bryson chairman and CEO of Edison International This CEC approval will help ensure that this critical new project will be able to provide a significant amount of new peaking power to the state as soon as next August Our thanks and appreciation go to the California Energy Commission and the environmental and regulatory agencies for their swift consideration of this important project This power has been offered by contract to the state so that the pricing for it does not depend on Californias broken deregulated power market said Alan J Fohrer president and CEO of EME Alternatively EME will seek to enter into a longterm costbased contract with either Pacific Gas Electric Company or San Diego Gas Electric Company to further ensure that Californias consumers reap the benefit of this additional power resource Fohrer said The Sunrise Power Project will be completed in two phases Phase will consist of a megawatt MW simplecycle peaking facility scheduled to be in service during the summer Phase will convert the peaking facility to a MW combinedcycle operation with an inservice date of summer The project will meet or exceed all pertinent environmental and safety standards Final regulatory approvals have been received for Phase I of the project only EME will be seeking expedited permitting approval for the Phase II expansion in line with the fasttrack approval process recently enacted by the California legislature EME has also negotiated an agreement with the labor unions for an adequate supply of highly skilled labor in order to achieve an accelerated construction schedule The accelerated schedule is aimed at providing this additional power to California by next summer Edison Mission Energy specializes in the development acquisition construction management and operation of global power production facilities As one of the worlds leading global power producers Edison Mission Energy owns nearly megawatts of generating capacity including interests in projects currently under

Edison Mission Energy Power Project Starts Construction After Expedited Approval By California Energy Commission Monday December pm Source Dow Jones Operation Targeted for August IRVINE Calif Dec PRNewswire Edison Mission Energy EME an Edison International company NYSE EIX started construction of its new Sunrise power plant on Thursday December having received expedited approval from the California Energy Commission CEC to proceed The power generation facility will be located in Kern County California and will bring both short and longterm generation capacity to the state which is in dire need of new power generation From the onset of the California power crisis we have sought to find means to bring new power to the California market said John E Bryson chairman and CEO of Edison International This CEC approval will help ensure that this critical new project will be able to provide a significant amount of new peaking power to the state as soon as next August Our thanks and appreciation go to the California Energy Commission and the environmental and regulatory agencies for their swift consideration of this important project This power has been offered by contract to the state so that the pricing for it does not depend on Californias broken deregulated power market said Alan J Fohrer president and CEO of EME Alternatively EME will seek to enter into a longterm costbased contract with either Pacific Gas Electric Company or San Diego Gas Electric Company to further ensure that Californias consumers reap the benefit of this additional power resource Fohrer said The Sunrise Power Project will be completed in two phases Phase will consist of a megawatt MW simplecycle peaking facility scheduled to be in service during the summer Phase will convert the peaking facility to a MW combinedcycle operation with an inservice date of summer The project will meet or exceed all pertinent environmental and safety standards Final regulatory approvals have been received for Phase I of the project only EME will be seeking expedited permitting approval for the Phase II expansion in line with the fasttrack approval process recently enacted by the California legislature EME has also negotiated an agreement with the labor unions for an adequate supply of highly skilled labor in order to achieve an accelerated construction schedule The accelerated schedule is aimed at providing this additional power to California by next summer Edison Mission Energy specializes in the development acquisition construction management and operation of global power

regarding the proposed decision is a pretty good Reade rs Digest version of the order Susan and I spoke with Jeff Dasovich and Mark Baldwin yesterday and the consensus of those conversations was that Transwestern should remain involved in this proceeding only for purposes of implementationdocumentation Jeff offered that he might send a letter to Governor Grays office expressing both dismay and

first before committing to anything Bilas draft cautious toward SoCal competition Mindful of the current chaos over energy markets in the state California Public Utilities Commissioner Richard Bilas has recommended the adoption of a much more moderate approach to promoting competition on Southern California Gas SoCal sy stem In his draft decision Bilas advised the commission to reject the unbundlin g of intrastate transmission and instead approve the first settlement filed in the case th e less farreaching Interim Settlement IS submitted in December SoCal San Diego Gas a nd Electric and other parties filed two more settlements after the IS reaching a comprehensive agreement in April this year But since then gas and power prices skyrocketed in the state prompting a consumer backlash and giving competition a bad name The draft language notes that the first interim settlement was supported by more customer groups than the later agreements Recent events lead us to conclude that the centerpiece of this investigation the unbundling of intrastate transmission and the implementation of a system of firm tradable intrastate transmission rights should be delayed according t o the draft order This unbundling is the basis of the comprehensive settle ment and we cannot approve it We do not however wish to commit to paralysis until as the postinterim settlement would have us do Accordingly we believe Californians are better served at this juncture by the adoption with modifications of the IS The biggest change to the IS in the draft is the rejection of an automatic capacity expansion by SoCal at Wheeler Ridge Calif with rolledin rates if certain criteria are met El Paso Energy had objected to the provision in the IS that would have allowed SoCa l to automatically expand capacity at Wheeler Ridge by million cfd if a certain number of curtailments occurred El Paso objected to forcing all shippers to pay for the expansion at Wheele r when only certain customers would benefit The draft says SoCal can file a separate application for the Wheeler Ridge expansion but approval would be conditioned on a traditional hearing proce ss The draft decision would also End SoCals current windowing process which limits shipp ers ability to change nominations for deliveries between receipt points on the system It is replaced with an announced daily

threshold fo r participating in core aggregation is reduced and billing options are offered to core aggregators Bilas draft also warned that the commission may come back in two years to open another investigation into gas competition taking into account any changes in mark et conditions Bilas gave a little more insight into his decision in the text of the draft The cost of gas as a commodity has vastly increased at the border show ing a differential between the basin and border prices that is more than the cost of transport and related services we question whether there will be an opportunity for discounting by markete rs if more competition is allowed Bilas wrote in the draft decision With half the state already committ ed to a restructured competitive natural gas industry it suddenly seems as if the benefits of such re structuring to enhance competition are speculative particularly at this time With one leg in the water the current has switched direction and it will be difficult if not foolhardy to reach our goals by forging ahead We choose to take a cautious approach again the draft continues Rather than proceeding to unbundle transmission in Southern California now we approve with modifications the settle ment suggesting smaller steps towards a competitive market Additionally w e unbundle core interstate transmission and once again urge the Legislature to pass

Kern River Gas Transmission CP recently amended its application for authority to construct and operate facilities Expansi on Project to serve new and existing powerplants in California as of Because the Expansion now incorporates most of the facilities to be installed for the shortterm California Action Project CP Kern Riv er needs only an additional dthd from Wyoming to California The dthd plus dthd expiring on for California Action shippers will create dthd needed by all Expansion shippers However t he revised design includes the continuation of dthd of capacity at t he Wheeler Ridge delivery point where Kern River interconnects with Southern California Gas Co SoCalGas available to California Action shippers through at which time Kern River will incorporate the dthd into its Expansion Project In its April order certificating the expedited California Action Project FERC also directed Kern River to seek explicit authority to reserve excess capacity for planned future expansions Kern River RP complied with a tariff filing which triggered a prote st from the Firm Customers The Firm Customers claim that Wheeler Ridge is significantly constrained and Kern River should not be able to reserve capacity especially at that point until all existing firm shippers with primary delivery point rights are reliably served In the most recent development on June Kern River answered that it is not responsible for problems downstream of Wheeler Ridge California Action Project CP FERC granted Kern River a certificate on April to provide up to Mcfd of limitedterm incremental capacity from Wyoming to California as of July to address the urgent need for additional energy In the order the Commission recognized that upgradi ng the meter station at Wheeler Ridge would create some excess capacity and that Kern River planned to reserve that capacity for its Expansion While the reservation of capacity was not precluded under its existing tariff Kern River told FERC that it would file for explicit authority to reserve capacity under the current circumstances Noting that such capacit y would be available for interruptible and secondary firm deliveries between the inservice dates of the California Action and the Expansion the Commission directedKern River to file a tariff provision within days In a request for rehearing filed May the Firm Customers challenged FERCs assumption that there will be some excess capacity at Wheeler Ridge They cited evidence indicating that Wheeler Ridge is already constrained resulting in significant scheduling cuts eg firm nominations cu t in May They insisted that expansion shippers should not have primary point access at Wheeler Ridge In the alternative expansion shippers should not enjoy the same level of firm service as existing shippers This line of argument was challenged by Kern River and expansion shipper Mirant Americas Energy Marketing LLC who urged FERC to deny rehearing Capacity Reservation Proposal RP On May Kern River filed a revised tariff sheet the Firm Customers filed a protest and Kern River answered While they support expansion of Kern River into California the Firm Customers fear that the proposed tariff language is not sufficient ly conditioned toprevent Kern River from reserving ie withholding or reselling capacity on an interim basis where there is no excess capacity to reserve or resell They are particularly concerned that Kern River may be able to withhold capacity andor sell incremental capacity on an interim basis at Wheeler Ridge The proposal would permit Kern River to reserv e what it does not have ie excess capacity and to recapture what it has already sold ie primary firm capacity held by existing Firm Customers for sale to others This violates the Commissions regulations and is contrary to every notion of due process fairness and the sanctity of contracts they said As in their request for rehearing of the Californ ia Action order the Customers cited evidence of significant schedulin g cuts at Wheeler Ridge Kern River should not be allowed to reserve or sell capacity at the Wheeler Ridge point until there is excess primary delivery point capacity at that point and sufficient downstream takeaway capacity such that existing firm shippers scheduling nominations for primary poi nts are not cut they said Accordingly they urged the Commission to rejec t the tariff filing to the extent that it allows reservation or interim sale of capacity at Wheeler Ridge and to clarify that Kern River is not allowed to withhold excess capacity at any point on its system when there are ship pers that are willing to pay maximum tariff rates for such capacity under longterm contracts The Firm Customers failed to seek rehearing expre ssly on FERCs directive about Wheeler Ridge shot back Kern River The attem pt to get FERC to disallow in this docket what the Commission recognized and allowed in CP is inappropriate the company said In any case the essence of their position was already set forth in the rehearing re quest As before the Firm Customers disregard the fact that Kern River is not responsible for the market problems downstream of its Wheeler Ridge deliver y point but only for reliably meeting its commitment to provide firm transportation deliveries to that point It has reliably delivered all quantities scheduled by SoCalGas for takeaway and has the capacity to deliver volumes up to the level of its firm contract obligations Moreover a prohibition on reservation of capacity at Wheeler Ridge would change the facility design of the Expansion which in turn could delay a new certificate filing beyond August and the inservice date of the Expansion beyond It could also could cause overbuilding of expansio n capacity and increase costs for both new and existing shippers Amended Expansion CP In the original application filed Kern River proposed to provide up to dthd of new firm longterm contract demand as of The amendment filed May proposes to install an additional unit at Kern Rivers Muddy Creek Compressor Statio n in Lincoln County Wyoming a new unit at its Daggett Compressor Station in Sa n Bernardino County California and an upgrade of its Opal Meter Station in Lincoln County Wyoming These facilities will cost approximately million A pro rata share dthd out of dthd of California Action costs will be allocated to the Expansion Kern River renewed it s request for a predetermination of rolledin rate treatment for the Expansion since the billing determinants dthd will reduce existi ng rates by offset in part by higher compressor fuel costs and electric compressor costs To ensure recovery of actual costs from shippers flowing gas through Daggett excluding California Action shippers subject to a separate incremental fuel inkind reimbursement obligation Kern River still sought FERC approval of a pro forma tariff provision establishing an electric compressor fuel surcharge However the initial surcharge now proposed is per dth of gas flow through the station based on updat ed gas volumes and electricity costs Kern River asked the Commission to act b y August so construction can begin at Muddy Creek by September before the onset of winter in Wyoming

Elec Dereg Wed Sources Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LOS ANGELES Dow JonesEdison International EIX saying the current state of Californias power markets threatens the company with bankruptcy will call Wednesday for an end to Californias fouryear experiment with deregulation sources familiar with the issue told Dow Jones Newswires John Bryson chief executive of Edison International is expected to announce that the companys regulated utility unit Southern California Edison wont be able to recover more than billion in losses related to power purchases and continue serving its retail customers unless the states deregulated market structure is scrapped In a move tantamount to a call for reregulation Edison will propose to break ground on new power plants within days and reenter the powergeneration business Southern California Edison was required to exit under the states landmark deregulation law the sources said Edison plans to follow the announcement by filing a request with state regulators to increase retail electricity rates by as much as the sources said even though regulators rejected Edisons request for a rate increase of last week The utility has lined up the support of some state lawmakers for the broader proposal which would require action by the state legislature the sources said Southern California Edison with million customers is one of the countrys largest electric utilities Edison was the first of the states utilities to sign on to the deregulation effort and as it says on its Web site played a central role in the restructuring of the electric industry in California Among the concessions won by utilities in is the rate freeze which they demanded to help them recover costs related to deregulation but which is now producing huge losses Edisons current losses stem from an imbalance between the soaring prices it must pay to purchase power on the wholesale markets and the fixed rate at which it can sell power to its customers About half of those losses are offset the utilitys own power sales revenues which are accounted for separately and used to pay down deregulationrelated debt Rising power costs have produced a surplus in that account Edison wouldnt reveal the current size of the surplus but said previously that the California Power Exchange paid the utility billion over its generating costs for power through the end of September at a time when its powerpurchase losses were billion PowerPurchase Losses Mounting The net losses continue to mount Californias wholesale power prices hovered at record levels all summer and spiked even higher in the past two weeks as colder weather arrived in the Northwest at a time when much of Californias power supply was down for maintenance The price of power for delivery Wednesday in California hit an average of a megawatthour Tuesday up from a megawatthour a week ago the result of high demand and a decision by Californias wholesale market operator to lift its cap on prices The rate Southern California Edison can charge its retail customers however is fixed at MWh Last week Merrill Lynch Co MER downgraded its ratings for Edison International and PGE Corp PCG the parent of Californias other major utility Pacific Gas Electric to neutral saying the utilities may be forced to file for bankruptcy if the state doesnt allow them to raise their retail rates A Morgan Stanley Dean Witter MDW analyst drew the same conclusion Monday also cutting his rating to neutral Edison to this point has kept its powerpurchase losses off its earnings statement in hopes that a political or regulatory solution will allow them to be collected later The California Public Utilities Commission put the hope of such a solution further out of reach last week however when it ruled against rate increases sought by Edison and PGE Credit rating agency Fitch Inc on Monday lowered its ratings for Edison International and Southern California Edisons senior unsecured debt to the Aminus level citing increased liquidity pressure and uncertainty about the utilities ability to recover the costs of their power purchases The agency downgraded Edison International the parent because half its consolidated cash flow is provided by Southern California Edison Edison which sources said plans to remain in the retail electricity business said late last week that it has secured a billion line of credit and expects to have enough cash on hand to continue to pay for wholesale electricity for the next several months California paid more than billion for power last week sources said Some of that however was paid to Southern California Edison which still generates about megawatts of power in the state Shares in Edison International have fallen over the past three weeks They closed

said The Sunrise Power Project will be completed in two phases Phase will consist of a megawatt MW simplecycle peaking facility scheduled to be in service during the summer Phase will convert the peaking facility to a MW combinedcycle operation with an inservice date of summer The project will meet or exceed all pertinent environmental and safety standards Final regulatory approvals have been received for Phase I of the project only EME will be seeking expedited permitting approval for the Phase II expansion in line with the fasttrack approval process recently enacted by the California

Knowledge Areas Western Energy N American Power N American Gas CALIFORNIA ON THE BRINK The California Stalemate California moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over creditworthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would avoid selling to the California market While numerous factors have contributed to the high cost of power incurred by Californias utilities the root cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation The current credit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address the situation The collective efforts of all market participants should be focused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible Western power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this summer Perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of California consumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and significant rate increases The California Public Utilities Commission denied the requests of Pacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edison to end their rate freezes forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance the costs of higher wholesale energy This has created an unsustainable accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the California market The current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the galvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to address the underlying structural problems in the industry However there is no guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective solution for customers and the industry as a whole Wholesale and retail markets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain muddled In the necessarily political process that will follow it is possible thatas has largely been the case so farthe steps taken will fail to move the California power market toward a more enduring solution and will instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws In the six months since Californias supply shortfall began plaguing Western markets regulators have done little to address the underlying problem Rather than addressing the cause of the supply shortageestablishing a market environment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and demand side responsesefforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for the crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers Indeed several actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by discouraging new power plant additions These include price caps repeated changes to market rules attempts to seize generator profits and a challenging siting and permitting process Medicine Worse than the Illness Several years of electricity demand growth and low prices in California were accompanied by very few additions to the supply base Regulators did not pay adequate attention to the looming supply shortfall The void of consensus over the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of bandaid remedies that address the symptoms but not the cause of Californias electric market woes Challenging siting and permitting Despite state action to better coordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants power plant developers still face high hurdles Local community opposition alone has struck down some key proposed facilities Price caps discourage investment State and federal proposals to cap prices limit the attractiveness of the California wholesale power market especially for developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment to more stable or more attractive markets outside the state Repeated rule changes Frequent rule changes in the ISO markets including the price caps confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new plant development Calls for refunds Despite reports by the Power Exchange the ISO and the FERC that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the California markets state officials continue to accuse power providers of gaming the market Calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits are a threat to new plant development Facility inspections Recent inspections of power plants by state officials to verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of their generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust CERAs recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the West are not guaranteed to make a profit Prospects of new plant profitability are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants decommissioning of older units demand growth and numerous other difficulttoforecast factors Californias regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers considering entering the state Despite efforts by the California ISO to stimulate new capacity additions in the state with a special limitedterm capacity payment CERA estimates that demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the West in In addition the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until at the earliest Therefore three years remain before a sufficient quantity of capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk of an outage The Road to Recovery There are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity shortfall Encourage new build Supply must be part of the answer This requires a series of steps that can help facilitate new supply build While in principal some have been taken such as new fast track approval the success of these actions can only be measured by the build itself For now there is still not enough new supply coming on until to relieve supply tightness Stabilize investment climate Utilities must have assurance that they will ultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power This provides the credit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new build Move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios One of the reasons the pressure on customers has been so intense in California has been the absence and even discouragement of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in the stateparticularly for residential and small commercial customers With the market at a peak however now is in one sense a suboptimal time to move toward term contracting Yet these contracts provide the foundation for a series of actionsincluding new supply build and demand side investments If they end up above market they will at least have achieved the desired effect of knocking down prices a fact which by itself should provide sufficient justification for recovering the cost of these commitments Encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response Although originally a feature of Californias market design most consumers are insulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates Exposing customers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a demand response Encourage market mechanisms that dampen the Boom Bust characteristic of the market Whether in the form of a capacity payment a reserve requirement or a minimum term portfolio requirement the California power market needs to move to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the market is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to elicit new investment Such a structure can help dampen but not eliminate future price volatility Avoid continuously tinkering with the market While the market does need to be restructured as described above it also needs to be stable and reliable to encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust longterm contractual market for power in California Continually tinkering with the market structuresuch as the three times the price cap has been shifted since Julyonly serves to undermine confidence in the market California needs to do its best to develop a longterm solution and then let the market run its course Allow for greater environmental flexibility The state should explore a more balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply shortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to emissions restrictions Free PURPA power plants to generate Relief should be granted to PURPA power plants that are operational but are restricted by contract from operating to generate only power end

ScottET NRON Steven HarrisET NRON cc Subject Daily California Update CPUC Votes to Keep Gas Flowing A special session yesterday of Californias regulators gave PGEs utility authority to amend its gas supply deals to keep supplies flowing to the state past Feb when the current federal DOE emergency order expires but it postponed action on another PGE request that Southern California Gas Co which has strongly objected be compelled to provide emergency supplies to the PGE utilitys residential and small business customers Loretta Lynch president of the California Public Utilities Commission said PGEs utility is a victim a victim of circumstances and a victim of predatory practices by natural gas suppliers now demanding payment for future supplies up front not because the utility has failed to pay its past gas bills but because the electricity crisis has sapped its creditworthiness The CPUC action allows PGEs utility to offer suppliers the option of securitization or in effect a lien in the utilitys retail customers bills which cover the full cost of the wholesale gas prices as an incentive to have the suppliers extend contracts with PGEs gas utility operations while the creditworthiness of the company itself is dubious It wont be until next week when the utility begins negotiating new contracts that it will know if the CPUC action will overcome the suppliers reluctance to extend contracts in the current situation according to PGE gas utility spokesperson Staci Homrig On the operational side PGE on Wednesday declared a lowinventory OFO because of a cold snap causing more supplies to be burned then pipeline shippers were bringing into the system The action was thought to help cause the PGE citygate price to jump from to on Wednesday As for reports of low storage Homrig said that while the utilitys supplies are very low they are adequate for the next week They are not dipping into cushion or base gas at this point Homrig said Lynch said that PGE has not defaulted on any payments but nevertheless in what she considers predatory practices the suppliers have required advance payments or payment at the time supplies are provided These gas suppliers are taking advantage of an emergency situation to extract another pound of flesh Lynch said in voting for the securitization measure Suppliers who have been paid when due are now saying regardless of existing agreements pay us today They are doing this in the coldest time of the year so the commissioners have to take these difficult steps to allow PGE amend these agreements in order to keep the gas flowing Part of the CPUCs action places a day limit on the securitization option so with the way gas contracts work in effect it only provides about another days worth of supplies said Homrig who noted that almost all of PGEs to suppliers have asked for special payment arrangements advances cashondelivery or letters of credit that the company cannot accommodate because of its cashflow crisis Out of ongoing negotiations the parties came up with the securitization proposal in the customer account receivables thus assuring them they will get paid On the gas side PGE has had sufficient revenues unlike its electric business but the suppliers have not wanted to let the utility stick to a normal payment arrangement because of the severe creditrating decline in the past weeks The CPUC met in San Francisco late Wednesday afternoon in the midst of a whirlwind day of public announcements from the governor state legislature consumer groups regulators and utilities A key piece was missing however California state legislative leaders called off a morning briefing that was to have offered the latest legislative proposals for dealing with the energy crisis Reportedly sticking points remain centered on the key questions of who pays for the solutions and how deeply the state gets into the energy business A spokesman for the assembly speakers office said he had no idea when the briefing would be rescheduled One piece of legislation that got through the state Senate SB X yesterday authorizes another million in emergency funds to purchase power It also would allow the state water resources department to be the utilities wholesale power supplier under longterm contracts at least through The measure drew a protest from CPUC Commissioner Richard Bilas who argued that the state agency be removed from that role as quickly as possible The bill which was first passed by the state Assembly was returned to assembly committees last night to iron out changes made in the senate It then would have to be ratified again by the Assembly Meanwhile consumer activists held rallies around the state protesting the state bailout of the privatesector utilities This prompted at least one of the utilities Southern California Edison to come out swinging saying that the recently released results of utility financial audits do not show any windfall profits or diversion of monies from the utilities to the parent company A letter surfaced in Washington from Gov Gray Davis to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee dated Jan and outlining measures the state is taking to increase energy supply and decrease demand sign longterm contracts and maintain the financial viability of the states public utilities The letter a catalogue of recent initiatives already reported here contained no specifics on any longterm contracts nor legislation signed that would address the immediate problem Davis outlined measures being taken to speed up siting of new power plants saying an additional MW would be online by the end of the year Responding to questions on another arena Edison Internationals senior vice president Tom Higgins said everything is on the table in the ongoing negotiations between Davis threeperson negotiating team and the two utilities including dropping the pending lawsuit in federal court in Los Angeles and crediting excess revenues from the utilities own generation against the whopping wholesale power cost undercollections The state remained under a power watch for the th day as the California independent grid operator CalISO urged conservation because reserves remain very low

Dthd It is a mainline expansion allowing Transwestern to flow west from receipt points East of Thoreau to the California border As you recall we held an open season in November for an undefined expansion to the system Customers were encouraged to define volumespricepath in their expressions of interest As youd expect we received wideranging expressions of interest for various locationsterm lengthspathspricing After months of work to define the most economical project for TW we were able just this week to go back to the original open season respondents and define the project for them Weve given them until March to provide us with a binding bid for capacity in the expansion Well look at those bids once theyre received and sortallocate them in the event volumes bid exceed according to our tariff Weve identified what receipt and delivery point capacities are available for customers on the expansion There is no capacity available for deliveries to SoCal Gas at Needles We expect gas to be delivered to PGE Southwest Gas and the two new power plants recently constructed off TW at the Cal border In my view and I think a view shared by many is that there really isnt necessarily a lack of upstream interstate capacity Rather the bigger obstacle to meeting growing gas demand in Southern California are the physical and regulatory bottlenecks in the California utility systems For example SoCal Gas has a physical bottleneck coming off TW into its Line that limits TW to Mcfd sustainable capacity With the addition of a modest horsepower increase at the SoCal Gas receiving station they could easily take another Mcfd off TW Similar bottlenecks exist into SoCal Gas Line system off EPNG at Topock as well as the interconnect with PGE and KernMojave at Wheeler Ridge The Line takeaway capacity from Wheeler Ridge is rated only at Mcfd PGE and KernMojave could easily deliver over Bcfd The problem at Wheeler Ridge will only be exacerbated if both PGE and Kern are successful in building expansions to their systems The clearest description of this problem Ive ever heard came from Jeff Dasovich Jeff likened the interstate pipelines serving California to an interstate highway system that ends in a dirt road The gas transmission infrastructure in California has been sorely neglected In fact if it hadnt been for the construction of KernMojave in the early s building directly into Kern County problems would be much worse today The issue has reached such a crescendo in California that even SoCal Gas is convening an industry forum to discuss intrastate infrastructure issues on March Transwestern will be represented there As to regulatory bottlenecks the CPUC launched an investigation a couple of years ago into the unbundling of the gas industry in California In an unprecedented effort the majority of stakeholders in the SoCal Gas system marketers producers pipelines the CPUCs own Office of Ratepayer Advocates and SoCal Gas itself offered up a comprehensive unbundling proposal to the CPUC for its consideration and approval Unforntunately the vested interests of the new owners of former utility generation used to having SoCal Gas system resources for balancingswings paid for by other customer classes put up significant resistance to the comprehensive settlement proposal This generator opposition along with the well publicized timing of problems blamed on electric system unbundling have put a stake in the heart of the regulatory reform process To answer your question about larger expansions as I said above Im not sure that additional interstate pipe beyond the current list of expansions on TW PGE and Kern necessarily has to be put into the ground in order to meet near term year demand in California However I do believe that California must take a rational look at its infrastructure needs with an eye towards relieving significant physical and regulatory bottlenecks in its intrastate transmission system Original

Kern River Gas Transmission CP recently amended its application for authority to construct and operate facilities Expansi on Project to serve new and existing powerplants in California as of Because the Expansion now incorporates most of the facilities to be installed for the shortterm California Action Project CP Kern Riv er needs only an additional dthd from Wyoming to California The dthd plus dthd expiring on for California Action shippers will create dthd needed by all Expansion shippers However t he revised design includes the continuation of dthd of capacity at t he Wheeler Ridge delivery point where Kern River interconnects with Southern California Gas Co SoCalGas available to California Action shippers through at which time Kern River will incorporate the dthd into its Expansion Project In its April order certificating the expedited California Action Project FERC also directed Kern River to seek explicit authority to reserve excess capacity for planned future expansions Kern River RP complied with a tariff filing which triggered a prote st from the Firm Customers The Firm Customers claim that Wheeler Ridge is significantly constrained and Kern River should not be able to reserve capacity especially at that point until all existing firm shippers with primary delivery point rights are reliably served In the most recent development on June Kern River answered that it is not responsible for problems downstream of Wheeler Ridge California Action Project CP FERC granted Kern River a certificate on April to provide up to Mcfd of limitedterm incremental capacity from Wyoming to California as of July to address the urgent need for additional energy In the order the Commission recognized that upgradi ng the meter station at Wheeler Ridge would create some excess capacity and that Kern River planned to reserve that capacity for its Expansion While the reservation of capacity was not precluded under its existing tariff Kern River told FERC that it would file for explicit authority to reserve capacity under the current circumstances Noting that such capacit y would be available for interruptible and secondary firm deliveries between the inservice dates of the California Action and the Expansion the Commission directedKern River to file a tariff provision within days In a request for rehearing filed May the Firm Customers challenged FERCs assumption that there will be some excess capacity at Wheeler Ridge They cited evidence indicating that Wheeler Ridge is already constrained resulting in significant scheduling cuts eg firm nominations cu t in May They insisted that expansion shippers should not have primary point access at Wheeler Ridge In the alternative expansion shippers should not enjoy the same level of firm service as existing shippers This line of argument was challenged by Kern River and expansion shipper Mirant Americas Energy Marketing LLC who urged FERC to deny rehearing Capacity Reservation Proposal RP On May Kern River filed a revised tariff sheet the Firm Customers filed a protest and Kern River answered While they support expansion of Kern River into California the Firm Customers fear that the proposed tariff language is not sufficient ly conditioned toprevent Kern River from reserving ie withholding or reselling capacity on an interim basis where there is no excess capacity to reserve or resell They are particularly concerned that Kern River may be able to withhold capacity andor sell incremental capacity on an interim basis at Wheeler Ridge The proposal would permit Kern River to reserv e what it does not have ie excess capacity and to recapture what it has already sold ie primary firm capacity held by existing Firm Customers for sale to others This violates the Commissions regulations and is contrary to every notion of due process fairness and the sanctity of contracts they said As in their request for rehearing of the Californ ia Action order the Customers cited evidence of significant schedulin g cuts at Wheeler Ridge Kern River should not be allowed to reserve or sell capacity at the Wheeler Ridge point until there is excess primary delivery point capacity at that point and sufficient downstream takeaway capacity such that existing firm shippers scheduling nominations for primary poi nts are not cut they said Accordingly they urged the Commission to rejec t the tariff filing to the extent that it allows reservation or interim sale of capacity at Wheeler Ridge and to clarify that Kern River is not allowed to withhold excess capacity at any point on its system when there are ship pers that are willing to pay maximum tariff rates for such capacity under longterm contracts The Firm Customers failed to seek rehearing expre ssly on FERCs directive about Wheeler Ridge shot back Kern River The attem pt to get FERC to disallow in this docket what the Commission recognized and allowed in CP is inappropriate the company said In any case the essence of their position was already set forth in the rehearing re quest As before the Firm Customers disregard the fact that Kern River is not responsible for the market problems downstream of its Wheeler Ridge deliver y point but only for reliably meeting its commitment to provide firm transportation deliveries to that point It has reliably delivered all quantities scheduled by SoCalGas for takeaway and has the capacity to deliver volumes up to the level of its firm contract obligations Moreover a prohibition on reservation of capacity at Wheeler Ridge would change the facility design of the Expansion which in turn could delay a new certificate filing beyond August and the inservice date of the Expansion beyond It could also could cause overbuilding of expansio n capacity and increase costs for both new and existing shippers Amended Expansion CP In the original application filed Kern River proposed to provide up to dthd of new firm longterm contract demand as of The amendment filed May proposes to install an additional unit at Kern Rivers Muddy Creek Compressor Statio n in Lincoln County Wyoming a new unit at its Daggett Compressor Station in Sa n Bernardino County California and an upgrade of its Opal Meter Station in Lincoln County Wyoming These facilities will cost approximately million A pro rata share dthd out of dthd of California Action costs will be allocated to the Expansion Kern River renewed it s request for a predetermination of rolledin rate treatment for the Expansion since the billing determinants dthd will reduce existi ng rates by offset in part by higher compressor fuel costs and electric compressor costs To ensure recovery of actual costs from shippers flowing gas through Daggett excluding California Action shippers subject to a separate incremental fuel inkind reimbursement obligation Kern River still sought FERC approval of a pro forma tariff provision establishing an electric compressor fuel surcharge However the initial surcharge now proposed is per dth of gas flow through the station based on updat ed gas volumes and electricity costs Kern River asked the Commission to act b y August so construction can begin at Muddy Creek by September before the onset of winter in Wyoming

Elec Dereg Wed Sources Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LOS ANGELES Dow JonesEdison International EIX saying the current state of Californias power markets threatens the company with bankruptcy will call Wednesday for an end to Californias fouryear experiment with deregulation sources familiar with the issue told Dow Jones Newswires John Bryson chief executive of Edison International is expected to announce that the companys regulated utility unit Southern California Edison wont be able to recover more than billion in losses related to power purchases and continue serving its retail customers unless the states deregulated market structure is scrapped In a move tantamount to a call for reregulation Edison will propose to break ground on new power plants within days and reenter the powergeneration business Southern California Edison was required to exit under the states landmark deregulation law the sources said Edison plans to follow the announcement by filing a request with state regulators to increase retail electricity rates by as much as the sources said even though regulators rejected Edisons request for a rate increase of last week The utility has lined up the support of some state lawmakers for the broader proposal which would require action by the state legislature the sources said Southern California Edison with million customers is one of the countrys largest electric utilities Edison was the first of the states utilities to sign on to the deregulation effort and as it says on its Web site played a central role in the restructuring of the electric industry in California Among the concessions won by utilities in is the rate freeze which they demanded to help them recover costs related to deregulation but which is now producing huge losses Edisons current losses stem from an imbalance between the soaring prices it must pay to purchase power on the wholesale markets and the fixed rate at which it can sell power to its customers About half of those losses are offset the utilitys own power sales revenues which are accounted for separately and used to pay down deregulationrelated debt Rising power costs have produced a surplus in that account Edison wouldnt reveal the current size of the surplus but said previously that the California Power Exchange paid the utility billion over its generating costs for power through the end of September at a time when its powerpurchase losses were billion PowerPurchase Losses Mounting The net losses continue to mount Californias wholesale power prices hovered at record levels all summer and spiked even higher in the past two weeks as colder weather arrived in the Northwest at a time when much of Californias power supply was down for maintenance The price of power for delivery Wednesday in California hit an average of a megawatthour Tuesday up from a megawatthour a week ago the result of high demand and a decision by Californias wholesale market operator to lift its cap on prices The rate Southern California Edison can charge its retail customers however is fixed at MWh Last week Merrill Lynch Co MER downgraded its ratings for Edison International and PGE Corp PCG the parent of Californias other major utility Pacific Gas Electric to neutral saying the utilities may be forced to file for bankruptcy if the state doesnt allow them to raise their retail rates A Morgan Stanley Dean Witter MDW analyst drew the same conclusion Monday also cutting his rating to neutral Edison to this point has kept its powerpurchase losses off its earnings statement in hopes that a political or regulatory solution will allow them to be collected later The California Public Utilities Commission put the hope of such a solution further out of reach last week however when it ruled against rate increases sought by Edison and PGE Credit rating agency Fitch Inc on Monday lowered its ratings for Edison International and Southern California Edisons senior unsecured debt to the Aminus level citing increased liquidity pressure and uncertainty about the utilities ability to recover the costs of their power purchases The agency downgraded Edison International the parent because half its consolidated cash flow is provided by Southern California Edison Edison which sources said plans to remain in the retail electricity business said late last week that it has secured a billion line of credit and expects to have enough cash on hand to continue to pay for wholesale electricity for the next several months California paid more than billion for power last week sources said Some of that however was paid to Southern California Edison which still generates about megawatts of power in the state Shares in Edison International have fallen over the past three weeks They closed

Dthd It is a mainline expansion allowing Transwestern to flow west from receipt points East of Thoreau to the California border As you recall we held an open season in November for an undefined expansion to the system Customers were encouraged to define volumespricepath in their expressions of interest As youd expect we received wideranging expressions of interest for various locationsterm lengthspathspricing After months of work to define the most economical project for TW we were able just this week to go back to the original open season respondents and define the project for them Weve given them until March to provide us with a binding bid for capacity in the expansion Well look at those bids once theyre received and sortallocate them in the event volumes bid exceed according to our tariff Weve identified what receipt and delivery point capacities are available for customers on the expansion There is no capacity available for deliveries to SoCal Gas at Needles We expect gas to be delivered to PGE Southwest Gas and the two new power plants recently constructed off TW at the Cal border In my view and I think a view shared by many is that there really isnt necessarily a lack of upstream interstate capacity Rather the bigger obstacle to meeting growing gas demand in Southern California are the physical and regulatory bottlenecks in the California utility systems For example SoCal Gas has a physical bottleneck coming off TW into its Line that limits TW to Mcfd sustainable capacity With the addition of a modest horsepower increase at the SoCal Gas receiving station they could easily take another Mcfd off TW Similar bottlenecks exist into SoCal Gas Line system off EPNG at Topock as well as the interconnect with PGE and KernMojave at Wheeler Ridge The Line takeaway capacity from Wheeler Ridge is rated only at Mcfd PGE and KernMojave could easily deliver over Bcfd The problem at Wheeler Ridge will only be exacerbated if both PGE and Kern are successful in building expansions to their systems The clearest description of this problem Ive ever heard came from Jeff Dasovich Jeff likened the interstate pipelines serving California to an interstate highway system that ends in a dirt road The gas transmission infrastructure in California has been sorely neglected In fact if it hadnt been for the construction of KernMojave in the early s building directly into Kern County problems would be much worse today The issue has reached such a crescendo in California that even SoCal Gas is convening an industry forum to discuss intrastate infrastructure issues on March Transwestern will be represented there As to regulatory bottlenecks the CPUC launched an investigation a couple of years ago into the unbundling of the gas industry in California In an unprecedented effort the majority of stakeholders in the SoCal Gas system marketers producers pipelines the CPUCs own Office of Ratepayer Advocates and SoCal Gas itself offered up a comprehensive unbundling proposal to the CPUC for its consideration and approval Unforntunately the vested interests of the new owners of former utility generation used to having SoCal Gas system resources for balancingswings paid for by other customer classes put up significant resistance to the comprehensive settlement proposal This generator opposition along with the well publicized timing of problems blamed on electric system unbundling have put a stake in the heart of the regulatory reform process To answer your question about larger expansions as I said above Im not sure that additional interstate pipe beyond the current list of expansions on TW PGE and Kern necessarily has to be put into the ground in order to meet near term year demand in California However I do believe that California must take a rational look at its infrastructure needs with an eye towards relieving significant physical and regulatory bottlenecks in its intrastate transmission system Original

ScottET NRON Steven HarrisET NRON cc Subject Daily California Update CPUC Votes to Keep Gas Flowing A special session yesterday of Californias regulators gave PGEs utility authority to amend its gas supply deals to keep supplies flowing to the state past Feb when the current federal DOE emergency order expires but it postponed action on another PGE request that Southern California Gas Co which has strongly objected be compelled to provide emergency supplies to the PGE utilitys residential and small business customers Loretta Lynch president of the California Public Utilities Commission said PGEs utility is a victim a victim of circumstances and a victim of predatory practices by natural gas suppliers now demanding payment for future supplies up front not because the utility has failed to pay its past gas bills but because the electricity crisis has sapped its creditworthiness The CPUC action allows PGEs utility to offer suppliers the option of securitization or in effect a lien in the utilitys retail customers bills which cover the full cost of the wholesale gas prices as an incentive to have the suppliers extend contracts with PGEs gas utility operations while the creditworthiness of the company itself is dubious It wont be until next week when the utility begins negotiating new contracts that it will know if the CPUC action will overcome the suppliers reluctance to extend contracts in the current situation according to PGE gas utility spokesperson Staci Homrig On the operational side PGE on Wednesday declared a lowinventory OFO because of a cold snap causing more supplies to be burned then pipeline shippers were bringing into the system The action was thought to help cause the PGE citygate price to jump from to on Wednesday As for reports of low storage Homrig said that while the utilitys supplies are very low they are adequate for the next week They are not dipping into cushion or base gas at this point Homrig said Lynch said that PGE has not defaulted on any payments but nevertheless in what she considers predatory practices the suppliers have required advance payments or payment at the time supplies are provided These gas suppliers are taking advantage of an emergency situation to extract another pound of flesh Lynch said in voting for the securitization measure Suppliers who have been paid when due are now saying regardless of existing agreements pay us today They are doing this in the coldest time of the year so the commissioners have to take these difficult steps to allow PGE amend these agreements in order to keep the gas flowing Part of the CPUCs action places a day limit on the securitization option so with the way gas contracts work in effect it only provides about another days worth of supplies said Homrig who noted that almost all of PGEs to suppliers have asked for special payment arrangements advances cashondelivery or letters of credit that the company cannot accommodate because of its cashflow crisis Out of ongoing negotiations the parties came up with the securitization proposal in the customer account receivables thus assuring them they will get paid On the gas side PGE has had sufficient revenues unlike its electric business but the suppliers have not wanted to let the utility stick to a normal payment arrangement because of the severe creditrating decline in the past weeks The CPUC met in San Francisco late Wednesday afternoon in the midst of a whirlwind day of public announcements from the governor state legislature consumer groups regulators and utilities A key piece was missing however California state legislative leaders called off a morning briefing that was to have offered the latest legislative proposals for dealing with the energy crisis Reportedly sticking points remain centered on the key questions of who pays for the solutions and how deeply the state gets into the energy business A spokesman for the assembly speakers office said he had no idea when the briefing would be rescheduled One piece of legislation that got through the state Senate SB X yesterday authorizes another million in emergency funds to purchase power It also would allow the state water resources department to be the utilities wholesale power supplier under longterm contracts at least through The measure drew a protest from CPUC Commissioner Richard Bilas who argued that the state agency be removed from that role as quickly as possible The bill which was first passed by the state Assembly was returned to assembly committees last night to iron out changes made in the senate It then would have to be ratified again by the Assembly Meanwhile consumer activists held rallies around the state protesting the state bailout of the privatesector utilities This prompted at least one of the utilities Southern California Edison to come out swinging saying that the recently released results of utility financial audits do not show any windfall profits or diversion of monies from the utilities to the parent company A letter surfaced in Washington from Gov Gray Davis to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee dated Jan and outlining measures the state is taking to increase energy supply and decrease demand sign longterm contracts and maintain the financial viability of the states public utilities The letter a catalogue of recent initiatives already reported here contained no specifics on any longterm contracts nor legislation signed that would address the immediate problem Davis outlined measures being taken to speed up siting of new power plants saying an additional MW would be online by the end of the year Responding to questions on another arena Edison Internationals senior vice president Tom Higgins said everything is on the table in the ongoing negotiations between Davis threeperson negotiating team and the two utilities including dropping the pending lawsuit in federal court in Los Angeles and crediting excess revenues from the utilities own generation against the whopping wholesale power cost undercollections The state remained under a power watch for the th day as the California independent grid operator CalISO urged conservation because reserves remain very low

CERA Knowledge Areas Western Energy N American Power N American Gas CALIFORNIA ON THE BRINK The California Stalemate California moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over creditworthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would avoid selling to the California market While numerous factors have contributed to the high cost of power incurred by Californias utilities the root cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation The current credit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address the situation The collective efforts of all market participants should be focused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible Western power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this summer Perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of California consumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and significant rate increases The California Public Utilities Commission denied the requests of Pacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edison to end their rate freezes forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance the costs of higher wholesale energy This has created an unsustainable accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the California market The current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the galvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to address the underlying structural problems in the industry However there is no guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective solution for customers and the industry as a whole Wholesale and retail markets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain muddled In the necessarily political process that will follow it is possible thatas has largely been the case so farthe steps taken will fail to move the California power market toward a more enduring solution and will instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws In the six months since Californias supply shortfall began plaguing Western markets regulators have done little to address the underlying problem Rather than addressing the cause of the supply shortageestablishing a market environment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and demand side responsesefforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for the crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers Indeed several actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by discouraging new power plant additions These include price caps repeated changes to market rules attempts to seize generator profits and a challenging siting and permitting process Medicine Worse than the Illness Several years of electricity demand growth and low prices in California were accompanied by very few additions to the supply base Regulators did not pay adequate attention to the looming supply shortfall The void of consensus over the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of bandaid remedies that address the symptoms but not the cause of Californias electric market woes Challenging siting and permitting Despite state action to better coordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants power plant developers still face high hurdles Local community opposition alone has struck down some key proposed facilities Price caps discourage investment State and federal proposals to cap prices limit the attractiveness of the California wholesale power market especially for developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment to more stable or more attractive markets outside the state Repeated rule changes Frequent rule changes in the ISO markets including the price caps confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new plant development Calls for refunds Despite reports by the Power Exchange the ISO and the FERC that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the California markets state officials continue to accuse power providers of gaming the market Calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits are a threat to new plant development Facility inspections Recent inspections of power plants by state officials to verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of their generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust CERAs recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the West are not guaranteed to make a profit Prospects of new plant profitability are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants decommissioning of older units demand growth and numerous other difficulttoforecast factors Californias regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers considering entering the state Despite efforts by the California ISO to stimulate new capacity additions in the state with a special limitedterm capacity payment CERA estimates that demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the West in In addition the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until at the earliest Therefore three years remain before a sufficient quantity of capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk of an outage The Road to Recovery There are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity shortfall Encourage new build Supply must be part of the answer This requires a series of steps that can help facilitate new supply build While in principal some have been taken such as new fast track approval the success of these actions can only be measured by the build itself For now there is still not enough new supply coming on until to relieve supply tightness Stabilize investment climate Utilities must have assurance that they will ultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power This provides the credit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new build Move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios One of the reasons the pressure on customers has been so intense in California has been the absence and even discouragement of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in the stateparticularly for residential and small commercial customers With the market at a peak however now is in one sense a suboptimal time to move toward term contracting Yet these contracts provide the foundation for a series of actionsincluding new supply build and demand side investments If they end up above market they will at least have achieved the desired effect of knocking down prices a fact which by itself should provide sufficient justification for recovering the cost of these commitments Encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response Although originally a feature of Californias market design most consumers are insulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates Exposing customers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a demand response Encourage market mechanisms that dampen the Boom Bust characteristic of the market Whether in the form of a capacity payment a reserve requirement or a minimum term portfolio requirement the California power market needs to move to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the market is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to elicit new investment Such a structure can help dampen but not eliminate future price volatility Avoid continuously tinkering with the market While the market does need to be restructured as described above it also needs to be stable and reliable to encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust longterm contractual market for power in California Continually tinkering with the market structuresuch as the three times the price cap has been shifted since Julyonly serves to undermine confidence in the market California needs to do its best to develop a longterm solution and then let the market run its course Allow for greater environmental flexibility The state should explore a more balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply shortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to emissions restrictions Free PURPA power plants to generate Relief should be granted to PURPA power plants that are operational but are restricted by contract from operating to generate only power end
