<13096876.1075843517246.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,jbennett@gmssr.com,2001-05-22 02:53:00,Workshop on Real Time MeteringCommissions Energy Division held a workshop yesterday May st with the stated objective of developing a viable program for real time pricing options which will attract sufficient customer participation to have a meaningful impact starting July In short the workshop provided the California Energy Commission CEC a forum to push the proposal it advanced in the SCEPGE rate design proceeding which has now been fleshed out more through proposed tariff language attached The Energy Division is taking the view that the CEC proposal is the point of departure In other words thats whats going to be adopted unless changes are made in this workshop process The UDCs are taking the view that there is no way they can implement the CECs proposal by July The hang up from the UDCs end appears to be the two part nature of the proposal Basically the CEC has proposed based on the program currently being used by Georgia Power that a customer pays for baseline level of usage at standard tariff prices and differences in usage from the baseline are billed at RTP prices The UDCs state that they could have their billing systems ready in a month to bill customers at market prices for entire consumption but it would take four to six months to have the billing systems ready to administer the two part proposal The CEC is insistent that given the fact that the RTP program will be voluntary the number of customers that will be on the program initially will not be large and the UDCs should at minimum be able to establish a manual system to bill these customers The UDCs in return state that it makes no sense to waste the time and effort to establish a manual system if you are working toward greater participation ie start working toward an automated system The result of the discussions was that the UDCs CEC and the Energy Division are suppose to get together in a smaller working group to see what can be done about the billing constraints so that something can be in place on July On possible solution discussed is the decoupling of the standard tariff piece of the customers bill from the real time piece for a few months until the billing constraints are worked out I think the idea is that the customer would be billed at the standard tariff price for all usage with a true up later on for the real time pricing on the incremental portion of the usage Other points of interest arising from the workshop The CECs proposal calls for RTP Values to be prepared by DWR and the ISO for each of the hours of the following day These prices will be posted on the ISO and DWR websites DWR is concerned however about the market having too much information about its procurement practices Therefore DWR will use information readily obtainable in the market eg Platts index that publishes next day prices for on and off peak DWR however will make certain adjustments to these published prices It was not clear exactly what adjustments would be made There was concern from participants at the workshop that the DWR price would not be transparent A lot of discussion ensued as to whether the million authorized by AB X will be sufficient to pay for all the meters the plan is to put an interval meter in place for all customers over kW SCE has taken the position that the per meter which is being allocated is not sufficient SCE will not start installing meters until it receives clarification from the Commission that it will be allowed to track the costs in a memorandum account for potential future recovery SCE plans to file an advice letter on this point this week There is also concern about what the buys you Apparently the meters will have the capability to provide a customers pricing data as frequently as they wants it but if the customer wants to access that data on a more frequent data than daily it will have to buy additional software about At the tail end of the day there was some discussion on how real time pricing would interact with other rates and demand responsiveness programs An analysis was prepared by John Flory private consultant working for the CEC on this which sets forth his best shot on how real time pricing can supplement several other demand responsiveness options to provide additional demand cost reduction benefits For example a customer on both the Scheduled Load Reduction Program and on RTP could during his nonSLRP hours respond to RTP prices Mr Flory prepared a chart which highlights which programs he believes could work together and which will not A copy of this material will be faxed to Sue Mara SF and Harry Kingerski Houston The process from here on out is not clear The Energy Division will write up a brief report on the workshop without recommendations The small working group referenced above will convene and furnish a report back by the end of next week After that it gets kind of fuzzy as to how something will be implemented by July If you have any additional questions about the workshop please call XDOC Jeanne Bennett XDOC

<797203.1075843625127.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,jbennett@gmssr.com,2001-05-22 02:53:00,Workshop on Real Time MeteringCommissions Energy Division held a workshop yesterday May st with the stated objective of developing a viable program for real time pricing options which will attract sufficient customer participation to have a meaningful impact starting July In short the workshop provided the California Energy Commission CEC a forum to push the proposal it advanced in the SCEPGE rate design proceeding which has now been fleshed out more through proposed tariff language attached The Energy Division is taking the view that the CEC proposal is the point of departure In other words thats whats going to be adopted unless changes are made in this workshop process The UDCs are taking the view that there is no way they can implement the CECs proposal by July The hang up from the UDCs end appears to be the two part nature of the proposal Basically the CEC has proposed based on the program currently being used by Georgia Power that a customer pays for baseline level of usage at standard tariff prices and differences in usage from the baseline are billed at RTP prices The UDCs state that they could have their billing systems ready in a month to bill customers at market prices for entire consumption but it would take four to six months to have the billing systems ready to administer the two part proposal The CEC is insistent that given the fact that the RTP program will be voluntary the number of customers that will be on the program initially will not be large and the UDCs should at minimum be able to establish a manual system to bill these customers The UDCs in return state that it makes no sense to waste the time and effort to establish a manual system if you are working toward greater participation ie start working toward an automated system The result of the discussions was that the UDCs CEC and the Energy Division are suppose to get together in a smaller working group to see what can be done about the billing constraints so that something can be in place on July On possible solution discussed is the decoupling of the standard tariff piece of the customers bill from the real time piece for a few months until the billing constraints are worked out I think the idea is that the customer would be billed at the standard tariff price for all usage with a true up later on for the real time pricing on the incremental portion of the usage Other points of interest arising from the workshop The CECs proposal calls for RTP Values to be prepared by DWR and the ISO for each of the hours of the following day These prices will be posted on the ISO and DWR websites DWR is concerned however about the market having too much information about its procurement practices Therefore DWR will use information readily obtainable in the market eg Platts index that publishes next day prices for on and off peak DWR however will make certain adjustments to these published prices It was not clear exactly what adjustments would be made There was concern from participants at the workshop that the DWR price would not be transparent A lot of discussion ensued as to whether the million authorized by AB X will be sufficient to pay for all the meters the plan is to put an interval meter in place for all customers over kW SCE has taken the position that the per meter which is being allocated is not sufficient SCE will not start installing meters until it receives clarification from the Commission that it will be allowed to track the costs in a memorandum account for potential future recovery SCE plans to file an advice letter on this point this week There is also concern about what the buys you Apparently the meters will have the capability to provide a customers pricing data as frequently as they wants it but if the customer wants to access that data on a more frequent data than daily it will have to buy additional software about At the tail end of the day there was some discussion on how real time pricing would interact with other rates and demand responsiveness programs An analysis was prepared by John Flory private consultant working for the CEC on this which sets forth his best shot on how real time pricing can supplement several other demand responsiveness options to provide additional demand cost reduction benefits For example a customer on both the Scheduled Load Reduction Program and on RTP could during his nonSLRP hours respond to RTP prices Mr Flory prepared a chart which highlights which programs he believes could work together and which will not A copy of this material will be faxed to Sue Mara SF and Harry Kingerski Houston The process from here on out is not clear The Energy Division will write up a brief report on the workshop without recommendations The small working group referenced above will convene and furnish a report back by the end of next week After that it gets kind of fuzzy as to how something will be implemented by July If you have any additional questions about the workshop please call XDOC Jeanne Bennett XDOC
