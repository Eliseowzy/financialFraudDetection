week of is mandatory Please supply me with the timesdates you are available to test for the next two weeks as well as the blackout times ASAP We are in the process of stress testing the system To ensure that we are free of errors and duplicate data I need new data to be entered into ALL scripts this week preferably Monday thru Wednesday I know you are all extremely busy but the data entered prior to noon today cannot be used We have resolved a few issues and need new data sent across in order to verify the resolution is complete To prepare you in advance I will need you to rerun all test scripts again next week If you have question concerns or run into any problems please call or email me immediately x Regards Melissa x DONT FORGET Ensure that each team is communicating with each other The following process must be followed each and every time the test script is executed in order to track test script results The Result section of all test scripts must be filled out by the Global Users Global users will email the completed test scripts to their Unify teammate Once the Unify tester has completed verification heshe will fill in the remainder of the Result information After the Unify tester has verified and updated all test scripts the Unify testers will forward the test scripts along with all results to me For example When Marlene is finished entering all Global Facilities test scripts Chris Wade and Richard should receive an email containing the test scripts and Result information needed for Unify verification ie Pipeline rate schedule deal category etc Richard Wade and Chris will verify Unify information and fill in additional Result information Once that is complete I should receive emails one from each person containing the test scripts and Result information Also remember you do not have to follow the scripts verbatim Under the Script Execution section of each script Required Actions are mandatory However you can add additional information if you so choose The more information the better the test On the other hand the Expected Results column may vary per user NOTE The th floor testing lab is available for your use Please refer to the email I sent out for lab time availability
