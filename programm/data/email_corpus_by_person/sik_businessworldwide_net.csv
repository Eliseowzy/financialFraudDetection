highestlevel processors HYPD is a Great Plains and Microsoft Solution Provider HYPD is a Computer Associates partner New management team with proven track record of business success HY PDS business model is targeted on obtaining recurring revenue streams IM AGE INVESTMENT SUMMARY HYPD is a premier provider of comprehensive integrated technology services ITSP and solutions for a client base in the rapidly growing ITSP marketplace for smalltomedium sized businesses HYPD is capable of handling a wide range of its clients unique ITSP need s with services ranging from conventional IT services to enterprise migrat ion and comprehensive IT HyperSource solutions outsourcing all of a client s ebusiness needs HYPD has positioned its future business strategy aro und the development of uniquely designed Integrated Technology Centers ITC s which will offer client companies comprehensive bundled ITSP services a nd solutions integrated with its state of the art facilities The first Ho uston based ITC has recently begun operations and is offering its clients a full and expansive range of outsourced IT and backoffice services HYPD s first ITC is designed around an ATDedicated Entrance Facility with onne t redundant fiber provisioning offering scalable bandwidth up to an OC a nd beyond This comprehensive Ti er hosting center enables HYPD to offe r clients complete endtoend IT services in a fully redundant and seamless environment Through recently developed Hyperserve connection products H YPD has been able to improve the functionality of its services by offering clients remote server appliances that connect to the ITC Bolstered by str ategic alliances and strong working relationships with major players in tec hnology and telecommunications including Microsoft Intel ATT and Great Plains HYPD has demonstrated a superior ability to cater to the unique ne eds and limitations of smalltomedium sized businesses effectively creati ng a business model that partners HYPDS success with that of its clients Utilizing this innovative approach HYPD should be able to grow its busine ss in conjunction with client business growth and position itself as the I TSP provider of choice for an emerging market of small and mid sized compan ies Within t he Houston region and with this small and mid sized target market HYPD is well positioned to grow its business substantially over th e near to intermediate term and achieve niche market dominance within an ap preciable time period HYPD has recently aimed its fullservice IT hosti ng business model towards the unique needs and growth strategies of small t o mediumsized businesses a rapidly growing market that is relatively unde served by major IT service providers such as Level UUNet and Sprint HYPD has based this approach around the potentially lucrative longterm re venue streams afforded through association with growing companies For exa mple HYPD has recently initiated longterm Hypersource IT hosting arrangem ents with Eagle Wireless International and Premiere Media Group Eagle Wir eless is a leading supplier of broadband wired and wireless equipment and s ervices for a variety of markets including the Internet digital settop b oxes and wireless convergence products and is anticipated to reach nation al market penetration within the next several years As the client company grows its business over the next several years the highly scalable nature of the Hyperdynamics IT hosting model will enable the Company to offer ad ditional needed services readily while retaining high margins By being ab le to refine and scale up c lient IT services in a quick time period and for minimal additional expenses HYPD has opened up access to significant a nd recurring longterm revenue streams from smaller and midsized business clients Moreover HYPD offers client companies an unprecedented degree of personalized attention and customization when compared to major national ITSP providers The infrastructure of HYPDS first ITC designed to supp ort endtoend ITSP services can also be leveraged for easy and smart diver sification With its recent acquisition of Seacon Computer Systems Inc S CS HYPD has been able to enter the vertical seismic data management marke t Thus in addition to its horizontal industry approach for ITSP services new and innovative vertically oriented business opportunities offering div ersified revenue streams are coming to HYPD For example SCS is a seismi c data management company that has developed a unique and cost saving metho d for transferring seismic and geologic data for oil and gas companies on mm and mm magnetic tapes to state of the art DVD optical storage The c urrent methods of storing this type of data on magnetic tapes are time cons uming prohibitively expensive outdated the technology is over years o ld and inefficient SCS will enable clients in the expanding oil and gas industry to migrate the estimated billion magnetic tapes that degrade in years to DVD storage with an expected lifespan of over years at a cheaper price point and with easy accessibility The SCS acquisition mo reover provides an ideal strategic fit to the core data center business of HYPD and opens up significant and highly lucrative revenue streams SCS will derive revenue s from three principal sources conversion of exis ting tapes to superior DVD storage technologies accessing DVD data thr ough HYPDs ITC facility and a vertical ASP approach to remote seismic interpretation processing of data through the Houston ITC using technical and hardware support from Intel In addition to opening up an innovative a nd new business through the SCS acquisition HYPD believes that it will be able to apply this type of vertical ASP approach towards other target indus tries such as insurance services either through additional acquisitions o r joint ventures HYPDs projected revenue and business growth will be l argely driven by several principal catalysts including continuing to implement its full service IT hosting solution Hypersource through the Ho ustonbased stateoftheart Integrated Technology Center and future plann ed ITCs in regional markets orienting its ITSP solutions and services towards the unique needs of expanding smallandmedium sized businesses entering into longterm recurring revenue contracts by growing with its clients and providing additional services at higher margins as these clie nt businesses expand opening up new and lucrative revenu e streams th rough its subsidiary SCS and integrating this business opportunity through internal synergies with its core IT hosting and services business and positioning itself within a competitively underserved marketplace for ITSP services and products for small and midsized business clients VALUAT ION Consolidation within the ITSP industry has been a consistent theme wi thin the past several years Major ITSP hosting players have been acquired in a series of recognizable transactions Notable among these has been th e acquisition of Verio by NTT and the acquisition of Digex by WorldCom W ithin the remaining players in the IT hosting industry remaining players h ave been devastated by the decline in valuations accorded based on consist ently increasing earnings deficits and increased cost of services provided In addition these players have suffered due to aggressive acquisition st rategies undertaken during the previous two years that have not proven out as significant growth catalysts and increased debt structures By contrast HYPD has pursued a conservative growth strategy with limited acquisitions carefully calculated to directly and immediately benefit aggregate revenue s and earnings Relative to comparative companies within the ITSP industry HYPD could realize superior growth in business and earnings over the near tointermediate term period A grouping of comparable companies within th is sector currently trades at an average price to sales multiple of X On a forward looking basis using FY revenue and earnings estimates for the Company fiscal year starts July this represents roug hly a fold premium to current trading levels Thus when applying the co mparative groupings average price to earnings and price to revenue multipl es to HYPD we can arrive at a relative valuation of per share over th e next months SUMMARY Aggressive investors looking for aboveaver age return potential on a portion of their investment capital should give H YPD a serious look Management of the Company headed by CEO Kent Watts a re highly talented and educated in their technical areas We believe HYPD has assembled an astute goal oriented sophisticated team committed to HYP D becoming very very successful Investors at current levels may be rewar ded in the short term and beyond as HYPDS business plan is executed HY PD may very well be one of the stock markets best secrets IMAGE Di sclaimer IMAGE StockInfoKing SIK publishes reports
