Committee FROM Jim Steffes Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair Bob Reilley Power Marketers Working Group Chair Scott Weiner Legislative Affairs Committee Chair Mark Bennett Senior Manager of Policy Donn Salvosa Manager of Government Affairs DATE August RE Reliability Legislation We are providing you with this memo to provide some information and perspective on the important issues relating to federal legislation in advance of our August th joint Regulatory Affairs and Legislative Affairs meeting on reliability legislation Reliability Legislation S S sponsored by Sen Slade Gorton RWA was approved by the Senate in the last Congress The House of Representatives did not act on the bill S represents the only consensus bill to be approved by either chamber This legislation would establish a national electric reliability organization ERO with the authority to establish and enforce mandatory reliability standards FERC would have primary jurisdiction over the electric reliability organization ERO all Affiliated Regional Reliability Entities entities to which authority would be delegated to enforce compliance with reliability standards all system operators and all users of the bulkpower system The bill prescribes procedural guidelines for FERC approval of applications competing for status as the ERO and ERO standards It would also require all users of the transmission system to comply with such standards What causes us some concern are a number of provisions in the legislation that would delegate authority to different entities The bill would Allow the ERO subject to FERC approval to delegate authority to a requesting regional entity to implement and enforce compliance with standards Include a broad savings clause which preserves state authority to ensure the safety adequacy and reliability of electric service within each state Not ensure that the boundaries of ARREs and RTOs are the same although it would instruct ARREs to cooperate with RTOs to ensure enforcement of standards A similar bill HR was introduced in the House last session by Rep Albert Wynn DMD No action was taken on this bill The same language is included in the comprehensive energy bill introduced by Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman DNM Other Developments Last year in response to failed attempts by the Congress to pass comprehensive electricity legislation a number of groups headed by NERC sent a letter to House Speaker J Dennis Hastert RIL calling for the passage of stand alone reliability legislation The letter is attached A number of groups including public power groups the California ISO Edison Electric Institute NARUC and the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association all signed the letter EPSA was strongly pressured to sign the letter to add more weight and credibility to the effort However we did not sign the letter While we stated that we did not oppose the letter EPSAs position at the time was the advocacy for comprehensive federal legislation Last month a number of groups with interests in reliability legislation met in Washington in an attempt to forge an agreement on legislation that can be supported by industry stakeholders Efforts were made to shorten the existing legislation similar to the bill introduced by Rep Albert Wynn without changing the intent of provisions in the language In addition to EPSA other groups in attendance included NARUC the Pennsylvania PUC Entergy PJM Public Power Groups Consumer Groups ELCON Mirant and Enron The meeting produced a realization among the participants on the wide difference of opinions on how best to proceed The state PUCs lobbied for a continued state role in reliability language Entergy supported the original language contained in the Bingaman bill Still a number of other groups favored the shorter PJM version PJM Proposal PJM recently circulated condensed reliability language The page bill would give enforcement authority to FERC If you would like a copy faxed to you please contact Michael Reddy at EPSA Additionally FERC would establish reliability standards and will maintain primary jurisdiction FERC would designate a national reliability entity composed of a number of regional entities for the purpose of developing reliability standards for the transmission system Some concerns over the PJM language include Formation of regional entities that would be a bottoms up organization These entities would have no regard to how they conform with RTOs Reliability standards would be developed as voluntary consensus standards The regions and the national entity would be on equal ground Revised NERC language Just last Thursday NERC convened another meeting for the purposes of attempting to shorten the original NERC language Working off of the language found in the Wynn bill the new language was shortened to pages The redlined version is attached Among the noteworthy changes p applications for approval to become the ERO strikes language to specify funding mechanisms and requirements p changes in filings of funding and funding procedures language deleted on specifics on changes to funding p additional language added to state that neither the ERO nor FERC will have the authority to order construction of additional generation or transmission if it determines a need p language on coordination with RTOs deleted Status and Prospects of Legislation The Republican House and the leadership of the House Energy and Commerce Committee chaired by Rep WJ Billy Tauzin RLA and Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality Chairman Joe Barton RTX has maintained the position that electricity should be addressed in a comprehensive fashion This is a continuation of the position held by Former House Commerce Chairman Tom Bliley RVA Staff for Chairman Tauzin are in the process of developing electricity provisions during the August recess It is likely that one of the titles will be on reliability The Senate with its recent switch in control remains uncertain on the overall view of stand alone reliability legislation In its present version Senate Energy Chairman Bingamans bill contains the same reliability provisions found in the Wynn bill Chairman Bingaman also plans to markup legislation in the Fall RegulatoryNERCGISB Developments While the timing and details of reliability legislation remain uncertain NERC has continued its effort to transition to NAERO When first envisioned several years ago the legislative objective was to establish NAERO as a selfregulatory organization with authority to enforce mandatory reliability standards Legislative delays however led the NERC Board to take unilateral steps to advance the transition beginning with its governance structure Last February the member board was replaced by a new board of ten independent board members Members of the former board then were reconstituted as the new Stakeholder Committee with an advisory role in addition to authority to participate in funding board member changes and a few other general matters Also the board implemented a compliance program based upon contracts to be executed by the Regional Reliability Councils Funding for NERC presently administered by the regions remains an extremely problematic open question as is the continued dominance of transmission providers in the current NERC Standing Committee voting structure The GISB proposal to include a wholesale electric quadrant in the new Energy Industry Standards Board EISB has provided an alternative that didnt exist at the time the NAERO concept and related legislative effort began The EISB model which would combine the development of gas and electric retail and wholesale standards initially viewed as a remote prospect when it was floated in early has gained substantial momentum During FERCs June th technical conference on Function and interregional coordination the Commissioners compared the circumstances in the gas industry that led to the formation of GISB with those of the electric industry today In separate letters to GISB Executive Director Rae McQuade dated August th Commissioners Massey Wood and Brownell observed the need to develop uniform rules and standards and expressed enthusiastic support for a new EISB to do it Those letters were distributed during an industry conference hosted by the Department of Energy DOE on August th further contributing to the credibility of the EISB proposal Meanwhile the pressure that the EISB proposal is generating clearly appears to have become part of the overall context for NERCs reform effort as well as the reliability legislation A task force set up by the NERC Stakeholder Committee is reviewing how to make the three Standing Committees more open and inclusive including possible recommendations to change the voting structure from the current transmission providertransmission customer to a sector approach The NERC board may receive those recommendations and other possible NERC reforms including a new Organization Standards Process when it meets in October The effort to launch an EISB is expected to come to a head when the GISB board meets on September th There are indications that the board will approve going forward with the proposal Such action would considerably raise the stakes for the NERC board and present challenging issues regarding how to set up the voting sectors within the wholesale electric quadrant Additionally the industry will need to consider how to more precisely define the types of standards the new organization would develop The emergence of a new EISB if it occurs could potentially diverge from legislation that presumes that NERCNAERO will be the only standard setting organization Granting a new NAERO authority over reliability will beg serious questions regarding its scope of activities and create the specter of multiple organizations that many hope to avoid

Committee FROM Jim Steffes Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair Bob Reilley Power Marketers Working Group Chair Scott Weiner Legislative Affairs Committee Chair Mark Bennett Senior Manager of Policy Donn Salvosa Manager of Government Affairs DATE August RE Reliability Legislation We are providing you with this memo to provide some information and perspective on the important issues relating to federal legislation in advance of our August th joint Regulatory Affairs and Legislative Affairs meeting on reliability legislation Reliability Legislation S S sponsored by Sen Slade Gorton RWA was approved by the Senate in the last Congress The House of Representatives did not act on the bill S represents the only consensus bill to be approved by either chamber This legislation would establish a national electric reliability organization ERO with the authority to establish and enforce mandatory reliability standards FERC would have primary jurisdiction over the electric reliability organization ERO all Affiliated Regional Reliability Entities entities to which authority would be delegated to enforce compliance with reliability standards all system operators and all users of the bulkpower system The bill prescribes procedural guidelines for FERC approval of applications competing for status as the ERO and ERO standards It would also require all users of the transmission system to comply with such standards What causes us some concern are a number of provisions in the legislation that would delegate authority to different entities The bill would Allow the ERO subject to FERC approval to delegate authority to a requesting regional entity to implement and enforce compliance with standards Include a broad savings clause which preserves state authority to ensure the safety adequacy and reliability of electric service within each state Not ensure that the boundaries of ARREs and RTOs are the same although it would instruct ARREs to cooperate with RTOs to ensure enforcement of standards A similar bill HR was introduced in the House last session by Rep Albert Wynn DMD No action was taken on this bill The same language is included in the comprehensive energy bill introduced by Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman DNM Other Developments Last year in response to failed attempts by the Congress to pass comprehensive electricity legislation a number of groups headed by NERC sent a letter to House Speaker J Dennis Hastert RIL calling for the passage of stand alone reliability legislation The letter is attached A number of groups including public power groups the California ISO Edison Electric Institute NARUC and the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association all signed the letter EPSA was strongly pressured to sign the letter to add more weight and credibility to the effort However we did not sign the letter While we stated that we did not oppose the letter EPSAs position at the time was the advocacy for comprehensive federal legislation Last month a number of groups with interests in reliability legislation met in Washington in an attempt to forge an agreement on legislation that can be supported by industry stakeholders Efforts were made to shorten the existing legislation similar to the bill introduced by Rep Albert Wynn without changing the intent of provisions in the language In addition to EPSA other groups in attendance included NARUC the Pennsylvania PUC Entergy PJM Public Power Groups Consumer Groups ELCON Mirant and Enron The meeting produced a realization among the participants on the wide difference of opinions on how best to proceed The state PUCs lobbied for a continued state role in reliability language Entergy supported the original language contained in the Bingaman bill Still a number of other groups favored the shorter PJM version PJM Proposal PJM recently circulated condensed reliability language The page bill would give enforcement authority to FERC If you would like a copy faxed to you please contact Michael Reddy at EPSA Additionally FERC would establish reliability standards and will maintain primary jurisdiction FERC would designate a national reliability entity composed of a number of regional entities for the purpose of developing reliability standards for the transmission system Some concerns over the PJM language include Formation of regional entities that would be a bottoms up organization These entities would have no regard to how they conform with RTOs Reliability standards would be developed as voluntary consensus standards The regions and the national entity would be on equal ground Revised NERC language Just last Thursday NERC convened another meeting for the purposes of attempting to shorten the original NERC language Working off of the language found in the Wynn bill the new language was shortened to pages The redlined version is attached Among the noteworthy changes p applications for approval to become the ERO strikes language to specify funding mechanisms and requirements p changes in filings of funding and funding procedures language deleted on specifics on changes to funding p additional language added to state that neither the ERO nor FERC will have the authority to order construction of additional generation or transmission if it determines a need p language on coordination with RTOs deleted Status and Prospects of Legislation The Republican House and the leadership of the House Energy and Commerce Committee chaired by Rep WJ Billy Tauzin RLA and Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality Chairman Joe Barton RTX has maintained the position that electricity should be addressed in a comprehensive fashion This is a continuation of the position held by Former House Commerce Chairman Tom Bliley RVA Staff for Chairman Tauzin are in the process of developing electricity provisions during the August recess It is likely that one of the titles will be on reliability The Senate with its recent switch in control remains uncertain on the overall view of stand alone reliability legislation In its present version Senate Energy Chairman Bingamans bill contains the same reliability provisions found in the Wynn bill Chairman Bingaman also plans to markup legislation in the Fall RegulatoryNERCGISB Developments While the timing and details of reliability legislation remain uncertain NERC has continued its effort to transition to NAERO When first envisioned several years ago the legislative objective was to establish NAERO as a selfregulatory organization with authority to enforce mandatory reliability standards Legislative delays however led the NERC Board to take unilateral steps to advance the transition beginning with its governance structure Last February the member board was replaced by a new board of ten independent board members Members of the former board then were reconstituted as the new Stakeholder Committee with an advisory role in addition to authority to participate in funding board member changes and a few other general matters Also the board implemented a compliance program based upon contracts to be executed by the Regional Reliability Councils Funding for NERC presently administered by the regions remains an extremely problematic open question as is the continued dominance of transmission providers in the current NERC Standing Committee voting structure The GISB proposal to include a wholesale electric quadrant in the new Energy Industry Standards Board EISB has provided an alternative that didnt exist at the time the NAERO concept and related legislative effort began The EISB model which would combine the development of gas and electric retail and wholesale standards initially viewed as a remote prospect when it was floated in early has gained substantial momentum During FERCs June th technical conference on Function and interregional coordination the Commissioners compared the circumstances in the gas industry that led to the formation of GISB with those of the electric industry today In separate letters to GISB Executive Director Rae McQuade dated August th Commissioners Massey Wood and Brownell observed the need to develop uniform rules and standards and expressed enthusiastic support for a new EISB to do it Those letters were distributed during an industry conference hosted by the Department of Energy DOE on August th further contributing to the credibility of the EISB proposal Meanwhile the pressure that the EISB proposal is generating clearly appears to have become part of the overall context for NERCs reform effort as well as the reliability legislation A task force set up by the NERC Stakeholder Committee is reviewing how to make the three Standing Committees more open and inclusive including possible recommendations to change the voting structure from the current transmission providertransmission customer to a sector approach The NERC board may receive those recommendations and other possible NERC reforms including a new Organization Standards Process when it meets in October The effort to launch an EISB is expected to come to a head when the GISB board meets on September th There are indications that the board will approve going forward with the proposal Such action would considerably raise the stakes for the NERC board and present challenging issues regarding how to set up the voting sectors within the wholesale electric quadrant Additionally the industry will need to consider how to more precisely define the types of standards the new organization would develop The emergence of a new EISB if it occurs could potentially diverge from legislation that presumes that NERCNAERO will be the only standard setting organization Granting a new NAERO authority over reliability will beg serious questions regarding its scope of activities and create the specter of multiple organizations that many hope to avoid Hastert Letter Final
