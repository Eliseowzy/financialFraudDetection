to months from Philadelphia FRB Survey for October Up from Industrial Production in Oct fell Capacity Utilization down to from Sept level of October Consumer Prices down Core Rate Without Volatile Food Energy Costs rose As expected Longer term readers know that we have long believed that given the wherewithal and the confidence the American consumer will spend Lately the confidence factor has been shaken somewhat but now appears to be stabilizing And even though the labor markets have weakened income growth is still good So the consumer did what we hoped for and to a lessened extent expected they spent big time in October We knew the overall retail sales number would be big as in a prior newsletter we had pointed out the incredible annualized rate of auto sales driven by financing And of course auto sales are a big part of overall retail sales What we didnt know but were impressed by was the solid gain in retail sales ex autos The important point here is simply that going into the all important holiday selling season consumers were willing to spend at a pretty good clip This has nothing to do with cheap financing and bodes well for fourth quarter retail sales an important driver of two thirds of economic activity The downside to the October burst of auto sales and the announced plans to continue cheap financing through year end is simply that sales are being stolen from early next year At some point it would seem relatively obvious that production will have to slow which would slow a recovery or stretch out the time frame of a period of sub par growth But at the moment our preference is for the recession not to deepen rather than worry too much about the slope of the recovery The jobless claims number has also continued to improve We are not trying to make the case that unemployment wont go up it will But the pace of new layoffs is at least not accelerating and could be stabilizing So another bit of good news There was also a very significant at least in my opinion bit of news that was a page one story for Investors Business Daily to their credit The headline was Greenspan Is Upbeat on Productivity Sees Best Of Tech Boom Still Ahead Greenspan also talked about energy and the need for more nuclear power but my immediate focus is the productivity issue Again longer term readers know that we were very pleased with recent productivity data and thought that as a recovery unfolds productivity growth should move up But Chairman Greenspans views are what count and for the moment it doesnt much matter whether he is right What matters is what Chairman Greenspan believes and the policy implications The news is good Simply put given his belief that productivity growth will accelerate the FOMC will be much less likely to raise rates sharply as the recovery begins to gain strength say the middle of next year This is not to say they wont raise rates but it does seem likely that they wont be aggressive to the upside as they have been to the downside Good news for investors at least in the intermediate term For it to be good news longer term Chairman Greenspan has to be right and productivity growth must accelerate to allay our concern about a potential buildup of inflationary pressures as the recovery strengthens At the moment we will be content with a recovery taking hold this Spring It still seems like the best bet given the

Market Highlights Change SP Dow Jones NASD Comp Russell SOX Index Value Line MS Growth MS Cyclical T Bill BP Long Bond BP Gold OzNear Month Silver OzNear Month Economic News Not Much News Last Week What There Was Was Very Positive Also FRB Officials And Chairman Greenspan Now More Upbeat Best Bet No Rate Cut Removal Of Bias Spring Recovery December Leading Economic Indicators rose Subcomponents also solid Jobless Claims fell to Four Week Moving Average fell to Existing Home Sales eased in December Full Year though was a record and unsold inventory falls Regular readers should already know that we were quite happy with last weeks reports Not only were the economic reports very supportive of our long held outlook for a recovery to be underway by Spring but we even had a few powerful conversions to our way of thinking various members of the FRB and Chairman Greenspan himself Lets hope theyre right this time On Monday when the markets were closed various Federal Reserve Board FRB officials were reported by the Wall Street Journal to have downplayed the negativity of earlier remarks Then on Thursday Chairman Greenspan in Congressional testimony noted that some of the forces that have been restraining the economy over the past year are starting to diminish and that activity is beginning to firm Thats about a degree turn in a short period of time from his significant risks remarks that we noted a few issues ago It is not that his views of the economy have changed that much at least in my opinion as I think he was genuinely surprised at the interpretation of his remarks as we were at the time We actually thought his speech positive in terms of his comments on productivity growth But most market participants focused on the short term negatives not the long term positives Chairman Greenspans efforts on Thursday should help to redirect the focus One other point worth noting is that he also tried to dampen the expectations for the recovery as we have Again during his Congressional testimony he noted that although household spending should continue to trend up the potential for significant acceleration in activity in this sector is more limited Simply put if the consumer sector doesnt pop and it drives two thirds of economic activity then logically the recovery wont be too sharp But as we have pointed out before such a scenario can be quite positive for financial assets Last weeks important actual reports jobless claims and leading indicators were both very positive Leading indicators advanced for the third consecutive month and importantly at an accelera ting rate In addition subcomponents were also supportive of an economic recovery beginning soon if it is not already underway The jobless claims report although there were revisions to the prior week was also quite good Claims are again falling but perhaps more importantly they are now at a level below September th The clear implication is that the labor markets are stabilizing a fact that will not be lost on the FOMC when they meet Whereas last week we had noted that we didnt think another rate cut was necessary but that the FOMC could take out an insurance policy it now seems quite likely that the FOMC is finished lowering rates for this cycle In addition while they may leave the bias toward lover rates in place our best bet is that the bias is removed Given the strength of the leading indicators it would seem like tortured logic to try to argue that the significant risks that Chairman Greenspan discussed only two weeks ago actually exist Clearly then our view hasnt changed we still expect an economic recovery to be underway by Spring and we expect the bounceback to be less than the consensus expects Well see if were right soon enough But if we are the logical extension for market participants is that cyclical stories will disappoint For now were just happy enough having the FRB on our side as the long term implications are quite positive

Russell SOX Index Value Line MS Growth MS Cyclical T Bill BP Long Bond BP Gold OzNear Month Silver OzNear Month Economic News Last Weeks Reports Very Solid With One Exception FRBs Beige Book Mixed But Some Signs Of Hope Our View More Optimistic Recovery Underway By Spring December Retail Sales eased Good News See Below Consumer Price Index fell in December Core Rate Ex Volatile Food and Energy rose

Average fell to International Trade deficit for November narrows Univ of Michigan Consumer Sentiment mid month Big gain from Decembers Although stock market participants focused on individual earnings releases as the official earnings season got underway our focus remained on the economic news And the reports were fairly good and continue to support our view of a recovery in progress by Spring For starters the Retail Sales report was very good even though the reported number was a decline of The drop was fueled pun intended by a decline in gasoline sales which fell as energy prices fell which also drove the trade deficit down But obviously a decline in gasoline prices is not a negative for consumers As we have pointed out numerous times recently the decline in energy prices has the same economic impact as a reasonable tax cut Not surprisingly then we liked the retail sales data The implication is that inventories will not be a problem at the retail level after the holiday selling season And of course the strength does support our contention that spending is driven by personal income which continues to hold up very well and consumer confidence which was quite strong at midmonth according to the Univ of Michigan survey The FRB Beige Book Survey agrees sort of at least for retail sales Otherwise they are not so sure but seem to imply that they think the economy is bottoming out with any hints at recovery very tentative More so than is usual even for the FRB this report seems to steer clear of making any definitive statements In addition to the fact that economic inflection points are very very difficult to identify in real time the FRB may be trying to keep their options open for the next meeting of the rate setting Federal Open Market Committee FOMC As you know our view is that another quarter of one point cut is not necessary but the FOMC may take out an insurance policy In any case as we tried to make clear last week the really important issue is the extent of the rebound in productivity growth and not the exact timing of the onset of recovery One other point worth noting from the more obscure Philadelphia Federal Reserve Banks Business Outlook Survey is that their midAtlantic manufacturing index turned positive And the new orders subcomponent went positive as well moving from to with the shipments subcomponent even stronger Anecdotal evidence yes But directionally important and the magnitude of the change would imply no huge revisions back to negative territory near term In any case we believe that by Spring a recovery will be underway And our view remains that the bounce back will be softer than what some are assuming and could therefore be disappointing to those that are buying stocks that are dependent on the economic cycle But even GDP growth should be positive for financial assets in general and if the FRB is right about productivity trends they will allow higher trendline growth than in the past In short nothing in the economic data or the early corporate earnings reports for that matter has caused us to alter our view We expect a recovery to be underway shortly if it has not already begun and to accelerate in the second half Last week the economy outperformed the stock market But the stock market should revert to form as a discounting mechanism And when it does it will look to the recovery and not the history of the just ended quarter Stay tuned Current Weekly Calendar of Economic Data Monday MARTIN LUTHER KING DAY US MARKETS CLOSED Tuesday Leading Indicators Wednesday Thursday Jobless Claims

market participants became converts last week particularly given the strength in the Institute of Supply Managements Index formerly known as the National Purchasing Managers Index And the stock market responded positively For us though the issue is now the slope of the recovery which has important market implications at least in our opinion Assuming no serious exogenous event our best bet is for the resumption of modest economic growth beginning with a slightly positive first quarter and accelerating as the year progresses to somewhat over We would be pleased if that scenario plays out but others wont as they are expecting a faster recovery and a stronger second half And the disappointment would likely fall hardest on those economically sensitive stocks which have been bid up most recently Our rationale starts with the obvious the recession and we are assuming it is about over so we will use the past tense was short and shallow Short and shallow leaves less room for a snap back as consumer spending really did hold up very well last year And as you all know the consumer drives approximately two thirds of economic activity While it had appeared that the labor markets were improving nicely and even though the latest Labor Department Report was better than expected the recent softness in the jobless claims report implies that labor markets will not recover quickly This is not terribly surprising as the labor markets lag economic activity but it does support our view that the early stages of recovery will likely be modest Further out the role of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee FOMC becomes important Their next meeting is at the end of the month but given what we know now it would be very unlikely to have a further rate cut Best bet now is no change and removal of the easing bias But the real issue is how quickly they raise rates given the unprecedented reduction over the past year Recently there has been some dissension at the FOMC Some members believe they have moved too far too fast so they will be looking to take back some of the cuts quite quickly Chairman Greenspan though will likely be more tolerant given his strongly held belief that productivity improvements are real and sustainable Complicating the issue still further is that voting members have changed At the moment our view is that they will move fairly quickly to nudge rates slightly higher to maintain their image as foes of inflation particularly if the reported inflation numbers tick up or productivity figures deteriorate If we are right that might bother the markets some but the economic impact of moving rates up from such low levels should be minimal The real problem would arise if the appearance was that a series of rate increases would push short rates above For now not a concern But going forward an issue Simply put inflation is bad very bad for financial assets The latest yearoveryear increase in average hourly earnings was But that is at the end of a recession so wage pressures will likely build Hopefully Greenspan is right and productivity can improve at a rate reducing the inflationary threat significantly My intent is not to be alarmist as the stock market and economy recover However for the end of a recession not only are wage pressures real but stock market valuations using the FRBs own model at year end were slightly overvalued already

Economic Reports Last Week Were Uniformly Positive Nice Ending For Bodes Well For Recovery Spring Recovery More And More Likely A Good Bet November Durable Goods Orders fell Ex volatile transportation

See Below Last weeks economic reports were uniformly positive and given that a few of them are truly forward looking the implications for are getting better and better When combined with the prior weeks reports we are becoming more and more confident barring an exogenous event that an economic recovery will be underway by Spring Perhaps Ed Hyman is right it may have already begun Longer term readers know that we place a lot of importance on the outlook for the consumer given that consumer spending drives approximately two thirds of Gross Domestic Product GDP Naturally we were particularly pleased then that the Conference Board Consumer Confidence Survey confirmed the nice gain in the Univ of Michigan Sentiment Index that we reported last week However there is a but The but is the disconnect between the sharp increases in sentiment and the soft holiday selling season True there was a late inning rally and yes a major discounter reported recent weekly sales at the top end of their target but the overall selling season was sloppy and driven by price One rationale might be that consumers are somewhat concerned about the labor market given the rise in the unemployment rate and the recent lackluster gains in personal income To us this would be a plausible explanation and implies that sluggishness will continue for a while longer However the Durable Goods report without the volatile transportation sector has now improved for two consecutive months not eternity by any standard but it does imply that the pressure on the beleaguered manufacturing sector is ending If so then there will be a lagged response favorably impacting both jobs and income While the housing market was also strong we again caution that in our view the strength is overstated given Novembers warm weather Simply put more people can shop for a house in nice weather than poor weather More shoppers low rates equals more sales Simple as that But still there are some positive implications as the supply of new homes on the market is the smallest in almost a year Overall then a pretty good ending to And as you know our view is for a recovery to be underway by Spring But the war against terrorism is not over and may in fact be expanded and even without an exogenous event the slope of the recovery is far from certain So enjoy the New Year Holiday as we look forward to Stay tuned

long term subscribers know we have been more upbeat than most in our economic outlook Now the recession has disappeared and the Dow Jones Industrial Average has exceeded the Nikkei What more could one ask for We had always believed that prior to September th a recession would have been avoided but we were hoping that the Dow would exceed the Nikkei at somewhat higher levels All kidding aside though last week was positive To almost everyones surprise th Qtr GDP was positive but barely so So for the record at least until the revisions are released GDP growth by quarter was That doesnt officially qualify as a recession but there certainly was a profits recession and thats what counts Nonetheless there is a message in the data Specifically if such a mild recession can cause such a severe erosion in corporate profits the flipside should be that leverage works both ways In other words as the economy recovers profits could surprise on the upside even as we believe overall economic growth will disappoint by snapping back less than consensus Although the th qtr GDP number was driven by consumer spending the personal income data imply that the consumer should not hunker down The gain was the best since December of last year and with auto companies already announcing deals the price sensitive shopping trends should continue The other noteworthy item in the GDP report was the huge drop in inventories and yet overall GDP was still positive With consumer spending likely to be maintained it seems highly likely that the inventory correction is over and that production will have to increase in the near future In fact some of the lead reports already imply that is the case say the new orders component of the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index The Labor Department Report was also a positive surprise However at year end there are a lot of cross currents in the numbers so we wouldnt read too much into the decline in the unemployment rate Nonetheless it could have some psychological significance and help maintain the more upbeat tone of consumer confidence And finally there is the Federal Open Market Committee FOMC and their decision to leave rates unchanged but to maintain their bias toward lower rates As you know we expected the former but thought they would remove the bias given the rise in consumer confidence and the three consecutive monthly gains in the leading indicators series It appears that they are trying to micro manage expectations as the bias is clearly not needed My point is simply that Chairman Greenspan appears to be becoming increasingly sensitive to financial market reactions to the FRBs actions of any kind He went out of his way to correct the negative impression we would argue misinterpretation of one of his speeches Our view now is that he wanted to leave the bias in place to drive home his view and ours that the recovery will not be sharp And of course at a subsequent meeting they can remove the bias to reinforce perceptions of recovery We think such an approach is a tad too cute but probably harmless Overall we obviously continue to like the economic data It supports our view of a recovery by Spring if one hasnt already begun Under such a scenario earnings estimates should at least hold taking pressure off the stock market Well see but at the moment we like the riskreward ratio Current Weekly Calendar of Economic

Quarter Gross Domestic Product GDP Quite Good Accelerates From Fourth Quarter Recession Now Unlikely Our View Still For Recovery In Second Half April Consumer Confidence fell to Durable Goods Orders

to Largest Weekly increase since October Employment Cost Index rose in st Qtr Up yearoveryear An acceleration from th Qtr st Qtr GDP rose An acceleration from th Qtr Personal Consumption Price Index at rate Up From th Qtr rate of Univ of Michigan Consumer Sentiment fell to from end Of March level of But slight bounce from midmonth It does seem too early to declare victory for the Federal Reserve Boards monetary policy but the odds of a recession have been seriously reduced given the quite positive first quarter GDP report Clearly the initial report is subject to large revisions but a revision into negative territory would be a stretch Therefore an official recession would require negative growth in the second and third quarters an unlikely outcome in our view given prior interest rate cuts and a more stimulative fiscal policy Thats the good news The bad news is that the same GDP report noted a pickup in inflationary pressures as the personal consumption price index accelerated quite markedly from the fourth quarter rate In addition the Federal Open Market Committee FOMC also pays quite a bit of attention to the Employment Cost Index ECI which rose at a yearoveryear rate for the first quarter It is these types of pressures that we had in mind when we noted last week that the FOMCs intermeeting move contained some risks One other point worth noting is that the Money Supply has been growing at an extremely rapid rate In this day and age not many folks pay attention to the money supply data like they used to but the liquidity being supplied by the FRB is significant Clearly the pace can slow but my point is that they are pulling out all the stops to avert a recession and appear to have succeeded But in my view not without incurring some risk that inflationary pressures will accelerate In other words it is not a given that the FOMC will lower rates by a half point or at all at their May meeting Whether they do or not and if so to what extent will now depend upon forthcoming reports particularly those providing price information such as this coming Fridays Labor Department Report And there is the potential for a positive report First jobless claims have clearly been on a strong uptrend so it almost doesnt matter the specific date the survey was taken there should be an underlying bias toward continued softness And second beginning of the year price pressures should be outoftheway In other words pay raises that kick in at the first of the year making comparisons more difficult should no longer distort the data Hopefully then average hourly earnings will not break out of their recent band taking some pressure off the FOMC Going forward the slide in consumer confidence and the likely continuing rise in the unemployment rate should mitigate wage demands And of course if the economy does reaccelerate then the FOMC will be more likely to use a higher assumption for productivity growth so they will tolerate higher wage growth before being concerned about inflationary pressures Simply put we do not want to be alarmist but we do want to make certain that given all the recession talk investors understand that we have not entered a risk free nirvana The FOMC has been very very aggressive in trying to avoid a recession They appear to have succeeded If we have a non V recovery still the best bet then inflationary pressures should be contained Our concern is that if we and virtually everyone else are wrong and the recovery is sharp then inflationary pressures could build Stay tuned the all clear signal has not
