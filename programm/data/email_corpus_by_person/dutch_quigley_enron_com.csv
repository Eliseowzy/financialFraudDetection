Reynolds Subject Re Franchise Players and the Draft Actually the draft order was determined by a vote and is not subject to changethis year anyway The idea behind it was to not let someone keep a franchise player generally one of the top players overall and then receive possibly the fifteenth pick overall in the draftthus getting a top player and the number one pick in the next round while someone that does not keep a franchise player in theory could get the last pick of the supplemental round and the last pick of the first round number player and the th playertoo much of a penalty to

Draft The snake thing is good and bad But I think the first round should be randomly selected for ALL teams because the current way gives those not keeping a franchise player a double benefit by picking in the supplemental and then also at the top of the first round Theoretically the non keeper teams are getting the best players who are arguably also franchise players In effect by not keeping a player you are randomly selecting a lower level franchise player So they shouldnt get the an automatic shot at or whatever it might be as well So snake or no snake all of round one should be random

together Tuesday afternoon of our counterparties are writing letters of complaint heres a sample of some of the quotes we have heard from the counterparties we have added in the last months I shouldnt have to spend my time decomposing the invoices and confirmations you send out It has been days since we traded and we havent received a shred of paper to give us the details of the trade We are being told in a confirm something different than we are being invoiced for We did not trade contracts per day it was per month do you guys even think before you type I am a CFO and an accountant and I cant decipher what you are trying to confirm here From a business dinner where a client of ours was speaking casually to large industrials and endusers One upon the mentioning of BB exchanges said they WILL NOT ever trade on EOL again because the backoffice procedure was such a nightmare they couldnt rely on the accuracy or timeliness of the confirm This was a captive client who and needs to trade who will not show us their flow again The latest is the most disturbing we just want to do a small trade to test your system We have heard it is a nightmare but want to see for ourselves I mean how difficult can it be to book the purchase of lots of crude And still days later they do not have one paper to show the details not one phone call to confirm the tradenothing We even warned the BO that this was a new customer and to make best eforts to make sure the process runs smoothly and efficiently Well clearly we failed We do not understand what is going on in the back office Is it that they are too disconnected from our daily operations to understand how integral their accurracy is to our business Is there too much turnover How are they trained Who is in charge of the backoffice There seems to be a different manager for every step of the process who coordinates all their efforts Does anyone care Ok Ill stop For our part we have Michelle coming up to NY for a week in December we wanted this to happen as soon as she started but did not work for her We have to stop this before we lose clients which we will All the problems are being caused by the following Our inability to generate an accurate position report for our clients This has already cost us money this year Our clients do trades a day they are constantly in and out of positions it is imperative that we get these right As well this report is our ONLY check to make sure deals are entered and entered correctly into the system There are hundreds of books at Enron We have postions on with dozens of them We currenttly do not have an automated mechanism to pull deals from every book in one shot We have to select books one by one this method will always result in books being ommmitted given our deal flow Michelle is in charge of this process We need a IT person on this yesterday Michelle is spending most of her day verifying the validity of the report she generates Robyn Russell and I check it everyday there are always mistakes There is a breakdown in the backoffice functions after Michelle collects the tickets we write and verbally confirms them There is no check after they have been imput There are ALWAYS imput errors Michelle needs to check every deal after its entered into the system going forward We also have NO set procedures for the bookings of deals We have no idea where our job ends and the book admins starts for non standard deals like gas dailies and swaptions we need to know the exact process from start to finish a Confirms are sent immediately after deals are entered what if deals are imput incorrectly the confirm goes out anyway resulting in mass confusion at the client Going forward confirms need to be delayed until we can confirm that everything about the deal is correct b Invoicing there have been dozens of occassions where the amounts we are invoicing do not match the deals done EOL We are pushing hard to get counterparties on here we have signed Renaissance up a B program fund but I shudder to see how EOL will fair at these tasks Credit All of our clients are margined If deals are in the system incorrectly the wrong MTM goes to the client another mismatch We work closely with credit since we need to collect initial margin from some clients this amount changes daily we need someone who can get on the phone with clients and explain these numbers through again we are doing this now

October AM ToQuigley Dutch SubjectReduction of trading lines by Fimat Dutch there is a mess with Fimat and since you used to run Johns book an d may see something in this situation I do not I wondered if you could giv e me any feedback in this before I send it to Deffner Thanks Sarah On Tuesday Oct Warren Tashnek Fimat Houston and Steve Forman Fimat NY telephoned me to inform Enron that Fimat cut its trading lines from million to million for Enron This cut is irrespective of the mil lion credit limit we have from Soc Gen for the margin line Soc Gen is th e bank that owns Fimat brokerage Fimat made this decision based on the f ollowing events according to Steve Thursday ENE positions were expitted from ABN to Fimat The positions came from exi sting positions at ABN JP Morgan SSB and Goldman Sachs Generally broker s agree how to handle expitting of trades including the transfer of cash as sociated with the moving of the trades Specifically a major issue evolved with ABN and Fimat In this case Fimat agreed with ABN to transfer the trades at the trade price and then rebook them at the trade price There was a million variation margin associat ed with this transfer of trades at the trade price which ABN agreed to send on Friday to Fimat Since Fimat agreed to accept the trades at the trade price Fimat was exposed in the event that ABN did not send the million on Friday If Fimat had agreed to transfer the trades at the settlement r ate instead of the trade price then Fimat would not have been exposed for million in variation margin on Thursday night Friday On Friday Fimat did not receive its million from ABN as agreed When Fimat called ABN ABN told Fimat that ENE called ABN and instructed ABN to send the money directly to ENE This left Fimat exposed for million on behalf of Enron On Friday morning Fimat brokerage statements showed that ENE was owed million by Fimat Fimat sent million to Soc Gen to pay down the Soc G en margin line for Enron This left million available for ENE but Fima t wanted its million This led to confusion between Enron and Fimat On Friday there was a conversation between Fimat NY and Fimat Montreal F imat Montreal asked Fimat NY to take positions on behalf of ENE The numbe r of positions and the variation margin associated with these positions wer e undisclosed Very late on Friday HSBC tried to transfer Canadian positions to Fimat Can ada without an account for Enron at Fimat Canada Based in the bad press on Enron and the gossip in the financial community r ight now Fimat NY told Fimat Montreal to refuse the transfer Fimat wants to know why Enron is expitting trades from bigger brokerage hou ses that have increased risk allocations fro Enron Fimat is uncomfortable with these events Monday Fimat decides it wants an explanation from Enron Fimat wants to reassess the brokerage statements and double check both the amount of money transfer red to them and also the positions transferred Fimat informed Enron that it would not move money based on brokerage statements alone Fimat would n ot confirm to Enron what amounts of money should actually move until later in the day This does not work for Enron as we must inform our Treasure by am as to what cash transfers will occur Under our current loan agre ement with Soc Gen Fimat informs Soc Gen by noon if money should mov e so Fimat is changing its way of doing business with Enron based on its di scomfort with ENE as a counter party Tuesday positions were expitted to Fimat to offset the gas positions from ABN Fimat proposed solutions million Tbill posted to Fimat as collateral on ENE behalf Guarantee to Fimat with respect to trading from ENE although ENE has alrea dy posted guarantee to Soc Gen for margin line ENE to convince Soc Gen to guarantee to Fimat that Soc Gen will make paymen ts on ENEs behalf My tkae on the situation Fimat is upset based mainly on Enrons handling of expitted trades and bad press I told Fimat that I believed the reason trades were expitted to Fim at was that ENE wanted to move its positions to brokers who were offering m argin lines to ENE I promised to look into our handling or mishandling of the situaiton but it seems that disorganization rather than ill intent was responsible for Fimats inconveniences I explained that Enron is prepar ed neither to mediate between Soc Gen and Fimat nor to cause Soc Gen to mak e payments to Fimat on our behalf That issue should have been resolved wh en the amrgin line was set up and the payment mechanism has been working fi ne so far As far as the confusion with ABN we were not party to the disc ussions betweeen Fimat and ABN and can not make any comment to that Fin ally we can not make margin payments to Fimat when we do not have proper no tice time I am sorry that there is bad press out there but I do not think we should give Fimat special permission to comb through our statements on an on going basis This may have been necessary for them earlier this week but they need to get their act together and get the proper number to us ea rly in the morning like all the other brokers We need to determine how much we need Fimat right now I am not inclined t o entirely blow them off especially sinces I do not want them to tell othe r brokers that we are acting strangely and hurt our reputation further righ t now At the same time no one around Enron needs more work right now and we can not hold a high maintenance brokers hand hand every step of the wa y Lets decide what to do and implement Sarah

mornings ENEDYN analyst conference call Listened in on the analyst call this morning Here are my notes Did not yet have a chance to organize them so theyre simply in chronological order The call began with Watson Bergstrom and Whalley reading from prepared statements Watson spoke for c minutes Bergstrom for and Whalley spoke for perhaps seconds Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them Specific points EES will be a part of the new company Enron assets will be revalued at closing The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred If the merger does not go through Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for very little additional consideration If DYN terminates the merger and ENE has sufficient liquidity ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred Debtequity of combined company expected to be Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative ChevronTexaco will hold MM shares out of a total MM shares of the postmerger entity Watson reiterates that going forward the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure with a significant reduction in on and offbalancesheet leverage In what was termed a new approach the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true Dynegy owed Enron MM Lay says that Enron had other options particularly financial All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be pretty big but that the companies feel theyre able to appropriately value this exposure Lay says we have nothing else to hide but internal investigation still under way Lay had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps MM more of risk capital there would have been no question that they would have qualified for offbalancesheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs Dynegy says that several internal investigations continue at Enron and thus DYNENE cannot say with certainty that theres absolutely nothing else out there Doty Dynegy CFO says that late last week ENE had close to a billion in cash Osprey will be unwound late next summer Marlin will be unwound after closing Many of the offbalancesheet structures including the creditlinked notes are expected to be unwoundredeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing With regard to ENE asset dispositions these will be accelerated to the extent possible However Doty says that our backs are not against the wall and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash ENE will renew its day facility believe this is the Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago within the next weeks BBBflat most likely rating for combined entity according to initial comments from ratings agencies McMahon says no comment to WSJ article indicating that ENEs banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks Consolidation of trading activity Mid and backoffice consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing such that only the front office trading books will need to be combined at closing EES NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity so there wont be much integration work required there The big integration effort will be ENA Watson says that the creative financing surrounded noncore assets Doty adds that frankly DYN assigned zero economic value to noncore businesses in their valuation model They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the noncore assetsbusinesses and left it at that Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by Enrons top three executives who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies Says that their approach evidenced a willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegys deliberations on proceeding with the merger WatsonDoty said that theyre NOT sure that no surprises remain in Enrons booksbut that the riskreward offered by the combination was compelling The deal does have materialadversechange outs for Dynegy covering any MAC regarding Enrons assets or businesses Dynegys lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a blunt instrument under which it would be difficult to bring a case so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enrons total legal liability from any source or cause of action tops Bn prior to closing McMahon adds that there could be more restatements but he does not expect there to be more restatements ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron Enron is planning to hold an Enronspecific conference call in the next few days tentatively scheduled for Wednesday Initial reaction of ratings agencies very positive to combined entities McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to yearend had the merger not materialized Dynegys earnings guidance places Enronrelated earnings accretion at which represents a haircut to Enron internal estimates Doty says that this is all operating earningsfigure does not include any amounts from expected synergies Doty says that both Enron and Dynegys books as far as he understands are relatively shortterm in weight and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity Says a very very substantial portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash ChevronTexacos investment in Dynegy was calculated at a discount to public prices on the date of negotiation not disclosed Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week ChevronTexacos investment is now at a more substantial discount to market prices ChevronTexaco has provision to get different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better No further clarification given Whalley believes that well retain the Enron traders and marketers Theyre used to being part of a winning team and the combined entity will definitely be a winner They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders and they are very excited by the combination They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions He says that to the extent necessary yes Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENEthere will be more of an assetbacked trading focus but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial marketmaking trading than the Dynegy of today Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture hes a strong team player He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well Give me a call if youd like me to try to clarify any of these comments Patrick Tucker x
