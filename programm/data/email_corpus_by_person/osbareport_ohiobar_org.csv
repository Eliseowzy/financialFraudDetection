Association was not subject to Public Records Act because it was not a public office or a public in stitution under ORC A The municipalities had no control over hospitals operation and no board member acted in representational capaci ty for them and provision of hospital care is not a uniquely governmenta l service The initial issuance of bonds by municipalities for hospitals construction without
