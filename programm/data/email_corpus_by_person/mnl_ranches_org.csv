these people regarding the truth of the Bibleheres something that shows Gods awesome creation and shows that He is still in control Did you know that the space program is busy proving that what has been called myth in the Bible is true Mr Harold Hill President of the Curtis Engine Company in Baltimore Maryland and a consultant in the space Program relates the following development I think one of the most amazing things that God has for us today happened recently to our astronauts and space scientists at Greenbelt Maryland They were checking the position of the sun moon and planets out in space where they would be years and years from now We have to know this so we wont send a satellite up and have it bump into something later on in its orbits We have to lay out the orbits in terms of the life of the satellite and where the planets will be so the whole thing will not bog down They ran the computer measurement back and forth over the centuries and it came to a halt The computer stopped and put up a red signal which meant that there was something wrong either with the information fed into it or with the results as compared to the standards They called in the service department to check it out and they saidWhats wrong Well they found there is a day missing in space in elapsed time They scratched their heads and tore their hair There was no answer Finally a Christian man on the team said You know one time I was in Sunday School and they talked about the sun standing still While they didnt believe him they didnt have an answer either so they said Show us He got a Bible and went back to the book of Joshua where they found a pretty ridiculous statement for any one with common sense There they found the Lord saying to Joshua Fear them not I have delivered them into thy hand there shall not a man of them stand before thee Joshua was concerned because he was surrounded by the enemy and if darkness fell they would overpower them So Joshua asked the Lord to make the sun stand still Thats rightThe sun stood still and the moon stayed and hasted not to go down about a whole day Joshua The astronauts and scientists said There is the missing day They checked the computers going back into the time it was written and found it was close but not close enough The elapsed time that was missing back in Joshuas day was hours and minutesnot a whole day They read the Bible and there it was about approximately a day These little words in the Bible are important but they were still in trouble because if you cannot account for minutes youll still be in trouble years from now Forty minutes had to be found because it can be multiplied many times over in orbits As the Christian employee thought about it he remembered somewhere in the Bible where it said the sun went BACKWARDS The scientists told him he was out of his mind but they got out the Book and read these words in Kings that told of the following story Hezekiah on his deathbed was visited by the prophet Isaiah who told him that he was not going to die Hezekiah asked for a sign as proof Isaiah said Do you want the sun to go ahead degrees Hezekiah said It is nothing for the sun to go ahead degrees but let the shadow return backward degrees Isaiah spoke to the Lord and the Lord brought the shadow ten degreesBACKWARD Ten degrees is exactly minutes Twentythree hours and minutes in Joshua plus minutes in Second Kings make the missing day in the universe Isnt it amazing References Joshua and and Kings Forward this to as many people who you believe would think this is equally as
