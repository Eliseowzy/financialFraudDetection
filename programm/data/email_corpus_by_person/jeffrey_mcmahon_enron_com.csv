Stephen Bowen Jr Raymond Subject RE EOGIL sale to BG SorryI forgot to attach the press release File INDIA EOGIL NEW AGREEMENT DRAFT doc Original Message From Sherrick Jeffrey Sent Tuesday January PM To McMahon Jeffrey Cc Detmering Tim Wallace Stephen Bowen Jr Raymond Subject FW EOGIL sale to BG Jeff FYI here is the game plan for EOGIL and the sale to BG It appears that we have the fundamental support of the creditor committee to sign the BG deal for India See Tims note below I spoke to Ray by telephoneon his way to the airport regarding the questions Lilly Chu had outlined when she spoke to Tim Detmering To paraphrase Rays comments to my note below a he is working with the creditors committee on the DO issues and both the committee and Ray want to put a broader program in place to handle our concerns for the asset sales and the ongoing business At this point we are in good faith proceeding with the sale with the assumption that this will be sorted out before we sign the deal in midFebruary b the deal compensation should sort itself out as the appropriate people review the information they have been given over the weekend and today As a nondebtor we plan to honor the agreements but we will supply Lilly et al with the information they need to understand the deal in place With these understandings we are proceeding forward to sign the documents with BG and file a motion with the court Brian Rosen is drafting the motion for the court and he will circulate it tomorrow for comments and expect to file it ASAP The hearing date will be in midFebruary Tim is in discussions with BG and the only outstanding issue is the escrow form of agreement This will be either resolved this evening or put to the side until closing since it is not needed for signing However BG is making noise that they would like to finalize it if possible before signing this evening THEREFORE ASSUMING THE STARS ALIGN and WE SIGN THE DEAL TONIGHT BG WILL BE ISSUING A PRESS RELEASE TOMORROW A COPY IS ATTACHED WE HAVE SENT IT THROUGH PR John Ambler Johan Zaayman and the working group and now the two of you Do we need to send it elsewhere Well circulate a short note if and when we execute the documents If you have any questions or comments please contact Tim Stephen or I jeff Original Message From Sherrick Jeffrey Sent Tuesday January PM To Bowen Jr Raymond Subject FW EOGIL With respect to the note below we have done the following this morning We have provided Mary Jean Potenzone with Weil samples of the documents for her review There are a couple of different documents Retention agreements divestiture agreements and the only differences being names and amounts We have also sent her any associated agreements extensions and assignment She indicated she would review this afternoon My understanding is she is the conduit to Millbank None of the people on this list participated in the prepetition retention Lilly has asked about Futhermore none of these people are part of the future plan if there is one to the best of my knowledge On DO supposedly Lilly said they discussed this and the creditors see the need for such a plan but they dont want a one off plan as well It would be good to get someone on behalf of the creditors to send us a written note along these lines Once we have the compensation and the DO issue resolved we can notify BG and sign this deal I suggest you call Lilly and get closure on these two issues ok on bonuses letter in lieu of DO policy if you can Brian is drafting the motion and he just informed us that neither of these issues need to be in the motion they are just creditor committee issues jeff Original Message From Detmering Tim Sent Tuesday January PM To Bowen Jr Raymond Brian Rosen Email Steve Zelin Email Cc Wallace Stephen Davis Steve Sherrick Jeffrey Harper Stephen Subject EOGIL Just spoke with Lilly Chu at Houlihan The Creditors Committee is fine with the transaction with the following reservations Escrow the proceeds DO insurance will be addressed in the future Ray needs to get back with Lilly and clarify the deal compensation arrangements for EGEP personnel including providing employment agreements to Milbank Lilly was confused about who was participating in the deal compensation and expressed concern about making clear that people are only getting paid once ie people who got a piece of the prepetition retention were not also getting a deal bonus for this transaction and were not also getting something out of the upcoming retention plan EGEP showed up on a chart that we sent her as a Debtor I told her that was incorrect and apologized for Eickenrohts mistake I just assumed it was Robert since he was not in the room at the time Therefore the Creditors are please to have us file our motion so long as it provides for escrowing the proceeds does not provide for separate DO insurance and does not address the deal compensation

mailtoIMCEANOTESThomasSfikasENRONenronXgate NRONcom Sent June To Steel Distribution Cc McMahon Jeffrey Bowen Jr Raymond Subject Steel Stradegies Conference NYC Yesterday during the Panel V discussion Why Have Steel Middlemen Gone From The Most Threatened To Best Positioned we got some direct feedback on the perception of Enron in the marketplace The participants were Fred Lamesh CEO of Trademarked Inc Michael Siegel CEO of Olympic Steel Bud Siegel CEO of Russell Metals and Wilfred von Bulow CEO of Ferrostaal Inc the moderator was Peter Marcus Managing Partners of World Steel Dynamics Each participant gave a brief speech about their respective companies which was followed by a QA session The first mention of Enron was during Michael Siegals speech in which he mentioned that Olympic Steel had sold material to Enron and that Enron has recognized that steel is a commodity and for many countries represents currency Michael was clearly proud of his transactions with Enron and agreed with our view of steel as a commodity The real feedback came during the QA Peter Marcus posted the following question to the panelists What about Enron With their plan of entering the market with a number of hubs across the country stocking material with large scale distribution on a spot basis Will this business model work Do they offer any real value or not Following are the respective responses as best I can reiterate from my notes please dont quote me on this Fred Lamesh TradeArbed The concept is too new to make a judgment yet on credibility Enron has certainly been successful in the past and should not be discounted I question their ability to procure material at competitive enough levels to make this a profitable venture but there may be some value in their delivery of financial instruments Michael Siegal Olympic Steel Enron certainly has the financial means to withstand a break even business to support their financial instruments At this point we view them as just another entity in the market and until we can evaluate their performance it is difficult to determine value I am concerned though that they will prop up under capitalized distributors and allow them to operate despite mismanagement One interesting and unique concept that they are trying to bring to the industry though is the idea that a contract is a contract with liquidated damages for non performance That would certainly be change sporadic laughter among the crowd Bud Siegel Russell Metals I addressed the Enron question last night during dinner and was told that I was abusive to the young lady from Enron Tammy I later understood that you had a less than cordial conversation with Bud the previous evening I am calling Enron the Hunts of the steel business with their idea of buying up the market The whole concept is like Swiss cheese You can not put up depots buy from steel mills and expect to sell the same steel to distributors cheaper than the mills themselves The logistical expenses alone guarantee failure You can not be everything to everyone Considering the current state of under financing in this industry they will inevitably end up financing bankrupt people and take credit hits Without immediate success Enron has been known to exist markets quickly in the past and I believe they will be gone within the yearsome sporadic applause Wilfried von Bulow Ferrostaal Right now they are just another additional player in the market They will certainly have an impact but it would not be pragmatic to make a judgment yet on their ability to succeed Lets watch it and see if there is any value to what they are trying to bring to the market It appears to me that the focus on Enron in the market right now continues to be more on the physical aspects of what we are doing and not enough emphasis or credibility is being given to the financial tools we are bringing It is obviously very easy to poke holes in a concept of trading large volumes of physical steel on a spot basis through the set up of physical hubs around the country In the end the only way we will be successful will be by bringing liquidity to our index through financial instruments We need to focus more on educating customers about our financial tools developing our curve and bringing players to the market

with the below except I think the applause for our demise was unfortunately rather more aggressive This was my first exposure to the nonEuropean Steel players and found myself quite amazed at the few number of public advocates that we had at the conference in consideration of what we are offering The oneonone contact with the attendees was completely the opposite We talked with a broad and numerous set of people who coming to the booth as sceptics they think that were are in the market just to grab the physical business left with cards in hand and future risk management meetings in mind Big buyers eg GE Emerson and consultants eg Accenture McK etc were particularly receptive and should be courted as public advocates for what we are doing Jeff Original Message From Thomas NRON mailtoIMCEANOTESThomasSfikasENRONenronXgate NRONcom Sent June To Steel Distribution Cc McMahon Jeffrey Bowen Jr Raymond Subject Steel Stradegies Conference NYC Yesterday during the Panel V discussion Why Have Steel Middlemen Gone From The Most Threatened To Best Positioned we got some direct feedback on the perception of Enron in the marketplace The participants were Fred Lamesh CEO of Trademarked Inc Michael Siegel CEO of Olympic Steel Bud Siegel CEO of Russell Metals and Wilfred von Bulow CEO of Ferrostaal Inc the moderator was Peter Marcus Managing Partners of World Steel Dynamics Each participant gave a brief speech about their respective companies which was followed by a QA session The first mention of Enron was during Michael Siegals speech in which he mentioned that Olympic Steel had sold material to Enron and that Enron has recognized that steel is a commodity and for many countries represents currency Michael was clearly proud of his transactions with Enron and agreed with our view of steel as a commodity The real feedback came during the QA Peter Marcus posted the following question to the panelists What about Enron With their plan of entering the market with a number of hubs across the country stocking material with large scale distribution on a spot basis Will this business model work Do they offer any real value or not Following are the respective responses as best I can reiterate from my notes please dont quote me on this Fred Lamesh TradeArbed The concept is too new to make a judgment yet on credibility Enron has certainly been successful in the past and should not be discounted I question their ability to procure material at competitive enough levels to make this a profitable venture but there may be some value in their delivery of financial instruments Michael Siegal Olympic Steel Enron certainly has the financial means to withstand a break even business to support their financial instruments At this point we view them as just another entity in the market and until we can evaluate their performance it is difficult to determine value I am concerned though that they will prop up under capitalized distributors and allow them to operate despite mismanagement One interesting and unique concept that they are trying to bring to the industry though is the idea that a contract is a contract with liquidated damages for non performance That would certainly be change sporadic laughter among the crowd Bud Siegel Russell Metals I addressed the Enron question last night during dinner and was told that I was abusive to the young lady from Enron Tammy I later understood that you had a less than cordial conversation with Bud the previous evening I am calling Enron the Hunts of the steel business with their idea of buying up the market The whole concept is like Swiss cheese You can not put up depots buy from steel mills and expect to sell the same steel to distributors cheaper than the mills themselves The logistical expenses alone guarantee failure You can not be everything to everyone Considering the current state of under financing in this industry they will inevitably end up financing bankrupt people and take credit hits Without immediate success Enron has been known to exist markets quickly in the past and I believe they will be gone within the yearsome sporadic applause Wilfried von Bulow Ferrostaal Right now they are just another additional player in the market They will certainly have an impact but it would not be pragmatic to make a judgment yet on their ability to succeed Lets watch it and see if there is any value to what they are trying to bring to the market It appears to me that the focus on Enron in the market right now continues to be more on the physical aspects of what we are doing and not enough emphasis or credibility is being given to the financial tools we are bringing It is obviously very easy to poke holes in a concept of trading large volumes of physical steel on a spot basis through the set up of physical hubs around the country In the end the only way we will be successful will be by bringing liquidity to our index through financial instruments We need to focus more on educating customers about our financial tools developing our curve and bringing players to the market
