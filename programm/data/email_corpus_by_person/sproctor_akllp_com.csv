they are not opposed to the escrow account just the hassle of paper work but he is checking with his commercial person and will get back to me today I told him ENA wants to do the deal ENA is willing to open the escrow account but thats the deal So I expect to hear from him shortly Attached is the email from Centanas attorney At the very beginning of Mike Richards email he lists all of his claims Original Message From Nemec Gerald mailtoGerald NRONcom Sent Tuesday February PM To Proctor Shemin V Mann Kay Cc Subject FW FW Gas Storage Agreement with Duke Energy Field Services Kay Mark is aware of this transaction The following is his response to Centanas counsel email I did discuss with Mark this morning the current course we are following with Centana and he agreed it made sense As it stands now we would sell all the gas inplace to Centana and they would net out postpetition fees Our business people feel that we have used the storage services postpetition and consequently those fees would be an administrative expense An amount equivalent to the prepetition fees would be held in escrow until the bankrutpcy court resolved the prepetition amounts All remaining amounts would be delivered to Enron North America Original Message From Mark Ellenberg ENRON Sent Friday February AM To Nemec Gerald Cc Mann Kay Subject Re FW Gas Storage Agreement with Duke Energy Field Services He is wrong on just about every point In the few instances where he has stated correct legal principles he has misapplied them the bankruptcy code expressly cuts off interest on unsecured claims as of the petition date refusing to act under the contract unless prepetition debt is paid is a violation of the automatic stay in this regard it should be noted that obligations maturing postpetition are still prepetition debts to the extent they arise from a prepetition contract such as here both set off and recoupment require that there be a debt owed to the debtor by the counterparty and a debt owed by the debtor to the counterparty here the unstated premise of centanas position is that centanas obligation to return gas is a debt owed by it to to enron this is wrong centana is merely a bailee of the gas and its return obligation is not a debt this is clearly established in the cotton warehouse cases i have previously sent you the cites for section d on its face only applies to leases of nonresidential real property a gas storage agreement is obviously not such a lease the court has already ruled that enron deserves time to determine whether to assume or reject executory contracts in addition the court has ruled that parties to executory contracts are not entitled to relief from the stay or adequate protection centana should be placed on notice that they are violating the stay by demanding prepetition debt and by refusing to turn over property of the estate this exposes them to a contempt citation and damages we should thank them for providing a smoking gun in the form of richards email in addition they are in breach of contract for refusing to comply with enrons withdrawal requests this exposes them to breach of contract damages claims based on the decline in the value of gas they are entitled to be paid as an administrative expense for storage charges based on storage actually used since december you should be aware that we resolved a similar standoff with ngpl by agreeing to immediately reject storage contracts and paying postpetition administrative storage charges if they cooperated in the sale of gas to a third party via inground transfer maybe that would work here Nemec Gerald To GeraldNemec cc ENRONcom Subject FW Gas Storage Office Agreement with Duke Energy Field Services PM Mark Attached is the authority under which Centana is holding portions of our gas in storage I will forward a copy of the storage agreement also Original Message From Michael S Richards ENRON Sent Wednesday February AM To Nemec Gerald Cc Greg A Swidensky Subject Gas Storage Agreement with Duke Energy Field Services Importance High Gerald this email will serve as a followup to our telephone conversation from the other day There are a number of arguments we believe we have with respect to our entitlement to prebankruptcy lease payments under our storage lease with Enron These arguments include our rights under our storage lease agreement common law setoff rights recoupment rejectionassumption and adequate protection issues These issues are briefly addressed below Under the terms of our September Gas Storage Agreement Enron is obligated to pay monthly interest in the amount of for past due lease obligations Currently Enron is past due for both pre and postbankruptcy lease obligations to us Under the terms of the lease we are authorized to suspend withdrawals until all past due obligations including interest are paid We believe that under Texas law we are entitled to common law recoupment andor setoff rights We dont know whether Enron intends to accept or reject our storage lease If Enron rejects our year lease we calculate the rejection damages for anticipatory breach to exceed million which is in excess of the value of the gas Recoupment rights are generally available to determine a just liability on the claim of one party against another with respect to a single indivisible contract If recoupment is not available setoff enables us to offset our claims under the lease against Enrons claims for the gas subject to the automatic stay because mutual debts may be offset against each other to achieve a just result Official Comm of Unsecured Creditors v Manufacturers and Traders Trust Co In re Bennett Funding Group Frd nd Cir Section d of the Code requires that a debtorinpossession timely perform all of its obligations under an unexpired lease until it is assumed or rejected Therefore not only rent but also other fees taxes and attorneys fees to the extent provided for under the lease must be paid under Section d Courts have held late charges for postpetition prerejection lease payments to be obligations that must be paid as administrative expense claims See eg In re MS Freight Distribution Inc BR Bankr WD Wash We believe that we are entitled to the setting of an early deadline by the court for Enron to determine whether or not to accept or reject this contract in order to protect our recoupmentsetoff rights and we believe we are entitled to relief from the automatic stay to permit the exercise of the setoff rights if recoupment should be found not to apply Pending such determinations we believe that we are entitled to hold the gas to preserve our recoupmentsetoff rights See eg Citizens Bank v Strumpf US Our preference is to work out a deal with Enron for the purchase of this gas with a credit against the purchase price for both pre and post bankruptcy lease obligations We believe we should seek bankruptcy court approval to the extent this involves prebankruptcy obligations This
