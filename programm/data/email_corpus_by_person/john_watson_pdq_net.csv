You Live a Happier Life Summary of October Dear Folks This weeks gathering focused on how in light of our present circumstances can we learn to practice a true present and enjoy the good that is all around us We must develop Wisdom about the way life works Skill in making life work for us and Faith that will sustain us in all times The blackest bleakest day in Christian history was essential for the brightest Full text of the presentation Noticing and Enjoying Strawberries In the email preview of our time together today I told the following story It is a very famous story from the Buddhist tradition The story is of a monk who was fleeing a tiger He ran to the edge of a cliff and being unable to stop himself went over the edge On the way down he caught the branch of a tree He had been saved He looked down and way below on the ground was another tiger He must hang on with all his might No way to go back up and certain death below As he was hanging there he glanced aside and saw a strawberry on a bush growing from the edge of the cliff beside him He let go of the limb with one hand picked the strawberry and savored it This story of course is a parable It is told to illustrate the importance of developing the ability to enjoy a true present Our present circumstances are certainly chaotic are they not How are we to develop the ability to enjoy the delicious strawberry that is just within reach Indeed how can we develop the ability even to notice that the strawberry is there Thats what our time together is going to be about today developing the ability to notice and enjoy strawberries even when things fall apart Let me begin with some preliminary observations just to make sure we are all on the same page In the last fourteen years I have given almost different talks Thats a lot Does anyone have that much to say The answer to that is No Twenty years or so ago working with my teachermentor Carlyle Marney I came up with something of a creed I could put the entire Christian faith in less than fifty words Here they are God is in our history with a searching love Jesus Christ is central The cross is unavoidable Church is a community of believers and there is no salvation by ones self That is to say faith is relational Discipline is required We can live an assured hope That is to say there is a saving possibility in every situation That from a Christian perspective is what we have to talk about What changes is our understanding of it our circumstances and us One of the things that has changed of course is that on we began to be forced to notice what is going on around us Mostly however we have seen just tigers chasing us and a huge abyss below us with more tigers You dont hear much talk about delicious strawberries Indeed we are frantically looking for the branch to hold on to I hope that you get at least that much here I was working out at my athletic club on Wednesday and was struggling away reading about Methodist Polity while doing the stair master On a recumbent bike in front of me was a man I admire him for his spunk and still working out daily who was pontificating about how to deal with our nations current crisis He went on and on about how the only way to fight terrorism is with terrorism Like you I have seen the newspapers magazines and listened to the programs on radio and television I found it funny as all getout that on one of the television news magazine programs this past week they were talking about how we were becoming a nation of terrorized people Hello They are the ones who are stirring up the fear What should you have in your survival kit Stay tuned for the news that follows Give me a break Yet the fact is that our government officials are saying more terrorist attacks are likely to take place in this country How do we live with that I do not want to ignore or deny the tigers chasing us or the abyss I do want what my teaching is about to help us notice and enjoy the strawberries This circumstance that we find ourselves in can be the perfect teaching moment for us We dont like this because we have come in our culture to value comfort so much But the feelings of loss and fear that we have experienced since can show us with terrifying clarity exactly what our spiritual work needs to be Not only has an emphasis on comfort seduced us away from reality but also so has the need for each of us to appear to the other that weve got it all together Let me be very clear spiritual practice isnt about being good it is about waking up One day Gabriel was walking about in the heavenly realm He came upon God and it was apparent that God was very depressed Gabriel said to God Whats the matter God said pointing to the earth Look at what a mess they have made of everything Nothing is going like I had hoped it would Im going to destroy the lot of them But you cant do that Gabriel said And why not Im God the Almighty I can do whatever I wish Because said Gabriel you promised I did Yes At the time of the great flood Well then Im going to get rid of most of them Send someone to go over all the earth and find the truly righteous Give to each of the righteous a small brass plaque so that when I send the angel of death to destroy the angel of death will be able to distinguish the righteous from those who are not So Gabriel did as he was instructed And do you know what the brass plaque said No You didnt get one either Our eyes have been opened by the events of and following We hate it We want to run In the past we have run We have used all sorts of things to escape the way life is One of the things weve used is humor I dont think I heard one single joke about the Oklahoma City bombing did you Im beginning to hear some about aspects of our current crisis Conan OBrien said It was reported today that Osama Bin Laden has brothers and sisters Which absolutely shocked me because I had no idea he was Catholic Jay Leno said this You read about all these terrorists most of them came here legally but they hung around on these expired visas some for as long as years Now compare that to Blockbuster you are two days late with a video and these people are all over you Lets put Blockbuster in charge of immigration Here are some more Leno lines The US Government has said they are now going to go after the terrorists electronic banking system You know what they should do They should transfer Bin Ladens funds to my bank Theyd mess up his deposits screw up his statement and nickel and dime him to death with service charges More and more facts coming out about Osama bin Laden You know he never sleeps in the same place two nights in a row just like Clinton We have other ways of protecting ourselves from what is Each and every one of us has wanted to be able and this is the first principle of Ordinary Life to be an exception to the way life is We have wanted to get a leg up on life and in the process we only cause ourselves more suffering So we protect ourselves from the pain by all sorts of addictions We work furiously to get those things we have been taught will make us happy when we finally have them We are committed to happy endings and trying to make them become realities robs us of the very life we say we want If we cant manipulate the situation what can we do Three things we must develop wisdom about the way life is skill in making life work for us and a faith that can sustain us at all times especially during the times when there seems to be no rational reason to believe at all To do any of this takes creative imagination the ability to see things out of our usual way of seeing them I will stoop to almost any means whatever to get you to think outside the box in spiritual terms If we are going to experience and participate in the abundant life if we are going to notice and appreciate the strawberries we have to use our minds And our spirits Last Sunday in our dialogue time together I reminded you that the central facet of the Christian faith if a belief in the resurrection There are as you might imagine many different views and interpretations of the resurrection from very conservative folks who believe in the bodily resurrection of Jesus to those very liberal Christian who see it as a metaphor of a new life that is possible in the now moment made available by faith Some folks get caught up in fights about which of these positions is correct Im not interested in that I want to offer you and me insights and methods that will assist us in living as fully and freely and bravely and beautifully as we possibly can One of the teachings we can get out of is that none of us knows how much longer we have to live We have hopes and assumptions but not real knowledge What do you want to do with that time you have left What I want to do with that period of time is create lifeenhancing events and experiences for myself and you That isnt the only thing I want to do but it is the main thing With that in mind lets take a step in that direction In order for there to be a resurrection in Christian theology there first had to be crucifixion The crucifixion was the early churchs version of September Now I know this is a very imperfect analogy But bear with me a moment The crucifixion of Jesus took place on a day that soon began to be called Good Friday Why call it good I know good Friday is a corruption of Gods Friday But the phrase good Friday has stuck for a reason After all it would be just as easy to say Gods Friday Why is it called good What could be good about it What could be good about it for us Because when you look at it it seems to most assuredly a holy mess One of Jesus disciples deals with his disappointment and frustration by betraying his teacher He careens out of control eventually committing suicide The politicians of the day dealt with the events of the day in a way that foreshadows quandaries that we see in things like the some of the decisions in the Middle East we are paying such a price for now They arrest Jesus then attempt to release him then hear his case then consider the religious opposition to him The religious community fares no better as they function in a dither They orchestrate a way to honor the letter of their law but slaughter the spirit of it Then they completely lose control as the man they most want to abolish is labeled their king The climate is emotionally explosive Nerves are set on edge Peter takes it out on an innocent bystander by cutting his ear off Pilate has second thoughts but is afraid to trust his better judgment when he sees how vicious the crowd has become And the crowd is unruly uneasy in that volatile state that precedes bedlam The evening news reports that nature itself is out of kilter torn by violent storms darkness comes at midday There is confusion and chaos about this socalled Good Friday We have trouble with confusion and chaos We are creatures of order Control is most important to us Our ideal person is one who has it all together as we put it one who has everything under control To lose control in our view of things is a form of sickness One of the things we hope and pray for is that as we get older we wont lose control of our bodies or fall victim to some disease where we lose control We would rather die Certainly we dont want anyone else controlling us either sick or well Good Friday is chaotic The day is nonsensical But maybe just maybe that is precisely what the day is about a kind of confusion and chaos that our minds to say nothing about our hearts cant organize Chaos comes and we are in panic Our need to make sense out of it goes into overdrive When we ourselves lose control and go outside our values and we do the complex mixture of pain and shame is overwhelming A few years ago as I was leaving the house to go to work the phone rang with the news that during the night a drug crazed kid had apparently at random selection broken into the home of two friends of ours and bludgeoned them to death while they slept Just two weekends before they had gone on a retreat with this Sunday School class The event made me crazy trying to make sense of it You just never know who or when or where things might suddenly stop happening Jesus is brutally murdered by truly good people just doing their jobs And we look at that and it makes no sense to us We want to organize it and explain it with some political or psychological or theological premise We always end up exasperated One of the problems with the story of the crucifixion of Jesus is that we who do so love to be in control are comforted because we already know the end of this story Yet I will assert that we who do so love to be in control really do not know what to do with this day It is for that very reason that we call this day good It is good in the sense that it is good for us It is good for us to be made to stare into this mess which is so far beyond our control It is good for us because it reminds us of what happens when our design runs amuck It is good for us because it reminds us that we are not in absolute control even when we think we are It is good for us also because it reminds us of our origins and our ends Now pay attention There is theological construction under way here Put on your hard hats and thinking caps The only other place in the scriptural tradition that invites us to contemplate such a formless chaotic and unfathomably dark mystery is the Genesis story which tells us that in the beginning the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep We are reminded that we are children of chaos born of its confusion and fashioned out of its corruptible elements called by the spirit of God from the tumult and shaped by God into whatever order we shall ever know The great discomfort of Good Friday then is not the pain we inflicted upon Jesus not even the sorrow of his death but the reality of the chaos it reveals It is most assuredly a holy mess But notice that our tradition sees within Jesus what they called the new Adam If Jesus be the new Adam then Good Friday so filled with chaos is also the first day of the new creation The crucifixion and the turmoil and the confusion surrounding it constitute the raw mass of chaos from which a new order is made And the humble humiliating lesson that awaits us is that this new order like the chaos is beyond our control Admitting this has never been easy especially in our culture and especially for those whose lives are built upon making sense out of things and staying in control So I invite you to take your place in the midst of the chaos to pay homage to the nonsense If we could just let go of those instinctive inclinations to probe the chaos or grasp it we might find ourselves in all of it And if we could go through life and come before God in this manner we might know the wisdom that would set us free We might actually be strengthened to face in humility the overwhelming chaos and the numbing nonsense of our own time I heard someone say the other day and this is so typical of us when things dont go to our liking I dont see how a God of love and justice could allow the events of September to happen I cant believe in God anymore Folks it is not God who is put to the test here any more than God was put to a test on Good Friday It is we ourselves who are put to the test And when we have seen this truth and made it ours when we have given up our vain attempts to undo history to guarantee the present or to predetermine the future we might see more clearly that we are the creatures and God is the creator Maybe that would make each day a new creation for us Maybe we could even be quiet enough to hear what God says after every act of creation creation out of the chaos It is good So there it hangs a beautiful delicious strawberry Got the faith to reach out and taste it God lets pray that we do No matter where you go this week no matter what happens remember this You are carrying precious cargo Watch your step Ordinary Life is a gathering that provides an opportunity to develop an enlightened heart and an awakened mind to the reality of

AM To Subject ordinarylife Hurry Up and Wait ORDINARY LIFE Thoughts and Ideas to Help You Live a Happier Life Summary of December Dear Folks On the last Sunday of we talked about the matter of time How fast it passes What are we to do with it We are to wait This class was about what we are waiting for and how we are to wait The answers are both maddening and embarrassing There is also an excursion here about how to read the Bible and how Fundamentalism came to be I hope you find this inspirational and valuable as you reflect on the year just passed and prepare for what is to come Some famous author once wrote and I cant find his name now No one ever greeted the first of the year with indifference I believe that is true It is a time of new beginnings and of hope I wish that for you What follows is the full text from which I spoke on Sunday Much love Bill Kerley Hurry Up and Wait Living life is an art Our lives and our living are pieces of art to create Isnt that a great concept Learning this art is important because we dont have much time to live do we This stuff we call time goes so fast so very fast Im fascinated with time utterly fascinated I have surrounded myself with countless devices for measuring the passing of time For years and years I kept a DayTimer I experimented with various sizes and styles I think I was hoping that if I found the perfect system Id be able to accomplish all that I wanted to Wrong Ive never been able to do that But keeping a DayTimer did enable me to see what I do with time and why and what I allow time to do with me and why I can experience how rapidly it passes and how slowly it drags out Now for years Ive gone paperless and have been using a Palm device It serves the same function as a DayTimer just easier to carry If I go back and look at pages from my DayTimer from several years ago it sometimes seems like I was another person When I began doing sitting meditation I could experience time as if it were molasses or as a flash of lightening Sometimes it seems I have been sitting forever and I will open my eyes to see that only a few minutes have passed At other times an hour passes in five minutes Time is so central to us Think of all the books we read the instructions we follow the activities we do just to help us structure time Early on in life someone gives us a watch and says to us Dont be late again They make an assumption They assume that we know how to tell time What did you do What are you doing What are you going to do These are all time questions When you look at life spiritually which really is your only option there is a meaningful answer to all the questions we raise about time But we find the answer both maddening and embarrassing Maddening because it turns out that what we are to do with our time is to wait The word wait is one of the most characteristic words in the Bible Wait on the Lord They that wait upon the Lord shall inherit the earth My soul waits for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning According to my count the word wait is found in the Bible exactly times If I were to read them all you would wait a long time Who wants to spend time like that Whats so maddening about waiting is that we dont know how We dont like encountering or being confronted with stuff we dont know how to do In my own life one of the frustrating and disappointing things Ive noticed is how Ive backslidden in the area of patience Sometimes we structure time by getting involved in a process we call business as usual When we do that the right now the present moment is stripped of any urgency or importance it might have These gatherings weve been calling Ordinary Life arent about business as usual Those of you here who have trouble with the church have this complaint The church has often pretended it didnt live in the twentieth century So the church has sometimes ignored the vast changes taking place out there in the world Being the last to speak about major issues integrity being good stewards of the earths resources learning to live interdependently sexist language outdated world view you name it Religious organizations churches and synagogues constitute the second largest landholder and purchaser of goods and services in this country What a power we could be And yet historically the church has had to be hit over the head before it opens its eyes to what is happening in the world content to let the world be damned unless it enters our ecclesiastical ghetto No urgency no living on tiptoe not breathless as to the Kingdom of God being here and now Just business as usual I said a moment ago that looking at the world spiritually is our only option That isnt true You can look at the world religiously Im going to overstate this case Religion is about fear Spirituality is whats on the other side of fear As someone once said Religion is for people who are afraid of hell Spirituality is for people who have been there When I was growing up in a Southern Baptist Church in Columbia Tennessee a lot of my religious instruction was fearbased There are some words and phrases that I wish Id never heard not because they are not good words but because they got so contaminated Among these are words like sin commitment dedication We hear phrases growing up that shape us I said in one of our recent times together that there is nothing wrong with you Youre just fine In response to that someone who gets the email summaries of this class sent me this Unless you were raised by wolves the chances are extremely good that as you were growing up you heard at least a few of the following Dont do that Stop that Put that down I told you not to do that Why dont you ever listen Wipe that look off your face Ill give you something to cry about Dont touch that You shouldnt feel that way You should have known better Will you ever learn You should be ashamed of yourself Shame on you I cant believe you did that Dont ever let me see you do that again See that serves you right Because I told you so Are you ever going to get it What were the last words out of my mouth What were you thinking of You ruin everything You have no sense Youre nuts The nurses must have dropped you on your head Just once do something right Ive sacrificed everything for you and what thanks do I get I had great hopes for you If Ive told you once Ive told you a thousand times Give an inch and you take a mile Anybody would know that Dont talk back to me Youll do as you are told Thats not funny Who do you think you are Why did you do it that way You were born bad You drive me crazy You do that just to hurt me I could skin you alive What will the neighbors say You do that to torture me Youre so mean I could beat the daylights out of you Dont you dare look at me like that Youre just a little brat Its all your fault You make me sick Youre trying to kill me Now whats the matter with you crybaby Go to your room You deserve it Eat it because children are starving Dont stick your lip out If you cry Ill slap you Dont you ever think about anyone else Get out of my sight Do as I say not as I do Hearing lines like these somewhere along the way you concluded that there was something wrong with you What else could you conclude If there were nothing wrong with you people wouldnt say things like that to you or treat you that way We heard those lines because those who spoke them had heard them It is with our awareness that we are to break the chain of saying such lines our awareness and compassion In order to do this we must take some words and phrases and retranslate them Thats is part of our agenda in the weeks ahead Meanwhile back to waiting There is a little story in the Bible that is very instructive It is found in Luke And the Lord replied Im talking to any faithful sensible man whose master gives him the responsibility of feeding the other servants If his master returns and finds that he has done a good job there will be a reward his master will put him in charge of all he owns But if the man begins to think My Lord wont be back for a long time and begins to whip the men and women he is supposed to protect and to spend his time at drinking parties and in drunkenness well his master will return without notice and remove him from his position of trust and assign him to the place of the unfaithful The master goes away and entrusts his estate to a servant who doesnt do what he is supposed to do Jesus was talking about the religious institution and religious leaders of his day If he were here he might be saying it to us Well we havent gone to beating people and getting drunk a lot but men and women have been beaten by the massive indifference of the church to the problems of race and poverty and peace and religious institutions have gotten drunk on buildings and power and prestige The reaction of some people to this behavior is a kind of disenchantment with the church or disgust with the church or indifference to the church I was astounded at the statistic when I heard it Sixty percent of persons now alive in this country have never been to church I graduated from high school on the eve of the Supreme Courts decision to desegregate public schools When I was just a little boy I knew about the injustice in the racial system in the South where I lived I was frustrated and angry with the church about its blindness about its participation in this system I wanted nothing to do with business as usual So I became part of a movement to abolish the old Down with bureaucracy Spirituality is about change The moment is now Stale water is turned into heady wine The new age is here The future is now We shall overcome There is no time for business as usual Lets grab the future in our bare hands and bring it here So we marched and we sat and we debated and wrote and then you know what we did We waited We realized we werent so powerful Now I can look back and see that though business as usual for a religious organization can get it away from its fundamental purpose and create a cultural ghetto dragging change in can be equally idolatrous Creating life isnt up to us we arent that powerful How maddening it is to discover that we dont know how to wait Whats more we are embarrassed about what it is we are waiting for So embarrassed Ive never even talked about it in here We are to wait But what good does it do to watch and wait if we dont know what we are looking for and waiting for What are we waiting for anyway Youre waiting for me to say Were waiting for the second coming Isnt that what you were talking about at work this past week No When I was working on this for today I had this fantasy during the week of someone inviting a visitor to this class and saying to that person something like Id like for you to come to my Sunday School Class Well Sunday School isnt for me But this isnt your usual Sunday School class Its not a Bible study no outdated religious language And so far today Ive read from the Bible and am talking about the second coming Let me say a word or two about the Bible Conflict about the Bible is the single most divisive issue among Christians especially in this country The conflict as Marcus Borg points out is about two very different ways of interpreting or reading the Bible One way is a literalfactual way and the other is a historicalmetaphorical way The literalfactual way is the way most fundamentalists approach the Bible As you might guess Im in the historicalmetaphorical camp This would be very important to how I would describe my religious posture Not only am I nonliteralistic but also nonexclusivistic I am living out my relationship to God within the Christian tradition but I want to honor the validity of all the enduring religious traditions There is no way to know what is the truth about this because there is no way we can step outside our own personal and cultural history and context Youll have to test for yourself whether what I am saying about this makes sense to you or not The conflict about the Bible can be seen showing up in three arenas First is the view over the creation of the earth creationism versus evolution The second is the raging debate dividing the church today over homosexuality The third has to do with ones view of Jesus The renewed quest for the historical Jesus has been met with much negativity among fundamentalist and conservative Christians To see Jesus as a man strikes at the very heart of their faith Fundamentalism regardless of which religion you find it in is a very modern phenomenon It is a reaction against modern culture and appeared in the United States only early in the twentieth century It stresses the infallibility and inerrancy of the Bible in every aspect And it has done so militantly Someone has said that a Fundamentalist is an evangelical Christian who is angry about something Martin Luther and John Calvin leaders of the Protestant Reformation certainly had high regard for the Bible but never took a view that it was infallible in the way current fundamentalists do You also have to keep in mind that ordinary people simply did not read the Bible until about years ago Only if you were educated and knew Latin Greek or Hebrew and had access to handwritten manuscripts could you do so Two events changed this One was the invention of the printing press and the other was the translation of the Scriptures into a common language Making the Bible available to everybody has been a mixed blessing A positive one is that it made real what the Protestant Reformation was all about the priesthood of believers or as Marcus Borg calls it the democratization of Christianity No longer are the riches of the Bible known only to a few When William Tyndale translated the Bible into English his reward was that he was burned at the stake He wanted to enable a boy that driveth the plow to know more of the Scriptures than a priest But the negative side is that it has made possible individual interpretations of the Bible that has led to more divisions among Christians than any other single thing Think of it prior to the invention of the printing press no one had seen such a thing as a Bible It didnt exist as a single bound book It was a collection of various manuscripts usually referred to as the Scriptures What we call the Gospels were first referred to as memoirs of the Apostles But once all the books were selected which is another story and bound into one volume it was easy to think of the Bible as a single book not the library that it is and that this book had a single author God Fundamentalism brings with it not only changes in how we view the Bible but in how we view so much else Like time Sherry pointed out to me an article in the New York Times yesterday on billable hours If one takes a billable hours approach to life every hour is just like every other There is not much room for quality worth satisfaction in a job well done or for ritual Take our personal relationships I ran across a phrase in Spirituality and Health that caught me up short Intimacy IntimeI see We are taught to keep time by billable hours to focus on quality time watch the clock etc Yet at the heart of a useful spiritual practice is how we relate to time I stress to you the importance of a practice I dont care what it is But something that consciously grounds you that gives you a perspective on your life and the events through which you navigate One of the most important spiritual practices can be summed up by the words watching and waiting But what are we watching and waiting for The Christian answer is the second coming Bear with me The watching and the waiting in spiritual practice is supposed to give an invigorating sense of existential urgency to the way we live our lives You know how we can allow drab routine to eat large hunks out of our lives And it is kind of hard to get that sense of urgency if it turns out that what were waiting for is something as seemingly farremoved as the second coming I asked a Jewish rabbi a redundancy once on the television show I did years ago if the Jews were still expecting the messiah He said About as much as you Christians are looking for the second coming Which is to say not much Not really Those of us who worship across the street say the Apostles Creed and it has the lines about Jesus coming back to judge the quick and the dead But lets face it Lets be honest In our daytoday lives none of us is craning our necks and straining our eyes waiting for some cosmic catastrophe that might occur in five seconds or five million years The second coming just doesnt have any realistic relationship to the way we live our lives So the notion of the second coming just drops out of sight And why shouldnt it I grew up being taught that Id better be careful because Jesus is coming back like a thief in the night When I was just a child I can remember Billy Graham assuring us that we were living in the last days Im both embarrassed and angry about the way this notion of the second coming has been used to manipulate and scare people into goodness Im not the only person in this room who has heard Dont do anything you wouldnt want to be caught doing when Jesus comes And yet I can say to you that learning to wait for the second coming is a large part of the art of living My goal in the rest of this presentation is to try to make that clear The second coming is not some date off out there in the future To wait literally for Jesus to appear in the sky is as misinformed as it would be to go on some archaeological search for the Garden of Eden and Adam and Eve Those things dont literally exist Never did What Jesus talked to people about was the urgency of the time in which they lived Thats what that story of his I read to you is about It is about an expected coming and a delay Jesus spoke this parable to the religious leaders of the day and was trying to arouse them to the fact that their day of destiny as the people of God was upon them right now They were being visited with the truth right now They were to know what hour it is and be ready They were to recognize the ultimate choices of life and death when those choices were present and they were present right now Thats what the early church was focusing on when it talked about the second coming They were giving life the urgency that life calls for they were recognizing the nearness of the ultimate the constant possibility of experiencing the presence of God They did that in the symbol of Christ coming back Spiritual language is full of symbols like that symbols that convey a truth that is greater than literal truth Symbols are what make truth vivid For example one abiding truth one of our continuing experiences is the tendency we have to deny our humanity and attempt to be God to ourselves This is what sin is This sin is such a central issue in the living of our lives that you can never really say all there is to say about it What is needed is a story to convey it Everything you always wanted to know about sin but were afraid to ask is therefore contained in a story about a man and a woman named Adam and Eve Thats the way it is with the second coming If you get hung up on or embarrassed by taking the symbol of the second coming literally youll miss its real meaning and impact Here it is There is nothing out there we need to draw into our lives there is nothing out there we need to keep out of our lives that will make us happy or bring us fulfillment Or that will keep us from experiencing the harm difficulties problems and failures that are a part of being human To get involved in either one of those activities is to miss the experience of hope and judgment right here right now If we turn our backs on this sometimes hard brutal grim world as it is we turn our backs on the only source for knowing God we ever have had or every will have If we turn our backs on the present by concentrating on getting stuff into or keeping stuff out of our lives well miss God in the now The heart of spiritual truth is about the reality that God is right here right now Now Ill grant this is sometimes hard to see Finding God in the world is sometimes like trying to see the picture in those magic eye things You have to develop another way of seeing Nothing is easier than to miss the God who is always present among us and between us The God who is present in the headlines of todays paper and in the requests of those who call for us to help I want what happens in here to be about God in the world now and the urgency of finding God in the world now Thats what the second coming is about The second coming is a powerful symbol that conveys a truth too important to forget Im not asking you to believe that Jesus is going to come knocking on your door tonight or that he is going to come back and walk the streets as a human being as he did before To get you to look for the second coming is just a dramatic way to get us to stop and think And thats just what happened in this room a few minutes ago when I first used the phrase second coming It got your attention Supposing our everyday lives were suddenly crossed by his What would he think of us or we of him Second coming Thats picture language Dramatic language It isnt describing in advance a literal event that you could pick up on a radar screen You know I hope that the story of Adam and Eve is not describing an incident that happened only once in the past The story of Adam and Eve and Cain and Able and all the rest describes something that continues to happen to all of us all the time Thats the way it is with the second coming It is not just a single event that might or might not happen in our lifetime If it were a literal event it would have meaning only for those in whose lifetime it took place The symbol of the second coming if understood properly helps us recognize and live with the reality that is meeting us all the time and continues to meet us all the time It is not just something that is confined to the end The phrase second coming is nowhere in the Bible A more accurate translation of it would be presence What it means is that we all the time live on the edge of time We forget this Our actions whether good or not have an ultimate significance Our actions whether good or not have effects of infinite range and scope We are always standing under incalculable responsibility We are to be faithful in little things because there are no little things We are to be faithful in Gods absence because God is never absent To be concerned with the end in this way is to deal with the right here right now Everywhere all the time what we call Christ is present No way of getting away from it Go wherever you want Wait till doomsday if you wish There is still that standard of love and justice all around us in the person who sitting next to you right now in the headlines of todays paper in the obscure stories on the back pages in the requests to meet the needs of the downandout that we feed lunches to across the street or in the socalled sophistication of the upandin worshipping in the cathedral across the street It is this presence we are to watch for It is this presence we are to wait for How do we do that How are we to structure our time so that we can be sensitive to that Holy Presence right here right now We are to wait I mentioned earlier that the word wait is used a hundred times in the Bible Of course the word wait is a translation from Hebrew and Greek into English As with all languages you cant translate from one into the other without losing something One meaning of the word wait in the Bible draws the picture of being stretched taut of being pulled Much as you might twist the strands of fiber to make a rope This is the tension of enduring So there is a line in the Psalms that goes My soul waits for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning You can almost see the passionate expectancy of the watchman eagerly looking out into the night watching for every little noise being alert watching for the dawn Thats waiting It is expecting something that hasnt happened to happen and it is to be looking out for it We are not pushed by the past or pulled by the future We are not what we have been nor what we will be At each moment we are free to change the significance of the past for the present and free to choose a new mode of expressing ourselves in the future Each moment demands that we make ourselves over by another free choice And that moment is now I dont know a better definition of spiritual wellbeing than this Spiritual wellbeing is the absence of elsewhereness It is presenteesism in contrast to absenteeism Years ago I was planning an event with my son and I asked him when he wanted to do it He said I want to do it in the middle of right now Thats the only time weve got There is another word for wait in the Bible It is a kind of quiet meditative passive waiting It is the kind of waiting we do when we are without any conscious awareness of Gods nearness It is in the line They that wait on the Lord shall renew their strength We shortchange this kind of waiting with our impatience and our franticness Yet this kind of waiting is a crucial part of every spiritual tradition Its the forty years in the wilderness and the fifty years in exile in the Old Testament It was the generations before Jesus came the days in the desert It is in waiting like this that the very reality of faith is unfolded because faith implies a certain not having a certain not knowing a certain being without It is in waiting like this that faith is faith and not superstition It is in this kind of waiting where being religious is so dangerous and being spiritual is so essential Somehow which is what I hope our times in here are ultimately all about we must learn to play this waiting game by holding both kinds of waiting together The passionate expectancy in one hand the mystery of it all in the other This is how we are to structure our time If you have ever had to do any significant waiting you know that its good to have a place to be while you wait Thats what this gathering we call Ordinary Life is about Someone asked once how do you join this class You cant join If you are here you are a member And if you are a member your business is about the management of this estate with which you have been entrusted There is a very instructive line in the middle of that story of Jesus Happy is the servant if the master finds that person faithfully discharging these duties when he comes again Its the happy that is in this prayer I offer for and about you May you be filled with loving kindness and compassion May you be happy May you be peaceful and at ease May you be well May no harm come to you May no difficulties come to you May no problems come to you May you always meet with success May you also be given the patience ability to wait the courage the understanding and the determination to meet and overcome the inevitable difficulties problems and failures that are a part of this life No

Subject ordinarylife Summary for November ORDINARY LIFE Thoughts and Ideas to Help You Live a Happier Life Summary of November Dear Folks This Sundays Ordinary Life gathering continued to focus on a spiritual response to the days following the events of and following One of the questions people are raising is What can we do to be safe This presentation responds to that question I shared with you how we realize what we visualize It is important to know the role and use of myth magic and ritual in our lives The key to released power for our time and lives is in personal responsibility It is also important to know the principle of cause and effect We are constantly tempted to forget that life is a gift that no one is special and that change can occur only at the conscious level This presentation also included the principles of mind and spirit we can use to meet our moral obligation to be happy Full text of the presentation Dancing in Difficult Times The title of my talk with you today is Dancing During Difficult Times These are those are they not At least it seems so We are assaulted by news we dont want to hear and yet if we dont pay some attention we may not know how to be alert I practice my own preaching at this point I never listen to the news or look at the paper until after I meditate in the morning I believe what the publication The Onion advised investors when the market dropped can apply to a multitude of matters They said Investors are advised to remain calm and leave the panic to the professionals But even after meditating when I pick up the New York Times it chills me Whats next Is there any way to be safe I was interviewed for the ten oclock news Friday night for the NBC affiliate here The interview lasted twenty minutes Twenty seconds got on the air During the interview the reporter asked me what I thought people needed to do to deal with their fear and stay safe during this time I said Dont smoke and wear your seat belt The fact is that far more people die on a regular basis as a result of cigarette smoking and car accidents than die as a result of the terror we read about in the paper I tried to find out exactly how many by doing a web search but only turned up finds of personal injury attorneys pleading for your business if youve been in a car accident I think God needs a good lawyer There are all these crackpots out there doing hateful things in Gods name I think Gods lawyer should go after them for libel slander defamation of character and more If you read any of Gods books you wont find God counseling people to harm the innocent That is simply not Gods desire I think it was Lily Tomlin who noted that if you talk to God thats called praying But if God talks to you thats schizophrenia For anyone to claim that God has told them to do something contrary to Gods will of love is nuts I am asked on a very regular basis by lots of people how do deal with anxiety during these troubled times So one answer is to keep a perspective In there were police reported motor vehicle crashes an increase of percent from people were killed people were injured An average of persons died each day in one every minutes That is more enough than to fill a jumbo jet every single week Let me offer you a perspective on something else I frequently get responses from folks some in person and many by email about the value of our gatherings for you Im so glad But listen to this I used to have a play a game as a child It was a game I used to play with my cousins We called it playing church Yes we also played doctor but my parents made us quit when my cousin tried to take out a neighbor childs appendix Church was one of our favorite games We would gather in my grandmothers living room where there was a grand piano and pick parts Someone would be the teacher of the makebelieve Sunday school class someone would be the pianist someone would be the song director etc Now I promise you I never had a saneconscious desire to be a parish minister But notice that is where in part where Ive ended up Just this week I had a memory of that childhood playtime and a realization that Im living that dream What that caused to occur in me is such a deep gratitude for you If it werent for you I couldnt do this No matter what happens in here in our times together I am the one who is most deeply benefited So I thank you so much that you make it possible for my unconscious dream to be true So there is one principle right there is it not What we visualize is what we realize The principles I am trying to teach the method of being I want to use in my life and present to you are things Ive been trying to get into my head and heart and hands for at least the past thirty years They are so simple and yet we never fully master them The good news is that we have the rest of our lives to do that no matter how long or short that might be I experience life in some of the same ways that I think you do too For example I frequently stray far off the path of what I teach I assume you do too I can fall for the cultures notion about security You know we begin to believe that there is something we can do to stay safe My eye condition has been a great teacher for me at this point One day out of the blue I began to have these flashers in my left eye Each time I had surgery I was confident I was on the other side of the difficulty Surely I thought things would get back to normal But the surgery failed I had another one It failed Another one Then two Sundays ago more flashers An emergency session with the surgeon on Monday revealed scar tissue forming on the retina causing the retina to bunch up in that place and thus tug at the edges of the retina risking more tears and a resulting detachment I sat there dumbfounded as the surgeon informed me that there is nothing that can be done about this Just wait and see what happens It will either go away or it wont Ah the lesson of patience Though I confess Im kind of tired of attending this particular class held by my eye Mother Teresa once said I know God never gives me more than I can handle but sometimes I wish He didnt have so much confidence in me One of the ways that we can more successfully move through these days of our lives is to pay careful attention to the role of myth magic and ritual in our lives Every week across the street we act out a great ritual And it itself is in the context of a great ritual and mythic story We will begin in a few weeks this mythic story all over again the first Sunday in Advent will lead us day by day all the way to the greatness of Easter morning and the Pentecost celebration that follows fifty days after that We go over this myth year after year Not because we dont know it but because we draw strength from participating in it It doesnt change but our understanding of it does our lives change our circumstances change Just so with the principles of Ordinary Life If we dont have ways to remind us of the principles of Ordinary Life well drift away and become very frightened or cynical or lost In our society there are notions that function as gods that lead us far astray from who we really are and what life is really about Money is one of our gods isnt it Status can be And there are many others Our task is to dethrone these things and learn how life really works and make what we learn help us create the life we want and want the life we have We are not what we do We are not what we have Life is in our being Another way of stating this is that we create the world we live in by our beliefs The worldview we hold is responsible for the quality of our lives We are responsible for the content of our lives No terrorist is responsible for the content of my life I am one hundred percent responsible This is the key to released power The understanding you have of your world is your religion These are not comfortable teachings for us Why is that Well the fundamental bottom line reason is that if we look at life as it is we have to face up to our death and that is just too much Dont worry Im not going there right now For the moment lets think about cause and effect and see if we can use this principle to help us live the principle of our having a moral obligation to be happy even though we are assaulted by news we dont want to hear about terrorist attacks anthrax and all that jazz The law of cause and effect means This is this way because that is that way Cause and effect means that everything is connected to everything When you are working with this principle it is critically important to practice nonjudgment Most of us have some notion of what it would mean to live heroically in the face of whatever life has to dish out to us Right We know of people like Helen Keller or Ann Frank who lived their lives in the midst of and in spite of difficult times So we know what heroic living looks like But notice also how easy it is for us to fall off the path When I was at Harvard there was a prayer we prayed Dear God deliver me from the sin of intellectual pride which for your information means It is so easy to fall off the path And also notice the consequences when we do Lets look at some truths about life and how quickly and easily we can move away from them For example Life is a gift but we live as if we had to work to earn it None of us is special but we live lives of intense competition The only way you can change your life is at the consciousness level but we act like we can change it at the material level through what we have andor do Get this What you are about is love There is no way you can be about something else You are created in the image of love You can withhold love or distort it but you cant get away from it Ive been using the phrase principle of equality in my teachings with you lately If we come at life if we come at other nations if we come at our relationships committed to inequality we are not going to experience life But we learn the principle of inequality early One of you sent me this Just had to email you this before I forgot Today in the last service there was a little boy sitting behind me with his parents He must have been about or yrs old During the baptism he says in a startled voice trying to whisper but not quite managing to Oh my gosh That is a real live baby up there I didnt know they let babies into church They dont know nuthin I had to grin If he only knew that is why the rest of us are here Often we try to practice our spiritual principles when it is comfortable and convenient for us But when a tragedy strikes we revert to defensive and reactionary beliefs and behaviors You cannot ride two horses with one behind Otherwise you are going to get real sore You will become known as what is called a lost soul I have found a ton of help in Buddhist psychology and practices Whatever your religious beliefs are I believe this can be true for you too One of the things Ive learned by investigating this territory is that there are principles that accurately describe the way life works If we know these and live them we will be happier people We will have more of the life we want When years ago I first tried to translate these principles into my own life and language the way I worded them was like this What we believe creates the world we live in All that we accomplish with our lives is a direct result of our thoughts We are what we think and our character is the complete sum of our thoughts Individual responsibility for this must be absolute This is the way Buddha put it The thought manifests as the word The word manifests as the deed The deed develops into habit And habit hardens into character So watch the thought and its ways with care And let it spring from love Born out of concern for all being By and large we get in life what we expect to get We have a tendency to attract into our lives those events and experiences that harmonize with out dominant belief systems If I were to ask you to go into the next room and count all of the blue things you see Im sure you could do that You could come back and report some number of your counting But then if I were to ask you While you were in there how many brown things did you see your report would be nonexistent or not accurate because brown is not what you were looking for This is called sorting What do you sort for We do this also by the questions we ask ourselves every morning as we are beginning our day What we dwell on grows in our experience This says something about the importance of meditation and prayer You can hold only one thought at a time If you dont like what is in your mind replace it substitute it with something else This is the principle of substitution Then there is the principle of work or practice I talked to the reporter about the importance of being present She thought for a moment and said Thats very hard to do How do you learn to do it My response Like learning any other skill You practice I dont know a thing in the world worth doing that doesnt take practice and work When the first astronauts made it to the moon and were walking about one of them said This seems like old home week What did that mean It meant that they had practiced that walk so much in simulation that it seemed familiar to them Relaxation and play This is one of the most important needs of the Self of the soul We are in different many ways to practice a Sabbath in our lives So many of us dont We just work work work Play by the way doesnt mean the competitive combat so many engage in and rest doesnt mean sleeping and napping One of the biggest causes that keeps people from finding satisfaction in life is playing into the victim mentality The victim mentality simply defined is that outlook or attitude that says My life is essentially at the mercy of vast powerful forces out there and beyond my control Therefore I am at the mercy of My history my upbringing my genes my heritage My social class my education or lack of it or my IQ or lack of it My parents my teachers or an invalid relative My mate my partner My boss my supervisor my manager or my coworkers The economy the times we live in the social structure or our form of government The politicians the large corporations or the rich Some particular enemy who is out to get me and who has great power The Victim Mentality ultimately discharges you from any responsibility for your life since clearly what is happening to you is not your fault Im not saying there are no victims Let a good hurricane occur around here and folks are made victims quickly But there is a vast difference between being a victim and having a victim mentality One means dealing heroically with what you have to deal with and the other means giving up I believe each one of us always has more control over our lives than we think is the case No matter how much of our life we see as unchangeable there is always that part that is under our control and that we can work on to change Even if it is only it is almost always more than we think Although we work in some predictable ways almost machine like were not machines You can cut a machine off What you believe however continually does something with the energy that is going through you If you are afraid of losing your job if you are afraid of losing your mate if you are afraid there will never be a Mr notso wrong for you guess what The universe is going to support you in having those be your life experiences Here is something I have mentioned to you before but it fits again in this context There is a risk we need to keep in our minds We have parts of our lives we are not clear about Affecting this lack of clarity are forces in our society powerful forces that are focused on us all the time These are in the form of television radio newspapers magazines salespersons employers relatives and friends They have many ideas about what we should be thinking When we avoid making clear decisions about what is best for us we tend to adopt the ideas of these other sources without even being aware that we are doing it It is like your being is a sponge You can fill the sponge with love forgiveness peace confidence abundance affirmation gratitude and joy OR we can leave the sponge partly dry and the world will fill it for us Thats why we need to practice a way that keeps the quality of life experience we want for ourselves in our consciousness Thats our choice When we dont make it someone else will make it for us Okay What might be a practical application of this If these principles are true and if the ultimate nature of all that is is love then how are we to live I believe we are more in alignment with the purpose for our lives when we are experiencing and expressing the following Love peace forgiveness confidence hope abundance affirmation faith gratitude and joy and happiness Whatever your specific purpose is these states of being fit your basic purpose in life So here is the process First we look around and notice what is Second we accept it without judgment of any kind This sometimes requires practice The skill you are practicing here is forgiveness Or the principle of responsibility Until we learn to bring mindfulness to every aspect of our lives a stance of mindfulness all the time everywhere we are in hell If you wait for the circumstances of your life to change before you develop mindfulness youll never get there We can easily fall into being dependent on others without even realizing it It was autumn and the Indians on the remote reservation asked their new Chief if the winter was going to be cold or mild Since he was an Indian Chief in a modern society he had never been taught the old secrets and when he looked at the sky he couldnt tell what the weather was going to be Nevertheless to be on the safe side he replied to his tribe that the winter was indeed going to be cold and that the members of the village should collect wood to be prepared But also being a practical leader after several days he got an idea He went to the phone booth called the National Weather Service and asked Is the coming winter going to be cold It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold indeed the meteorologist at the weather service responded So the Chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more wood in order to be prepared A week later he called the National Weather Service again Is it going to be a very cold winter Yes the man at National Weather Service again replied its definitely going to be a very cold winter The Chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of wood they could find Two weeks later he called the National Weather Service again Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold Absolutely the man replied Its going to be one of the coldest winters ever How can you be so sure the Chief asked The weatherman replied The Indians are collecting wood like crazy Then third you practice experiencing andor expressing one of the states of being that reflects your spiritual beliefs Let me give you an example one of you offered me Recently Dr Bob Bell visited Istanbul You might remember that he made comments in here about his visit to a mosque there After returning to Houston he wrote the following letter to their tour guide We want to thank you so much for your kindness patience charm and wit while putting up with us We arrived back in Houston Texas without incident on October th Our country continues to be traumatized and anxious Now it is Anthrax that has us in a panic We have had things too easy for too long over here This may be Gods wake up call to us and we are finding it difficult to accept In church this morning we read the following from Pauls second letter to Timothy New Testament Christian Bible This is a portion For the time is coming when people will not put up with sound doctrine but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own desires and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander away to myths As for you always be sober endure suffering do the work of an evangelist carry out your ministry fully I think this applies to both of our faiths and I encourage you and all others to live your religion fully and with a burning devotion Together we will defeat this thing and come out stronger and closer in our love for each other We will not have another Crusade We ride together this time May GodAllahYahweh richly bless us all There is a rhythm to this dance The first step is made as quickly as possible The second may take a bit longer if there is homework to do We want to make the third one last as long as possible Think about it If you learn to be present the dance takes place all by itself You are aware of the flowing feelings within you starting with love I love so much about and within life From that love flows a sense anguish and despair when I realize that I cant hold on to anything or anyone I love That is followed by a sense of wonder and awe that I have been permitted to participate in any of it What flows from that is a sense of victory and triumph And from that a sense of joy And from that joy a sense of awe at the wonder of it all Which ends up leading me once again to love Which causes the dance to start all over again Thats the flow Our job is to learn to celebrate every aspect of it Let me read you an embodiment of this in a recent message from the Hopi Elders You have been telling the people that this is the Eleventh Hour Now you must go back and tell the people that this is the Hour And there are things to be considered Where are you living What are you doing What are your relationships Are you in right relation Where is your water Know your garden It is time to speak your Truth Create your community Be good to each other And do not look outside yourself for the leader This could be a good time There is a river flowing now very fast It is so great and swift that there are those who will be afraid They will try to hold on to the shore They will feel they are being torn apart and they will suffer greatly Know the river has its destination The elders say we must let go of the shore push off into the middle of the river keep our eyes open and our heads above the water See who is in there with you and celebrate At this time in history we are to take nothing personally Least of all ourselves For the moment that we do our spiritual growth and journey comes to a halt The time of the lone wolf is over Gather yourselves Banish the word struggle from your attitude and your vocabulary All that we do now must be done in a sacred manner and in celebration We are the ones weve been waiting for The Elders Oraibi Arizona Hopi Nation No matter where you go this week no matter what happens remember this You are carrying precious cargo Watch your step Ordinary Life is a gathering that provides

You Live a Happier Life Summary of November Dear Folks Its going to be difficult to give a summary of our gathering for this past Sunday Several people got up and gave their reasons reactions to Thanksgiving Ive included below some of the remarks I made and what I had available of what others contributed to the occasion It was to me a wonderful gathering Enjoy Much love Bill Kerley Thanksgiving This past week contained our national holiday Thanksgiving As I see it you and I have so much for which to be grateful That we are here able to participate in and benefit from this gathering is so profound a blessing Last week I wasnt here I was visiting with my father and brother in Tennessee It was almost the first time Ive gotten to fly since my eye challenge So I hadnt seen my Dad since shortly after my mothers death in January I am grateful to and for my parents Im grateful not only for their long lives but for the many gifts I have received from them As I visited with my father and brother I was aware of such a rich history Im grateful for that Im grateful for growth itself I noticed for example that I was relieved to notice that I have gotten over my sibling rivalry issues Of course my fancypantsMrBigShotretired vicepresidentofabigcorporation hasnt Im grateful for life itself I heard a story recently about a man who was in the hospital His wife was with him when the doctor came in to visit the man The man was suffering from some mysterious malady After a few minutes examining the patient the doctor called the wife out into the hall He said to her Ive done all I can do for your husband Im going to dismiss him Your husband is suffering from a very serious disease combined with horrible stress If you dont do the following your husband can die Each morning fix him a healthy breakfast Be pleasant and make sure he is in a good mood For lunch fix him a nutritious meal For dinner prepare an especially nice meal for him Dont burden him with chores Dont discuss your stress this will probably make him feel worse And most importantly you must be intimate with your husband every day of the week If you can do this for at least ten months to a year I think your husband will regain his health completely On the way home the husband asked his wife When the doctor called you out into the hall what did he say to you She reached over and patted him on the leg and said He said that youre going to die I am also grateful to and for you I issued some invitations for folks to come and share their reasons for being grateful I dont know who might respond but if you are here and want to do that now is the time At this point the following people spoke to the Ordinary Life gathering Marti Nelson spoke about her experience at the Day The Retreat of Noble Silence She said that it was one of the most difficult and important things she has ever done for herself Even more difficult than the chemotherapy she has been through the past year for cancer But so valuable She encouraged everyone to do it Then Ron Marr came with some words he had prepared for the occasion Im going to share some of them here The Truth About Thanksgiving Some years ago Bill observed If the work of art you are creating is your life you dont want the canvas to be too small My thanksgiving story is a life in process and thankfully its fabric keeps expanding I once led a class on the subject Truth Telling In preparing I gathered numerous quotes collected over the years some humorous some wise Attempting somehow to reconcile the many themes running wild through the pages I observed that all Christian truth is relational Some cosmologists and quantum physicists would argue that at some level the same is true for the physical universe In one way or another all significant venues of my existence involve some aspect of my relationship with God my relationship with myself my relationship with my fellow human beings andor my relationship with the planet and all other living things Its in these realms I experience my deepest sadness and my greatest joys In each I encounter the inescapable drama of separation and reconciliation and gratefully the alchemy of grace In the days following my soul ached and I felt a great sadness Not only for the obvious tragedy but also for the remnants of fear anger judgment and separation that persist to some extent in our own hearts and communities We have difficulty fully loving and accepting our selves to the point where we can receive effortlessly and without resistance or manipulation the love constantly being extended to us Even within our churches we have yet to fully embrace those of differing race sexual orientation and faith traditions One writer following characterized the real war as between those who worship a god of anger judgment and those who worship a God of Love And I am grateful for a wave moving silently through the land the revaluing of living authentically the honest sharing of fears and dreams being expressed in so many gatherings following for peoples everywhere in every arena now holding hands with those who were invisible or worse only a brief time earlier An intimate connection seems to exist between the quest for honesty and a transparent personality Since my divorce many years ago Thanksgiving and Christmas have too often found me mired in sadness longing for my kids Too often reliving the pain of so many losses not fully grieved Especially the loss of deep intimacy and family with which I crave so deeply to feel a belonging This week I had the privilege of delivering to my father the gift he had selected from his nursing home bed for my stepmothers birthday I also brought a couple of cards that sounded very much like him Signing one of the cards took almost fifteen minutes and I feared his note would be illegible Looking closer I could read the tiny shaking letters and the four words All my love Dick And I knew the powerful connection of family and felt sheer joy at having been in some small way a conduit for my best friends love If you are interested in the full text of Rons remarks email him at At this point I remarked about how wonderful people are So creative and inventive There are so many different ways to look at things Each of us sees things differently Arent you grateful for the human mind itself And for having a sound mind Jim and Mary were both patients in a Mental Hospital One day while they were walking past the hospital swimming pool Jim suddenly jumped into the deep end He sunk to the bottom stayed there Mary promptly jumped in to save him She swam to the bottom and pulled Jim out When the medical director became aware of Marys heroic act he immediately ordered her to be discharged from the hospital as he now considered her to be mentally stable When he went to tell Mary the news he said Mary I have good news bad news The good news is youre being discharged because since you were able to jump in and save the life of another patient I think youve regained your senses The bad news is Jim the patient you saved hung himself with his bathrobe belt in the bathroom I am so sorry but hes dead Mary replied He didnt hang himself I put him there to dry To prove how creative people are Stephanie Warfield Chaplain at St Lukes Episcopal Hospital came and read excerpts from her most recent Chaplains Journal This included reading a list of things for which she was grateful As she read the list I read the faces of those who were present What she said seemed to spark memories of things that perhaps wed otherwise have forgotten about Bob Stecker came and reminded us about the importance of humor in life with a story from his days as a drama director Jean Snyder told of her gratitude for all the help and support she felt while she and Marti went through a year of Martis cancer treatment and recovery Casey Kelly came to give one brief line It was this Life is a comedy tragedy is the long moment before we get the joke I reflect back on the themes we strike in here over and over They are There is no enlightenment out there This is it What matters most of all is to have a true present Doing so is very difficult We spend so much of our lives dwelling on past regrets and or fantasizing future disasters or hopes It takes a long time to grow in wisdom to say nothing of the time it takes to think well If you truly want to be free give up judging comparing and needing to know why Be happy That is not a nice wish like have a nice day It is an instruction In a world like ours it is a moral obligation to be joyful I am grateful that we have the opportunity to revisit these and other notions as the circumstances of our lives and our lives themselves continue to ebb and flow with the passing of time A very dear friend of mine Linda McCleskey who lives in Seattle sent me a poem that is fitting to close this celebration of gratitude with A Poem by Starhawk Community Somewhere there are people to whom we can speak with passion without having the words catch in our throats Somewhere a circle of hands will open to receive us eyes will light up as we enter voices will celebrate with us whenever we come into our own power Community means strength that joins our strength to do the work that needs to be done Arms to hold us when we falter A circle of healing A circle of friends Someplace where we can be free Im glad that this gathering which we call Ordinary Life is that for those of us who choose to be present This has gotten to be my closing ritualblessing to you No matter where you go

Live a Happier Life Summary of July Dear Folks Before I forget it my beautiful bride wants to know if one of you is responsible for the bird feeder that appeared hanging in one of the trees in our front yard Im honoring her request to inquire Also I was not going to do this but Ive had several requests for the text of the sermon I gave Sunday at St Pauls My reluctance in doing this is that sermons unlike the talks I give in our regular Ordinary Life gathering are meant to be heard and not read Sermons are set in a particular liturgical setting and use a language unique to that context Nonetheless Im posting it below If you dont care for sermons or dont like being preached to just delete it Stay well Bill Kerley THE BEST NEWS YOU EVER HEARD I am so glad you are here today Ive been thinking about you all week Actually longer than that I was hoping you would be here because I have something to say just to you Before I tell you want it is let me tell you what Im shooting for in this sermon I want you leave here today saying Thats the best news Ive ever heard Not only that I want you leave here with an ability to see the world in a new way So that you can infect others with this good news Dont misunderstand I dont want you to leave here feeling smug because your prejudices have been confirmed I want it to be because a transformation of values and beliefs takes place here so that you can leave this place to lead a new life You know as well as I do that so many people dont live life at all They just exist Getting by from day to day Some people have trouble just seeing what is Friends of mine became deeply concerned when their daughter a straightA student and who had never offered them a minute of serious difficulty showed up to introduce her new boy friend His hair was at least four different vivid colors he had tattoos over all exposed places on his body and so many pieces of metal piercing his body that the father wondered How does this guy get through a metal detector at the airport The parents endured this encounter and when it was over began to try to reason with their daughter that perhaps this young man was not the best choice for a boyfriend When they said things that implied they questioned his character the daughter assured them that he was of the highest moral sort Really said the parents How can you be so sure of that The daughter said Well if he werent why would he be doing hours of community service Some people cant see what is Plus we can talk ourselves into almost anything we want Ive come to see that very often we do not so much love the truth as we make true what we love Learning to live the life God wants for us is determined by what we say yes to and what we say no to In the gospel text for today Martha is described as being distracted As one translation has it She is concerned about all she has to do Jesus in commenting on Marys choice to spend time with him talking and learning Jesus says and this is my translation Martha you worry and fuss about a lot of things but only a few things are necessary really only one and that part that Mary has chosen is the most important of all and you must not tear her away from it Mary has learned what to say yes to That is the secret of life It is not easy to do Being able to do it is both a gift of grace and extremely hard work But it is what makes the difference between living and existing Our lives your life is shaped by what you say yes to Outside the walls of a place like this there is almost no place or activity that encourages us to say yes to real life We are encouraged at every turn to believe that our happiness is in what we have or what we do And though this process never really satisfies we are reluctant to give up on it The two chief forces of consumer marketing are desire and fear Eat this drink this do this drive this and you will be happy If you dont you wont Take this pill and avoid pain Dont take it and suffer The spiritual teachings of the world however clearly say that desire and fear are our two biggest barriers to a truly happy life One of the things saying yes to life means is to see life as a demand Thats a problem for us because most of us have grown up buying into the notion that no one should make demands on us We want to be free One of our mottoes is Dont you dare tell me what to do But make no mistake about it life is demand The demand is that you must choose your own life No one else can do that for you Not if your living is to be satisfying and significant Thats work you have to do Most of us live life as if it were a trial run for a second chance ambling along meaning to do many things yet somehow never quite getting around to most of them And all too suddenly life is gone There is no time for trial runs in life Whatever is important in life should be firmly grasped now Whatever is to be done should receive our best Whatever dreams we have should be pursued Whatever joy and beauty we find should be shared and savored If misfortune finds us as it surely will it should be conquered quickly lest precious days for living be lost forever Life is fragile and should be handled with care and prayer Martha got distracted doing what she thought was important Now there is a certain truth in Marthas position Jesus was coming for dinner I saw a line once somewhere that said If you are expecting God for breakfast you dont burn the toast Certainly we must do in life But Marthas doing had distracted and worried her so much that she couldnt enjoy the party My word is that true for our culture This pace of life sneaks up on us and we get seduced into thinking that just because its possible we need to be doing it that if we dont get with what everyone else is doing well be left behind Consequently we have created and live in a culture where you have phone numbers to reach your family of three You chat several times a day with a stranger from South Africa but you havent spoken to your next door neighbor yet this year Leaving the house without your cell phone which you didnt have the first or years of your life is a cause for panic and turning around to get it Cleaning up the dining room means getting the fast food bags out of the back seat of your car Most of us like Martha feel hard pressed to deal with the hundreds of things that compete for our attention daily Nearly every minute of our daily life revolves around job and mortgage bills and debts personal ambitions and family problems with an occasional expensive exhausting vacation thrown in for diversion Thats what we call the good life We have come to think that we have no alternatives What used to be called the fast lane has taken over our whole highway But a spiritual fact is that if we do not make the choice that Mary did if we do not touch the sacred we will have done nothing That wonderful passage in the Old Testament that Ill bet all of you are familiar with doesnt say Be loving and know that I am God or Be obedient and know that I am God It says Be still and know that I am God The hectic pace at which we try to live is not of course the kind of demand Im talking about We dont have life because of what we do When like Mary we choose the one thing needful and become quiet and still at his feet we find ourselves doing all sorts of things Not in order to have life but because we see the wondrous love we have been given and we cant stay still about it Let me tell you something and I hope you hear this as the best news you ever heard You dont have to earn the right to be here You dont have to prove your worth You are born worthy You dont have to compete for a place in life Theres already a place for you You dont have to go somewhere else to live The opportunity for abundant life surrounds you where you are You dont have to bargain with God or plead with God or manipulate God to get Gods favor or attention Youve already got both of these things Here is some solid Wesleyan Methodist theology In Jesus Christ God has already said a loud clear yes to you It took me years to get this message and I can still fall off the path about it Somewhere along the line I bought the message that my worth depended on what I did If I did an inadequate job at something it meant that I was inadequate If I failed at something I was a failure If I did a bad thing I was bad Im not meaning to be hard on myself or others Its so easy to get this message growing up A child goes to a parent and says What should I wear to the party tonight The parent says Wear whatever you like Soon the child emerges dressed for the party and says How to do you like this No no honey the parent says Stripes and polka dots dont go together Go back and change either the shirt or the slacks One week later the child says What should I wear to the party tonight Ive told you over and over wear whatever you like Why do you always ask me Why indeed You might as well face up to this There is nothing you can do learn or buy that can make it possible for you to escape disapproval If you are living that way you are living hopelessly burying chunks of yourself every day If you can see right now how worthy and wonderful you are youll not be depressed when approval is withheld as it surely will be Disappointed maybe but not depressed There is a demand in life never mistake it That demand comes as a result of our seeing how loved and accepted we are When his followers went to him and asked Lord how will people know that we belong to you his answer was simple and significant He didnt say People will know you are mine by what you believe about the Bible or the virgin birth or the resurrection Or any to the other doctrinal matters Christians have their silly disputes over What he said was People will know that you are mine by the way you love one another Thats the demand And we live it joyfully because weve heard the best news ever in his saying You belong to me Not only is life promise and demand Life is also freedom and responsibility Again it is easy for us to hear only one part of this the part about freedom Lord do we ever want to be free Free to do our own thing If there is one thing that can make us bristle it is someone else trying to tell us what to do But folks freedom without responsibility is an illusion a joke a fraud Freedom to do what you want when you want is not freedom its licence Authentic freedom in our theology is the power to become what you can become To be free really free is to be responsible that is to have the ability to respond to life in such a way as to move toward Gods intention for your life Thats freedom I love this church I love so much about it The freedom the acceptance Ive felt from the first The way it looks and feels The people This church is made up of such wonderful people Well except for two or three And you know who you are We have the freedom to be church Ive been part of this community of faith for sixteen or seventeen years now And almost from the beginning Ive been tempted to sneak in here at night and change the wording on these signs you see up here They say Enter to Worship and Depart to Serve I think thats backwards Real church is made possible when we all understand that we Enter to Serve and Depart to Worship Sure there are times when out of our need we come here to be taken care of in some way But if we all did that all the time there would be no church at all I think one of the things that makes it sometimes so difficult to take in the good news is that we have closed ourselves to serving to giving to contributing All throughout my ministry Ive heard people be critical of the church and God knows a lot of that criticism we deserve I wonder what the Jesus I know would say about a lot of the stuff we say and do I wonder if he wouldnt look at some of our beliefs and behaviors scratch his head and say Thats not what I had in mind at all Be that as it may this church will be the kind of church for you that you want to the precise degree to which you exercise your freedom to be responsible for seeing to it that we are the kind of church you want To the degree that church happens here when we leave this place we are to take our sense of joy and confidence into the world with us We are to get new eyes in here so that we can see God at work in the world This is true worship and the test of our rituals here that we live with reference to a transcendent reality out there whether we feel like it or not That we dont go unconscious and drift into life as usual In the Gospel selection Jesus says that Mary chose the better part that she had hold of something that could not be taken from her I know you and me well enough to know that that is our hearts desire to choose that which cannot be taken from us I also know that we so often look in the wrong places for it Mary chose to be present to Jesus Thats the trick To be here to be present We get so distracted like Martha planning for the big someday that we miss the fact that the future we have been hoping for is right here right now This is the only day you have to do your living Now dont mishear that To live with no eye on the future is to live with no meaning in the present Life that is real and lasting comes from giving yourself to something lasting Thats what Mary chose Our critical task it seems to me is to learn the difference between filling up a day and fulfilling a day Until we have learned to live for something other than me now we have not learned to live for today or tomorrow That kind of living comes listen carefully Im going to give you the definition of eternal life that kind of living comes when we learn to penetrate our past with sacred memories when we learn to accept the future with hopeful expectancy when we learn to saturate our present with an acceptance of ourselves and each other as people created in the image of God In that is eternal life And that this kind of living is available to you and me that it is possible for you and me is the best news you could possibly ever hear I want you to hear the Good News best news you ever heard That no matter how far you may think you are away from it or on the other hand how smugly you may think you dont need it God loves you exactly the way you are I cannot think of better news than that Now go live it Let this news transform you so that you begin to see the world in an entirely different way What might that look like Frederick Buechner says that when you get to the heart of all good theology all you are left with is a story Stories like A man was journeying from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among thieves Who do you think was neighbor to him Stories like A certain man had two sons and one demanded his inheritance Stories like He entered a certain home where a woman named Martha welcomed him So let me tell you a story Years ago in the world of professional golf before Tiger Woods transformed the game the sport was very different Didnt get a lot of publicity Prizes werent very big Golfers usually drove themselves from tournament to tournament The tournaments themselves werent played for television audiences with big corporate sponsors but for local communities and the country clubs The purses were of course considerably smaller A golfer from Australia won a tournament at a club in Georgia His purse was something like As he was leaving after the closing ceremonies and visiting with the others he went to get in his car A woman who had been in the gallery confronted him in the parking lot begging for his help She had come to that part of the country following her golfer husband Even though he was alcoholic and abusive she hoped to make her marriage work Not only had it not but now she was on her on away from home No family No support Even worse her baby was very sick in need of medical help She had no resources She was desperate Her story was so touching to the golfer that he simply endorsed his winning check over to her Thats doing The next year he returned for the same tournament The pro at that golf club knowing what had happened last year decided to tell the man from Australia that the woman was a con artist She had in reality bilked him out of those winnings The golfer was stunned at this news He then responded You mean that woman lied to me Yes You mean to tell me that I was tricked Yes You mean to tell me that there is no sick baby Thats right Thats the best news I ever heard Thats what I want For you to get the best news you ever heard here about yourself about the way life is so that you and I and you and I together can go out there and live lives where we see the world and ourselves and each other in the way he wants us to see That we see ourselves and each other in the way he sees us That we see the world in the way he wants us to That we see in a way that would cause him to say about us You have chosen the one thing that really matters I am so glad youve been here today Ive been thinking about you all week Actually longer than that I was hoping you would be here because I had something to say just to you Now Ive said it I hope youve heard it as the best news you ever heard Ordinary Life is a gathering that provides an opportunity to develop an enlightened heart and an awakened mind to the reality of the present moment The gathering meets on

January AM To Subject ordinarylife An Appeal from Bolivia ORDINARY LIFE Thoughts and Ideas to Help You Live a Happier Life Summary of January Dear Folks This online newsletter offering previews and summaries of the Ordinary Life gathering now goes to almost people all over the United States and in at least three foreign countries that I know of I am both delighted and stunned that my rantings are useful to so many Of course I hope what I have to teach has universal applicability even though it is spoken to a group of to folks in Houston each week Sometimes things are more meaningful to the local gathering That may be the case for what happened this past Sunday Then again maybe not Read on Richard Wingfield put together a moving and informative video about work that the Ordinary Life gathering has had a stake in for some years now We have sent both people and money to our sister church in Cochabamba Bolivia I want to quote at length from a letter sent to the Ordinary Life gathering by Wilson Boots He was on the video shown Sunday I trust that you have had opportunity to see the video record filmed by Richard Wingfield of the dedication of the health clinic at Emmanuel Methodist in Cochabamba Bolivia It was a wonderful day filled with hope for the host of church and community people who gathered to celebrate this special moment With much gratitude we expressed heartfelt thanks for the vision and commitment of the Ordinary Life Class that through your special offing made possible the construction of this community health center Its location adjacent to the back wall of our small church sanctuary symbolizes in a special way the profound Gospel dimensions of the healing and health that are shared here daily in the lives of very poor people of the community It will be of interest to you to know that the small room where Rev Diane Wimberley is living during her year of service with Emmanuel is just thirty feet away from this modest clinic Diane is involved daily in ministry with the dedicated community MD and nurse who provide such excellent care for so many children women and men who have no other possibilities for medical care due to their situation of poverty and absence of other health care alternatives This is a time of serious crisis however for this medical outreach ministry Due to the general economic crisis in Bolivia and the ending of financial support for the Doctor and nurse due to the unusual circumstances of the international organization that has been giving support the work of this medical outpost has been seriously curtailed In fact if minimal monthly funding cannot be made available for at least a few months until some alternative grant can be secured it is the real possibility that the clinic will be closed I want to ask your consideration for the possibility of some immediate support of this urgent need Diane Wimberley sent a letter to Richard Wingfield in which she also explains the situation I cites parts of it One of the things that I am writing about is a need for money The center is in bad shape The doc is having to cut his hours back in order to take another job a situation caused both by the situation here and his practice not pulling in what it should due to the economic crisis in the country He is a rare one who is deeply committed to this center and everything that it stands for He recruits other docs in the city to volunteer works on soliciting other clients He basically has told me that his life was changed by the center when he began and nothing can make him leave it now So he will work three jobs for the government which he hates for the university in his private practice and come here hours in the middle of the day He is completely committed to helping children and their families Diane states that up until this crisis he was being paid a month by the center That is the amount she is asking for from Ordinary Life I have gotten both calls and emails from folks after last Sunday indicating that people are more than willing to see us do this or perhaps even more We didnt have time to discuss this Sunday but I wanted you to have this information and well talk about it when we gather this week Thanks again to Richard Wingfield for doing such an outstanding job bringing us the story Much love Bill Kerley Ordinary Life is a gathering that provides an

to all of you who responded to the need for financial help in our medical work in Bolivia I cant recall experiencing such generosity We are going to be able to give them more than they requested Plus several people are already on the list to go down with the next work crew and one person is going to help arrange getting medical supplies to the clinic Wow Thanks The material I offered focused on how our Western approach to the truth and how modernity have had destructive effects on our religious and spiritual well being We have become fact fundamentalists I also deal with the perplexing question of what Jesus might do in dealing with terrorism The lesson ends with a telling of an ancient story from Ethiopia about the battle between Truth and Falsehood What follows is a full text of the presentation Is The Story Youre Telling With Your Life the Truth A boat docked in a tiny Mexican village An American tourist complimented the Mexican fisherman on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took him to catch them Not very long answered the Mexican But then why didnt you stay out longer and catch more asked the American The Mexican explained that his small catch was sufficient to meet his needs and those of his family The American asked But what do you do with the rest of your time I sleep late fish a little play with my children and take a siesta with my wife In the evenings I go into the village to see my friends have a few drinks play the guitar and sing a few songs I have a full life The American interrupted I have an MBA from Harvard and I can help you You should start by fishing longer every day You can then sell the extra fish you catch With the extra revenue you can buy a bigger boat With the extra money the larger boat will bring you can buy a second one and a third one and so on until you have an entire fleet of trawlers Instead of selling your fish to a middleman you can negotiate directly with the processing plants and maybe even open your own plant You can then leave this little village and move to Mexico City Los Angeles or even New York City From there you can direct your huge enterprise How long would that take asked the Mexican Twenty perhaps twentyfive years replied the American And after that Afterwards Thats when it gets really interesting answered the American laughing When your business gets really big you can start selling stocks and make millions Millions Really And after that After that youll be able to retire live in a tiny village near the coast sleep late play with your children catch a few fish take a siesta and spend your evenings drinking and enjoying your friends Ordinary Life auditor Wayne Herbert sent me that and it is just a wonderful story about the kinds of things I want us to be about I sometimes refer to what wants to happen in here with the phrase Journey Into Wholeness It is so easy for those of us in the West to think that that journey is out there somewhere in the outer world The goal of spiritual work is to become a self Or to become aware of the Self I cant adequately explain to you what this self is It is the center and at the same time the circumference of the personality It embraces both consciousness and unconsciousness The Self is known as the Christ in Christianity Journey into Wholeness The root meaning of the word holiness is this wholeness Wholeness involves finding the missing parts or the faculties that are lacking in our natures and restoring them to a dignified place in our personality Usually for those of us in the Western world our need as reflected in the story of the Mexican fisherman is relatedness relatedness to ourselves as well as to others This is the principle of equality Ive spoken to you about so often We who speak English are limited to one word for love In Sanskrit there are ninetysix words for love We are highly specialized in technology yet quite primitive in terms of feelings Jesus and other Eastern spiritual teachers saw the outer world to be of little importance The place where the kingdom of God was was inside and among us For us however reality is in the outer material physical world One of the ways this has affected Christian theology is the emphasis on a belief that we are so unique so distinctive that even our bodies persist on the other side of death The religion out of which we came Judaism thought that after death what happened to us was much like what happens to a dewdrop after the sunrise Yes it has individuality while it exists as a separate entity but it is destined quite quickly to flow back into the great primal ocean of existence and to lose all individuality Does a drop of water cease to exist when it falls back into the sea Well yes and no Nothing is lost but its individuality is no more Jesus knew that the ego was a great troublemaker for us We cling to everything that we think defines us as individuals To threaten this notion of who we are is hell We protect what we call our individuality at all costs Death is bearable only if we are guaranteed a life after death containing all the characteristics of our individual human life You can see how this would affect the way we go about living our lives and making choices about who we are and what are we to do Those were the questions that shaped by the way what became our Bible After every great cultural upheaval the community of people raised the questions Who are we and what are we to do ee cummings once wrote To be yourself in a world that is doing its best to make you everybody else means to fight the hardest battle any human being can fight and never stop fighting I love the story of the Pentecostal man who wandered into let us say a Methodist church During the sermon the visitor got so excited that whenever the preacher made a point the Pentecostal man would scream out Praise God or Hallelujah or Amen The ushers were so distraught about the Pentecostals behavior that the head usher went down the aisle and whispered to him Youll have to keep quiet The pastors right in the middle of the sermon The Pentecostal man said Keep quiet How can I keep quiet Ive got the Holy Spirit To which the usher said Well you didnt get it in this church The Pentecostal man made a theological error that many of us make You see he didnt have the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit had him And thats the problem with much of our theology We wish he had the Holy Spirit Theres a part of us that wishes we could keep the Holy Spirit in the nice neat tidy confines of our categories and barriers Wed like to put God in a box Get this Nobody has the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit always has us and given our Western orientation that scares us so that we resist and repress and deny until we are spiritual dead as doornails We want a God in a box like we want everything else in our lives predictable and controllable We want a religion that is safe A journey that is predictable There is no true spiritual journey that is that way We modern people have been victimized by own modernity Of course weve benefited we have the sciences technology modern medicine even emphases on human rights come from our modern approach to things But it has had two deeply destructive effects on our religious and spiritual life For one thing it has made people skeptical about spiritual reality If God cant be proved by modern means then God must not be Second modernity has led us to be preoccupied with factuality with scientifically verifiable and historically reliable facts Modern Western culture is the only culture in human history that has identified truth with factuality We are as Marcus Borg calls us fact fundamentalists If a statement isnt scientifically or historically factual it isnt true These two things are serious mistakes and deadly to the journey inward Let me point out that both liberals and conservatives can be fact fundamentalists Liberals try to rescue a few facts from the fire Conservatives say the Bible must be factually true in order to be true at all This is why they emphasize the literal and historical factuality of biblical texts They both agree facts are what matters If I had a magic wand that worked one of the things I would do is to get both liberals and conservatives alike to see how modern both of these positions are What weve got when it comes to having faith today for most people is whether they can believe iffy things or not That to most people is what Christianity has become It is as if what God wants most from us is believing highly problematic statements to be factually true And if you cant believe them then you dont have faith and probably arent a Christian Listen carefully Faith has to do with your relation to God to Self Not whether you believe the Bible to be true or not Im going to come back to this in the weeks ahead Let me see if I can give you an example One of the questions that has persistently come up in the discussion group has to do with what Jesus view on violence might be This has been raised since the events of What would Jesus have us do Does professing to be Christian mean trying to live as Christ might live And if so why arent we doing what he asks us to do First of all I confess I have not a clue what Jesus would do in response to My hunch is not much His interest was not in that sort of thing Besides he had little political power If we went to him and asked I think he would probably tell a story He might tell the story of the Good Iranian Terrorist Thats what the parable of the Good Samaritan sounded like to the people of his time Who are you he might ask Then tell a story to us as we stand there with our mouths open and scratching our heads Maybe he would tell a story like this One day a rabbi in a frenzy of religious passion rushed in before the ark fell to his knees and started beating his breast crying Im nobody Im nobody The cantor of the synagogue impressed by this example of spiritual humility joined the rabbi on his knees Im nobody Im nobody The custodian watching from the corner couldnt restrain himself either He joined the other two on his knees calling out Im nobody Im nobody At which point the rabbi nudging the cantor with his elbow pointed at the custodian and said Look who thinks hes nobody Ill tell you something that might be misunderstood I think that one of the numbers that organized religion has done on us is to convince us that we are supposed to be like Jesus What God is interested in is saving human beings That being the case what we must do is be human The Christian conspiracy Im going to call it against being human is to convince us that what we are supposed to do is be like Jesus A couple of years ago there was a popular slogan WWJD The goal was to ask before doing any and everything What would Jesus do If Jesus were here today would he have worked for Enron Would he have been on the board of directors If Jesus were here today would he go to church Which one The image that I had of Jesus when I grew up was that Jesus would not go to movies on Sunday but he would go swimming because we had a lot of water in our town Would he be a Republican or a Democrat Would he be involved in the political process The one thing that Jesus Christ was about was love and he did this by the extravagant way that he lived his life He wasnt married he didnt hold down a job he didnt have to raise kids The Roman church has it that Jesus was such a guy that not only did he not have a sexual dimension neither did his mother What Jesus was about and still is is Love The extravagant way that Jesus lived his life was to communicate the overwhelming love that God has for us Boundless love Inexpressible love It is like God comes down and puts arms around us and says This is how much I love you Now love yourself like that This was the thing that marked the ministry of Jesus So Soren Kierkegaard writes To will to be that self which one truly is is the opposite of despair How do you do that Well to be the self you truly are is to have a particular history and it is to aspire to go beyond the limitations of that history and it is to be frustrated when you realize you cant To accept this humanness means to be passionate about our aspirations and compassionate about our limitations It is like you get up from where youre sitting and come up here and stand beside me physically and look at the person who is seated in the chair where you are and you have compassion for that person It is that kind of acceptance We are not to be like Jesus We are to be Christlike There is a world of difference Jesus went around kicking selfesteem into people All of the stories that you find in the New Testament are like that Look at the stories of his ministry If a man can restore sight to a blind man he gives that person a new lease on life a new selfconfidence If a man can absolve a prostitutes guilt in lasting forgiveness he gives her the gift of selfrespect The crippled the insane the leper the tax collector the beggar a motley assortment of humanity desperately in need of selfesteem and he extended it to them The same dynamic was at work even when he was chasing the moneychangers out of the temple It may be temporarily embarrassing to be kicked out of your accustomed place of business but it has been known to lead to selfrespect The message is Youre made for something better than this You are loved by God This selfcompassion is foundational for the abundant life and Im sure that the response Jesus would have us make to the terrorist situation as well as the rest of life is this kind of love He would tell a story One of his central teachings was You shall know the Truth and the Truth shall set you free But first its going to mess with your life and upset you So let me tell you a story about Truth to ponder This story is from the Ethiopian culture Long ago Fire Water Truth and Falsehood lived together in one large house Although all were polite toward each other they kept their distance Truth and Falsehood sat on opposite sides of the room Fire constantly leapt out of Waters path One day they went hunting together They found a large number of cattle and began driving them home to their village Let us share these cattle equally said Truth as they traveled across the grasslands This is the fair way to divine our captives No one disagreed with Truth except Falsehood Falsehood wanted more than an equal share but kept quiet about it for the moment As the four hunters traveled back to the Village Falsehood went secretly to Water and whispered You are more powerful than Fire Destroy Fire and then there will be more cattle for each of us Water flowed over Fire bubbling and steaming until Fire was gone Water meandered along cheerfully thinking about more cattle for itself Falsehood meanwhile whispered to Truth Look See for yourself Water has killed Fire Let us leave Water who has cruelly destroyed our warmhearted friend We must take the cattle high in the mountains to graze As Truth and Falsehood traveled up the mountain Water tried to follow But the mountain was too steep And Water could not flow upwards Water washed down upon itself splashing and swirling around rocks as it tumbled down the slope Look and see Water is still tumbling down the mountainside to this day Truth and Falsehood arrived at the mountaintop Falsehood turned to Truth and said in a loud voice I am more powerful than you You will be my servant I am your master All the cattle belong to me Truth rose up and spoke out I will not be your servant They battled and battled Finally they brought the argument to Wind to decide who was the master Wind didnt know Wind blew all over the world to ask people whether Truth or Falsehood was more powerful Some people said A single word of Falsehood can completely destroy Truth Others insisted Like a small candle in the dark Truth can change every situation Wind finally returned to the mountain and said I have seen that Falsehood is very powerful But it can rule only where Truth has stopped struggling to be heard And it has been that way ever since I think what Jesus would do if we asked him what we are to do is that he would likely tell a story And then he would remind us that we ourselves are telling a story with our lives After saying that perhaps he would ask Is the story you are telling with your life the truth No matter where you go this week no matter what happens remember this You are carrying precious cargo Watch your step Ordinary Life is a gathering that provides an opportunity to develop an enlightened heart and an awakened mind to the reality of the present moment The gathering meets on Sunday mornings at am in Fondren Hall at St Pauls UMC South Main Houston Texas and is taught by Dr

mailto Sent Thursday January PM To Subject ordinarylife The Most Important Question of All ORDINARY LIFE Thoughts and Ideas To Help You Live a Happier Life PREVIEW for January And SUMMARY of January Dear Folks Because of numerous factors you are receiving not only the preview for this coming Ordinary Life gathering but the summary of what was done on January as well First for what is coming up Over the past several years our relationship with our sister church in Cochabamba Bolivia has been growing stronger The Ordinary Life gathering has provided for several years now scholarships for people who wanted to go do building and medical work there As you know one of St Pauls clergy Diane Wimberly is spending a year there Two other folks in our community Dr Wilson and Nora Boots go regularly to work there Year before last we provided a substantial amount of money to help complete building a medical clinic there Now they have specifically through Diane turned to us with an appeal for assistance In order to give you the information needed to make a decision about this Ive asked Richard Wingfield to come and speak to us about his two trips there He will be showing photos and videos of the work there and explaining to us some of what the need is Ill read you Dianes letter to our gathering There will also be an opportunity for you to see if making the next trip to Bolivia is something you would like to participate in I sincerely hope youll come to learn about and provide feedback on this important work Much love Bill Kerley At our last gathering I spoke about the responses to the questionnaire that was posted here last September We had a high percentage of returns and each questionnaire was carefully analyzed Edward Harris did an enormous amount of work putting this questionnaire together and analyzing it After hearing the responses last week we had some dialogue about the future direction of Ordinary Life It was very helpful to me and I thank those of you who were present Then I talked about the importance of questions told a story about the most important question of all and left you with a couple of major ones to ponder What follows is a full text of that part of our time together The Big Questions Here is a prayer someone sent me I want to thank you Lord for being close to me so far this day With your help I havent been impatient grumpy judgmental or envious with anyone But I will be getting out of bed in a minute and I think that I will really need your help then Amen We do need all the help we can get dont we One of the ways help comes to us but which we dont usually recognize is through questions For example Are you here with a purpose What would have to happen for this time we spend together today to be a worthy investment of your time Im always wondering about things like that What followed at this point of a summary of the questionnaire responses and dialogue about that Questions are very important Every morning when you get up you start your day with questions At least this seems to be the case Perhaps the first one is Is it really time to get up Seems like I just went to sleep Then they begin What am I going to wear Whats for breakfast Will I be in time for the meeting How am I going to get it all done today Who will prepare supper tonight Hows the market doing Perhaps one of the things that differentiates is the quality of questions we ask ourselves I want to read you the story of the most significant question you can ask of yourself or of someone else This is an old old story This version of it comes from Dawna Markovas wonderful book I Will Not Die an Unlived Life Immediately after her father died she realized that even in his own opinion he had not really lived his life but merely existed As part of her grieving this poem came out of her I will not die an unlived life I will not live in fear of falling or catching fire I choose to inhabit my days To allow my living to open me To make me less afraid More accessible To loosen my heart Until it becomes a wing A torch a promise I choose to risk my significance To live so that which came to be as seed Goes to the next as blossom And that which came to me as blossom Goes on as fruit It is very important when you hear this story to hear it as a parable a metaphor about your inner life and living If you want to pursue this more read Robert Johnsons book He By the way Robert Johnsons biography is out and I highly recommend it as supplementary reading to what these gatherings are all about The title of that book is Balancing Heaven and Earth It will both inform and inspire you Now here is the story In the center of space and time there lived a king in a castle His name was Arthur and he had been mortally wounded Though his heart sill pumped blood he never left his chamber for he had fallen under an evil spell He no longer cared a whit for the fortunes of his people or his lands All of his kingdom lay fallow Everyones souls seemed to be suspended The people went about their daily tasks lethargically as if they were all in a trance of some kind They had lost all sense of purpose The story now shifts to a cottage in the woods not far from the castle A very naive fatherless young man name Parsifal had just come of age While walking through the forest he encountered a bevy of the kings knights riding along the road He was so awestruck by their shining appearance that he immediately wished to become one such as they Over the objections of his very strict mother Herzelaide he set off for the castle Parsifal was struck dumb however when he reached King Arthurs castle Instead of the glorious Camelot he had expected he found himself in the middle of a wasteland where everything was sterile He discovered that the king had been wounded in the groin and had lost the power of regeneration The Kings courtiers moving about listless did nothing about the terrible situation that had befallen them Parsifal was given a horse and weapons so he could battle with a formidable knight who had bested all of Arthurs champions Astonishingly Parsifal won and took the armor of the fearsome foe Some said it was mere luck but the consensus was that the young mans innocence conferred a divine blessing on him Parsifal wanted desperately to help his king but he like everyone else had no answers as to how to heal the wound His mind was filled with questions which flowed from the gift of his innocence but he dammed them up remembering his mothers constant injunction not to embarrass people by asking questions And so Parsifal left the count on a quest for the Holy Grail The legend then relates how he ventured down many a blind path and false trail in his search but finally he glimpsed the Grail and as a result felt the Kings pain in his own heart On the first of May he rode his magnificent white charger back to Arthurs castle He rushed to his king who was at Deaths door With compassion in his heart he overcame his previous hesitance and knelt beside his monarch A question rose to his lips and spilled over as it were wine What aileth thee A blinding light flashed and in an instant the spell was broken The kings heath was restored the land and all its inhabitants were renewed Arthur and the other members of the court turned to Parsifal and in honoring him the King gave this toast If you falter never forget that verily every day holds the promise of a new redemption Questions can be dangerous They can take you to and over the edge of the safe world we normally live in Is my spirit dying in my marriage What is my life really about Will I die an unlived life All new and original thought begins with a question Can we embrace the unanswered Can we live in the mystery Here is a very important question for you to ask yourself What is likely to happen to me if I keep living my life exactly as I am And then Is that what I want So here are two questions I leave with you The first is by Meister Eckhart and was written several hundred years ago What good is it to me if Mary gave birth to the son of God fourteen hundred years ago and I do not give birth to the child of God in my time and in my culture We are all meant to be mothers of God For God is always needing to be born The next question comes from Mother Teresa What do we live for if not to make life less difficult for each other The answers to these and other questions stirred in your today will of course have to come from you No matter where you go this week no matter what happens remember this You are carrying precious cargo Watch your step Ordinary Life is a gathering that provides an opportunity to develop an enlightened heart and an awakened mind to the reality of the present moment The gathering meets

Help You Live a Happier Life Summary of February Dear Folks When we gathered on Sunday I spoke with you about the importance and value of great questions in our lives During this season of Lent I am focusing on themes having to do with the metaphorical movement from bondage into freedom darkness into light Death into life We did take an excursion to talk about the importance of managing ones state of mind and I spoke about two ways to do that how we manage our bodies and how we manage the focus of our attention Then we revisited the Quest for the Holy Grail story because I had had so many questions about it Indeed I wasnt able to finish what I had planned to say well wrap that up next week along with the telling of another story I learned from Robert Johnson What follows is the full text of the presentation Much love Bill Kerley Quest I On When you leave the sessions that we share together here I want you to leave feeling better than you did when you came in the door Better about yourself better about your life better about your relationships better about what you do better about where you live Im not talking about the physical place where you live though that might be involved I just love this season of the year In the liturgical calendar we call it Lent It is that time from Ash Wednesday to Easter Sunday when we make what I call the journey from bondage to freedom from darkness into light from death into life So much of our spiritual journey can be put under the general theme of a journey or a quest The principles of Ordinary Life are about the beliefs and behaviors we can have that will empower us to have an enhanced experience of life How can you get what you really want out of your life on a daily basis Thats the question Well it may not be the question but it is an important one Question Thats what we are going to talk some about today questions The word question can be written as a sentence Quest I on We are on a quest We are in fact spending the precious moments of our lives on a quest for something Is the one you are on what you want Really In order to get what you really want you have to what Know what you want But even more than that in the belief system we are bringing to our work in here as reflected by the Ordinary Life principles wanting just anything and everything misses the point What do you want Most responses to this question are so general and not what we really want anyway A lot of people last night hoped to win the lottery People think that having lots of money would bring them happiness But I would contend that it is not the money that people want People dont want little pieces of green paper with dead presidents pictures on them People want what they think they are going to get from those things freedom fun the ability to get with others to have some kind of pleasure I want to put kind of a parenthesis in here before we come back to the heart of the matter One of the most important things we can do to create the power the joy and the passion we really want to live our lives with is to learn to manage our own states of mind If you dont do this it will cost you virtually everything you really want in your life friends family success and joy on a daily basis What determines how you feel How you feel at any moment in time is purely designed by and the result of how you are directing your own mind and body at that moment No matter what is happening in your life you are in control unless you are in intense physical pain or stressed to the point of exhaustion and mental failure of your own state Once you understand this and use it you have control of your life at a whole new level You can have more fun joy and passion than you ever dreamed of once you take that responsibility and take that control Some people resist this notion because it is close to the principle of our having a moral obligation to be happy It is a heavy responsibility but look at those who never learned to manage their state Almost every week sometimes it seems like every day you read in the paper of people who seem to have had all that would make most happy but didnt learn to manage their state within themselves There is a major price to pay in not managing your state For example a tragic event can happen in one persons life and after an appropriate time for physical and emotional adjustment they are able to let the event go and move on in their lives For other people they seem to hang on to bitter disappointments forever It is all a matter of learning to manage your state of mind In managing it there are major rewards How do you do it There are two primary ways to control your state of mind Controlling the way you use your physical body Controlling your mental focus That is what you pay attention to what you think about what you picture what you say to yourself when you talk to yourself Lets talk about each for a moment First lets see how we can use our physical bodies to create the emotions we want at any moment in time In order to feel anything in life you feel it through your physical body Do this exercise Stand up Tall Breathe fully Look up Put a huge silly grin on your face Now without changing any aspect of your body get depressed You cant do it Changing your body sends a totally different message to your brain The way we move our facial muscles the way we gesture the way we walk the pace at which we talk all of these things determine how we feel in any given moment So when we feel bad just talking positively to ourselves or making affirmations is not enough When most Americans dont like the way they feel they do something to change their body Drink smoke or eat Find some gestures and movements you can make that will instantly change your state These are your power moves How for example would you walk if you felt totally successful and unstoppable Sit the way you would be sitting if you had five times more energy than you ever can remember Breathe the way you would if you felt strong and excited and energized Put a facial expression on you would have if you felt totally passionate and excited Now go from this state to being in a state of boredom Sit that way Bored and tired What did you change Notice Though this may sound weird this is a valuable skill to have Developing new ways to handle your body is a most valuable way to change states Learn how to use your physical body to have enough energy to live with passion and enthusiasm A second way to change your state of mind and spirit is to control and direct the focus of your mind That is what are you paying attention to right now at this moment There is tremendous power in controlling the focus of your mind We can control what we are focusing on That is what we are picturing in our mind what we are saying to ourselves If you go to a party the only things you will have feelings about are the things you focus on The problem is that you cant focus on everything We become deletion creatures The price we pay for this is to walk around believing that our experience of the world is real Some people have and well get into reasons for this in a moment trained themselves to notice what they dont want and what they dont like Guess what shows up for them in life What they dont want What they dont like If you want the party of your life to be one you are happy with and not one you are upset with you have to focus on what makes you feel great The quality of your life is the quality of the state of mind you live in day to day How you feel day to day determines how you treat yourself how you treat other people how great you feel about your life What determines this is how you use your body and what and how you focus on things This is how some overcome tragedy and how others dont No matter how good it is you can always focus on something that isnt perfect or doesnt match your expectations Success is creating consistent pleasure in your life and causing yourself to grow Failure is being able to find pain no matter how good it is Understand we are always making decisions about what to focus on Our hope is in turning off the automatic pilot and taking control When you do you instantly change the quality of your life In life we get what we focus on Whatever you pay attention to is what you experience instantly If you feel a certain way on an ongoing basis it is because you ask certain questions on an ongoing basis Why does this always happen to me The presupposition is that bad things are always happening to you Do you presuppose things that limit you that put you down or that create consistent feelings of success in your life The quality of your life is based on the quality of your questions Asking for example about a horrible situation what can I learn from this that will enhance my life and the life of others as well How can I use this situation to help me create more power for me and for others If angry at someone you might ask What do I respect about this person Or What is funny about this that I havent noticed yet When you ask such questions you have to be willing really to search for the answer Ask with a sincere interest and desire for an answer What could I do today that would be more fun than ever before To connect more with my loved ones Here are some questions I use What am I most happy about in my life right now What about that makes me happy What else am I happy about What am I really excited about in my life right now What about that makes me excited What am I really grateful for in my life right now You will feel a state change when you answer these questions Come up with some questions whose answers can put you in the state you want and read them every morning You are already doing this Im suggesting that you do it in a way that is useful I want to revisit a story I read to you just a few weeks ago The story is The Quest of the Holy Grail It is a story rich in meaning and significance Ive had a number of questions seeking clarification When the knights of King Arthurs court had seen an apparition of the Grail through a veil they determined to go on a quest to find it Remember this is a myth and it is filled with symbolicmetaphorical language The knight energy within us serves the king The king energy is that which reflects our sense of integrity and wholeness our understanding of who we are and what our purpose in this life is In the story the knights thought We should go out together to find the Grail But then they realized that this could be a disgrace No each must go alone into the forest and enter at the point he himself would choose where it was darkest and there was no path The vision of and the search for the Grail is the quest for meaning and purpose Entering the forest alone at the darkest spot this is the road less traveled This is the heros journey These times together in Ordinary Life are designed for those ready to take such a journey The word hero is related to the words heresy and heretic All three are derived from a Greek word meaning able to choose A hero is a chooser A hero chooses the questions of his or her life and therefore the quest that person chooses to live For all of us the question is the questIon The questions we ask or fail to ask shape the journeys of our lives What distinguishes the person who is experiencing abundant life from the rest is that he or she chooses the questions and earnestly seeks their answers The rest follow the lead of society My question to you is this will you live your life from the heart develop a heart of compassion or live your life conventionally from the prescribed role Wisdom asks the right questions So much of what is important in life is around questions Daddy why is the sky blue Who made the world What would you do if you won the lottery In the Bible the questions are so important Adam where are you Am I my brothers keeper Master what must I do to inherit eternal life Who is my neighbor Simon do you love me Wisdom asks the right questions Enlightenment is about knowing the person who asks the question The more expansive our questions the wider our consciousness King Midas asked for gold King Solomon asked for wisdom What are you asking for The story of our lives doesnt really get interesting until we know what we want Questions ignite your mind like spark plugs ignite the engine of your car Is it time to get up What shall I wear What shall I have for breakfast What is on my schedule for today Will she make me happy Will he be faithful What will people think How can I pay my bills Point Most of our questions are so automatic we dont even notice them But they shape our lives Becoming mindful is becoming aware of the questions you are asking What are the dominant questions of your life They determine your lifes direction and shape So if you want to change the shape of your life change your questions Our automatic questions lead to one kind of life Here is another order of questions altogether Who am I What in the world am I doing here How can I serve What is the meaning of my life These questions clearly lead to something else In the Grail myth story the hero is the one who is adequate to Grail Quest His adequacy is not a matter of big muscles or intellectual refinement but of a simple childlike heart Parzival often seems something of a fool The line between the hero and the fool is always thin Parzival is raised by his mother Even if you were raised by a mechanical monkey you have a mother His father was a knight and came to his end in the way knights often do Mother would see to it that the same thing not happen to her fairhaired boy She secludes him from knightly things and stories Of course this fails It always does One day three knights show up in bright and shining armor and the boy is enchanted Enchantment is when we fall in love with someone or something with the belief that if we could just possess it or be possessed by it then we will live happily every after Mother then hopes to have him ridiculed out of his questions She wants him to give up this foolish business of heroic intentions Many people do give up their dreams to please mother or mother as projected onto their spouses What will people think kind of thing you know So she gives him a pitiful old nag of a horse and a ridiculous costume one that makes him look exactly like a fool The tribe never equips us to leave it We have to find those tools on our own Every one on the quest must be prepared to face ridicule If you want to be sure of yourself do what society tells you to do If you want to break out of the conventional mold you must figure out for yourself what you are about Some people blithely quote Joseph Campbells great line that says follow your bliss This doesnt mean following some silly whim It means knowing your missionpurpose on this planet and doing whatever is required to fulfill it Campbell became a world famous authority on myth because he did what was required in the face of ridicule and much opposition to gain that position The heart of the story of Parzival and his quest for the Grail is suggested in his first encounter in the Grail castle After various adventures Parzival has sort of stumbled into the Grail castle This is the wisdom of innocence The purity of the simple fellow gets him into the Grail castle We must indeed become like children Gentle as doves But we must also be as wise as serpents In the castle lives a king who is sorely wounded The kings illness has brought devastation to the kingdom it has become the Wasteland All of us to some degree get wounded growing up In the process of surviving the child interprets experience in three ways The first is in the bonding experiences or lack of them that we have The child interprets the tactile and emotional bonding or lack thereof as a statement about life in general Is it predictable and nurturing or is it uncertain painful and precarious This primal perception shapes the childs ability to trust All sorts of factors can influence death in the family illness etc Second are the behaviors the child observes growing up The child internalizes specific behaviors of the parent as a statement about self So a parents depression anger or anxiety will be interpreted as a statement about the child A man asked his dying father Why were we never close The father went into a tirade Do you remember when you were ten and you dropped your toy in the toilet and I had to work to get it out The list of trivial events continued The son had always thought of himself unworthy His father set him free by revealing his craziness Then there are the beliefs that are handed to the child The child observes the behaviors of the adults around her or him their struggles with life and internalizes not only these behaviors but also the attitudes they imply about the self and the world Years ago I would experience an uneasiness when my wife bought new clothes What I got to in my analysis was a memory of my mother taking me with her to buy new hats when she was depressed She would try one on and ask me if it looked good enough to get her a compliment Very inappropriate Parzival can redeem the king and the kingdom by asking a simple question The wounded king is brought before him and Parzival wants to ask What ails thee brother But he has been told good knights dont ask a lot of questions The decisive moment for him is the choice between acting from his heart or from his role as a knight He fails innocence is not enough for he has already been socially indoctrinated It has caused him to doubt the promptings of his heart He chooses to act the way he thought he was supposed to He muffed his opportunity for the Grail because he was trying so hard to be a good boy He goes to bed that night and when he gets up in the morning the castle is empty As he leaves the castle he hears a voice shouting You silly goose Why didnt you open your mouth and ask the lord the Question One of the experiences of midlife is to wake up and discover that the castle is empty What we do then is critically important Though a little dense he soon enough comes to realize that he has missed his chance He is really depressed He could see now that his being so slow to ask the question as he sat beside the sorrowing king has cost him So for the next five long years he tries desperately to find his way back to the castle He is booed and jeered Everyone knows he has failed and everywhere is the desolation of the Wasteland But he is gaining the wisdom of experience of commitment loyalty and dedication His journey weaves through a mazelike set of experiences through which he comes to redeem and understand his past Holding to his quest his question provides him with the ball of string that he can unwind and find his way out of the wasteland and back to the Grail castle You may well want to find a spiritual teacher or therapist to help you understand and know the one who is asking the question But dont look to that person to provide the question for you All the answers you need about your life you already have within you Of course he eventually triumphs and in fact becomes himself the Grail King Through his tenacity of purpose or loyalty to the Quest he makes it Just so all who take up the great Questions of life and hold tenaciously to them will enter into a marvelous life the life of their destiny For Parzival and I think for you and me too the basic issue is compassion In other words What ails thee brother What ails thee sister Jesus talked about tending to needs of the least of these his brothers and sisters If around you it looks like a wasteland the way out is through the heart If the heart is not the center of your life you are not really living you are inauthentic This is what the Grail story and Jesus and others tell us Whatever is at the center of your life will be the source of security guidance wisdom and power When next we gather Ill make some remarks about the rest of the Grail story and what the words security guidance wisdom and power mean The loving heart the heart of compassion is the reality of human life The desire to be what you are is what begins to wake you up No matter where you go this week no matter what happens remember this You

ordinarylife Summary of November ORDINARY LIFE Thoughts and Ideas to Help You Live a Happier Life Summary of November Dear Folks The Principle of Just Noticing One of the fastest ways out of the fear that our current global crisis can cause in us is to develop the skill of just noticing what our reaction of life is When we fail to notice what is we miss life as it is We do this because we try to make ourselves safe and secure especially from death Just noticing is build on the principle of sacred unity Full text of presentation Im calling the remarks I want to make with you today Just Noticing We are attempting to learn how to be with the world as it is And with ourselves as we are These are big tasks because the world as it is currently a scary place with an uncertain future And we as we are turn out to be a mixed bag some of which is hard to accept Last week I introduced you to what are at least for me some key concepts First were the principles of mind and spirit Second the process of learning to make life work for us in a way that fits the goal of living the life we want and wanting the life we live Some of you have wondered Is it really possible to do this Can we really love and accept ourselves and each other unconditionally One very important spiritual skill is learning just to notice Just be with what is Yes this is difficult to do with no judgment But it is one of our primary spiritual tasks If we cannot learn to relate to ourselves this way we cannot relate to others with kindness or compassion either Several years ago a man walked into a bar in San Francisco near the waterfront After he had ordered his drink he noticed that the man sitting next to him looked like a seagoing pirate Not only was he dressed the part but he had a pegleg a hook instead of a hand and he had a patch over one eye Curiosity got the better of him so he asked the man to tell him about himself Excuse me but you look like a pirate Aye mate that I was A true seagoing pirate My but you must have had an interesting life judging from the looks of things Aye lad that I have Do you mind telling about your adventures For example how did you come to have a pegleg Well I was a pirate you know One day a huge wave came and knocked me off the ship and a shark bit my leg clean off Thats why I have a pegleg And your arm How did you come by that hook Well I was a pirate you know One night in a bar in Singapore I got in a fight and this guy took a machete and cut my arm clean off Thats how I got my hook And how about your eye How did you lose your eye Well I was a pirate you know One day while up on deck I happened to look up and a sea gull pooped in my eye A sea gull pooped in your eye and thats how you lost your eye Well it was the day after I got my hook There is a profound wisdom in learning to be with life as it is Something happens and immediately we react rather than just noticing When we do that we can blind ourselves So often we want to escape life What I want our times together to help us all do is to develop a loving and compassionate relationship toward life as it is and toward ourselves as we really are One way to talk about this is with the phrase just noticing The foundation of this noticing is the principle of spiritual unity When Jesus used the word God the word that he used in Aramaic means that which encompasses everything both outside and inside This includes those things we label good and those things we label bad Both within the world and within ourselves This is one of the reasons we are encouraged to know ourselves as completely as possible You cant love what you dont know or know what you dont love Jesus was constantly inviting people toward himself in one way or another Indeed I think one of the true marks of the spiritual life style I would aspire to is that it be one that is inviting I would like for people to find what we are up to in here for example to be intriguing appealing etc Come follow me he said Come and see what I have found said his followers So Jesus embraced and invited everyone Indeed his hanging out with sinners prostitutes and drunks his inclusiveness if you will got him into far more trouble than anything he ever said about himself This is a manifestation of the Jewish principle of wisdom called Sophia In the Old Testament book of Proverbs you find Wisdom gathering various guests together At the time of Jesus there were very strict rules in Judaism about whom you could eat with and whom you couldnt and he regularly and deliberately disobeyed those rules By violating these rules Jesus modeled the nature of Gods love God invites and includes all The word Jesus used for God means no boundaries No one and nothing is excluded So our spiritual work involves attempting to create our lives in light of this reality Of course the phrases being with life as it is and learning to embrace it all are what we talk about all the time in here in one way or another Here is a promise the more you work with not running from the things that scare you whether within or without and the more you and I dont try to sidestep the feelings of insecurity that facing these demons brings us the more we will be at peace the more joy we will experience the happier we will be It is that simple It is that difficult Of course the bottom line thing we try to run from and escape is death Once I had a very profound dream It was disturbing beyond belief I would say that paying attention to and honoring this dream saved my life And by saved my life I dont mean it in the way we usually do It didnt keep me safe and secure I dreamed that I was back in Columbia Tennessee the town where I lived from age six until age seventeen or eighteen I had gone back there because I had some sort of business to conduct with the undertaker You understand that we take nothing in a dream as literal Dream symbols are much more serious than that While I was waiting for the undertaker to finish whatever he was doing and come to our meeting I was looking around this place Off of the vestibule where I stood waiting there were numerous visitation rooms Each seemed to have several caskets in it Each casket contained a corpse I looked over to the room on my right and there was a casket in which the body in it seemed to be breathing I walked over to it and there plain as day was my dad All laid out but clearly not dead He was breathing Now in the dream I had no emotional reaction to this whatsoever I just noticed it I went back to the vestibule to wait Soon the undertaker came out He had on a white lab coat with blood stains on it Blood in dreams always refers to sacrifice We dont like to make sacrifices I said to him Before we get down to business I thought you might like to know that the body in that casket over there isnt dead Oh yes we know He is about to die You see he is afraid of the pain of the process of being embalmed Were keeping an eye on him As soon as he is dead we are going to close the casket and bury him That seemed to make sense to me so I said Okay and we got about our business which I have no idea what it was When I woke the dream seemed like it had been so real I was very disturbed by it Remember there are no bad dreams just disturbing ones What could it possibly mean I worked with that dream for weeks What in me was afraid of dying Of the process of being embalmed The ego The ego thinks it is the whole show and is terrified about having the life sucked out of it This is why I say to you that the spiritual practice I am attempting to teach in here has nothing to do with believing anything religious at least not at first It has most of all to do with our being willing to die and to do this dying on a continuous basis Just when we are sure that weve found the truth that we have a place to stand that we are safe and secure life as it is or God comes along and says Let that go Sometimes this command is whispered to us and is so subtle we miss it if we arent careful Sometimes it is yelled so loudly in our ears that it echoes there for a long long time This is why I have cautioned you about the danger of putting labels on anything For example Im married Then my spouse leaves by death or divorce Im wealthy Then the market crashes Im young and healthy What do you mean its malignant Im a safe and secure citizen of the United States of America Then comes along Almost nowhere do we get taught the folly of running away from that which scares us Instead we are taught to cover it up make the bitter sweet smooth it over so no one will pay attention take a pill distract yourself and dont think about it By all means by any means make it go away The saddest thing about how we are taught to deal with the fear we have of the various deaths we need to face is that each and every method causes us to cheat ourselves out of being in the present moment Pema Chodron in her wonderful book When Things Fall Apart Heart Advice for Difficult Times talks about the wisdom of being nailed to the present moment I thought when I first read that phrase of one who was willing to be so nailed and the powerful impact he had because of that willingness One of the negative contributions organized religion has made to our lives is that it tries to organize things Which of course it must But organized religion begins to create God in its image Each religious group becomes so certain of what it is that God wants and believes But you notice that what God wants and believes varies from group to group You get the suspicion that the beliefs have been shaped to support and affirm the religious organizations existence and culture I have a suspicion that this is one of the leading causes of atheism The spiritual path I am attempting to apprehend and talk about isnt about getting someplace at least not the place that organized religion talks about Were not trying to get to heaven or be right I grew up as did some of you in a church that emphasized the importance of being saved To this day when I go to visit my Dad in Columbia Tennessee where that funeral home is if I go to church with my dad the service is just like it was when I was a child There is almost no one in that church under fifty My dad is Yet every sermon and every service is focused on the unsaved A phrase that some folks used briefly after when will things get back to normal Normal is one of the most useless words in our vocabulary Things are not normal except in this sense Things come together and they fall apart Then they come together again Then they fall apart again This is the way of ordinary life Our healing lies in creating room for this sort of thing to happen Room to love Then to grief Then to feel relief Then misery and joy that frees us to love again and start the process all over again Do you see why I say that the spiritual journey isnt about getting it together or getting to heaven In fact looking for a secure safe place is what keeps us miserable Just noticing what is going on right here and now and what our reaction to it is this noticing becomes our teacher Thats what meditation is about Learning to notice We dont meditate in order to become good meditators We meditate so that we will wake up If someone were to ask me How long does this take my answer would be The rest of our lives Many people are out seeking for some special religious andor spiritual path to take them to bliss All sorts of things are available for that Some try the drug Ecstasy Some try weekend workshops of all sorts Some go off and follow someone who can channel a long dead person into the present moment These dead folks always seem to be so wise Are there no dead jerks And on and on All these are efforts to transcend life as it is My assertion is that it is only when we are willing to be with ordinary life that we are free to really to live You see as long as I am preoccupied with the hope that there is somewhere else that is better to be or that there is someone else better to be Im not able to be with where I am and who I am right here right now I remember when I first heard the notion that suffering doesnt mean that something is wrong What a relief Suffering is part of life Life is difficult We dont suffer because weve done something wrong or werent good enough To believe that is spiritual poverty Spiritual poverty is always experiencing Im not good enough or havent done enough that there is something missing in me I strongly believe that our efforts to protect ourselves from sorrow and hardship are not being kind to ourselves We get taught in this culture on the importance of getting it all together and feeling good So that if we are experiencing an upset of some kind we think that something is wrong and we have to get it fixed When we take this approach we inevitably become bitter hardened unavailable fearful and alienated In our effort to avoid sorrow and hardship we end up living tensely its like living your whole life in the dentist chair When we suffer it doesnt mean something is wrong If you had a child or best friend who felt that that they were inadequate or fundamentally flawed what you would do is put your arms around them and say No you are fine just the way you are Then you might help the child or your friend explore why they felt so bad Understand We can explore the nature of our feeling inadequate without believing that we are inadequate At the point each person in the Ordinary Life Gathering was given a raisin We spent time just noticing the raisin Now a raisin is a small thing But what if it is your spouse or partner that you are not noticing What if it is your health What if it is your surroundings One of the first things I learned when I began to do sitting meditation is how much time I spend not in the moment Rather I am busy planning thinking about the next item on my to do list how Im going to get done all I have scheduled for myself One main goal of spiritual practice is just to notice These are dark times Learning to notice and then practicing loving kindness and compassion toward ourselves is as good a way as I know for us to start turning lights on in the darkness so that we and others can see No matter where you go this week no matter what happens remember this You are carrying precious cargo Watch your step Ordinary Life is a gathering that provides an opportunity to develop an enlightened heart and an awakened mind to the reality of the present moment The gathering meets on Sunday mornings at am in Fondren Hall at St Pauls UMC South Main Houston Texas and is
