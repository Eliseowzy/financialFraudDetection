says that under the law it agreed to divest most of its instate power plants to increase competition in the local electricity market In return the state would allow PGEs remaining hydroelectric and nuclear plants to sell power at market prices overseen by the FERC That would end the California PUCs authority to set prices and shifting regulatory oversight to FERCs less stringent system of

Columbia Gas to build the mile Millennium pipeline from Ontario to Mount Vernon NY The pipeline would transport Mcf per day to New York City and southern parts of the state The county alleges that the FERC prematurely granted Columbias request to build the pipeline They say that Columbia does not have the needed state approvals to proceed with construction and that the company did not provide crucial information about using dynamite to blast in environmentally sensitive areas in the Hudson River A FERC study found that the pipeline would have limited adverse environmental impact and was the preferred alternative to deliver natural gas to New York The commission has days to respond to the countys petition If denied Westchester can then seek a court order to block construction The county has asked several state regulatory departments to deny future approvals and cancel existing permits already granted Westchester will also refuse to grant Columbia permits for construction on county land Additionally the county is questioning whether the pipeline violates a state plan to protect coastal areas from environmental damage Federal law prohibits a federal agency from granting approval for projects that affect the coastline if a state finds it violates its own coastal plan In addition county officials have asked the governor to intervene when he attends a FERC conference

Andersen Consulting but lost a bitter fight with its sister firm Arthur Andersen to retain the brand name of Andersen Now the name loss looks like manna from Heaven as the once fabled Andersen name sinks in the Enron quagmire Once one of the pillars of accounting the Andersen name is now only associated with the Enron debacle That is very different from the scenario that prevailed during the bitter battle between the accounting firm and its consulting arm A Paris mediator ruled in Andersens favor in August That was a seen as a huge victory for the accounting firm The dispute began when

Americas Europe Asia Pacific Government and Auto Makers to Develop Fuel Cells The DOE and the US Council for Automotive Research an organization formed by GM Ford and DaimlerChrysler to speed up fuel efficiency research have agreed to fund a new program called FreedomCar to develop hydrogenbased fuel cells for use in cars The agreement will require significant investment by the automobile industry and the federal government the council said The new program represents the governments commitment to devote research and development money and future policy toward hydrogen as an eventual replacement for gasoline according to the DOE FreedomCAR replaces the Partnership for a New Generation Vehicle whose goal was to develop a car that gets miles per gallon of fuel PNGV was a partnership between federal agencies Ford GM and DaimlerChrysler to develop a car with times the fuel efficiency of a model by The federal fiscal budget had allotted million for PNGV The budget allotment for FreedomCAR will not be known until the president submits his budget to Congress in a few weeks The program is open to all auto makers not just domestic car manufacturers leaving the door open for Toyota Honda etc to join if they wish FreedomCAR might also include suppliers from the hydrogen production industry Currently fuel cells cost about per kW of energy produced and last for about hours In order to be competitive with combustible engines fuel cells need to be priced about per kW and last about hours or about miles Fuel cells can obtain hydrogen from a variety of sources including methanol and natural gas Fuel cellpowered vehicles have not been introduced because they are more expensive than gasolinepowered vehicles and there is no commercial fuel delivery system The US has only hydrogenfueling stations for cars in operation which are not open to the public compared to about fueling stations for vehicles that run on compressed natural gas and even more for those that run on propane The DOE secretary said that he thinks that the nations carbonbased economy may pass from the scene to perhaps be replaced by hydrogen The DOE held meetings last year with auto makers energy suppliers fuel cell manufacturers and educational experts to create a plan for how a hydrogenbased economy would operate Currently a consensus on whether hydrogen should be shipped through a pipe or made at the end point by electricity does not exist Ford GM and DaimlerChrysler have each said they plan to have some fuelcell vehicles commercially available by ENERGY ENERGYr FEAs Complete Suite of

breaking a regulatory contract to let it sell power at prices set by the FERC The claim stems from the law that deregulated the states power market and helped trigger Californias energy crisis PGE says that under the law it agreed to divest most of its instate power plants to increase competition in the local electricity market In return the state would allow PGEs remaining hydroelectric and nuclear plants to sell power at market prices overseen by the FERC That would end the California PUCs authority to set prices and shifting regulatory oversight to FERCs less stringent system of managing prices PGE says the market value of its power was not less than billion It also says that under an emergency energy bill passed last January the state broke the agreement for FERC regulation

Columbia Gas to build the mile Millennium pipeline from Ontario to Mount Vernon NY The pipeline would transport Mcf per day to New York City and southern parts of the state The county alleges that the FERC prematurely granted Columbias request to build the pipeline They say that Columbia does not have the needed state approvals to proceed with construction and that the company did not provide crucial information about using dynamite to blast in environmentally sensitive areas in the Hudson River A FERC study found that the pipeline would have limited adverse environmental impact and was the preferred alternative to deliver natural gas to New York The commission has days to respond to the countys petition If denied Westchester can then seek a court order to block construction The county has asked several state regulatory departments to deny future approvals and cancel existing permits already granted Westchester will also refuse to grant Columbia permits for construction on county land Additionally the county is questioning whether the pipeline violates a state plan to protect coastal areas from environmental damage Federal law prohibits a federal agency from granting approval for projects that affect the coastline if a state finds it violates its own coastal plan In addition county officials have asked the governor to intervene when he attends a FERC conference

Andersen Consulting but lost a bitter fight with its sister firm Arthur Andersen to retain the brand name of Andersen Now the name loss looks like manna from Heaven as the once fabled Andersen name sinks in the Enron quagmire Once one of the pillars of accounting the Andersen name is now only associated with the Enron debacle That is very different from the scenario that prevailed during the bitter battle between the accounting firm and its consulting arm A Paris mediator ruled in Andersens favor in August That was a seen as a huge victory for the accounting firm The dispute began when

Americas Europe Asia Pacific Government and Auto Makers to Develop Fuel Cells The DOE and the US Council for Automotive Research an organization formed by GM Ford and DaimlerChrysler to speed up fuel efficiency research have agreed to fund a new program called FreedomCar to develop hydrogenbased fuel cells for use in cars The agreement will require significant investment by the automobile industry and the federal government the council said The new program represents the governments commitment to devote research and development money and future policy toward hydrogen as an eventual replacement for gasoline according to the DOE FreedomCAR replaces the Partnership for a New Generation Vehicle whose goal was to develop a car that gets miles per gallon of fuel PNGV was a partnership between federal agencies Ford GM and DaimlerChrysler to develop a car with times the fuel efficiency of a model by The federal fiscal budget had allotted million for PNGV The budget allotment for FreedomCAR will not be known until the president submits his budget to Congress in a few weeks The program is open to all auto makers not just domestic car manufacturers leaving the door open for Toyota Honda etc to join if they wish FreedomCAR might also include suppliers from the hydrogen production industry Currently fuel cells cost about per kW of energy produced and last for about hours In order to be competitive with combustible engines fuel cells need to be priced about per kW and last about hours or about miles Fuel cells can obtain hydrogen from a variety of sources including methanol and natural gas Fuel cellpowered vehicles have not been introduced because they are more expensive than gasolinepowered vehicles and there is no commercial fuel delivery system The US has only hydrogenfueling stations for cars in operation which are not open to the public compared to about fueling stations for vehicles that run on compressed natural gas and even more for those that run on propane The DOE secretary said that he thinks that the nations carbonbased economy may pass from the scene to perhaps be replaced by hydrogen The DOE held meetings last year with auto makers energy suppliers fuel cell manufacturers and educational experts to create a plan for how a hydrogenbased economy would operate Currently a consensus on whether hydrogen should be shipped through a pipe or made at the end point by electricity does not exist Ford GM and DaimlerChrysler have each said they plan to have some fuelcell vehicles commercially available by ENERGY ENERGYr FEAs Complete Suite of
