rather than continuing to use Unify AR This is a change of the decision that was made two year ago However since all other Enron companies will be using SAP AR there is a definite benefit in using the same system across Enron entities to simplify intercompany reconciliation and related SAP interfaces ie cash application netting deposit load Even though many Unify users did not want to give up Unify AR functionalities since Unify has more flexibility we felt that it will be to everyones benefit to have the entire companys AR in the same system Please see attached table for details Thank you Enron North America Corp From Stephen P Schwarz PM To Sally CT Inja CT Pamela NRON Melissa CT Leslie CT Susan CT Brenda F CT Bryce CT Lisa CT Rita CT Bob CT Evelyn CT Cynthia NRON Regan M CT Kenneth M CT Brent A CT cc Subject Unify AR SAP Plans The attached memo details our proposal of a week ago to use SAP AR rather than Unify AR As of this morning we finalized our decision to use the SAP AR system and to turn off Unify AR when SAP is implemented Please direct any questions to myself at X or Melissa White at X Please feel free to forward this memo to anyone I may have forgotten who is interested Stephen Forwarded by Stephen P SchwarzHOUECT on PM Enron North America Corp From Stephen P Schwarz PM To Bryce CT Lisa CT Rita CT Mechelle CT Susan CT Brenda F CT Brent A CT Melissa K CT Leslie CMAIL Evelyn CT Laura E CT Cheryl CT cc Melissa CT Dorothy CT Kimberly CT Trang CT Christy CT Subject Unify AR SAP Plans Two years ago Enron North America made a decision to use Unify AR for cash application rather than SAP AR We decided at the time that SAP AR would be kept in sync with Unify AR by the UnifySAP interface We believe that the business logic for that decision has changed and are now recommending that Unify AR be permanently turned off and all AR functions be performed in SAP I have briefly summarized the change in business situation below Two Years Ago Today Netting allowed by legal and credit ONLY if netting contract was already in place Netting encouraged by legal and credit wherever possible regardless of existence of signed agreement Netting limited to one counterparty and legal entity at a time Canada nets across counterparties Netting performed in physical only financial settlements to maintain separate net statement process ENA considering netting physical and financial together All account coordinators were to apply their own cash Cash applied centrally in Power Financial and Canada Individual coordinators apply cash only in physical Gas Cash was to be applied at the line item level to track variances and to facilitate calculation of cost of funds by commercial team Although gas settlements is applying cash for some invoices at the line item level this functionality is not being used by power settlements and will not be used by financial settlements The company has not made any move towards calculating cost of funds by commercial team The Account Inquiry functionality in Unify was thought to be a key online tool Old habits die hardmost users appear to be printing reports and reviewing data rather than using the online functionality Overapplication of cash was not to be allowed Overpayments would be classified as on account with issues tracked in a case management system Case management system does not exist Allowing overapplication helps the account coordinators track overpayments easier than leaving cash on account The counterpartylegal entity combination on the deposit needed to match the counterpartylegal entity combination on the Enron invoice Given the number of legal entities Enron has along with the number of entities our counterparties have this seems like a hopeless battle Allowing crossapplication of cash seems easier Corp required that intercompany settlements had to be settled with cash movement Corp no longer requires intercompany settlements to be settled with cash movement Converting to SAP AR simplifies the UnifySAP interface in the following ways Bank deposits into SAP do not have to be split off into Unify Cash entries in Unify do not have to be interfaced back to SAP Unify netting entries do not have to be interfaced to SAP Payables information does not have to be interfaced from SAP to Unify Given the change in attitudes towards our netting business process we face two problems in Unify Controls built into Unify are already obsolete Unify does not maintain all products in one database making efforts to net across products in the future physical with financial for instance impossible Our understanding of the netting process in SAP indicates that there are no controls which sounds good at this point and that we would retain the automatic netting entries when the payable is netted with the receivable within SAP However we emphasize that netting would be done in SAP not at the time of finaling a payment in Unify To repeat we are recommending that Unify AR be turned off and we convert to SAP AR We will schedule a meeting the week of February to discuss Please call me at X with any questions or comments We WILL make this decision by February because the SAP timeline does not allow any additional time for consideration Stephen

rather than continuing to use Unify AR This is a change of the decision that was made two year ago However since all other Enron companies will be using SAP AR there is a definite benefit in using the same system across Enron entities to simplify intercompany reconciliation and related SAP interfaces ie cash application netting deposit load Even though many Unify users did not want to give up Unify AR functionalities since Unify has more flexibility we felt that it will be to everyones benefit to have the entire companys AR in the same system Please see attached table for details Thank you Enron North America Corp From Stephen P Schwarz PM To Sally CT Inja CT Pamela NRON Melissa CT Leslie CT Susan CT Brenda F CT Bryce CT Lisa CT Rita CT Bob CT Evelyn CT Cynthia NRON Regan M CT Kenneth M CT Brent A CT cc Subject Unify AR SAP Plans The attached memo details our proposal of a week ago to use SAP AR rather than Unify AR As of this morning we finalized our decision to use the SAP AR system and to turn off Unify AR when SAP is implemented Please direct any questions to myself at X or Melissa White at X Please feel free to forward this memo to anyone I may have forgotten who is interested Stephen Forwarded by Stephen P SchwarzHOUECT on PM Enron North America Corp From Stephen P Schwarz PM To Bryce CT Lisa CT Rita CT Mechelle CT Susan CT Brenda F CT Brent A CT Melissa K CT Leslie CMAIL Evelyn CT Laura E CT Cheryl CT cc Melissa CT Dorothy CT Kimberly CT Trang CT Christy CT Subject Unify AR SAP Plans Two years ago Enron North America made a decision to use Unify AR for cash application rather than SAP AR We decided at the time that SAP AR would be kept in sync with Unify AR by the UnifySAP interface We believe that the business logic for that decision has changed and are now recommending that Unify AR be permanently turned off and all AR functions be performed in SAP I have briefly summarized the change in business situation below Two Years Ago Today Netting allowed by legal and credit ONLY if netting contract was already in place Netting encouraged by legal and credit wherever possible regardless of existence of signed agreement Netting limited to one counterparty and legal entity at a time Canada nets across counterparties Netting performed in physical only financial settlements to maintain separate net statement process ENA considering netting physical and financial together All account coordinators were to apply their own cash Cash applied centrally in Power Financial and Canada Individual coordinators apply cash only in physical Gas Cash was to be applied at the line item level to track variances and to facilitate calculation of cost of funds by commercial team Although gas settlements is applying cash for some invoices at the line item level this functionality is not being used by power settlements and will not be used by financial settlements The company has not made any move towards calculating cost of funds by commercial team The Account Inquiry functionality in Unify was thought to be a key online tool Old habits die hardmost users appear to be printing reports and reviewing data rather than using the online functionality Overapplication of cash was not to be allowed Overpayments would be classified as on account with issues tracked in a case management system Case management system does not exist Allowing overapplication helps the account coordinators track overpayments easier than leaving cash on account The counterpartylegal entity combination on the deposit needed to match the counterpartylegal entity combination on the Enron invoice Given the number of legal entities Enron has along with the number of entities our counterparties have this seems like a hopeless battle Allowing crossapplication of cash seems easier Corp required that intercompany settlements had to be settled with cash movement Corp no longer requires intercompany settlements to be settled with cash movement Converting to SAP AR simplifies the UnifySAP interface in the following ways Bank deposits into SAP do not have to be split off into Unify Cash entries in Unify do not have to be interfaced back to SAP Unify netting entries do not have to be interfaced to SAP Payables information does not have to be interfaced from SAP to Unify Given the change in attitudes towards our netting business process we face two problems in Unify Controls built into Unify are already obsolete Unify does not maintain all products in one database making efforts to net across products in the future physical with financial for instance impossible Our understanding of the netting process in SAP indicates that there are no controls which sounds good at this point and that we would retain the automatic netting entries when the payable is netted with the receivable within SAP However we emphasize that netting would be done in SAP not at the time of finaling a payment in Unify To repeat we are recommending that Unify AR be turned off and we convert to SAP AR We will schedule a meeting the week of February to discuss Please call me at X with any questions or comments We WILL make this decision by February because the SAP timeline does not allow any additional time for consideration Stephen
