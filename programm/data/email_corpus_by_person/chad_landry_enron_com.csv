coming out about us getting bought out by shell or a large private equity shop CKL Original Message From Lenhart Matthew Sent Monday October PM To Landry Chad Subject RE Lousyanna State vs Texas Pretenders vs Contenders famous vassigh quotes pass the butter you gonna finish that if loving this cake is wrong i dont want to be right i can eat twice as much of this ice cream bc it is fat free food in lousyana is overrated texas food rules texas biscuts rule the world i like my cookies texas size dont mess with texas banana splits Original Message From ENRON On Behalf Of Sent Sunday October PM To Lenhart Matthew Landry Chad Subject Lousyanna State vs Texas Pretenders vs Contenders Well Well Well I am writing this note to all the smack talking coonass LSU fans who enjoy banging on The University of Texas Longhorns with smug smack like Overrated Overrated I usually use the BCC field when sending smack notes like this so everybody wont get barraged with weak Reply Alls from recipients who think they can go toe to toe with me in email smack ie Val and his weak shit he likes to send This time is different because I think yall should know who your fellow pathetic smack talking LSU fans are Yall can start a new support group called Vassighs College Football Smacked down Bitches that got their cakeholes shut by Chris Simms Cedric Benson and Roy Williams et al Yall have dished it all out so I do not feel bad for rubbing salt into the fatal wound that Ole Miss delivered you and your team Saturday night Here a couple of smack statements made by some if not all of the cajuns included in this email header Simms sucks how could he be a preseason heisman candidate Over his last three games Simms is of percent for yards and touchdowns passing touchdowns rushing with just one interception rating He has just started about ONE full seasons worth of games recently and is coming into his own Simms will be a top NFL pick as will Roy Williams and Cedric Benson I cant think of any College Football team in history with the high caliber triple threat that UT has with Simms Benson and Williams The SEC is the best conference in football the Big XII Sucks What a joke that statement is LSU would whip UT Yeah right LSU Could not beat Rice UT is the most overrated team in college football interesting since they are higher ranked now in November than they were in the preseason polls Mack Brown can only recruit he cant coach worth a damn Nick Saban is better Mack Brown has one loss he hasnt lost in Austin since he has been coach while Saban has led LSU to three losses in the Red Stick just THIS SEASON Every college football analyst would agree no conference compares to the Big XII The BIG XII have TEAMS RANKED IN THE TOP early November unbelievable Two of the top ranked BIG XII teams only losses were to the other top ranked BIG XII school UT loss to OU and OU loss to Nebraska The only way the best teams in the Big XII lose is when they have to play against each other The highest ranked SEC team Florida lost to Auburn which lost to pathetic Arkansas All football players worth a damn have left yalls God Forsaken state Peyton to Tennessee Marshall Faulk to SDSU the newest Manning to Ole Miss that just whipped up on yalls rd world state university in the Red Stick on national television on a cool October Saturday night Cajuns like Jake Delhomme and Bobby Bouchieaux stay in Lousyanna to play college ball though thats some encouraging news for yall I cant think of one LSU player that has ever done shit in the NFL NFL teams have gotten screwed every time they drafted a Lousyanna State football player David Lafleur Kevin Faulk Harvey Williams Eddie Kennison the list goes on and on It is really pathetic Texas has just RECENTLY produced dominating hausses like Ricky Tony Brackens Dan Neil Shaun Rogers Leonard Davis Priest Holmes Blake Brockermeyer Bryant Westbrook and many others Look at Eric Metcalf in his first game back to the NFL for the Redskins breaking NFL records Texas players are magic baby Not to mention legends like the Tyler Rose Tom Landry Bobby Layne and Tommy Nobis I hope yall enjoy Shreveport on a cold December night while yall attend Lousyanna States bowl game against Fresno State at the Independence bowl At least you can enjoy the New Years holiday by watching the NFL like offense of The University of Texas Longhorns play in a BCS bowl and God willing with some magic from TAMU over the Texas Traitor filled roster of OU and some other help watch UT vs Miami in the Rose Bowl I guess that smack from Elliot saying Rohan was better than Simms seems pretty foolish to you now doesnt it That dude needs to play linebacker if he wants to get in the NFL He might have a decent arm but he has no clue in the pocket The difference between how Eli Manning ran the passing game and Rohan did for LSU Saturday night showed LSUs deficiency at the QB position Fumbling bumbling stumbling is the best way to describe his play CKL you better buy your family Christmas gifts from the dollar store because you need to save your money to pay on the bet you made with me the night of Vals wedding in that little bar in Natchez Mississippi You boldly put your soon departed money where your mouth was all night since all you were ranting was tiger bait tiger bait any time I was trying to tell you how UT would whip up on LSU like the lesser ranked teams have already done this season The bet for was to go to the person whose team would be ranked higher at the end of the College Football season Me University of Texas You LSU Well since UT is in the top and with a worst case scenario would not finish out of the top this year and the fact that LSU will not even finish the season ranked you need to start saving your extra pocket cash or we can work out an installment plan Lenhart was a witness as well was another of Vals amigos I forgot the name but know the face It looks like history will keep on repeating itself with the Great State of Texas always being superior in every facet over its little cajun neighbor to the east Lousyanna Texas has the winningest NFL team of all time in the Dallas Cowboys the time champions and top ranked Texas Longhorns Conversely Lousyanna has the losingest NFL team of all time in the Aints and the doormat of the pathetic SEC west Lousyanna State university The last Governor of Texas is the President of the United States and leader of the free world The last Governor of Lousyanna is in prison licking Boudreauxs balls for the next years or so And the bottom line is that yall are in my State working because there are no jobs outside of casinos and bars in Lousyanna Even the only bright spots in the pathetic history of yalls only professional sports franchise is provided by Texas players Earl Campbell and Ricky Williams He who laughs last laughs best Man this note is a classic I think I will be sending it to Jim Rome Hook Em Val forward this note
