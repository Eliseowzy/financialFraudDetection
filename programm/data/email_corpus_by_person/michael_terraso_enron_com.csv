NGAAorg on AM To Dave Johnson Email Mike Terraso Email Tilford Vik Email cc Max Brown Email Subject As Predicted the USA Today Article on Pipelines Updated PM ET When pipelines are time bombs million miles of them deliver potential catastrophe every day By Patrick McMahon USA TODAY BELLINGHAM Wash Last summer an underground pipeline ruptured in a city park here and sent a torrent of gasoline along a wooded streambed toward two yearolds playing with a barbecue lighter After the inch pipeline had been hemorrhaging for an hour and minutes an explosion sent a fireball racing through the park A plume of smoke rose feet Authorities say the blast probably was triggered by a spark from the lighter There was a spark and the sky turned orange the boys both told me afterward says Frank King whose son Wade was one of the boys in the park Wade and his friend Stephen Tsiorvas were burned over of their bodies They died the next day Also killed was yearold Liam Wood who had graduated from high school five days before The collegebound Wood was flyfishing in the park when he was overcome by fumes fell into the creek and drowned To many people the boys were considered heroes says Mark Asmundson the mayor of this seaside city north of Seattle In sparking the explosion the boys kept the most extensive damage confined to the acre park he says The river of gasoline was heading right for the center of the city On Monday the Senate Commerce Committee held a oneday hearing here about five minutes from where the incident occurred on legislation to improve safety and government oversight of pipelines and the companies that operate them The hearing included gripping sometimes tearful testimony from the boys parents as well as statements from state and federal officials My baby died because of inaction His death was preventable said Katherine Dalen Stephens mother More than million miles of iron steel and plastic pipes some as large as feet in diameter snake beneath the earth and deliver oil gasoline natural gas and potential disaster across America every day They range from the transAlaskan pipeline to tiny pipes carrying natural gas to peoples homes Safer than gasoline trucks or oceangoing tankers by most measures onceremote pipelines are prompting new worries as sprawling metropolitan areas grow into their paths US pipeline accidents have fluctuated in the past years In the s there were liquid fuel spills and natural gas leaks roughly one a day The incidents most involving local lines carrying natural gas resulted in deaths injuries and million in property damage from through There also are environmental costs In January one of the nations largest pipeline companies Koch Industries of Wichita Kan paid a million civil fine to settle Environmental Protection Agency waterpollution charges involving oil spills from to The EPA said Koch failed to inspect its pipelines and waited for leaks before making repairs Liam Woods mother Marlene Robinson is focused on stronger regulations nationwide including more and better inspections and regional watchdog committees I dont have any children left to protect she said in an interview and repeated at the hearing This didnt have to happen to Liam and it doesnt have to happen to other peoples children Although the cause of the Bellingham incident remains under investigation one factor might have been damage to the pipeline from a backhoe when a water line was being installed in But investigators also have many questions about the role of Olympic Pipeline Co which operates a network of pipelines along a mile corridor from north of Bellingham to Portland Ore Investigators for the National Transportation Safety Board NTSB want to know whether Olympic ignored warning signs and whether it could have acted more swiftly after the leak But the inquiry has been delayed by a parallel investigation by the US Attorneys Office Several Olympic employees have declined to testify and have invoked their constitutional rights against selfincrimination Pipeline owners and government regulators defend the safety of transporting twothirds of the nations fuels by pipeline and they warn that more rules could boost energy prices Critics say pipelines are too loosely regulated not fully inspected and in some cases deteriorating The US Transportation Department oversees pipelines Its Office of Pipeline Safety sets standards for design operation maintenance and emergency response Richard Felder who heads the office testified at Mondays hearing Our goal is to prevent incidents like Bellingham from ever happening again he said In an earlier interview he defended his offices performance and the industry Its a good record Its the safest form of transporting fuel far and away The office has extensive rules on pipeline safety including requirements for signs along the route and programs to alert potential diggers but theres no such thing as risk elimination Felder says All you can do is manage it But the chairman of the federal governments transportation safety watchdog agency is unimpressed with Felders office and says it deserves a grade of F Its been the most frustrating area Ive had to deal with as chairman says Jim Hall NTSB chairman since He says no agency has a worse record of responding to NTSB recommendations In a recent speech he said theres no indication that the Office of Pipeline Safety is in charge or that its regulations its inspections its assets its staffing and its spirit are adequate to the task Felder takes issue with much of the criticism but he endorses calls for more research into pipeline safety He said his office is in the final stages of preparing new safety standards for heavily populated and environmentally sensitive areas He emphasized that the leading cause of pipeline failure is thirdparty damage from road utility and construction work The agency has worked to enhance a system to alert pipeline companies of digging with one telephone call Felder is critical of local authorities who ignore pipelines when making decisions on housing and commercial development Local planning has not kept people away from pipelines he says Its astounding to me Felder bristles at critics suggestions that his agency is a tool of the oil and gas industry I cant agree with that one iota he says We try to balance the safety issue and the economic issue The Senate Commerce Committee will consider a bipartisan bill sponsored by Sens Patty Murray DWash and Slade Gorton RWash Rep Jack Metcalf the Republican who represents Bellingham and Rep Jay Inslee a Democrat whose district includes an operating section of the pipeline The bill would require periodic internal inspections of pipelines boost federal spending on research increase the number of federal pipeline inspectors nationwide there now are and expand states regulatory authority On Monday the Office of Pipeline Safety gave the state of Washington the temporary right to do more inspections The MurrayGorton bill also would require federal certification of pipeline workers and expand the publics right to know about spills and leaks I was totally shocked and amazed when this happened Murray says You always assume that your neighborhood is safe and somebody has taken care of this The Bellingham rupture not only dumped gallons of gasoline into this city of near the Canadian border but also unleashed civic furor at Olympic Pipeline Its hard for people to get interested in things they cant see Out of sight is out of mind Mayor Asmundson says He has visited the boys grieving families and lobbied Congress The blast has dominated my life since June Pipeline operators portray accidents as isolated to escape national scrutiny he says The whole focus of the industry is containment Do whatever you have to do locally but dont stir things up nationally Last week Murray released a report she requested from the Transportation Departments inspector general It faults the Office of Pipeline Safety for ignoring enhanced safety requirements including increased inspections inside pipes in highly populated and environmentally sensitive areas as Congress required in and A US General Accounting Office audit of operations is due in May Also pending is a decision from Felder and the pipeline safety office on whether to restart the mile section shut down since the Bellingham accident Olympic Pipeline has repaired the line and is eager to reopen it People living along the route and officials are pushing for more extensive testing of the stilloperating section of the line south of Bellingham Felder says he has not decided whether it should be shut down Last week Felders office ordered a new round of testing along the entire line but critics such as Inslee are not convinced it will be enough The tests must be conducted on the closed section of the pipeline before a decision is made on reopening it Contributing Scott Hillkirk

State wins OK to inspect pipelines by Brier Dudley Seattle Times staff reporter IMAGE BELLINGHAM Federal regulators yesterday agreed to allow Washington state to inspect all interstate pipelines within its borders as requested by Gov Gary Locke and the state Legislature Weve got it weve just got to work out the fine details Locke said State officials think theyll do a better job inspecting the miles of pipelines in the state than the federal Office of Pipeline Safety OPS an agency thats been harshly criticized since Olympic Pipe Lines June explosion in Bellingham that killed three people Other states have tried unsuccessfully to take control of pipeline inspections from the OPS which has only inspectors for the West Coast but only four states now have that authority Still unresolved however is whether the state will be allowed to impose safety standards stricter than federal standards The states authority could also be shortlived if the OPS and the oil industry persuade Congress later this year to reduce states role in pipeline oversight Mixed messages about the safety offices position were delivered yesterday at a special Senate field hearing on pipelinesafety concerns Locke announced that the state was given testing authority based on a faxed letter he received just hours earlier from the top administrator for pipeline safety The fax said the state could take over inspections on condition that only one state agency were responsible A state law approved last week would have divided the task between two But later in the hearing OPS deputy administrator Richard Felder acknowledged under questioning that he would prefer that inspection authority remain with his office To sidestep that debate US Sen Slade Gorton RWash proposed amending the federal law that gives the OPS authority over pipelines that cross state lines Because Olympic Pipe Line is almost entirely in Washington its mile system parallels Interstate and ends in Portland Gorton suggested that states be allowed to regulate pipelines that are over percent within their borders Olympic a Rentonbased subsidiary of Shell Texaco Arco and oil shipper GATX testified that it would prefer federal oversight Having a unified set of regulations is important for a smooth operation said manager Carl Gast Gorton and US Sen Patty Murray DWash hosts of the hearing both want the state to have more authority over interstate pipelines Theyre backing legislation that would give states authority and funding to inspect pipelines themselves and require better collection and sharing of data about pipelines condition They also want the stricter standards on pipeline testing monitoring and operations Murray whose twin sister teaches at a Bellingham school near the explosion site noted that pipelines have spilled times and killed people in the US since She also said they leak million gallons of hazardous material a year or the equivalent of the Exxon Valdez spill every two years During the hearing at Bellingham City Hall the senators also heard emotional pleas for stricter regulations from victims parents Two yearold boys and an yearold fisherman died after Olympic spilled gallons of gasoline into a city park There needs to be a zerospill policy not we only kill two or three kids a year said Frank King whose yearold Wade died in the explosion Katherine Dalen mother of yearold victim Stephen Tsorvias said the accident made people realize their neighborhoods may not be safe because of the poorly regulated underground pipelines Also testifying were city officials from Renton SeaTac and Bellevue Like Bellingham those cities are trying to get Olympic to provide more information and testing to assure residents that the pipeline is safe Olympics Gast noted that the company will use two devices to internally inspect its entire pipeline later this year The cause of the accident is still being investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board which has been hampered by Olympic employees refusal to testify and by a federal criminal investigation into the accident Copyright The Seattle Times Company Pipeline blast still evokes anger Grieving parents urge senators to pass tough safety bill Tuesday March By SCOTT SUNDE Mail Author SEATTLE POSTINTELLIGENCER REPORTER BELLINGHAM Nine months have passed since Bruce Brabecs stepson died in a horrific pipeline accident here But the memories havent faded Photo Mary King weeps as her husband Frank testifies yesterday at a Senate field hearing in Bellingham on pipeline safety Their son Wade died in the June pipeline explosion Dan DeLongPI The smell of gasoline when Brabec fills the family car reminds him of the fumes that killed Liam Wood who was and out for a day of flyfishing on June The sound of the newspaper hitting the front porch every morning reminds Brabec of when police arrived to tell him and his wife that Liam had been overcome by fumes from leaking gasoline and drowned Imagine going home tonight and your child isnt home and never will be Brabec told US Sens Slade Gorton and Patty Murray during a Senate field hearing on pipeline safety yesterday Getting involved The public may mail written comments on improving pipeline safety to the Senate Commerce Committee Dirksen Senate Office Building Washington DC Anger and anguish mixed freely at the hearing which Gorton a Republican hopes will bolster efforts to win approval for a tough pipeline safety bill introduced by Democrat Murray The hearing in Bellinghams Depressionera City Hall attracted an overflow crowd Townsfolk were forced to huddle around television sets and watch the proceedings in the lobby Their frequent applause at the angry words drifted up the stairs and into the crowded hearing room State and local officials blasted the federal Office of Pipeline Safety as ineffective It regulates interstate pipelines such as the one owned by Olympic Pipe Line Co that ruptured and caught fire in Bellingham last June There was anger too at Olympic Officials from cities through which the pipeline runs said the company had resisted supplying them with data from pipe inspections then agreed by providing Xs and Os that no one could understand We have no confidence said Connie Marshall Bellevues deputy mayor that the Olympic pipeline is safely maintained and operated within our city The company however pledged a safer pipeline pointing to a plan instituted in October to add valves test pressure strengthen computer processing and make sophisticated internal inspections The company is trying to improve any system that may have been at fault in the June accident said Carl Gast Olympic vice president and manager We are not waiting until after the investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board is complete to take action Gast said Gast who has worked in the pipeline industry for years called the companys safety plan the most farreaching with which Ive ever been involved Olympic runs a mile system that takes petroleum products from refineries north of Bellingham and at Anacortes to Portland The system runs near the Interstate corridor including through the suburbs east of Lake Washington The victims Wade King The yearold burned to death while playing in Whatcom Creek when it erupted in a fireball June Stephen Tsorvias Also he was playing with Wade when gasoline ignited after spilling from a ruptured Olympic Pipe Line fuel line Liam Wood The yearold was flyfishing on the creek when he was overcome by leaking gasoline fumes and drowned The anguish at the hearing came from the parents of Wood and parents of two yearold boys Wade King and Stephen Tsorvias who burned to death as gallons of spilled gasoline ignited and a fireball roared down Whatcom Creek At times sadness tears our hearts apart and drowns our spirits said Katherine Dalen Stephens mother Marlene Robinson Liams mother said softly I no longer have children to protect They too were angry at Olympic and at the Office of Pipeline Safety The boys families have filed wrongfuldeath lawsuits against Olympic Frank King Wades father made it clear yesterday whom he blames for the tragedy The company is an outrage It needs to be shut down King said Olympics gross wanton recklessness killed my little man King said he has evidence that Olympic had a chance in July to dig up the pipe where it would later rupture to check for possible problems but decided not to because the excavation would be too difficult Bellingham has a water plant near the site of the rupture and numerous water pipes are above the pipeline In an interview King produced an Olympic document gathered for his lawsuit that he said indicated that the company decided not to dig up the pipe In and Olympic did an internal inspection of its pipeline Possible defects were identified in the inspections near where the pipe would later rupture But Olympic has said the possible defects did not seem serious enough to dig up the pipeline near the water plant Olympic Pipe Line spokeswoman Maggie Brown said Kings testimony marked the first time she had ever heard the claim that the company was prepared to dig up that section of pipe in but decided not to Kings wife Mary erupted in frustration that the accident was allowed to happen If this is properly maintained regulated whatever it wont happen again she said tearfully Anything is going to be better than what went on in the past which was nothing In fact pipeline regulation may be changing The Washington Legislature passed a bill this year that sets up a state pipeline safety program and asks the federal government for the power to police interstate lines like Olympics Gov Gary Locke told Gorton and Murray yesterday that the federal government may be willing to give the state the authority to inspect interstate pipelines Four states currently have that authority but the federal government still retains the right to punish pipeline companies over problems found in inspections A top official of the US Transportation Department told Locke in a letter yesterday that the federal government may give Washington inspection authority Locke however also wants the state to have the authority to regulate pipelines and to use tougher standards than the federal rules to do so Murrays bill would give the states more authority Richard Felder head of the Office of Pipeline Safety admitted that his regulators have had problems We worked to restore public confidence Felder said but clearly we have a long way to go Felder said the offices proposed budget would provide it with more money for regulation He also said his office will propose a new regulation by the end of the month to require companies to test the safety of their pipelines Gorton and Murray however seemed unconvinced that federal regulators will get tough So was Bob Chipkovitch who runs the pipeline program at the National Transportation Safety Board The NTSB which has no regulatory authority has repeatedly recommended tougher rules only to see nothing happen in the Office of Pipeline Safety he said For example years after the NTSB recommended that regulators require periodic inspections no such rule has been adopted I hope Bellingham has made a difference Chipkovitch said No we havent seen a change yet by regulators But I hope this accident does provide the impetus to do that The NTSB has yet to determine the cause of the June accident But Chipkovitch said the investigation so far has shown significant performance failures by pipeline controllers He noted that the pipeline rupture began at pm June after a pump failure near Woodinville computer problems at the companys Renton headquarters and a valve closed near Anacortes But minutes later refineries north of Bellingham resumed putting gasoline in the line Controllers only started shutting down the pipeline for good at At the point where the pipeline ruptured there may be evidence of external damage Chipkovitch said Olympic contends that construction at the water plant in damaged the pipe But investigators have yet to fully test the damaged pipe A federal criminal investigation into the accident has kept them from doing so At the same time several Olympic officials have refused to talk to the NTSB fearing they would incriminate themselves Chipkovitch said the investigation also focuses on the valve near Anacortes that closed June increasing pressure in the pipe upstream The valve closed times in the six months before the Bellingham accident he said Pipeline accidents Some of the countrys largest pipeline accidents in recent years June The Olympic Pipe Line Cos pipeline in Bellingham ruptured and gallons of jet fuel spilled into Whatcom Creek then ignited above killing two yearold boys and an yearold fisherman It was the rd reported spill on the line since it was opened in November Propane from a leaking

their inspection TR will not reinitiate gas or cru de export operations until we have completed our inspection We have forme d joint teams with CLHB and Army personnel to perform the inspection It could take as long as hours but well have a better estimate after we get a progress report in the morning All crews available systemwide are mobilizing for inspection of the entire system but for now our priority continues to be the lines in the altiplano The three stations in the altiplano have been shut down bled off and locked Other supervisors throughout the system have been advised and are on alert Government and regulator continue to be supportive of our shutdown and inspection action plan We have developed a contingency plan with COBEE the regional electricity distributor under which they will redistribute energy out of spare capacity in Cochabamba to LaPaz this should cover LaPaz s electricity needs during the duration of time we need to complete our inspection The only other significant consumer is a large cement plant in LaPaz Weve agreed that they will slow down their operations and prov ide only small local supplies industrial concrete demand will be shutin We did not send a press release on the issue although we have received inquiries our response is that we are concerned about the risk to Bolivia ns this action presented and we are performing an inspection on the system We are avoiding mention of gas stoppage to LaPaz at this time due to the volatility of the issue in LaPaz Government VMEH SIRESE has agreed with the message We expect that with the cement plant and power plant offline line pack should be sufficient to keep commercial demand satisfied for a few days In either event we are working with the local gas distributor to prepare a notice for LaPaz newspapers instructing gas consumers in the area how to safely shutdown and restart their equipment in the event that it becomes necessary The most likely scenario as of now is that Edwin Morales a local revolutionary tied to the coca trade is behind the action Morales ha s had contact in the past with the Raul Rocha bunch out of Chuquina Oruro so were still not sure whether this was an act against TR andor the industry or if it is against government Morales has just joined forces with ano ther rebel out of Cochabamba and is planning nationwide road blocks for tomorrow Their agenda is national theyve never isolated TR or our industry as a whole although Chaco in the north have been targeted in the past probably because they have a field in the middle of Morales stronghold The political situation here is tenuous with Banzer out and various political interests looking to fill the leadership void Were watching this situ ation closely The local Army brigade has committed to staying on vigilance f or at least the next few days once were comfortable with the operational situation well discuss a longerterm solution Steve Forwarded by Steve HopperTRANSREDES on PM Steve Hopper PM To r Peter E nronXGate cc Subject Emergency At pm today a CLHB line walker discovered a bomb on their LPG line in the Altiplano km from out SicaSica station Our OSSA II crude ex ports to Chile and GAA gas to LaPaz share the same ROW and would likely have been taken out with the bomb We understand that the bomb which had a manual fuse did not go off but had been lit and failed to explode Th e Army has been mobilized to diffuse the bomb and we consider the immediate threat neutralized However given that we have now seen several attempts in the last days of sabotage against our lines I have declared a state of EMERGENCY and will notify the Enron Crisis team We have shut all Altiplano pipeline operations down and have mobilized a joint CLHBTRArmy team to perform vigilance on the entire altiplano network The immediate result of this is that lights will likely start to go out in LaPaz within the next few hours the GAA line is their primary powe r fuel supply Ive notified all relevant government authorities of the situation and so far am getting support Ive also asked the Embassy t o look into the situation with the understanding that if this is the result of an organized movement they might have access to intelligence that could be helpful Additionally weve shut down all noncritical maintenance operations throughtout the rest of the system and are directing spare personnel to perform vigilance on the remainder of the system as quickly as possible Until and unless we have information that this threat goes beyond the altiplano we will continue operations with all stations on alert We will kick off the the total system inspection within the next few hours as soon as our people complete the overall plan I will keep you posted as things develop Steve

in Bellingham Washington Forwarded by Michael TerrasoOTSEnron on AM Terry D Boss NGAAorg on AM To Dave Johnson Email Mike Terraso Email cc Subject Articles on Yesterdays hearings from Seattle Papers State wins OK to inspect pipelines by Brier Dudley Seattle Times staff reporter IMAGE BELLINGHAM Federal regulators yesterday agreed to allow Washington state to inspect all interstate pipelines within its borders as requested by Gov Gary Locke and the state Legislature Weve got it weve just got to work out the fine details Locke said State officials think theyll do a better job inspecting the miles of pipelines in the state than the federal Office of Pipeline Safety OPS an agency thats been harshly criticized since Olympic Pipe Lines June explosion in Bellingham that killed three people Other states have tried unsuccessfully to take control of pipeline inspections from the OPS which has only inspectors for the West Coast but only four states now have that authority Still unresolved however is whether the state will be allowed to impose safety standards stricter than federal standards The states authority could also be shortlived if the OPS and the oil industry persuade Congress later this year to reduce states role in pipeline oversight Mixed messages about the safety offices position were delivered yesterday at a special Senate field hearing on pipelinesafety concerns Locke announced that the state was given testing authority based on a faxed letter he received just hours earlier from the top administrator for pipeline safety The fax said the state could take over inspections on condition that only one state agency were responsible A state law approved last week would have divided the task between two But later in the hearing OPS deputy administrator Richard Felder acknowledged under questioning that he would prefer that inspection authority remain with his office To sidestep that debate US Sen Slade Gorton RWash proposed amending the federal law that gives the OPS authority over pipelines that cross state lines Because Olympic Pipe Line is almost entirely in Washington its mile system parallels Interstate and ends in Portland Gorton suggested that states be allowed to regulate pipelines that are over percent within their borders Olympic a Rentonbased subsidiary of Shell Texaco Arco and oil shipper GATX testified that it would prefer federal oversight Having a unified set of regulations is important for a smooth operation said manager Carl Gast Gorton and US Sen Patty Murray DWash hosts of the hearing both want the state to have more authority over interstate pipelines Theyre backing legislation that would give states authority and funding to inspect pipelines themselves and require better collection and sharing of data about pipelines condition They also want the stricter standards on pipeline testing monitoring and operations Murray whose twin sister teaches at a Bellingham school near the explosion site noted that pipelines have spilled times and killed people in the US since She also said they leak million gallons of hazardous material a year or the equivalent of the Exxon Valdez spill every two years During the hearing at Bellingham City Hall the senators also heard emotional pleas for stricter regulations from victims parents Two yearold boys and an yearold fisherman died after Olympic spilled gallons of gasoline into a city park There needs to be a zerospill policy not we only kill two or three kids a year said Frank King whose yearold Wade died in the explosion Katherine Dalen mother of yearold victim Stephen Tsorvias said the accident made people realize their neighborhoods may not be safe because of the poorly regulated underground pipelines Also testifying were city officials from Renton SeaTac and Bellevue Like Bellingham those cities are trying to get Olympic to provide more information and testing to assure residents that the pipeline is safe Olympics Gast noted that the company will use two devices to internally inspect its entire pipeline later this year The cause of the accident is still being investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board which has been hampered by Olympic employees refusal to testify and by a federal criminal investigation into the accident Copyright The Seattle Times Company Pipeline blast still evokes anger Grieving parents urge senators to pass tough safety bill Tuesday March By SCOTT SUNDE Mail Author SEATTLE POSTINTELLIGENCER REPORTER BELLINGHAM Nine months have passed since Bruce Brabecs stepson died in a horrific pipeline accident here But the memories havent faded Photo Mary King weeps as her husband Frank testifies yesterday at a Senate field hearing in Bellingham on pipeline safety Their son Wade died in the June pipeline explosion Dan DeLongPI The smell of gasoline when Brabec fills the family car reminds him of the fumes that killed Liam Wood who was and out for a day of flyfishing on June The sound of the newspaper hitting the front porch every morning reminds Brabec of when police arrived to tell him and his wife that Liam had been overcome by fumes from leaking gasoline and drowned Imagine going home tonight and your child isnt home and never will be Brabec told US Sens Slade Gorton and Patty Murray during a Senate field hearing on pipeline safety yesterday Getting involved The public may mail written comments on improving pipeline safety to the Senate Commerce Committee Dirksen Senate Office Building Washington DC Anger and anguish mixed freely at the hearing which Gorton a Republican hopes will bolster efforts to win approval for a tough pipeline safety bill introduced by Democrat Murray The hearing in Bellinghams Depressionera City Hall attracted an overflow crowd Townsfolk were forced to huddle around television sets and watch the proceedings in the lobby Their frequent applause at the angry words drifted up the stairs and into the crowded hearing room State and local officials blasted the federal Office of Pipeline Safety as ineffective It regulates interstate pipelines such as the one owned by Olympic Pipe Line Co that ruptured and caught fire in Bellingham last June There was anger too at Olympic Officials from cities through which the pipeline runs said the company had resisted supplying them with data from pipe inspections then agreed by providing Xs and Os that no one could understand We have no confidence said Connie Marshall Bellevues deputy mayor that the Olympic pipeline is safely maintained and operated within our city The company however pledged a safer pipeline pointing to a plan instituted in October to add valves test pressure strengthen computer processing and make sophisticated internal inspections The company is trying to improve any system that may have been at fault in the June accident said Carl Gast Olympic vice president and manager We are not waiting until after the investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board is complete to take action Gast said Gast who has worked in the pipeline industry for years called the companys safety plan the most farreaching with which Ive ever been involved Olympic runs a mile system that takes petroleum products from refineries north of Bellingham and at Anacortes to Portland The system runs near the Interstate corridor including through the suburbs east of Lake Washington The victims Wade King The yearold burned to death while playing in Whatcom Creek when it erupted in a fireball June Stephen Tsorvias Also he was playing with Wade when gasoline ignited after spilling from a ruptured Olympic Pipe Line fuel line Liam Wood The yearold was flyfishing on the creek when he was overcome by leaking gasoline fumes and drowned The anguish at the hearing came from the parents of Wood and parents of two yearold boys Wade King and Stephen Tsorvias who burned to death as gallons of spilled gasoline ignited and a fireball roared down Whatcom Creek At times sadness tears our hearts apart and drowns our spirits said Katherine Dalen Stephens mother Marlene Robinson Liams mother said softly I no longer have children to protect They too were angry at Olympic and at the Office of Pipeline Safety The boys families have filed wrongfuldeath lawsuits against Olympic Frank King Wades father made it clear yesterday whom he blames for the tragedy The company is an outrage It needs to be shut down King said Olympics gross wanton recklessness killed my little man King said he has evidence that Olympic had a chance in July to dig up the pipe where it would later rupture to check for possible problems but decided not to because the excavation would be too difficult Bellingham has a water plant near the site of the rupture and numerous water pipes are above the pipeline In an interview King produced an Olympic document gathered for his lawsuit that he said indicated that the company decided not to dig up the pipe In and Olympic did an internal inspection of its pipeline Possible defects were identified in the inspections near where the pipe would later rupture But Olympic has said the possible defects did not seem serious enough to dig up the pipeline near the water plant Olympic Pipe Line spokeswoman Maggie Brown said Kings testimony marked the first time she had ever heard the claim that the company was prepared to dig up that section of pipe in but decided not to Kings wife Mary erupted in frustration that the accident was allowed to happen If this is properly maintained regulated whatever it wont happen again she said tearfully Anything is going to be better than what went on in the past which was nothing In fact pipeline regulation may be changing The Washington Legislature passed a bill this year that sets up a state pipeline safety program and asks the federal government for the power to police interstate lines like Olympics Gov Gary Locke told Gorton and Murray yesterday that the federal government may be willing to give the state the authority to inspect interstate pipelines Four states currently have that authority but the federal government still retains the right to punish pipeline companies over problems found in inspections A top official of the US Transportation Department told Locke in a letter yesterday that the federal government may give Washington inspection authority Locke however also wants the state to have the authority to regulate pipelines and to use tougher standards than the federal rules to do so Murrays bill would give the states more authority Richard Felder head of the Office of Pipeline Safety admitted that his regulators have had problems We worked to restore public confidence Felder said but clearly we have a long way to go Felder said the offices proposed budget would provide it with more money for regulation He also said his office will propose a new regulation by the end of the month to require companies to test the safety of their pipelines Gorton and Murray however seemed unconvinced that federal regulators will get tough So was Bob Chipkovitch who runs the pipeline program at the National Transportation Safety Board The NTSB which has no regulatory authority has repeatedly recommended tougher rules only to see nothing happen in the Office of Pipeline Safety he said For example years after the NTSB recommended that regulators require periodic inspections no such rule has been adopted I hope Bellingham has made a difference Chipkovitch said No we havent seen a change yet by regulators But I hope this accident does provide the impetus to do that The NTSB has yet to determine the cause of the June accident But Chipkovitch said the investigation so far has shown significant performance failures by pipeline controllers He noted that the pipeline rupture began at pm June after a pump failure near Woodinville computer problems at the companys Renton headquarters and a valve closed near Anacortes But minutes later refineries north of Bellingham resumed putting gasoline in the line Controllers only started shutting down the pipeline for good at At the point where the pipeline ruptured there may be evidence of external damage Chipkovitch said Olympic contends that construction at the water plant in damaged the pipe But investigators have yet to fully test the damaged pipe A federal criminal investigation into the accident has kept them from doing so At the same time several Olympic officials have refused to talk to the NTSB fearing they would incriminate themselves Chipkovitch said the investigation also focuses on the valve near Anacortes that closed June increasing pressure in the pipe upstream The valve closed times in the six months before the Bellingham accident he said Pipeline accidents Some of the countrys largest pipeline accidents in recent years June The Olympic Pipe Line Cos pipeline in Bellingham ruptured and gallons of

miles of them deliver potential catastrophe every day By Patrick McMahon USA TODAY BELLINGHAM Wash Last summer an underground pipeline ruptured in a city park here and sent a torrent of gasoline along a wooded streambed toward two yearolds playing with a barbecue lighter After the inch pipeline had been hemorrhaging for an hour and minutes an explosion sent a fireball racing through the park A plume of smoke rose feet Authorities say the blast probably was triggered by a spark from the lighter There was a spark and the sky turned orange the boys both told me afterward says Frank King whose son Wade was one of the boys in the park Wade and his friend Stephen Tsiorvas were burned over of their bodies They died the next day Also killed was yearold Liam Wood who had graduated from high school five days before The collegebound Wood was flyfishing in the park when he was overcome by fumes fell into the creek and drowned To many people the boys were considered heroes says Mark Asmundson the mayor of this seaside city north of Seattle In sparking the explosion the boys kept the most extensive damage confined to the acre park he says The river of gasoline was heading right for the center of the city On Monday the Senate Commerce Committee held a oneday hearing here about five minutes from where the incident occurred on legislation to improve safety and government oversight of pipelines and the companies that operate them The hearing included gripping sometimes tearful testimony from the boys parents as well as statements from state and federal officials My baby died because of inaction His death was preventable said Katherine Dalen Stephens mother More than million miles of iron steel and plastic pipes some as large as feet in diameter snake beneath the earth and deliver oil gasoline natural gas and potential disaster across America every day They range from the transAlaskan pipeline to tiny pipes carrying natural gas to peoples homes Safer than gasoline trucks or oceangoing tankers by most measures onceremote pipelines are prompting new worries as sprawling metropolitan areas grow into their paths US pipeline accidents have fluctuated in the past years In the s there were liquid fuel spills and natural gas leaks roughly one a day The incidents most involving local lines carrying natural gas resulted in deaths injuries and million in property damage from through There also are environmental costs In January one of the nations largest pipeline companies Koch Industries of Wichita Kan paid a million civil fine to settle Environmental Protection Agency waterpollution charges involving oil spills from to The EPA said Koch failed to inspect its pipelines and waited for leaks before making repairs Liam Woods mother Marlene Robinson is focused on stronger regulations nationwide including more and better inspections and regional watchdog committees I dont have any children left to protect she said in an interview and repeated at the hearing This didnt have to happen to Liam and it doesnt have to happen to other peoples children Although the cause of the Bellingham incident remains under investigation one factor might have been damage to the pipeline from a backhoe when a water line was being installed in But investigators also have many questions about the role of Olympic Pipeline Co which operates a network of pipelines along a mile corridor from north of Bellingham to Portland Ore Investigators for the National Transportation Safety Board NTSB want to know whether Olympic ignored warning signs and whether it could have acted more swiftly after the leak But the inquiry has been delayed by a parallel investigation by the US Attorneys Office Several Olympic employees have declined to testify and have invoked their constitutional rights against selfincrimination Pipeline owners and government regulators defend the safety of transporting twothirds of the nations fuels by pipeline and they warn that more rules could boost energy prices Critics say pipelines are too loosely regulated not fully inspected and in some cases deteriorating The US Transportation Department oversees pipelines Its Office of Pipeline Safety sets standards for design operation maintenance and emergency response Richard Felder who heads the office testified at Mondays hearing Our goal is to prevent incidents like Bellingham from ever happening again he said In an earlier interview he defended his offices performance and the industry Its a good record Its the safest form of transporting fuel far and away The office has extensive rules on pipeline safety including requirements for signs along the route and programs to alert potential diggers but theres no such thing as risk elimination Felder says All you can do is manage it But the chairman of the federal governments transportation safety watchdog agency is unimpressed with Felders office and says it deserves a grade of F Its been the most frustrating area Ive had to deal with as chairman says Jim Hall NTSB chairman since He says no agency has a worse record of responding to NTSB recommendations In a recent speech he said theres no indication that the Office of Pipeline Safety is in charge or that its regulations its inspections its assets its staffing and its spirit are adequate to the task Felder takes issue with much of the criticism but he endorses calls for more research into pipeline safety He said his office is in the final stages of preparing new safety standards for heavily populated and environmentally sensitive areas He emphasized that the leading cause of pipeline failure is thirdparty damage from road utility and construction work The agency has worked to enhance a system to alert pipeline companies of digging with one telephone call Felder is critical of local authorities who ignore pipelines when making decisions on housing and commercial development Local planning has not kept people away from pipelines he says Its astounding to me Felder bristles at critics suggestions that his agency is a tool of the oil and gas industry I cant agree with that one iota he says We try to balance the safety issue and the economic issue The Senate Commerce Committee will consider a bipartisan bill sponsored by Sens Patty Murray DWash and Slade Gorton RWash Rep Jack Metcalf the Republican who represents Bellingham and Rep Jay Inslee a Democrat whose district includes an operating section of the pipeline The bill would require periodic internal inspections of pipelines boost federal spending on research increase the number of federal pipeline inspectors nationwide there now are and expand states regulatory authority On Monday the Office of Pipeline Safety gave the state of Washington the temporary right to do more inspections The MurrayGorton bill also would require federal certification of pipeline workers and expand the publics right to know about spills and leaks I was totally shocked and amazed when this happened Murray says You always assume that your neighborhood is safe and somebody has taken care of this The Bellingham rupture not only dumped gallons of gasoline into this city of near the Canadian border but also unleashed civic furor at Olympic Pipeline Its hard for people to get interested in things they cant see Out of sight is out of mind Mayor Asmundson says He has visited the boys grieving families and lobbied Congress The blast has dominated my life since June Pipeline operators portray accidents as isolated to escape national scrutiny he says The whole focus of the industry is containment Do whatever you have to do locally but dont stir things up nationally Last week Murray released a report she requested from the Transportation Departments inspector general It faults the Office of Pipeline Safety for ignoring enhanced safety requirements including increased inspections inside pipes in highly populated and environmentally sensitive areas as Congress required in and A US General Accounting Office audit of operations is due in May Also pending is a decision from Felder and the pipeline safety office on whether to restart the mile section shut down since the Bellingham accident Olympic Pipeline has repaired the line and is eager to reopen it People living along the route and officials are pushing for more extensive testing of the stilloperating section of the line south of Bellingham Felder says he has not decided whether it should be shut down Last week Felders office ordered a new round of testing along the entire line but critics such as Inslee are not convinced it will be enough The tests must be conducted on the closed section of the pipeline before a decision is made on reopening it Contributing Scott Hillkirk

lines I have declared a state of EMERGENCY and will notify the Enron Crisis team We have shut all Altiplano pipeline operations down and have mobilized a joint CLHBTRArmy team to perform vigilance on the entire altiplano network The immediate result of this is that lights will likely start to go out in LaPaz within the next few hours the GAA line is their primary powe r fuel supply Ive notified all relevant government authorities of the situation and so far am getting support Ive also asked the Embassy t o look into the situation with the understanding that if this is the result of an

their inspection TR will not reinitiate gas or cru de export operations until we have completed our inspection We have forme d joint teams with CLHB and Army personnel to perform the inspection It could take as long as hours but well have a better estimate after we get a progress report in the morning All crews available systemwide are mobilizing for inspection of the entire system but for now our priority continues to be the lines in the altiplano The three stations in the altiplano have been shut down bled off and locked Other supervisors throughout the system have been advised and are on alert Government and regulator continue to be supportive of our shutdown and inspection action plan We have developed a contingency plan with COBEE the regional electricity distributor under which they will redistribute energy out of spare capacity in Cochabamba to LaPaz this should cover LaPaz s electricity needs during the duration of time we need to complete our inspection The only other significant consumer is a large cement plant in LaPaz Weve agreed that they will slow down their operations and prov ide only small local supplies industrial concrete demand will be shutin We did not send a press release on the issue although we have received inquiries our response is that we are concerned about the risk to Bolivia ns this action presented and we are performing an inspection on the system We are avoiding mention of gas stoppage to LaPaz at this time due to the volatility of the issue in LaPaz Government VMEH SIRESE has agreed with the message We expect that with the cement plant and power plant offline line pack should be sufficient to keep commercial demand satisfied for a few days In either event we are working with the local gas distributor to prepare a notice for LaPaz newspapers instructing gas consumers in the area how to safely shutdown and restart their equipment in the event that it becomes necessary The most likely scenario as of now is that Edwin Morales a local revolutionary tied to the coca trade is behind the action Morales ha s had contact in the past with the Raul Rocha bunch out of Chuquina Oruro so were still not sure whether this was an act against TR andor the industry or if it is against government Morales has just joined forces with ano ther rebel out of Cochabamba and is planning nationwide road blocks for tomorrow Their agenda is national theyve never isolated TR or our industry as a whole although Chaco in the north have been targeted in the past probably because they have a field in the middle of Morales stronghold

NGAAorg on AM To Dave Johnson Email Mike Terraso Email Tilford Vik Email cc Max Brown Email Subject As Predicted the USA Today Article on Pipelines Updated PM ET When pipelines are time bombs million miles of them deliver potential catastrophe every day By Patrick McMahon USA TODAY BELLINGHAM Wash Last summer an underground pipeline ruptured in a city park here and sent a torrent of gasoline along a wooded streambed toward two yearolds playing with a barbecue lighter After the inch pipeline had been hemorrhaging for an hour and minutes an explosion sent a fireball racing through the park A plume of smoke rose feet Authorities say the blast probably was triggered by a spark from the lighter There was a spark and the sky turned orange the boys both told me afterward says Frank King whose son Wade was one of the boys in the park Wade and his friend Stephen Tsiorvas were burned over of their bodies They died the next day Also killed was yearold Liam Wood who had graduated from high school five days before The collegebound Wood was flyfishing in the park when he was overcome by fumes fell into the creek and drowned To many people the boys were considered heroes says Mark Asmundson the mayor of this seaside city north of Seattle In sparking the explosion the boys kept the most extensive damage confined to the acre park he says The river of gasoline was heading right for the center of the city On Monday the Senate Commerce Committee held a oneday hearing here about five minutes from where the incident occurred on legislation to improve safety and government oversight of pipelines and the companies that operate them The hearing included gripping sometimes tearful testimony from the boys parents as well as statements from state and federal officials My baby died because of inaction His death was preventable said Katherine Dalen Stephens mother More than million miles of iron steel and plastic pipes some as large as feet in diameter snake beneath the earth and deliver oil gasoline natural gas and potential disaster across America every day They range from the transAlaskan pipeline to tiny pipes carrying natural gas to peoples homes Safer than gasoline trucks or oceangoing tankers by most measures onceremote pipelines are prompting new worries as sprawling metropolitan areas grow into their paths US pipeline accidents have fluctuated in the past years In the s there were liquid fuel spills and natural gas leaks roughly one a day The incidents most involving local lines carrying natural gas resulted in deaths injuries and million in property damage from through There also are environmental costs In January one of the nations largest pipeline companies Koch Industries of Wichita Kan paid a million civil fine to settle Environmental Protection Agency waterpollution charges involving oil spills from to The EPA said Koch failed to inspect its pipelines and waited for leaks before making repairs Liam Woods mother Marlene Robinson is focused on stronger regulations nationwide including more and better inspections and regional watchdog committees I dont have any children left to protect she said in an interview and repeated at the hearing This didnt have to happen to Liam and it doesnt have to happen to other peoples children Although the cause of the Bellingham incident remains under investigation one factor might have been damage to the pipeline from a backhoe when a water line was being installed in But investigators also have many questions about the role of Olympic Pipeline Co which operates a network of pipelines along a mile corridor from north of Bellingham to Portland Ore Investigators for the National Transportation Safety Board NTSB want to know whether Olympic ignored warning signs and whether it could have acted more swiftly after the leak But the inquiry has been delayed by a parallel investigation by the US Attorneys Office Several Olympic employees have declined to testify and have invoked their constitutional rights against selfincrimination Pipeline owners and government regulators defend the safety of transporting twothirds of the nations fuels by pipeline and they warn that more rules could boost energy prices Critics say pipelines are too loosely regulated not fully inspected and in some cases deteriorating The US Transportation Department oversees pipelines Its Office of Pipeline Safety sets standards for design operation maintenance and emergency response Richard Felder who heads the office testified at Mondays hearing Our goal is to prevent incidents like Bellingham from ever happening again he said In an earlier interview he defended his offices performance and the industry Its a good record Its the safest form of transporting fuel far and away The office has extensive rules on pipeline safety including requirements for signs along the route and programs to alert potential diggers but theres no such thing as risk elimination Felder says All you can do is manage it But the chairman of the federal governments transportation safety watchdog agency is unimpressed with Felders office and says it deserves a grade of F Its been the most frustrating area Ive had to deal with as chairman says Jim Hall NTSB chairman since He says no agency has a worse record of responding to NTSB recommendations In a recent speech he said theres no indication that the Office of Pipeline Safety is in charge or that its regulations its inspections its assets its staffing and its spirit are adequate to the task Felder takes issue with much of the criticism but he endorses calls for more research into pipeline safety He said his office is in the final stages of preparing new safety standards for heavily populated and environmentally sensitive areas He emphasized that the leading cause of pipeline failure is thirdparty damage from road utility and construction work The agency has worked to enhance a system to alert pipeline companies of digging with one telephone call Felder is critical of local authorities who ignore pipelines when making decisions on housing and commercial development Local planning has not kept people away from pipelines he says Its astounding to me Felder bristles at critics suggestions that his agency is a tool of the oil and gas industry I cant agree with that one iota he says We try to balance the safety issue and the economic issue The Senate Commerce Committee will consider a bipartisan bill sponsored by Sens Patty Murray DWash and Slade Gorton RWash Rep Jack Metcalf the Republican who represents Bellingham and Rep Jay Inslee a Democrat whose district includes an operating section of the pipeline The bill would require periodic internal inspections of pipelines boost federal spending on research increase the number of federal pipeline inspectors nationwide there now are and expand states regulatory authority On Monday the Office of Pipeline Safety gave the state of Washington the temporary right to do more inspections The MurrayGorton bill also would require federal certification of pipeline workers and expand the publics right to know about spills and leaks I was totally shocked and amazed when this happened Murray says You always assume that your neighborhood is safe and somebody has taken care of this The Bellingham rupture not only dumped gallons of gasoline into this city of near the Canadian border but also unleashed civic furor at Olympic Pipeline Its hard for people to get interested in things they cant see Out of sight is out of mind Mayor Asmundson says He has visited the boys grieving families and lobbied Congress The blast has dominated my life since June Pipeline operators portray accidents as isolated to escape national scrutiny he says The whole focus of the industry is containment Do whatever you have to do locally but dont stir things up nationally Last week Murray released a report she requested from the Transportation Departments inspector general It faults the Office of Pipeline Safety for ignoring enhanced safety requirements including increased inspections inside pipes in highly populated and environmentally sensitive areas as Congress required in and A US General Accounting Office audit of operations is due in May Also pending is a decision from Felder and the pipeline safety office on whether to restart the mile section shut down since the Bellingham accident Olympic Pipeline has repaired the line and is eager to reopen it People living along the route and officials are pushing for more extensive testing of the stilloperating section of the line south of Bellingham Felder says he has not decided whether it should be shut down Last week Felders office ordered a new round of testing along the entire line but critics such as Inslee are not convinced it will be enough The tests must be conducted on the closed section of the pipeline before a decision is made on reopening it Contributing Scott Hillkirk

State wins OK to inspect pipelines by Brier Dudley Seattle Times staff reporter IMAGE BELLINGHAM Federal regulators yesterday agreed to allow Washington state to inspect all interstate pipelines within its borders as requested by Gov Gary Locke and the state Legislature Weve got it weve just got to work out the fine details Locke said State officials think theyll do a better job inspecting the miles of pipelines in the state than the federal Office of Pipeline Safety OPS an agency thats been harshly criticized since Olympic Pipe Lines June explosion in Bellingham that killed three people Other states have tried unsuccessfully to take control of pipeline inspections from the OPS which has only inspectors for the West Coast but only four states now have that authority Still unresolved however is whether the state will be allowed to impose safety standards stricter than federal standards The states authority could also be shortlived if the OPS and the oil industry persuade Congress later this year to reduce states role in pipeline oversight Mixed messages about the safety offices position were delivered yesterday at a special Senate field hearing on pipelinesafety concerns Locke announced that the state was given testing authority based on a faxed letter he received just hours earlier from the top administrator for pipeline safety The fax said the state could take over inspections on condition that only one state agency were responsible A state law approved last week would have divided the task between two But later in the hearing OPS deputy administrator Richard Felder acknowledged under questioning that he would prefer that inspection authority remain with his office To sidestep that debate US Sen Slade Gorton RWash proposed amending the federal law that gives the OPS authority over pipelines that cross state lines Because Olympic Pipe Line is almost entirely in Washington its mile system parallels Interstate and ends in Portland Gorton suggested that states be allowed to regulate pipelines that are over percent within their borders Olympic a Rentonbased subsidiary of Shell Texaco Arco and oil shipper GATX testified that it would prefer federal oversight Having a unified set of regulations is important for a smooth operation said manager Carl Gast Gorton and US Sen Patty Murray DWash hosts of the hearing both want the state to have more authority over interstate pipelines Theyre backing legislation that would give states authority and funding to inspect pipelines themselves and require better collection and sharing of data about pipelines condition They also want the stricter standards on pipeline testing monitoring and operations Murray whose twin sister teaches at a Bellingham school near the explosion site noted that pipelines have spilled times and killed people in the US since She also said they leak million gallons of hazardous material a year or the equivalent of the Exxon Valdez spill every two years During the hearing at Bellingham City Hall the senators also heard emotional pleas for stricter regulations from victims parents Two yearold boys and an yearold fisherman died after Olympic spilled gallons of gasoline into a city park There needs to be a zerospill policy not we only kill two or three kids a year said Frank King whose yearold Wade died in the explosion Katherine Dalen mother of yearold victim Stephen Tsorvias said the accident made people realize their neighborhoods may not be safe because of the poorly regulated underground pipelines Also testifying were city officials from Renton SeaTac and Bellevue Like Bellingham those cities are trying to get Olympic to provide more information and testing to assure residents that the pipeline is safe Olympics Gast noted that the company will use two devices to internally inspect its entire pipeline later this year The cause of the accident is still being investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board which has been hampered by Olympic employees refusal to testify and by a federal criminal investigation into the accident Copyright The Seattle Times Company Pipeline blast still evokes anger Grieving parents urge senators to pass tough safety bill Tuesday March By SCOTT SUNDE Mail Author SEATTLE POSTINTELLIGENCER REPORTER BELLINGHAM Nine months have passed since Bruce Brabecs stepson died in a horrific pipeline accident here But the memories havent faded Photo Mary King weeps as her husband Frank testifies yesterday at a Senate field hearing in Bellingham on pipeline safety Their son Wade died in the June pipeline explosion Dan DeLongPI The smell of gasoline when Brabec fills the family car reminds him of the fumes that killed Liam Wood who was and out for a day of flyfishing on June The sound of the newspaper hitting the front porch every morning reminds Brabec of when police arrived to tell him and his wife that Liam had been overcome by fumes from leaking gasoline and drowned Imagine going home tonight and your child isnt home and never will be Brabec told US Sens Slade Gorton and Patty Murray during a Senate field hearing on pipeline safety yesterday Getting involved The public may mail written comments on improving pipeline safety to the Senate Commerce Committee Dirksen Senate Office Building Washington DC Anger and anguish mixed freely at the hearing which Gorton a Republican hopes will bolster efforts to win approval for a tough pipeline safety bill introduced by Democrat Murray The hearing in Bellinghams Depressionera City Hall attracted an overflow crowd Townsfolk were forced to huddle around television sets and watch the proceedings in the lobby Their frequent applause at the angry words drifted up the stairs and into the crowded hearing room State and local officials blasted the federal Office of Pipeline Safety as ineffective It regulates interstate pipelines such as the one owned by Olympic Pipe Line Co that ruptured and caught fire in Bellingham last June There was anger too at Olympic Officials from cities through which the pipeline runs said the company had resisted supplying them with data from pipe inspections then agreed by providing Xs and Os that no one could understand We have no confidence said Connie Marshall Bellevues deputy mayor that the Olympic pipeline is safely maintained and operated within our city The company however pledged a safer pipeline pointing to a plan instituted in October to add valves test pressure strengthen computer processing and make sophisticated internal inspections The company is trying to improve any system that may have been at fault in the June accident said Carl Gast Olympic vice president and manager We are not waiting until after the investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board is complete to take action Gast said Gast who has worked in the pipeline industry for years called the companys safety plan the most farreaching with which Ive ever been involved Olympic runs a mile system that takes petroleum products from refineries north of Bellingham and at Anacortes to Portland The system runs near the Interstate corridor including through the suburbs east of Lake Washington The victims Wade King The yearold burned to death while playing in Whatcom Creek when it erupted in a fireball June Stephen Tsorvias Also he was playing with Wade when gasoline ignited after spilling from a ruptured Olympic Pipe Line fuel line Liam Wood The yearold was flyfishing on the creek when he was overcome by leaking gasoline fumes and drowned The anguish at the hearing came from the parents of Wood and parents of two yearold boys Wade King and Stephen Tsorvias who burned to death as gallons of spilled gasoline ignited and a fireball roared down Whatcom Creek At times sadness tears our hearts apart and drowns our spirits said Katherine Dalen Stephens mother Marlene Robinson Liams mother said softly I no longer have children to protect They too were angry at Olympic and at the Office of Pipeline Safety The boys families have filed wrongfuldeath lawsuits against Olympic Frank King Wades father made it clear yesterday whom he blames for the tragedy The company is an outrage It needs to be shut down King said Olympics gross wanton recklessness killed my little man King said he has evidence that Olympic had a chance in July to dig up the pipe where it would later rupture to check for possible problems but decided not to because the excavation would be too difficult Bellingham has a water plant near the site of the rupture and numerous water pipes are above the pipeline In an interview King produced an Olympic document gathered for his lawsuit that he said indicated that the company decided not to dig up the pipe In and Olympic did an internal inspection of its pipeline Possible defects were identified in the inspections near where the pipe would later rupture But Olympic has said the possible defects did not seem serious enough to dig up the pipeline near the water plant Olympic Pipe Line spokeswoman Maggie Brown said Kings testimony marked the first time she had ever heard the claim that the company was prepared to dig up that section of pipe in but decided not to Kings wife Mary erupted in frustration that the accident was allowed to happen If this is properly maintained regulated whatever it wont happen again she said tearfully Anything is going to be better than what went on in the past which was nothing In fact pipeline regulation may be changing The Washington Legislature passed a bill this year that sets up a state pipeline safety program and asks the federal government for the power to police interstate lines like Olympics Gov Gary Locke told Gorton and Murray yesterday that the federal government may be willing to give the state the authority to inspect interstate pipelines Four states currently have that authority but the federal government still retains the right to punish pipeline companies over problems found in inspections A top official of the US Transportation Department told Locke in a letter yesterday that the federal government may give Washington inspection authority Locke however also wants the state to have the authority to regulate pipelines and to use tougher standards than the federal rules to do so Murrays bill would give the states more authority Richard Felder head of the Office of Pipeline Safety admitted that his regulators have had problems We worked to restore public confidence Felder said but clearly we have a long way to go Felder said the offices proposed budget would provide it with more money for regulation He also said his office will propose a new regulation by the end of the month to require companies to test the safety of their pipelines Gorton and Murray however seemed unconvinced that federal regulators will get tough So was Bob Chipkovitch who runs the pipeline program at the National Transportation Safety Board The NTSB which has no regulatory authority has repeatedly recommended tougher rules only to see nothing happen in the Office of Pipeline Safety he said For example years after the NTSB recommended that regulators require periodic inspections no such rule has been adopted I hope Bellingham has made a difference Chipkovitch said No we havent seen a change yet by regulators But I hope this accident does provide the impetus to do that The NTSB has yet to determine the cause of the June accident But Chipkovitch said the investigation so far has shown significant performance failures by pipeline controllers He noted that the pipeline rupture began at pm June after a pump failure near Woodinville computer problems at the companys Renton headquarters and a valve closed near Anacortes But minutes later refineries north of Bellingham resumed putting gasoline in the line Controllers only started shutting down the pipeline for good at At the point where the pipeline ruptured there may be evidence of external damage Chipkovitch said Olympic contends that construction at the water plant in damaged the pipe But investigators have yet to fully test the damaged pipe A federal criminal investigation into the accident has kept them from doing so At the same time several Olympic officials have refused to talk to the NTSB fearing they would incriminate themselves Chipkovitch said the investigation also focuses on the valve near Anacortes that closed June increasing pressure in the pipe upstream The valve closed times in the six months before the Bellingham accident he said Pipeline accidents Some of the countrys largest pipeline accidents in recent years June The Olympic Pipe Line Cos pipeline in Bellingham ruptured and gallons of jet fuel spilled into Whatcom Creek then ignited above killing two yearold boys and an yearold fisherman It was the rd reported spill on the line since it was opened in November Propane from a leaking gasservice pipe exploded in downtown San Juan Puerto Rico killing people and injuring others August A pipeline carrying liquid butane ruptured in Lively Texas sending a butane vapor cloud into a

NGAAorg on AM To Dave Johnson Email Mike Terraso Email Tilford Vik Email cc Max Brown Email Subject As Predicted the USA Today Article on Pipelines Updated PM ET When pipelines are time bombs million miles of them deliver potential catastrophe every day By Patrick McMahon USA TODAY BELLINGHAM Wash Last summer an underground pipeline ruptured in a city park here and sent a torrent of gasoline along a wooded streambed toward two yearolds playing with a barbecue lighter After the inch pipeline had been hemorrhaging for an hour and minutes an explosion sent a fireball racing through the park A plume of smoke rose feet Authorities say the blast probably was triggered by a spark from the lighter There was a spark and the sky turned orange the boys both told me afterward says Frank King whose son Wade was one of the boys in the park Wade and his friend Stephen Tsiorvas were burned over of their bodies They died the next day Also killed was yearold Liam Wood who had graduated from high school five days before The collegebound Wood was flyfishing in the park when he was overcome by fumes fell into the creek and drowned To many people the boys were considered heroes says Mark Asmundson the mayor of this seaside city north of Seattle In sparking the explosion the boys kept the most extensive damage confined to the acre park he says The river of gasoline was heading right for the center of the city On Monday the Senate Commerce Committee held a oneday hearing here about five minutes from where the incident occurred on legislation to improve safety and government oversight of pipelines and the companies that operate them The hearing included gripping sometimes tearful testimony from the boys parents as well as statements from state and federal officials My baby died because of inaction His death was preventable said Katherine Dalen Stephens mother More than million miles of iron steel and plastic pipes some as large as feet in diameter snake beneath the earth and deliver oil gasoline natural gas and potential disaster across America every day They range from the transAlaskan pipeline to tiny pipes carrying natural gas to peoples homes Safer than gasoline trucks or oceangoing tankers by most measures onceremote pipelines are prompting new worries as sprawling metropolitan areas grow into their paths US pipeline accidents have fluctuated in the past years In the s there were liquid fuel spills and natural gas leaks roughly one a day The incidents most involving local lines carrying natural gas resulted in deaths injuries and million in property damage from through There also are environmental costs In January one of the nations largest pipeline companies Koch Industries of Wichita Kan paid a million civil fine to settle Environmental Protection Agency waterpollution charges involving oil spills from to The EPA said Koch failed to inspect its pipelines and waited for leaks before making repairs Liam Woods mother Marlene Robinson is focused on stronger regulations nationwide including more and better inspections and regional watchdog committees I dont have any children left to protect she said in an interview and repeated at the hearing This didnt have to happen to Liam and it doesnt have to happen to other peoples children Although the cause of the Bellingham incident remains under investigation one factor might have been damage to the pipeline from a backhoe when a water line was being installed in But investigators also have many questions about the role of Olympic Pipeline Co which operates a network of pipelines along a mile corridor from north of Bellingham to Portland Ore Investigators for the National Transportation Safety Board NTSB want to know whether Olympic ignored warning signs and whether it could have acted more swiftly after the leak But the inquiry has been delayed by a parallel investigation by the US Attorneys Office Several Olympic employees have declined to testify and have invoked their constitutional rights against selfincrimination Pipeline owners and government regulators defend the safety of transporting twothirds of the nations fuels by pipeline and they warn that more rules could boost energy prices Critics say pipelines are too loosely regulated not fully inspected and in some cases deteriorating The US Transportation Department oversees pipelines Its Office of Pipeline Safety sets standards for design operation maintenance and emergency response Richard Felder who heads the office testified at Mondays hearing Our goal is to prevent incidents like Bellingham from ever happening again he said In an earlier interview he defended his offices performance and the industry Its a good record Its the safest form of transporting fuel far and away The office has extensive rules on pipeline safety including requirements for signs along the route and programs to alert potential diggers but theres no such thing as risk elimination Felder says All you can do is manage it But the chairman of the federal governments transportation safety watchdog agency is unimpressed with Felders office and says it deserves a grade of F Its been the most frustrating area Ive had to deal with as chairman says Jim Hall NTSB chairman since He says no agency has a worse record of responding to NTSB recommendations In a recent speech he said theres no indication that the Office of Pipeline Safety is in charge or that its regulations its inspections its assets its staffing and its spirit are adequate to the task Felder takes issue with much of the criticism but he endorses calls for more research into pipeline safety He said his office is in the final stages of preparing new safety standards for heavily populated and environmentally sensitive areas He emphasized that the leading cause of pipeline failure is thirdparty damage from road utility and construction work The agency has worked to enhance a system to alert pipeline companies of digging with one telephone call Felder is critical of local authorities who ignore pipelines when making decisions on housing and commercial development Local planning has not kept people away from pipelines he says Its astounding to me Felder bristles at critics suggestions that his agency is a tool of the oil and gas industry I cant agree with that one iota he says We try to balance the safety issue and the economic issue The Senate Commerce Committee will consider a bipartisan bill sponsored by Sens Patty Murray DWash and Slade Gorton RWash Rep Jack Metcalf the Republican who represents Bellingham and Rep Jay Inslee a Democrat whose district includes an operating section of the pipeline The bill would require periodic internal inspections of pipelines boost federal spending on research increase the number of federal pipeline inspectors nationwide there now are and expand states regulatory authority On Monday the Office of Pipeline Safety gave the state of Washington the temporary right to do more inspections The MurrayGorton bill also would require federal certification of pipeline workers and expand the publics right to know about spills and leaks I was totally shocked and amazed when this happened Murray says You always assume that your neighborhood is safe and somebody has taken care of this The Bellingham rupture not only dumped gallons of gasoline into this city of near the Canadian border but also unleashed civic furor at Olympic Pipeline Its hard for people to get interested in things they cant see Out of sight is out of mind Mayor Asmundson says He has visited the boys grieving families and lobbied Congress The blast has dominated my life since June Pipeline operators portray accidents as isolated to escape national scrutiny he says The whole focus of the industry is containment Do whatever you have to do locally but dont stir things up nationally Last week Murray released a report she requested from the Transportation Departments inspector general It faults the Office of Pipeline Safety for ignoring enhanced safety requirements including increased inspections inside pipes in highly populated and environmentally sensitive areas as Congress required in and A US General Accounting Office audit of operations is due in May Also pending is a decision from Felder and the pipeline safety office on whether to restart the mile section shut down since the Bellingham accident Olympic Pipeline has repaired the line and is eager to reopen it People living along the route and officials are pushing for more extensive testing of the stilloperating section of the line south of Bellingham Felder says he has not decided whether it should be shut down Last week Felders office ordered a new round of testing along the entire line but critics such as Inslee are not convinced it will be enough The tests must be conducted on the closed section of the pipeline before a decision is made on reopening it Contributing Scott Hillkirk

State wins OK to inspect pipelines by Brier Dudley Seattle Times staff reporter IMAGE BELLINGHAM Federal regulators yesterday agreed to allow Washington state to inspect all interstate pipelines within its borders as requested by Gov Gary Locke and the state Legislature Weve got it weve just got to work out the fine details Locke said State officials think theyll do a better job inspecting the miles of pipelines in the state than the federal Office of Pipeline Safety OPS an agency thats been harshly criticized since Olympic Pipe Lines June explosion in Bellingham that killed three people Other states have tried unsuccessfully to take control of pipeline inspections from the OPS which has only inspectors for the West Coast but only four states now have that authority Still unresolved however is whether the state will be allowed to impose safety standards stricter than federal standards The states authority could also be shortlived if the OPS and the oil industry persuade Congress later this year to reduce states role in pipeline oversight Mixed messages about the safety offices position were delivered yesterday at a special Senate field hearing on pipelinesafety concerns Locke announced that the state was given testing authority based on a faxed letter he received just hours earlier from the top administrator for pipeline safety The fax said the state could take over inspections on condition that only one state agency were responsible A state law approved last week would have divided the task between two But later in the hearing OPS deputy administrator Richard Felder acknowledged under questioning that he would prefer that inspection authority remain with his office To sidestep that debate US Sen Slade Gorton RWash proposed amending the federal law that gives the OPS authority over pipelines that cross state lines Because Olympic Pipe Line is almost entirely in Washington its mile system parallels Interstate and ends in Portland Gorton suggested that states be allowed to regulate pipelines that are over percent within their borders Olympic a Rentonbased subsidiary of Shell Texaco Arco and oil shipper GATX testified that it would prefer federal oversight Having a unified set of regulations is important for a smooth operation said manager Carl Gast Gorton and US Sen Patty Murray DWash hosts of the hearing both want the state to have more authority over interstate pipelines Theyre backing legislation that would give states authority and funding to inspect pipelines themselves and require better collection and sharing of data about pipelines condition They also want the stricter standards on pipeline testing monitoring and operations Murray whose twin sister teaches at a Bellingham school near the explosion site noted that pipelines have spilled times and killed people in the US since She also said they leak million gallons of hazardous material a year or the equivalent of the Exxon Valdez spill every two years During the hearing at Bellingham City Hall the senators also heard emotional pleas for stricter regulations from victims parents Two yearold boys and an yearold fisherman died after Olympic spilled gallons of gasoline into a city park There needs to be a zerospill policy not we only kill two or three kids a year said Frank King whose yearold Wade died in the explosion Katherine Dalen mother of yearold victim Stephen Tsorvias said the accident made people realize their neighborhoods may not be safe because of the poorly regulated underground pipelines Also testifying were city officials from Renton SeaTac and Bellevue Like Bellingham those cities are trying to get Olympic to provide more information and testing to assure residents that the pipeline is safe Olympics Gast noted that the company will use two devices to internally inspect its entire pipeline later this year The cause of the accident is still being investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board which has been hampered by Olympic employees refusal to testify and by a federal criminal investigation into the accident Copyright The Seattle Times Company Pipeline blast still evokes anger Grieving parents urge senators to pass tough safety bill Tuesday March By SCOTT SUNDE Mail Author SEATTLE POSTINTELLIGENCER REPORTER BELLINGHAM Nine months have passed since Bruce Brabecs stepson died in a horrific pipeline accident here But the memories havent faded Photo Mary King weeps as her husband Frank testifies yesterday at a Senate field hearing in Bellingham on pipeline safety Their son Wade died in the June pipeline explosion Dan DeLongPI The smell of gasoline when Brabec fills the family car reminds him of the fumes that killed Liam Wood who was and out for a day of flyfishing on June The sound of the newspaper hitting the front porch every morning reminds Brabec of when police arrived to tell him and his wife that Liam had been overcome by fumes from leaking gasoline and drowned Imagine going home tonight and your child isnt home and never will be Brabec told US Sens Slade Gorton and Patty Murray during a Senate field hearing on pipeline safety yesterday Getting involved The public may mail written comments on improving pipeline safety to the Senate Commerce Committee Dirksen Senate Office Building Washington DC Anger and anguish mixed freely at the hearing which Gorton a Republican hopes will bolster efforts to win approval for a tough pipeline safety bill introduced by Democrat Murray The hearing in Bellinghams Depressionera City Hall attracted an overflow crowd Townsfolk were forced to huddle around television sets and watch the proceedings in the lobby Their frequent applause at the angry words drifted up the stairs and into the crowded hearing room State and local officials blasted the federal Office of Pipeline Safety as ineffective It regulates interstate pipelines such as the one owned by Olympic Pipe Line Co that ruptured and caught fire in Bellingham last June There was anger too at Olympic Officials from cities through which the pipeline runs said the company had resisted supplying them with data from pipe inspections then agreed by providing Xs and Os that no one could understand We have no confidence said Connie Marshall Bellevues deputy mayor that the Olympic pipeline is safely maintained and operated within our city The company however pledged a safer pipeline pointing to a plan instituted in October to add valves test pressure strengthen computer processing and make sophisticated internal inspections The company is trying to improve any system that may have been at fault in the June accident said Carl Gast Olympic vice president and manager We are not waiting until after the investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board is complete to take action Gast said Gast who has worked in the pipeline industry for years called the companys safety plan the most farreaching with which Ive ever been involved Olympic runs a mile system that takes petroleum products from refineries north of Bellingham and at Anacortes to Portland The system runs near the Interstate corridor including through the suburbs east of Lake Washington The victims Wade King The yearold burned to death while playing in Whatcom Creek when it erupted in a fireball June Stephen Tsorvias Also he was playing with Wade when gasoline ignited after spilling from a ruptured Olympic Pipe Line fuel line Liam Wood The yearold was flyfishing on the creek when he was overcome by leaking gasoline fumes and drowned The anguish at the hearing came from the parents of Wood and parents of two yearold boys Wade King and Stephen Tsorvias who burned to death as gallons of spilled gasoline ignited and a fireball roared down Whatcom Creek At times sadness tears our hearts apart and drowns our spirits said Katherine Dalen Stephens mother Marlene Robinson Liams mother said softly I no longer have children to protect They too were angry at Olympic and at the Office of Pipeline Safety The boys families have filed wrongfuldeath lawsuits against Olympic Frank King Wades father made it clear yesterday whom he blames for the tragedy The company is an outrage It needs to be shut down King said Olympics gross wanton recklessness killed my little man King said he has evidence that Olympic had a chance in July to dig up the pipe where it would later rupture to check for possible problems but decided not to because the excavation would be too difficult Bellingham has a water plant near the site of the rupture and numerous water pipes are above the pipeline In an interview King produced an Olympic document gathered for his lawsuit that he said indicated that the company decided not to dig up the pipe In and Olympic did an internal inspection of its pipeline Possible defects were identified in the inspections near where the pipe would later rupture But Olympic has said the possible defects did not seem serious enough to dig up the pipeline near the water plant Olympic Pipe Line spokeswoman Maggie Brown said Kings testimony marked the first time she had ever heard the claim that the company was prepared to dig up that section of pipe in but decided not to Kings wife Mary erupted in frustration that the accident was allowed to happen If this is properly maintained regulated whatever it wont happen again she said tearfully Anything is going to be better than what went on in the past which was nothing In fact pipeline regulation may be changing The Washington Legislature passed a bill this year that sets up a state pipeline safety program and asks the federal government for the power to police interstate lines like Olympics Gov Gary Locke told Gorton and Murray yesterday that the federal government may be willing to give the state the authority to inspect interstate pipelines Four states currently have that authority but the federal government still retains the right to punish pipeline companies over problems found in inspections A top official of the US Transportation Department told Locke in a letter yesterday that the federal government may give Washington inspection authority Locke however also wants the state to have the authority to regulate pipelines and to use tougher standards than the federal rules to do so Murrays bill would give the states more authority Richard Felder head of the Office of Pipeline Safety admitted that his regulators have had problems We worked to restore public confidence Felder said but clearly we have a long way to go Felder said the offices proposed budget would provide it with more money for regulation He also said his office will propose a new regulation by the end of the month to require companies to test the safety of their pipelines Gorton and Murray however seemed unconvinced that federal regulators will get tough So was Bob Chipkovitch who runs the pipeline program at the National Transportation Safety Board The NTSB which has no regulatory authority has repeatedly recommended tougher rules only to see nothing happen in the Office of Pipeline Safety he said For example years after the NTSB recommended that regulators require periodic inspections no such rule has been adopted I hope Bellingham has made a difference Chipkovitch said No we havent seen a change yet by regulators But I hope this accident does provide the impetus to do that The NTSB has yet to determine the cause of the June accident But Chipkovitch said the investigation so far has shown significant performance failures by pipeline controllers He noted that the pipeline rupture began at pm June after a pump failure near Woodinville computer problems at the companys Renton headquarters and a valve closed near Anacortes But minutes later refineries north of Bellingham resumed putting gasoline in the line Controllers only started shutting down the pipeline for good at At the point where the pipeline ruptured there may be evidence of external damage Chipkovitch said Olympic contends that construction at the water plant in damaged the pipe But investigators have yet to fully test the damaged pipe A federal criminal investigation into the accident has kept them from doing so At the same time several Olympic officials have refused to talk to the NTSB fearing they would incriminate themselves Chipkovitch said the investigation also focuses on the valve near Anacortes that closed June increasing pressure in the pipe upstream The valve closed times in the six months before the Bellingham accident he said Pipeline accidents Some of the countrys largest pipeline accidents in recent years June The Olympic Pipe Line Cos pipeline in Bellingham ruptured and gallons of jet fuel spilled into Whatcom Creek then ignited above killing two yearold boys and an yearold fisherman It was the rd reported spill on the line since it was opened in November Propane from a leaking gasservice pipe exploded in downtown San Juan Puerto Rico killing people and injuring others August A pipeline carrying liquid butane ruptured in Lively Texas sending a butane vapor cloud into a

their inspection TR will not reinitiate gas or cru de export operations until we have completed our inspection We have forme d joint teams with CLHB and Army personnel to perform the inspection It could take as long as hours but well have a better estimate after we get a progress report in the morning All crews available systemwide are mobilizing for inspection of the entire system but for now our priority continues to be the lines in the altiplano The three stations in the altiplano have been shut down bled off and locked Other supervisors throughout the system have been advised and are on alert Government and regulator continue to be supportive of our shutdown and inspection action plan We have developed a contingency plan with COBEE the regional electricity distributor under which they will redistribute energy out of spare capacity in Cochabamba to LaPaz this should cover LaPaz s electricity needs during the duration of time we need to complete our inspection The only other significant consumer is a large cement plant in LaPaz Weve agreed that they will slow down their operations and prov ide only small local supplies industrial concrete demand will be shutin We did not send a press release on the issue although we have received inquiries our response is that we are concerned about the risk to Bolivia ns this action presented and we are performing an inspection on the system We are avoiding mention of gas stoppage to LaPaz at this time due to the volatility of the issue in LaPaz Government VMEH SIRESE has agreed with the message We expect that with the cement plant and power plant offline line pack should be sufficient to keep commercial demand satisfied for a few days In either event we are working with the local gas distributor to prepare a notice for LaPaz newspapers instructing gas consumers in the area how to safely shutdown and restart their equipment in the event that it becomes necessary The most likely scenario as of now is that Edwin Morales a local revolutionary tied to the coca trade is behind the action Morales ha s had contact in the past with the Raul Rocha bunch out of Chuquina Oruro so were still not sure whether this was an act against TR andor the industry or if it is against government Morales has just joined forces with ano ther rebel out of Cochabamba and is planning nationwide road blocks for tomorrow Their agenda is national theyve never isolated TR or our industry as a whole although Chaco in the north have been targeted in the past probably because they have a field in the middle of Morales stronghold The political situation here is tenuous with Banzer out and various political interests looking to fill the leadership void Were watching this situ ation closely The local Army brigade has committed to staying on vigilance f or at least the next few days once were comfortable with the operational situation well discuss a longerterm solution Steve Forwarded by Steve HopperTRANSREDES on PM Steve Hopper PM To r Peter E nronXGate cc Subject Emergency At pm today a CLHB line walker discovered a bomb on their LPG line in the Altiplano km from out SicaSica station Our OSSA II crude ex ports to Chile and GAA gas to LaPaz share the same ROW and would likely have been taken out with the bomb We understand that the bomb which had a manual fuse did not go off but had been lit and failed to explode Th e Army has been mobilized to diffuse the bomb and we consider the immediate threat neutralized However given that we have now seen several attempts in the last days of sabotage against our lines I have declared a state of EMERGENCY and will notify the Enron Crisis team We have shut all Altiplano pipeline operations down and have mobilized a joint CLHBTRArmy team to perform vigilance on the entire altiplano network The immediate result of this is that lights will likely start to go out in LaPaz within the next few hours the GAA line is their primary powe r fuel supply Ive notified all relevant government authorities of the situation and so far am getting support Ive also asked the Embassy t o look into the situation with the understanding that if this is the result of an organized movement they might have access to intelligence that could be helpful Additionally weve shut down all noncritical maintenance operations throughtout the rest of the system and are directing spare personnel to perform vigilance on the remainder of the system as quickly as possible Until and unless we have information that this threat goes beyond the altiplano we will continue operations with all stations on alert We will kick off the the total system inspection within the next few hours as soon as our people complete the overall plan I will keep you posted as things develop Steve

LaPaz but continue their inspection TR will not reinitiate gas or c rude export operations until we have completed our inspection We have for med joint teams with CLHB and Army personnel to perform the inspection It could take as long as hours but well have a better estimate after we get a progress report in the morning All crews available systemwide are mobilizing for inspection of the entire system but for now our priority co ntinues to be the lines in the altiplano The three stations in the altipl ano have been shut down bled off and locked Other supervisors throughou t the system have been advised and are on alert Government and regulator continue to be supportive of our shutdown and inspection action plan We have developed a contingency plan with COBEE t he regional electricity distributor under which they will redistribute ene rgy out of spare capacity in Cochabamba to LaPaz this should cover LaPaz s electricity needs during the duration of time we need to complete our in spection The only other significant consumer is a large cement plant in L aPaz Weve agreed that they will slow down their operations and provide only small local supplies industrial concrete demand will be shutin We did not send a press release on the issue although we have received inquiries our response is that we are concerned about the risk to Bolivia ns this action presented and we are performing an inspection on the system We are avoiding mention of gas stoppage to LaPaz at this time due to th e volatility of the issue in LaPaz Government VMEH SIRESE has agreed w ith the message We expect that with the cement plant and power plant offline line pack should be sufficient to keep commercial demand satisfied for a few days In either event we are working with the local gas distributor to prepare a notice for LaPaz newspapers instructing gas consumers in the area how to s afely shutdown and restart their equipment in the event that it becomes ne cessary The most likely scenario as of now is that Edwin Morales a local revol utionary tied to the coca trade is behind the action Morales has had co ntact in the past with the Raul Rocha bunch out of Chuquina Oruro so we re still not sure whether this was an act against TR andor the industry o r if it is against government Morales has just joined forces with another rebel out of Cochabamba and is planning nationwide road blocks for tomorro w Their agenda is national theyve never isolated TR or our industry as a whole although Chaco in the north have been targeted in the past proba bly because they have a field in the middle of Morales stronghold The po litical situation here is tenuous with Banzer out and various political int erests looking to fill the leadership void Were watching this situation closely The

station Our OSSA II crude ex ports to Chile and GAA gas to LaPaz share the same ROW and would likely have been taken out with the bomb We understand that the bomb which had a manual fuse did not go off but had been lit and failed to explode Th e Army has been mobilized to diffuse the bomb and we consider the immediat e threat neutralized However given that we have now seen several attempts in the last day s of sabotage against our lines I have declared a state of EMERGENCY and will notify the Enron Crisis team We have shut all Altiplano pipeline operations down and have mobilized a joint CLHBTRArmy team to perform vigilance on the entire altiplano netw ork The immediate result of this is that lights will likely start to go o ut in LaPaz within the next few hours the GAA line is their primary power fuel supply Ive notified all relevant government authorities of the sit uation and so far am getting support Ive also asked the Embassy to look into the situation with the understanding that if this is the result of a n organized movement they might have access to intelligence that could be helpful Additionally weve shut down all noncritical maintenance operations th roughtout the rest of the system and are directing spare personnel to perf orm vigilance on the remainder of the system as quickly as possible Until and unless we have information that this threat goes beyond the

could take as long as hours but well have a better estimate after we get a progress report in the morning All crews available systemwide are mobilizing for inspection of the entire system but for now our priority continues to be the lines in the altiplano The three stations in the altiplano have been shut down bled off and locked Other supervisors throughout the system have been advised and are on alert Government and regulator continue to be supportive of our shutdown and inspection action plan We have developed a contingency plan with COBEE the regional electricity distributor under which they will redistribute energy out of spare capacity in Cochabamba to LaPaz this should cover LaPaz s electricity needs during the duration of time we need to complete our inspection The only other significant consumer is a large cement plant in LaPaz Weve agreed that they will slow down their operations and prov ide only small local supplies industrial concrete demand will be shutin We did not send a press release on the issue although we have received inquiries our response is that we are concerned about the risk to Bolivia ns this action presented and we are performing an inspection on the system We are avoiding mention of gas stoppage to LaPaz at this time due to the volatility of the issue in LaPaz Government VMEH SIRESE has agreed with the message We expect that with the cement plant and power plant offline line pack should be sufficient to keep commercial demand satisfied for a few days In either event we are working with the local gas distributor to prepare a notice for LaPaz newspapers instructing gas consumers in the area how to safely shutdown and restart their equipment in the event that it becomes necessary The most likely scenario as of now is that Edwin Morales a local revolutionary tied to the coca trade is behind the action Morales ha s had contact in the past with the Raul Rocha bunch out of Chuquina Oruro so were still not sure whether this was an act against TR andor the industry or if it is against government Morales has just joined forces with ano ther rebel out of Cochabamba and is planning nationwide road blocks for tomorrow Their agenda is national theyve never isolated TR or our industry as a whole although Chaco in the north have been targeted in the past probably because they have a field in the middle of Morales stronghold

Chile and GAA gas to LaPaz share the same ROW and would likely have been taken out with the bomb We understand that the bomb which had a manual fuse did not go off but had been lit and failed to explode Th e Army has been mobilized to diffuse the bomb and we consider the immediate threat neutralized However given that we have now seen several attempts in the last days of sabotage against our lines I have declared a state of EMERGENCY and will notify the Enron Crisis team We have shut all Altiplano pipeline operations down and have mobilized a joint CLHBTRArmy team to perform vigilance on the entire altiplano network The immediate result of this is that lights will likely start to go out in LaPaz within the next few hours the GAA line is their primary powe r fuel supply Ive notified all relevant government authorities of the situation and so far am getting support Ive also asked the Embassy t o look into the situation with the understanding that if this is the result of an organized movement they might have access to intelligence that could be helpful Additionally weve shut down all noncritical maintenance operations throughtout the rest of the system and are directing

in Bellingham Washington Forwarded by Michael TerrasoOTSEnron on AM Terry D Boss NGAAorg on AM To Dave Johnson Email Mike Terraso Email cc Subject Articles on Yesterdays hearings from Seattle Papers State wins OK to inspect pipelines by Brier Dudley Seattle Times staff reporter IMAGE BELLINGHAM Federal regulators yesterday agreed to allow Washington state to inspect all interstate pipelines within its borders as requested by Gov Gary Locke and the state Legislature Weve got it weve just got to work out the fine details Locke said State officials think theyll do a better job inspecting the miles of pipelines in the state than the federal Office of Pipeline Safety OPS an agency thats been harshly criticized since Olympic Pipe Lines June explosion in Bellingham that killed three people Other states have tried unsuccessfully to take control of pipeline inspections from the OPS which has only inspectors for the West Coast but only four states now have that authority Still unresolved however is whether the state will be allowed to impose safety standards stricter than federal standards The states authority could also be shortlived if the OPS and the oil industry persuade Congress later this year to reduce states role in pipeline oversight Mixed messages about the safety offices position were delivered yesterday at a special Senate field hearing on pipelinesafety concerns Locke announced that the state was given testing authority based on a faxed letter he received just hours earlier from the top administrator for pipeline safety The fax said the state could take over inspections on condition that only one state agency were responsible A state law approved last week would have divided the task between two But later in the hearing OPS deputy administrator Richard Felder acknowledged under questioning that he would prefer that inspection authority remain with his office To sidestep that debate US Sen Slade Gorton RWash proposed amending the federal law that gives the OPS authority over pipelines that cross state lines Because Olympic Pipe Line is almost entirely in Washington its mile system parallels Interstate and ends in Portland Gorton suggested that states be allowed to regulate pipelines that are over percent within their borders Olympic a Rentonbased subsidiary of Shell Texaco Arco and oil shipper GATX testified that it would prefer federal oversight Having a unified set of regulations is important for a smooth operation said manager Carl Gast Gorton and US Sen Patty Murray DWash hosts of the hearing both want the state to have more authority over interstate pipelines Theyre backing legislation that would give states authority and funding to inspect pipelines themselves and require better collection and sharing of data about pipelines condition They also want the stricter standards on pipeline testing monitoring and operations Murray whose twin sister teaches at a Bellingham school near the explosion site noted that pipelines have spilled times and killed people in the US since She also said they leak million gallons of hazardous material a year or the equivalent of the Exxon Valdez spill every two years During the hearing at Bellingham City Hall the senators also heard emotional pleas for stricter regulations from victims parents Two yearold boys and an yearold fisherman died after Olympic spilled gallons of gasoline into a city park There needs to be a zerospill policy not we only kill two or three kids a year said Frank King whose yearold Wade died in the explosion Katherine Dalen mother of yearold victim Stephen Tsorvias said the accident made people realize their neighborhoods may not be safe because of the poorly regulated underground pipelines Also testifying were city officials from Renton SeaTac and Bellevue Like Bellingham those cities are trying to get Olympic to provide more information and testing to assure residents that the pipeline is safe Olympics Gast noted that the company will use two devices to internally inspect its entire pipeline later this year The cause of the accident is still being investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board which has been hampered by Olympic employees refusal to testify and by a federal criminal investigation into the accident Copyright The Seattle Times Company Pipeline blast still evokes anger Grieving parents urge senators to pass tough safety bill Tuesday March By SCOTT SUNDE Mail Author SEATTLE POSTINTELLIGENCER REPORTER BELLINGHAM Nine months have passed since Bruce Brabecs stepson died in a horrific pipeline accident here But the memories havent faded Photo Mary King weeps as her husband Frank testifies yesterday at a Senate field hearing in Bellingham on pipeline safety Their son Wade died in the June pipeline explosion Dan DeLongPI The smell of gasoline when Brabec fills the family car reminds him of the fumes that killed Liam Wood who was and out for a day of flyfishing on June The sound of the newspaper hitting the front porch every morning reminds Brabec of when police arrived to tell him and his wife that Liam had been overcome by fumes from leaking gasoline and drowned Imagine going home tonight and your child isnt home and never will be Brabec told US Sens Slade Gorton and Patty Murray during a Senate field hearing on pipeline safety yesterday Getting involved The public may mail written comments on improving pipeline safety to the Senate Commerce Committee Dirksen Senate Office Building Washington DC Anger and anguish mixed freely at the hearing which Gorton a Republican hopes will bolster efforts to win approval for a tough pipeline safety bill introduced by Democrat Murray The hearing in Bellinghams Depressionera City Hall attracted an overflow crowd Townsfolk were forced to huddle around television sets and watch the proceedings in the lobby Their frequent applause at the angry words drifted up the stairs and into the crowded hearing room State and local officials blasted the federal Office of Pipeline Safety as ineffective It regulates interstate pipelines such as the one owned by Olympic Pipe Line Co that ruptured and caught fire in Bellingham last June There was anger too at Olympic Officials from cities through which the pipeline runs said the company had resisted supplying them with data from pipe inspections then agreed by providing Xs and Os that no one could understand We have no confidence said Connie Marshall Bellevues deputy mayor that the Olympic pipeline is safely maintained and operated within our city The company however pledged a safer pipeline pointing to a plan instituted in October to add valves test pressure strengthen computer processing and make sophisticated internal inspections The company is trying to improve any system that may have been at fault in the June accident said Carl Gast Olympic vice president and manager We are not waiting until after the investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board is complete to take action Gast said Gast who has worked in the pipeline industry for years called the companys safety plan the most farreaching with which Ive ever been involved Olympic runs a mile system that takes petroleum products from refineries north of Bellingham and at Anacortes to Portland The system runs near the Interstate corridor including through the suburbs east of Lake Washington The victims Wade King The yearold burned to death while playing in Whatcom Creek when it erupted in a fireball June Stephen Tsorvias Also he was playing with Wade when gasoline ignited after spilling from a ruptured Olympic Pipe Line fuel line Liam Wood The yearold was flyfishing on the creek when he was overcome by leaking gasoline fumes and drowned The anguish at the hearing came from the parents of Wood and parents of two yearold boys Wade King and Stephen Tsorvias who burned to death as gallons of spilled gasoline ignited and a fireball roared down Whatcom Creek At times sadness tears our hearts apart and drowns our spirits said Katherine Dalen Stephens mother Marlene Robinson Liams mother said softly I no longer have children to protect They too were angry at Olympic and at the Office of Pipeline Safety The boys families have filed wrongfuldeath lawsuits against Olympic Frank King Wades father made it clear yesterday whom he blames for the tragedy The company is an outrage It needs to be shut down King said Olympics gross wanton recklessness killed my little man King said he has evidence that Olympic had a chance in July to dig up the pipe where it would later rupture to check for possible problems but decided not to because the excavation would be too difficult Bellingham has a water plant near the site of the rupture and numerous water pipes are above the pipeline In an interview King produced an Olympic document gathered for his lawsuit that he said indicated that the company decided not to dig up the pipe In and Olympic did an internal inspection of its pipeline Possible defects were identified in the inspections near where the pipe would later rupture But Olympic has said the possible defects did not seem serious enough to dig up the pipeline near the water plant Olympic Pipe Line spokeswoman Maggie Brown said Kings testimony marked the first time she had ever heard the claim that the company was prepared to dig up that section of pipe in but decided not to Kings wife Mary erupted in frustration that the accident was allowed to happen If this is properly maintained regulated whatever it wont happen again she said tearfully Anything is going to be better than what went on in the past which was nothing In fact pipeline regulation may be changing The Washington Legislature passed a bill this year that sets up a state pipeline safety program and asks the federal government for the power to police interstate lines like Olympics Gov Gary Locke told Gorton and Murray yesterday that the federal government may be willing to give the state the authority to inspect interstate pipelines Four states currently have that authority but the federal government still retains the right to punish pipeline companies over problems found in inspections A top official of the US Transportation Department told Locke in a letter yesterday that the federal government may give Washington inspection authority Locke however also wants the state to have the authority to regulate pipelines and to use tougher standards than the federal rules to do so Murrays bill would give the states more authority Richard Felder head of the Office of Pipeline Safety admitted that his regulators have had problems We worked to restore public confidence Felder said but clearly we have a long way to go Felder said the offices proposed budget would provide it with more money for regulation He also said his office will propose a new regulation by the end of the month to require companies to test the safety of their pipelines Gorton and Murray however seemed unconvinced that federal regulators will get tough So was Bob Chipkovitch who runs the pipeline program at the National Transportation Safety Board The NTSB which has no regulatory authority has repeatedly recommended tougher rules only to see nothing happen in the Office of Pipeline Safety he said For example years after the NTSB recommended that regulators require periodic inspections no such rule has been adopted I hope Bellingham has made a difference Chipkovitch said No we havent seen a change yet by regulators But I hope this accident does provide the impetus to do that The NTSB has yet to determine the cause of the June accident But Chipkovitch said the investigation so far has shown significant performance failures by pipeline controllers He noted that the pipeline rupture began at pm June after a pump failure near Woodinville computer problems at the companys Renton headquarters and a valve closed near Anacortes But minutes later refineries north of Bellingham resumed putting gasoline in the line Controllers only started shutting down the pipeline for good at At the point where the pipeline ruptured there may be evidence of external damage Chipkovitch said Olympic contends that construction at the water plant in damaged the pipe But investigators have yet to fully test the damaged pipe A federal criminal investigation into the accident has kept them from doing so At the same time several Olympic officials have refused to talk to the NTSB fearing they would incriminate themselves Chipkovitch said the investigation also focuses on the valve near Anacortes that closed June increasing pressure in the pipe upstream The valve closed times in the six months before the Bellingham accident he said Pipeline accidents Some of the countrys largest pipeline accidents in recent years June The Olympic Pipe Line Cos pipeline in Bellingham ruptured and gallons of

miles of them deliver potential catastrophe every day By Patrick McMahon USA TODAY BELLINGHAM Wash Last summer an underground pipeline ruptured in a city park here and sent a torrent of gasoline along a wooded streambed toward two yearolds playing with a barbecue lighter After the inch pipeline had been hemorrhaging for an hour and minutes an explosion sent a fireball racing through the park A plume of smoke rose feet Authorities say the blast probably was triggered by a spark from the lighter There was a spark and the sky turned orange the boys both told me afterward says Frank King whose son Wade was one of the boys in the park Wade and his friend Stephen Tsiorvas were burned over of their bodies They died the next day Also killed was yearold Liam Wood who had graduated from high school five days before The collegebound Wood was flyfishing in the park when he was overcome by fumes fell into the creek and drowned To many people the boys were considered heroes says Mark Asmundson the mayor of this seaside city north of Seattle In sparking the explosion the boys kept the most extensive damage confined to the acre park he says The river of gasoline was heading right for the center of the city On Monday the Senate Commerce Committee held a oneday hearing here about five minutes from where the incident occurred on legislation to improve safety and government oversight of pipelines and the companies that operate them The hearing included gripping sometimes tearful testimony from the boys parents as well as statements from state and federal officials My baby died because of inaction His death was preventable said Katherine Dalen Stephens mother More than million miles of iron steel and plastic pipes some as large as feet in diameter snake beneath the earth and deliver oil gasoline natural gas and potential disaster across America every day They range from the transAlaskan pipeline to tiny pipes carrying natural gas to peoples homes Safer than gasoline trucks or oceangoing tankers by most measures onceremote pipelines are prompting new worries as sprawling metropolitan areas grow into their paths US pipeline accidents have fluctuated in the past years In the s there were liquid fuel spills and natural gas leaks roughly one a day The incidents most involving local lines carrying natural gas resulted in deaths injuries and million in property damage from through There also are environmental costs In January one of the nations largest pipeline companies Koch Industries of Wichita Kan paid a million civil fine to settle Environmental Protection Agency waterpollution charges involving oil spills from to The EPA said Koch failed to inspect its pipelines and waited for leaks before making repairs Liam Woods mother Marlene Robinson is focused on stronger regulations nationwide including more and better inspections and regional watchdog committees I dont have any children left to protect she said in an interview and repeated at the hearing This didnt have to happen to Liam and it doesnt have to happen to other peoples children Although the cause of the Bellingham incident remains under investigation one factor might have been damage to the pipeline from a backhoe when a water line was being installed in But investigators also have many questions about the role of Olympic Pipeline Co which operates a network of pipelines along a mile corridor from north of Bellingham to Portland Ore Investigators for the National Transportation Safety Board NTSB want to know whether Olympic ignored warning signs and whether it could have acted more swiftly after the leak But the inquiry has been delayed by a parallel investigation by the US Attorneys Office Several Olympic employees have declined to testify and have invoked their constitutional rights against selfincrimination Pipeline owners and government regulators defend the safety of transporting twothirds of the nations fuels by pipeline and they warn that more rules could boost energy prices Critics say pipelines are too loosely regulated not fully inspected and in some cases deteriorating The US Transportation Department oversees pipelines Its Office of Pipeline Safety sets standards for design operation maintenance and emergency response Richard Felder who heads the office testified at Mondays hearing Our goal is to prevent incidents like Bellingham from ever happening again he said In an earlier interview he defended his offices performance and the industry Its a good record Its the safest form of transporting fuel far and away The office has extensive rules on pipeline safety including requirements for signs along the route and programs to alert potential diggers but theres no such thing as risk elimination Felder says All you can do is manage it But the chairman of the federal governments transportation safety watchdog agency is unimpressed with Felders office and says it deserves a grade of F Its been the most frustrating area Ive had to deal with as chairman says Jim Hall NTSB chairman since He says no agency has a worse record of responding to NTSB recommendations In a recent speech he said theres no indication that the Office of Pipeline Safety is in charge or that its regulations its inspections its assets its staffing and its spirit are adequate to the task Felder takes issue with much of the criticism but he endorses calls for more research into pipeline safety He said his office is in the final stages of preparing new safety standards for heavily populated and environmentally sensitive areas He emphasized that the leading cause of pipeline failure is thirdparty damage from road utility and construction work The agency has worked to enhance a system to alert pipeline companies of digging with one telephone call Felder is critical of local authorities who ignore pipelines when making decisions on housing and commercial development Local planning has not kept people away from pipelines he says Its astounding to me Felder bristles at critics suggestions that his agency is a tool of the oil and gas industry I cant agree with that one iota he says We try to balance the safety issue and the economic issue The Senate Commerce Committee will consider a bipartisan bill sponsored by Sens Patty Murray DWash and Slade Gorton RWash Rep Jack Metcalf the Republican who represents Bellingham and Rep Jay Inslee a Democrat whose district includes an operating section of the pipeline The bill would require periodic internal inspections of pipelines boost federal spending on research increase the number of federal pipeline inspectors nationwide there now are and expand states regulatory authority On Monday the Office of Pipeline Safety gave the state of Washington the temporary right to do more inspections The MurrayGorton bill also would require federal certification of pipeline workers and expand the publics right to know about spills and leaks I was totally shocked and amazed when this happened Murray says You always assume that your neighborhood is safe and somebody has taken care of this The Bellingham rupture not only dumped gallons of gasoline into this city of near the Canadian border but also unleashed civic furor at Olympic Pipeline Its hard for people to get interested in things they cant see Out of sight is out of mind Mayor Asmundson says He has visited the boys grieving families and lobbied Congress The blast has dominated my life since June Pipeline operators portray accidents as isolated to escape national scrutiny he says The whole focus of the industry is containment Do whatever you have to do locally but dont stir things up nationally Last week Murray released a report she requested from the Transportation Departments
