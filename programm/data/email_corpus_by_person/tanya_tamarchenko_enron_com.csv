factors corresponding to some commodity for another commodity This mapping we do quite frequently in our VAR system when forward prices for a commodity are not correlated because of poor price history I think using this kind of mappings is OK because we can not trust these correlations based on illiquid price information If we believed the matrix with low correlations represents what goes on in the market and we simply can not reconstruct it with our factors then we might use more factors then or the matrix itself Tanya Tanya Tamarchenko PM To Oliver CT cc David PortMarket NRON Rudi CT Wenyao CT Kirstee CT Debbie R CT Naveen NRON Subject Re UK PowerGas Oliver I completely agree with you validating VAR inputs like positions prices and volatilities which are used by RisktRac is the first thing to do You also rise a valid question if the factor loadings for some commodity do not make sense should we use the factor loadings for another commodity The factor loadings do not make sense when the correlations across the term structure are not high So if we believe that the forward prices for this commodity are market prices and statistical analysis on these prices produces the correlations which we trust then it would be proper to use this correlation matrix in VAR engine not the factors Using factors is simply the way to speed up calculations for highly correlated prices without sacrificing the accuracy Tanya Oliver Gaylard AM To Naveen NRON cc David PortMarket NRON Rudi CT Wenyao CT Kirstee CT Tanya CT Ganapathy CT Debbie R CT Subject Re UK PowerGas Naveen Regarding the calculation of UK VaRs in Risk Trac I agree that we should be using this calculation engine for all commodity VaRs However we should not focus solely on the UK but ensure that we use Risk Trac for continental power and gas UK power and gas Nordic Power To use Risk Trac I think the following need to be resolved first to implement it right the first time as I think it is incorrect to consider the Risk Trac numbers As the most accurate since it depends on the validity of these items Positions Delta and gamma and curve mapping These need to include all positions including those outside the main risk systems Positions curves and mapping should now be no problem given the feeds apart from continental power have been UATd and we have the spreadsheet feeds up and running Price and vol curves As used by the risk systems As above Inter commodity correlation prompt month Correlation should be easy to calculate given an accurate and complete data set However the incomplete historic data for Europe in Risk Trac prior to the formation of the task force would mean a full data set needs to be obtained and used Term structure of correlation would be good but I understand this is difficult to use in the calculation Factor loadings I think factor loadings should be calculated on the same data sets used for inter commodity correlation for all commodities If this analysis does not appear to work I am not sure that using factor loadings for other markets is adequate Do we need to consider an alternative approach to calculating VaR for these markets To ensure this moves forward I think a list of the mile stones responsibilities and time lines needs to be drawn up otherwise I fear the process of moving across to Risk Trac from the spreadsheet VaR will experience some slippage I will call today to start the process off Rgds Oliver Naveen NRON To Oliver CT cc David PortMarket NRON Rudi CT Wenyao CT Kirstee CT Tanya CT Ganapathy CT Debbie R CT Subject UK PowerGas Oliver I had a couple of issues pertaining to UK PowerUK Gas First just a few notes as it pertains to Risk Trac UKimplementation In RiskTrac currently all the Gas Curves are mapped to NBP All the Power Curves are mapped to R Cinergy Factor loading analysis lends itself only to NBP and the Norewgian curvesfor reasons of liquidity etc We have decided that NBP and Cinergy are the best curves available at this time The spreadsheet which is utilized in the UK also has curves mapped to a year old set of Factors derived from US Nat Gas which is clearly not optimal Hence We should be using RiskTrac numbers for VaR as it is the most accurate both in terms of ENEwide model usage and in terms of the most recent updated data Ever since UK Power came on board in RiskTrac weeks ago the UK Power number has been consistently MM above the numbers in your spreadsheet This difference is to be ecpected given the different inputs The consistent numbers do not point to a data error in any obvious way however if you believe that positions are not captured correctly please let our IT staff know that Checks which Ramesh has done indicate that positions are tying in However as you know there could be disconnects with Enpower etc In any event it would be ideal and optimal to have all the simulations run out of RiskTrac for reasons of aggregation and analysis Your help is appreciated Regards Naveen

across UK gas and power as well as the correlations across EFA slots We did part of the work last week Now well update the correlations based on historical prices Tanya Richard Lewis AM To Tanya CT cc Oliver CT James CT Steven CT Rudy CT Kirstee CT Naveen NRON David PortMarket NRON Ted CT Simon CT Paul D CT Amir CT Subject Re VaR correlation scenarios Thanks Tanya these are interesting results I am on vacation next week so here are my current thoughts I am contactable on my mobile if necessary Gas to power correlations I see your point about gas to power correlation only affecting VAR for the combined gas and power portfolio and this raises an interesting point At a conservative long term correlation combined VAR is omm less than previously expected so how does this affect the limit breach Strictly speaking we are still over our UK power limit but the limit was set when we were assuming no gas power correlation and therefore a higher portfolio VAR A suggested way forward given the importance of the spread options to the UK Gas and Power books can we allocate to the gas and power books a share of the reduction in portfolio VAR ie Reduction Portfolio VAR sumPower VAR Gas VAR Also if I understand your mail correctly Matrix implies gas power correlation is consistent with our correlation curves and this reduces total VAR by omm EFA slot correlations The issue of whether our existing EFA to EFA correlation matrix is correct is a separate issue I dont understand where the Matrix EFA to EFA correlations come from but I am happy for you to run some historical correlations from the forward curves use the first years I would suggest Our original matrix was based on historicals but the analysis is worth doing again Your matrix results certainly indicate how important these correlations are Closing thoughts Fridays trading left us longer so I would not expect a limit breach on Monday We are still reviewing the shape of the long term curve and Id like to wait until both Simon Hastings and I are back in the office Monday week before finalising this Regards Richard Tanya Tamarchenko To Oliver CT Richard CT James CT Steven CT Rudy CT Kirstee CT Naveen NRON David PortMarket NRON Ted CT cc Subject Re VaR correlation scenarios Everybody Oliver sent us the VAR number for different correlations for UKPower portfolio separately from UKGas portfolio First if VAR is calculated accurately the correlation between Power and Gas curves should not affect VAR number for Power and VAR number for Gas only the aggregate number will be affected The changes you see are due to the fact that we use MonteCarlo simulation method which accuracy depends on the number of simulations Even if we dont change the correlations but use different realizations of random numbers we get slightly different result from the model So to see the effect of using different correlations between Gas and Power we should look at the aggregate number I calculated weighted correlations based on curves I got from Paul As the weights along the term structure I used the product of price position and volatility for each time bucket for Gas and each of EFA slots The results are shown below Inserting these numbers into the original correlation matrix produced negatively definite correlation matrix which brakes VAR engine Correlation matrix for any set of random variables is nonnegative by definition and remains nonnegatively definite if calculated properly based on any historical data Here according to our phone discussion we started experimenting with correlations assuming the same correlation for each EFA slot and ET Elec versus Gas I am sending you the spreadsheet which summaries the results In addition to the aggregate VAR numbers for the runs Oliver did you can see the VAR numbers based on correlation Matrix and Matrix In Matrix the correlations across EFA slots are identical to these in original matrix I obtained this matrix by trial and error Matrix is produces by Naveen using Fingers algorithm it differs from original matrix across EFA slots as well as in Power versus Gas correlations and gives higher VAR than matrix does Concluding we will look at the historical forward prices and try to calculate historical correlations from them Tanya Oliver Gaylard PM To Richard CT James CT Steven CT Rudy CT Kirstee CT Naveen NRON Tanya CT David PortMarket NRON cc Subject VaR correlation scenarios The results were as follows when changing the gaspower correlations Correlation VaRUK Power book VaR UK Gas book oMM oMM oMM oMM oMM oMM oMM oMM Cholesky decomposition failed Not positive definite Cholesky decomposition failed Not positive definite Cholesky decomposition failed Not positive definite Cholesky decomposition failed Not positive definite Cholesky decomposition failed Not positive definite Cholesky decomposition failed Not positive definite Cholesky decomposition failed Not positive definite Peaks and off peaks were treated the same to avoid violating the matrixs integrity Interesting to note that for a higher correlation of the power VaR increases which is counter to intuition This implies that we need to look into how the correlations are being applied within the model Once we can derive single correlations from the term structure is the next action to understand how they are being applied and whether the model captures the PL volatility in the spread option deals From onwards the VaR calculation failed Oliver

factors corresponding to some commodity for another commodity This mapping we do quite frequently in our VAR system when forward prices for a commodity are not correlated because of poor price history I think using this kind of mappings is OK because we can not trust these correlations based on illiquid price information If we believed the matrix with low correlations represents what goes on in the market and we simply can not reconstruct it with our factors then we might use more factors then or the matrix itself Tanya Tanya Tamarchenko PM To Oliver CT cc David PortMarket NRON Rudi CT Wenyao CT Kirstee CT Debbie R CT Naveen NRON Subject Re UK PowerGas Oliver I completely agree with you validating VAR inputs like positions prices and volatilities which are used by RisktRac is the first thing to do You also rise a valid question if the factor loadings for some commodity do not make sense should we use the factor loadings for another commodity The factor loadings do not make sense when the correlations across the term structure are not high So if we believe that the forward prices for this commodity are market prices and statistical analysis on these prices produces the correlations which we trust then it would be proper to use this correlation matrix in VAR engine not the factors Using factors is simply the way to speed up calculations for highly correlated prices without sacrificing the accuracy Tanya Oliver Gaylard AM To Naveen NRON cc David PortMarket NRON Rudi CT Wenyao CT Kirstee CT Tanya CT Ganapathy CT Debbie R CT Subject Re UK PowerGas Naveen Regarding the calculation of UK VaRs in Risk Trac I agree that we should be using this calculation engine for all commodity VaRs However we should not focus solely on the UK but ensure that we use Risk Trac for continental power and gas UK power and gas Nordic Power To use Risk Trac I think the following need to be resolved first to implement it right the first time as I think it is incorrect to consider the Risk Trac numbers As the most accurate since it depends on the validity of these items Positions Delta and gamma and curve mapping These need to include all positions including those outside the main risk systems Positions curves and mapping should now be no problem given the feeds apart from continental power have been UATd and we have the spreadsheet feeds up and running Price and vol curves As used by the risk systems As above Inter commodity correlation prompt month Correlation should be easy to calculate given an accurate and complete data set However the incomplete historic data for Europe in Risk Trac prior to the formation of the task force would mean a full data set needs to be obtained and used Term structure of correlation would be good but I understand this is difficult to use in the calculation Factor loadings I think factor loadings should be calculated on the same data sets used for inter commodity correlation for all commodities If this analysis does not appear to work I am not sure that using factor loadings for other markets is adequate Do we need to consider an alternative approach to calculating VaR for these markets To ensure this moves forward I think a list of the mile stones responsibilities and time lines needs to be drawn up otherwise I fear the process of moving across to Risk Trac from the spreadsheet VaR will experience some slippage I will call today to start the process off Rgds Oliver Naveen NRON To Oliver CT cc David PortMarket NRON Rudi CT Wenyao CT Kirstee CT Tanya CT Ganapathy CT Debbie R CT Subject UK PowerGas Oliver I had a couple of issues pertaining to UK PowerUK Gas First just a few notes as it pertains to Risk Trac UKimplementation In RiskTrac currently all the Gas Curves are mapped to NBP All the Power Curves are mapped to R Cinergy Factor loading analysis lends itself only to NBP and the Norewgian curvesfor reasons of liquidity etc We have decided that NBP and Cinergy are the best curves available at this time The spreadsheet which is utilized in the UK also has curves mapped to a year old set of Factors derived from US Nat Gas which is clearly not optimal Hence We should be using RiskTrac numbers for VaR as it is the most accurate both in terms of ENEwide model usage and in terms of the most recent updated data Ever since UK Power came on board in RiskTrac weeks ago the UK Power number has been consistently MM above the numbers in your spreadsheet This difference is to be ecpected given the different inputs The consistent numbers do not point to a data error in any obvious way however if you believe that positions are not captured correctly please let our IT staff know that Checks which Ramesh has done indicate that positions are tying in However as you know there could be disconnects with Enpower etc In any event it would be ideal and optimal to have all the simulations run out of RiskTrac for reasons of aggregation and analysis Your help is appreciated Regards Naveen

across UK gas and power as well as the correlations across EFA slots We did part of the work last week Now well update the correlations based on historical prices Tanya Richard Lewis AM To Tanya CT cc Oliver CT James CT Steven CT Rudy CT Kirstee CT Naveen NRON David PortMarket NRON Ted CT Simon CT Paul D CT Amir CT Subject Re VaR correlation scenarios Thanks Tanya these are interesting results I am on vacation next week so here are my current thoughts I am contactable on my mobile if necessary Gas to power correlations I see your point about gas to power correlation only affecting VAR for the combined gas and power portfolio and this raises an interesting point At a conservative long term correlation combined VAR is omm less than previously expected so how does this affect the limit breach Strictly speaking we are still over our UK power limit but the limit was set when we were assuming no gas power correlation and therefore a higher portfolio VAR A suggested way forward given the importance of the spread options to the UK Gas and Power books can we allocate to the gas and power books a share of the reduction in portfolio VAR ie Reduction Portfolio VAR sumPower VAR Gas VAR Also if I understand your mail correctly Matrix implies gas power correlation is consistent with our correlation curves and this reduces total VAR by omm EFA slot correlations The issue of whether our existing EFA to EFA correlation matrix is correct is a separate issue I dont understand where the Matrix EFA to EFA correlations come from but I am happy for you to run some historical correlations from the forward curves use the first years I would suggest Our original matrix was based on historicals but the analysis is worth doing again Your matrix results certainly indicate how important these correlations are Closing thoughts Fridays trading left us longer so I would not expect a limit breach on Monday We are still reviewing the shape of the long term curve and Id like to wait until both Simon Hastings and I are back in the office Monday week before finalising this Regards Richard Tanya Tamarchenko To Oliver CT Richard CT James CT Steven CT Rudy CT Kirstee CT Naveen NRON David PortMarket NRON Ted CT cc Subject Re VaR correlation scenarios Everybody Oliver sent us the VAR number for different correlations for UKPower portfolio separately from UKGas portfolio First if VAR is calculated accurately the correlation between Power and Gas curves should not affect VAR number for Power and VAR number for Gas only the aggregate number will be affected The changes you see are due to the fact that we use MonteCarlo simulation method which accuracy depends on the number of simulations Even if we dont change the correlations but use different realizations of random numbers we get slightly different result from the model So to see the effect of using different correlations between Gas and Power we should look at the aggregate number I calculated weighted correlations based on curves I got from Paul As the weights along the term structure I used the product of price position and volatility for each time bucket for Gas and each of EFA slots The results are shown below Inserting these numbers into the original correlation matrix produced negatively definite correlation matrix which brakes VAR engine Correlation matrix for any set of random variables is nonnegative by definition and remains nonnegatively definite if calculated properly based on any historical data Here according to our phone discussion we started experimenting with correlations assuming the same correlation for each EFA slot and ET Elec versus Gas I am sending you the spreadsheet which summaries the results In addition to the aggregate VAR numbers for the runs Oliver did you can see the VAR numbers based on correlation Matrix and Matrix In Matrix the correlations across EFA slots are identical to these in original matrix I obtained this matrix by trial and error Matrix is produces by Naveen using Fingers algorithm it differs from original matrix across EFA slots as well as in Power versus Gas correlations and gives higher VAR than matrix does Concluding we will look at the historical forward prices and try to calculate historical correlations from them Tanya Oliver Gaylard PM To Richard CT James CT Steven CT Rudy CT Kirstee CT Naveen NRON Tanya CT David PortMarket NRON cc Subject VaR correlation scenarios The results were as follows when changing the gaspower correlations Correlation VaRUK Power book VaR UK Gas book oMM oMM oMM oMM oMM oMM oMM oMM Cholesky decomposition failed Not positive definite Cholesky decomposition failed Not positive definite Cholesky decomposition failed Not positive definite Cholesky decomposition failed Not positive definite Cholesky decomposition failed Not positive definite Cholesky decomposition failed Not positive definite Cholesky decomposition failed Not positive definite Peaks and off peaks were treated the same to avoid violating the matrixs integrity Interesting to note that for a higher correlation of the power VaR increases which is counter to intuition This implies that we need to look into how the correlations are being applied within the model Once we can derive single correlations from the term structure is the next action to understand how they are being applied and whether the model captures the PL volatility in the spread option deals From onwards the VaR calculation failed Oliver
