trading margin requirements will go into effect for all brokers The new industrywide day trading rules outline specific requirements that all accounts that frequently day trade must comply with While the new day trading rules offer increased leverage they also present the opportunity for greater losses We ask that you take the time to understand how the new day trading rules will affect your account My account hasnt been tagged as a pattern day trader account What does this have to do with me Datek is giving all margin accounts access to the additional day trading buying power as permitted by the new rule Unless your accounts trading pattern matches that of the NASDNYSE day trading margin rule you will not be required to meet day trading margin restrictions However we still ask that all margin account holders be educated on the new rules as they may affect your account Should your account be tagged as a pattern day trading account in the future Datek will notify you of the designation What are the new day trading margin requirements for pattern day traders A pattern day trader is defined as an account that makes roundtrip day trades buying and selling the same security in one day in any rolling business day period Pattern day traders will be subject to a new set of day trading rules and requirements Heres what you need to know Under the new rules customers that have been identified as pattern day traders must maintain in marginable equity at all times Pattern day trader accounts that fall below the NASDNYSE minimum will be restricted to cash transactions only until the minimum equity amount is reached Go to helpdesktransfershtml to find out how to transfer equity or helpdeskdepositshtml for information on depositing cash and securities to meet the new minimum A day trading margin call will be generated as soon as an executed day trade in a pattern day trader account exceeds the day trading buying power Customers will have business days to fulfill a day trading margin call Only a deposit of cash or fully paid securities can satisfy a day trading margin call A day trading call must be met in business days If the day trade margin call is not satisfied by the fifth business day the new NASDNYSE rules require that the account be restricted to trading on a cash available basis for days or until the day trade call is met How am I given increased leverage under the new rules The new rules modify the day trading buying power calculations giving you access to times the margin maintenance excess This is a twofold increase in the possible leverage available under current rules Example A pattern day trader with a cash balance of and no positions in their account would have access to day trading buying power Day trading buying power is calculated based on the positions and cash in an account at the end of the trading day Generally you can calculate your day trading buying power using the following formula of the Long Stock Value LSV of any Short Stock Value SSV Cash As an added benefit we will display your day trading buying power in realtime on your portfolio and trading pages as soon as the new rules go into effect This buying power figure is the amount available for day trading Day trading buying power does not change based on gains and losses in your account that occur intraday Be aware that all margin accounts will have access to the greater of either their stock buying power or their day trading buying power Our systems will always allow an order to go through based on the higher buying power amount Since our systems have no way of determining whether you will hold the position overnight or just for the day its your responsibility to enter trades that remain within the buying power for the type of trade youre making What can I do to meet a day trading margin call Should you need to meet a day trading margin call the fastest way is by wiring funds to your account or sending an overnight check For help with mailing addresses and wire instructions go to helpdeskdepositshtml Remember day trading calls can only be met by depositing cash or nonmargined securities Is this industrywide Will all brokers have to comply with these rules The new day trading rules are NASDNYSE requirements that will have to be followed by all brokers We are ready for these changes and are taking all the right steps to make sure you are ready as well If your account is tagged as a pattern day trading account according to the new NASDNYSE definition you will receive notification from Datek If your account has already been tagged as a pattern day trader under the current rule the tag will remain in place for days after your last daytrade and you will be required to be in compliance with the new rule as of September Fully understanding your risk tolerance and the new NASDNYSE margin requirements allows you to better manage your margin account Please review our Helpdesk at helpdeskmarginhtmldaytrading
