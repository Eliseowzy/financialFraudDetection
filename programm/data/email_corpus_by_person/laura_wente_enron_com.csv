Message from on Message from on I thought this was important information for you to have RAPE Self Protection Hi girls I just finished taking the most amazing selfdefense class sponsored by Shandwick and I wanted to share some really valuable info with you before it goes out of my head The guy who taught the class has a female friend who was attacked last year in the parking garage at Westport Plaza in St Louis one night after work and taken to an abandoned house and raped He started a womens group and began teaching these classes soon after This guy is a black belt in karate and trains twice a year with Steven Segall He and the others in this group interviewed a bunch of rapists and date rapists in prison on what they look for and heres some interesting facts The thing men look for in a potential victim is hairstyle They are most likely to go after a woman with a ponytail bun braid or other hairstyle that can easily be grabbed They are also likely to go after a woman with long hair Women with short hair are not common targets The second thing men look for is clothing They will look for a woman whos clothing is easy to remove quickly The outfit they look for is overalls because many of them carry scissors around to cut clothing and on overalls the straps can be easily cut They also look for women on their cell phone searching through their purse or doing other activities while walking because they are off guard and can be easily overpowered The time of day men are most likely to attack and rape a woman is in the early morning between and am The number one place women are abducted fromattacked at is grocery store parking lots Number two is office parking lotsgarages Number three is public restrooms The thing about these men is that they are looking to grab a woman and quickly move her to a second location where they dont have to worry about getting caught Only said they carried weapons because rape carries a year sentence but rape with a weapon is years If you put up any kind of a fight at all they get discouraged because it only takes a minute or two for them to realize that going after you isnt worth it because it will be timeconsuming These men said they will not pick on women who have umbrellas or other similar objects that can be used from a distance in their hands Keys are not a deterrent because you have to get really close to the attacker to use them as a weapon So the idea is to convince these guys youre not worth it Several defense mechanisms he taught us are If someone is following behind you on a street or in a garage or with you in an elevator or stairwell look them in the face and ask them a question like what time is it or make general small talk I cant believe it is so cold out here were in for a bad winter Now youve seen their face and could identify them in a lineup you lose appeal as a target If someone is coming toward you hold out your hands in front of you and yell Stop or Stay back Most of the rapists this man talked to said theyd leave a woman alone if she yelled or showed that she would not be afraid to fight back Again they are looking for an EASY target If you carry pepper spray this instructor was a huge advocate of it and carries it with him wherever he goes yelling I HAVE PEPPER SPRAY and holding it out will be a deterrent If someone grabs you you cant beat him with strength but you can by outsmarting him If they grab your wrist pull your wrist back so your hand is in waving position palm facing forward and twist it toward yourself and pull your arm away It is hard to hold onto wrist bones that are moving in that way They stumble toward you and you stumble back so you can use that momentum to bring the same out and backhand them with your knuckles in the forehead nose or teeth If you are grabbed around the waist from behind pinch the attacker either under the arm between the elbow and armpit or in the upper inner thigh HARD One woman in a class this guy taught told him she used the underarm pinch on a guy who was trying to date rape her and was so upset she broke through the skin and tore out muscle strands the guy needed stitches Try pinching yourself in those places as hard as you can stand it It hurts After the initial hit always go for the groin I know from a particularly unfortunate experience that if you slap a guys balls sorry to be graphic it is extremely painful You might think that youll piss the guy off and make him want to hurt you more but the thing these rapists told our instructor is that they want a woman who will not cause a lot of trouble Start causing trouble and hes out of there When the guy puts his hands up to you grab his first two fingers and bend them back as far as possible with as much pressure pushing down on them as possible The instructor did it to me without using much pressure and I ended up on my knees and both knuckles cracked audibly Of course the things we always hear still apply Always be aware of your surroundings take someone with you if you can and if you see any odd behavior dont dismiss it go with your instincts You may feel a little silly at the time but youd feel much worse if the guy really was trouble Please forward this to any woman you know its simple stuff that could save her life

Plaza in St Louis one night after work and taken to an abandoned house and raped He started a womens group and began teaching these classes soon after This guy is a black belt in karate and trains twice a year with Steven Segall He and the others in this group interviewed a bunch of rapists and date rapists in prison on what they look for and heres some interesting facts The thing men look for

hair Women with short hair are not common targets The second thing men look for is clothing They will look for a woman whos clothing is easy to remove quickly The outfit they look for is overalls because many of them carry scissors around to cut clothing and on overalls the straps can be easily cut They also look for women on their cell phone searching through their purse or doing other activities while walking because they are off guard and can be easily overpowered The time of day men are most likely to attack and rape a woman is in the early morning between and am The number one

attacker to use them as a weapon So the idea is to convince these guys youre not worth it Several defense mechanisms he taught us are If someone is following behind you on a street or in a garage or with you in an elevator or stairwell look them in the face and ask them a question like what time is it or make general small talk I cant believe it is so cold out here were in for a bad winter Now youve seen their face and could identify them in a lineup you lose appeal as a target If someone is coming toward you hold out your hands in front of you and yell Stop or Stay back Most of the rapists this man talked to said theyd leave a woman alone if she yelled or showed that she would not be afraid to fight back Again they are looking for an EASY target If you carry pepper spray this instructor was a huge advocate of it and carries it with him wherever he goes yelling I HAVE PEPPER SPRAY and holding it out will be a deterrent If someone grabs you you cant beat him with strength but you can by outsmarting him If they grab your wrist pull your wrist back so your hand is in waving position palm facing forward and twist it toward yourself and pull your arm away It is hard to hold onto wrist bones that are moving in that way They stumble toward you and you stumble back so you can use that momentum to bring the same out and backhand them with your knuckles in the forehead nose or teeth If you are grabbed around the waist from behind pinch the attacker either under the arm between the elbow and armpit or in the upper inner thigh HARD One woman in a class this guy taught told him she used the underarm pinch on a guy who was trying to date rape her and was so upset she broke through the skin and tore out muscle strands the guy needed stitches Try pinching yourself in those places as hard as you can stand it It hurts After the initial hit always go for the groin I know from a particularly unfortunate experience that if you slap a guys balls sorry to be graphic it is extremely painful You might think that youll piss the guy off and make him want to hurt you more but the thing these rapists told our instructor is that they want a woman who will not cause a lot of trouble Start causing trouble and hes out of there When the guy puts his hands up to you grab his first two fingers and bend them back as far as possible with as much pressure pushing down on them as possible The instructor did it to me without using much pressure and I ended up on my knees and both knuckles cracked audibly Of course the things we always hear still apply Always be aware of your surroundings take someone with you if you can and if you see any odd behavior dont dismiss it go with your instincts You may feel a little silly at the time but youd feel much worse if the guy really was trouble Please forward this to any woman you know its simple stuff that could save her life
