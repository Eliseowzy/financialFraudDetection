<19990183.1075862886922.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,nshaw@usenergyservices.com,2001-11-09 07:21:07,Ken I can only say that I hope you Enrons Board of Directors Jeff Skilling Andy Fastow and Stan Horton spend some real quality time in jail Neal Shaw US Energy Services Inc Phone Cell Fax 
<2249937.1075852804478.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,nshaw@usenergyservices.com,2001-10-24 14:42:37,Ken Thank you for the email addresses of Enrons Board of Directors I will present my position to them The best attribute of a really good Top Gun is that they operate most effectively in an offensive mode not in a defensive mode Develop and maintain your offensive positions and follow through Too bad about Andy but under the circumstances replacing him is the start of a good offense Good luck Neal Shaw Neal Shaw US Energy Services Inc Phone Cell Fax

<13648633.1075852808694.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,nshaw@usenergyservices.com,2001-10-11 06:26:38,REHi Morgan Now that I do not work for Ken Lay and as a stockholder he actually works for me I can go directly too him and tell him what I really think I can also tell all of the board members what I think as well without fear of getting fired by one of my former politically motivated bosses Ken Lay earned a PHD as an economist He knows exactly what I am talking about What he is doing is trying correct many bad Enron decisions and to find easy income in a tough time He is very good at working the floor as I call it of the New York Stock Exchange He has probably made deals with brokers and large mutual fund managers such as Vanguard and Fidelity for them to repurchase large amounts of Enron stock IF he can clean up Enron and bring in some revenue So far so good The problem arises when you look at the quality of the revenue Ken is generating What I see is largely from one time sales of existing assets and not from continuing operations In other words the effect is only temporary and it is much harder to recreate at a later time because the asset is gone Personally I am not buying into the trust me line from Enron It is time for Enrons leadership to earn their millions in salary Love Dad Original Message From Shaw Morgan mailto HIEFSNFLcom Sent Wednesday October PM To Shaw Neal Subject RE I did get it DadI think you really made some great points Do you think Ken really gets what you are trying to say Good things for the Right Reasonswhere have I heard that before Love you Morgan Original Message From Shaw Neal mailto Sent Wednesday October PM To Subject FW Morgan Jenny Did not know if you received the lastest on the Ken Lay Letter Ken is the President CEO and Chairman of all of Enron Love Dad Original Message From Shaw Neal Sent Tuesday October AM To Cc Subject RE Importance High Ken Thank you for your response to my email Whether you actually took the time to respond or left it to one of your assistants I hope you read my commentssuggestions and truly understood them I have a few more comments and suggestions You are correct overall stock values have declined and Enron has some additional unique issues related to its broadband and telecom business payments from California and large investments in foreign power plants particularly India However I cannot agree with your comments or Jeffs about short sellers Short sellers like jackals and vultures exist for a reason and are an important part of the whole financial community in which we live Short sellers and Jackals are always looking for a dealmeal When they find an unhealthy company animal they investigate which oftens leads to greater opportunities Enron under Jeffs leadership was not healthy and the short sellers jackals found a wonderful opportunity Your current job as was Jeff Skillings is to not provide the short sellers jackals a reason or opportunity to focus on Enrons stock price I applaud your recent commitment to the financial community to provde better definition regarding Enrons profits Developing the necessary internal mechanism for a largely transparent financial reporting system will police itself and will ultimately reinforce confidence in Enrons true value As an economist you need to remember that the market value of any company in todays economy is largely based on the markets perception of its value As you and I have so recently seen the market very often reacts on preception and only looks at intrinsic value as an afterthought The financial community believes that if it quacks like a duck and walks like a duck thenjust maybe it is a duck and not really a racehorse Enron executives need to be more cognizant of the negative impact their excessive insider selling of shares has on market preception Using stock options in lieu of salary is a very powerful incentive but it can also backfire especially if the proper safe guards are not in place Excessive insider trades can and should be limited Doing good things for the right reasons works For some years now Northerns leadership has not done many good things for the right reasons They are highly political and have developed a nasty habit of not telling their upper management Stan Horton the truth but what Stan wants to hear They are doing many things not because they should but becaue they can get away with them This activity works only as long as their customers do not have a choice You want exampleslook at the nonEnron pipeline activity in Florida and the upper midwest A solid domestic asset with a reasonable return is much better than the possibility of much higher returns on assets in unstable foreign markets Enron is not smarter than the world and the world has certainly demonstrated that it will not allow Enron to possess very much control over world affairs Lets learn from our mistakes Selling difficult assets such as in India is good Selling profitable assets such as Portland General is bad just to make the bollom line revenue Warren Buffet an Omaha native does not look like such an old fuddyduddy as he once did as recently as last year Strong solid fandamentals do count and Short sellers will always be around and DOING GOOD THINGS FOR THE RIGHT REASONS truly works Sincerely Neal Shaw Original Message From mailto Sent Monday October PM To Shaw Neal Subject RE Any responses to this email should be sent to Neal I appreciate your recent email concerning the decline in Enrons stock price I share with you a very deep disappointment and frustration about this decline The decline has occurred for a number of reasons First overall stock values have declined significantly this year Enrons stock price has declined more than averages primarily because of the total melt down in the broadband and telecom business difficulties with getting paid by the California utilities and trouble with our large power plant and LNG project in India These problems have been further compounded by endless misinformation and rumors probably promulgated by short sellers In any event I believe we our making progress in addressing these various problems I believe our stock price will increase over the short to intermediate term With good success we will be able to restore most or all of the value we lost this year over the not too distant future I appreciate your concerns and your suggestions and I will certainly do everything I can to restore your confidence in Enron Sincerely Ken Original Message From Shaw Neal ENRON mailtoIMCEANOTESShawCNealCnshawusenergyservicesE comE NRONcom Sent Monday September PM To Subject Ken My name is Neal Shaw and I worked for Northern Natural Gas Company in Midland Minneapolis and Omaha in the Marketing Department of Enrons Gas Pipeline Group for almost years I left the company is December I have a major portion of my investment portfolio in Enron shares I just read an interesting article titled Sizing up CEO aplomb under duress a major concern by Jamie Lareau This article focused on how to recognize CEOs and CEO candidates who were not up to the requirements of their job and used Jeff Skilling as an example I have agreed with views of this journalist for some time especially since Jeff called a fund manager an asshole Publically calling someone is simply Not something any CEO should do and you and Enrons board should have done something about Jeff then My point is as follows Where were you and the Enron Board during all this Why have you let people like Jeff Skilling and Stan Horton virtually destroy all growth prospects for the pipelines and totally concentrate on trying to make money without an asset base A lot of people believed Jeffs hype and many people have suffered Has Jeff suffered I think not especially since he has left Enron with millions of our dollars in his pocket Hopefully he will be able to afford the time off to find himself Did you see the movie Top Gun Toward the end of the movie Tom Cruise otherwise know as Maverick blamed himself for the loss of his friend and simply disengaged from combat flying However when things got really rough Maverick reengaged the enemy and did what he was hired to do Do you know where this is going You are once again Enrons Top Gun The enemy is Enrons depressed stock price It is time for you to reengage and live up to your title of Top Gun and CEO I and the rest of Enrons stock holders need you to repair the damage Jeff did and STOP the damage people like Stan Horton are currently doing and get Enron back in the mix I sincerely hope you are still capable of doing a good job If you are not refund your salary since Jeff took over and step down Sincerely Neal Shaw US Energy
