<19846363.1075862287426.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,jim.piro@enron.com,2001-10-18 17:32:00,Weekly Report for PGE Cc Regulatory Affairs The Oregon Public Utility Commission today hosted a public hearing in Portland to discuss the impacts of PGEs Oct price increase The hearing was conducted in response to a request by consumer and business interest groups even though the month long rate case proceedings are officially closed and the OPUC approved PGEs request Pamela Lesh PGEs vice president of Public Policy and Regulatory Affairs represented the company at the hearing Representatives and members of the interest groups Industrial Customers of Northwest Utilities Associated Oregon Industries and Citizens Utility Board also offered their comments Todays hearing is part of a larger campaign by these groups asking for reconsideration of PGEs rate case Several weeks ago the OPUC denied their request to block the implementation of new rates on October A second proposal by these groups is a request for reconsideration in which the OPUC could decide to create a plan to mitigate or defer the price increases over time This matter has yet to be decided by the OPUC but we expect them do deny the reconsideration request PGE has stated that a price deferral or phasein approach would not be wise because it would create millions of dollars in debt that would ultimately cost PGE customers more in the long term Beginning this week all residential and business customers will receive a special mailing from PGE that provides details on how customers can use energy wisely and efficiently Retail Loads Were roughly MW behind Authorized UE forecast in the last days and MW behind MW behind when adjusted for weather in the last days due to significantly weak demand by manufacturing customers though hightech held up well and likely commercial nonmanufacturing customers You may have heard this morning that the US Industrial Production Index fell for months in a row worse since WWII Power Supply This past week we have seen the market continue to creep up slowly The daily electric has strengthened mostly offpeak with a slight strengthening onpeak onpeak has traded mostly around to and offpeak has steadily moved up from to In the cash electric we have been selling about MW onpeak and have stayed out of the offpeak market due to the gas price following the electric for Beavers dispatch price Daily gas we have seen the prices move up to Sumas and settled around for tomorrow This has been moving all around with weather forecasts being part of the driver and threats of storms Term electric had climbed slowly this past week with the feeling that we reached the bottom but has settled back down to last week prices Term gas has followed the electric with the prices rising slightly throughout the week then settling down to last week prices Overall everything has been very quiet with everything running full out when the dispatch is below the market We arent anticipating any major fluctuation in the coming week that would cause either gas or electric to move dramatically All the plants are available and running smoothly El Paso Seasonal Exchange Negotiations are in process with El Paso on a seasonal exchange in which PGE may take up to MW of Dec and Jan power in fourhour blocks Total energy taken by PGE must be returned in Sep in fourhour blocks of El Pasos choice El Paso would like to embed a provision for lending commercial terms are being negotiated Intel Blend and Extend Initial contact with customer has been made and terms are being revised as requested by Intel At Intels first availability PGE will meet with them to discuss two products an extend and blend financing of a reduced rate increase and an extend and blend product with financed

<26401075.1075862295169.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,jim.piro@enron.com,2001-06-06 16:44:00,Q forecast Cc Attached is a spreadsheet that compares our original plan budget plus overview to our forecast for the nd quarter with actuals for April and May and last months forecast for June We are in the process of completing our May closing but the IBIT number for May is complete The June forecast was prepared last month and we are now in the process of updating our forecast of power cost and IBIT for June We should complete that next week Curves in the west continue to come down which will potentially reduce our IBIT for June but I will know more next week The spreadsheet shows million IBIT compared to what I provided you early this week of million The primary difference is power cost and our view that given the current movement in wholesale prices from May that power cost could rise by an additional million from that level We are currently in the dead band zone for the PCA so any change in power cost go right to IBIT There is one other issue related to power cost concerning our need to potentially increase our reserves for the California receivables AA continues to push us on this issue to increase the amount of reserves If we have a good June we might want to increase our reserves however this is something we will talk with Bob Butz about early next month when June results are available Please call if you would like to discuss this further We will have a better look at June next week once the updated forecast is completed

faces challenge PGEs dance card may take awhile to fill if its deal with Sierra Pacific fails Wednesday April By Gail Kinsey Hill of The Oregonian staff If Sierra Pacific Resources leaves Portland General Electric at the altar other suitors may cool their heels awhile before proposing Not only has the Wests energy crisis apparently spoiled the pending marriage of Nevadas Sierra Pacific and PGE it has chilled a consolidation trend that just a year ago was as hot as a starlets love life I dont see any eager buyers out there said Justin McCann a senior analyst with Standard Poors Things are pretty rocky at the moment Still possibilities exist Analysts suggest that Northwest Natural Gas in Portland Puget Energy in Bellevue Wash and IdaCorp in Boise could be interested in going after PGE if Sierra Pacific and Enron Corp PGEs parent company part ways On May either Enron or Sierra Pacific can walk away from the transaction if closing documents arent signed by then Officials from both companies have said they remain committed to the deal but they admit that changing regulatory and financial conditions make closure unlikely Houstonbased Enron said its prepared to wait patiently for another offer This is not a fire sale said Mark Palmer an Enron spokesman Enron an energy and trading company bought PGE in eager to benefit from markets that were being opened to greater competition and less government regulation But officials grew impatient with the plodding pace of deregulation and decided to jettison such capitalintensive slowgrowing assets as PGE In November Sierra Pacific Resources announced plans to buy PGE for billion in cash and assumed debt an amount similar to what Enron paid two years earlier After more than a year of leaping regulatory hurdles the deal appeared close to completion Then last summer energy shortages and skyhigh wholesale electricity prices swept through California and the rest of the West Wholesale prices times yearago levels have gouged Sierra Pacifics bottom line The company owns generating plants that supply electricity for some business and residential customers but it also buys on the wholesale market Sierra Pacific had intended to become increasingly reliant on the wholesale market and to sell many of its generating facilities The utility was to use proceeds from the sales to buy down its debt and secure financing for the PGE purchase But the Nevada Legislature is close to slapping a moratorium on the sales of any generating plants Lawmakers worry that divestitures could pinch energy supplies still further and roil wholesale markets for months to come Sierra Pacifics weakened financial state also means that the federal Securities and Exchange Commission likely wont approve the merger The SEC is the remaining regulatory body that must sanction the deal PGE isnt in on the negotiations but officials agree that the sale looks shaky Its anyones guess right now Peggy Fowler PGE president and chief executive officer recently told The Oregonians editorial board So far talk about replacement bidders is more speculation than fact Analysts said a utility based in the West is the most likely scenario Its probably going to be somebody close by said Doug May a senior portfolio manager with Wells Fargo Private Asset Management in Grand Junction Colo Its tough to come in from another part of the country But dont rule out foreign companies May added When ScottishPower bought Portlandbased PacifiCorp in December it became the first foreign concern to buy a US electric utility The merger stirred up talk of more international linkups Regionally Northwest Naturals name comes up as a potential suitor The Portlandbased utility already works cooperatively with PGE in a number of business arrangements including a joint meterreading program A lot of programs were doing are the kinds of things other electric and gas utilities are doing under one utility said Mark Dodson Northwest Natural vice president of public affairs and general counsel Im not at all surprised people might speculate that we would acquire PGE Dodson declined to comment directly on whether Northwest Natural might try to buy PGE As long as theres an agreement in place its inappropriate for us to talk about it he said Officials of IdaCorp a holding company whose primary subsidiary is electric utility Idaho Power also declined to discuss whether they have been eyeing PGE We cant really comment on deals we might get into said Russ Jones an IdaCorp spokesman IdaCorp made an unsuccessful bid for PGE two years ago when Enron first solicited offers Jones said But he said I dont know the answer to whether wed be interested now If it becomes available Jones added well probably investigate as we would with any other assets that might become available Puget Energy a holding company for Puget Sound Energy also declined to comment We never speculate on rumors said Grant Ringel Puget Energys director of corporate communications Puget Sound Energy serves electric and natural gas customers in Western Washington and is the result of the merger of Puget Sound Power and Light with Washington Energy the parent of Washington Natural Gas The merged utilities serving about million customers formed the largest electric and natural gas utility in the Northwest In the s as federal laws began deregulating electric power markets utility mergers became increasingly common Industry executives and analysts attributed the trend to increased competition and a drive toward greater efficiency With deregulation economies of scale are very important said Wells Fargos May Its very difficult to do well as a small company The trend has taken in couplings of electric utilities and natural gas utilities convergence in industry parlance as well as linkups of electric utilities Yet analysts note that the industrys consolidation has slowed of late The uncertain regulatory environment throughout the United States the energy shortage in the West and the electricity crisis in California are putting the brakes on the trend they say This whole California thing has made everyone very cautious said Standard Poors McCann People want to see the situation sort itself out You can reach Gail Kinsey Hill by email at or by telephone at Wholesale market bright for PGE The utility reports billion in revenue in fiscal from reselling electricity Wednesday April By Gail Kinsey Hill of The Oregonian staff Enron Corp views Portland General Electric as a sluggish asset weighted down by regulatory laws and political uncertainties Maybe so But PGE posted healthy financial gains in fiscal benefiting from the regions energy shortage and spiking wholesale electricity prices Revenue from wholesale power sales jumped to a record billion last year more than triple the wholesale sales figure of million Bottom line PGE recorded earnings of million in up percent from earnings of million It was a banner year for us said Jim Piro PGEs chief financial officer The utilitys financial strength should continue even if a pending sale to Sierra Pacific Resources falters according to analysts I dont think PGE will be tainted as an asset if the utility again is put on the block said Doug May senior portfolio manager for Wells Fargo Private Asset Management in Grand Junction Colo In contrast with PGE Sierra Pacific suffered from high wholesale power prices reporting losses of million in a sharp decline from earnings of million Utilityowned hydroelectric and coal and gasfired generation plants supply about half of the electricity thats needed to serve PGEs business and residential customers The company buys the rest of its power on the wholesale market Until last summer wholesale prices remained relatively stable Then pushed by electricity shortages and Californias botched deregulation plan prices soared from between and a megawatt hour to more than a megawatt hour The market became so volatile that on some days shortterm or spot prices spiked above a megawatt hour Soaring prices cut into the financial reserves of utilities caught short of power and forced to the market for lastminute buys But PGE with experienced wholesale traders and a conservative purchasing strategy had secured longterm contracts as a hedge against the market The approach kept spot purchases to a minimum In fact PGE bought more electricity than its customers could use The long position allowed PGE to resell the electricity California was among its customers for a tidy profit We were fortunate to be in a good situation last year Piro said Wholesale electricity sales accounted for percent of PGEs operating revenue last year a turnaround from prior years when retail sales dominated financial returns Wholesale sales proved so lucrative that PGE withdrew a request to raise rates by percent The utility may raise rates late this year officials said or if cash continues to pour in it may issue refunds to customers PGEs expenses also have gone up dramatically The utility spent billion on electric power and fuel purchases last year up from million in Top Print
