introducing functionality which will allow token reference periods for balance of month products the scheduled process will therefore recreate these products every day automatically essentially just a change to the description Therefore the product will already be there In the mean time all of the other desks have been creating their products ahead of time to deal with this issue we currently have most desks creating products weeksmonths in advance This software change is scheduled for Friday to prevent traders from going through this issue next month February We have only loggedtaped phone calls to the HelpDesk when Portland office has called the HelpDesk with regard to this issue Clearly in the second case we see a minute gap but this appears to be a single incident and not really something of the level of significance specified in your memo Dale does come in early specifically for any products Portland did not create the day before but obviously there can be times bad traffic when he may be late CST J Richter called to approve products Products activated products within minutes CST J Richter called to approve products CST Anna Gardiner approved products CST J Richter called to inquire on status CST HelpDesk rang J Richter back to check that he had seen approval and had no technical problems Clearly we are not intentionally trying to create a problem but EnronOnline is a new product and everyone is putting an immense amount of effort into getting the product up and running and helping everyone We only seem to have times that the procedure has been used to the HelpDesk extent and not failed dramatically Changing the procedure for two days assuming succesful implementation of the tokenized reference periods when we are all working to keep the system up and running and keep all customers informed of developments may create more problems If we do not introduce this software change on Friday we should review this policy I obviously have no problem with Tim approving such products as we will be moving to that level of authority shortly anyway Michael Etringer PM To Louise CT cc Tim CT Chris H CT Dale CT Subject Approval procedure for Pending Products I would like to talk with you concerning our current procedure for daily approval of newly created products IT IS NOT WORKING The current procedure is for us to create the product and call Dale Neuner and let him know its out there If Dale is not in the office or it is before or after normal work hours the traders need to call the help desk who in turn calls Amita in the London office who then approves the product The Portland office starts trading at AM PPT In the event a product is not created ahead of time they create the product in the morning This morning the traders had several daily products pending approval It took minutes to get those products approved On daily products the trading period may last only hour As a result the trader missed most of the trading period OUR CUSTOMERS ARE NOT HAPPY AND NEITHER ARE THE TRADERS A solution was proposed in December which I have attached below to address this issue However it only works in the ideal world It would be overly optimistic to think that we are going to be able to always be able to create our products ahead of time That is not the reality By rolling out our products we have created an implicate contract with our customers that we will consistently make markets in the products we trade I would like to propose an alternate solution We need a direct method for Tim Belden to have approval rights to approve existing products These are not new products we trade them every day There is no reason Tim should not have a level of approval to at the very least approve existing products Especially

prudent in light of ENAs interest in keeping these offbalance sheet regardless of their use in Canada or the US My estimate is based on MM balance four month average duration staggered payments interest rate and withholding tax Matt Berry of ENA Finance and Morris Clark were part of our discussion on this matter The reason that we do not look at it over an extended term is becasue this West LB structure was put in place as a bridge until Enron determined if the machines were to be used in Canada or the US At that time Enron would put in place either a Canadian or US permanent structure that would be more taxefficient I am available to talk about this further Let me know Chris Enron Capital Trade Resources Canada Corp From Peter Keohane AM To Christopher F CT cc Subject WestLB Transaction Further to my voice mail FYI Forwarded by Peter KeohaneCALECT on AM Enron Capital Trade Resources Canada Corp From Peter Keohane AM To John J CT cc Greg CT Eric CT Subject WestLB Transaction John the attached is a summary by Greg of the financining for the turbines purchased from New Brunswick Power In summary ECC pays the bank West LB directly in three installments under an offbalance sheet lease financing arrangement The first installment of US MM was made Dec The next installment is due Feb of US MM and the third installment is due roughly March of US MM The drag on the financing is that West LB through whom ENA structures its offbalance sheet turbine financings is not a Canadian resident for tax purposes and therefore is not tax efficient to ECC in that there is a withholding tax payment on the interest not principal component of each leasefinancing payment An offbalance sheet financing with a Canadian resident financial institution would eliminate this tax inefficiency and this is what I was referring to when I indicated some work may still be required to restructure the turbine financing The withholding tax if we keep this structure will total roughly C over all of the leasefinancing payments Chris Calger has the exact figure Any decision to change the structure should have regard to these costs and the transaction costs and fees associated with finding a new Canadian resident offbalance sheet lender In addition if we decide to keep the turbines or sell or transfer the turbines to ENA or a third party depending on commercially what it is we decide to do with them additional work may be required to take title to the turbines or to assignrestructure the West LB financing and the New Brunswick Power purchase agreement I am confident that the bulk of commercial legal work for any of these transactions can be handled internally but that the tax legal work may require the input of outside counsel We are also obligated to pay GST but this is ultimately reimbursed through the lease financing althoguh there is a time value of money component that is not recovered from the time GST is paid and when the GST rebate is made Forwarded by Peter KeohaneCALECT on AM Greg Johnston PM To Peter CT cc Eric CT Subject WestLB Transaction Peter referring to your request for an update as to the status and mechanics of the West LB transaction relating to our acquisition of the NB Power turbines please be advised as follows Although ENA executed the Acquisition and Development Agreement the Agreement with WestLB all of ENAs interest in that Agreement was immediately assigned to Enron Canada meaning that we are directly responsible for making all funding requests and all cost of borrowing payments to WestLB The initial payment on the turbines was made through WestLB for an amount of US on December GST was payable on US of that amount The next installment is due to NB Power on February and is for an amount of US Laura Scott will be initiating the funding request in the next day or so to allow the advance to be a LIBOR advance WestLB will then attend to paying the installment payment plus GST to NB Power on Feb The final installment payment is for an amount of US and is due on the earlier of the date on which we commence disassembling the turbines and March The cost to Enron Canada for utilizing WestLB who is not registered in Canada to carry on business is that we are required to pay withholding tax of on all costs of borrowing ie interest payments The interest is calculated at a LIBOR rate WestLB has now registered themselves in Canada for GST purposes and will be making the required GST payments to NB Power and then applying for the GST rebate which rebate amount is for our account under the Agreement WestLB is aware that depending on how we proceed with our required use of the turbines they will be taken out either with respect to i the interim financing or if the interim financing period is short ie if we were going to proceed immediately to finish paying for the turbines and commence moving them ii when we put the SPV in place to build the project If we determine that the turbines are to go to Houston and be moved into the US the withholding tax issue obviously disappears If we determine to proceed with the project in some fashion but the interim financing period will be more than a month or so it probably makes sense to remove WestLB from the interim financing thereby saving ourselves the cost of the withholding tax One potential fix is to bring in a Canadian bank to act as funding agent with WestLB continuing to bear the transactional risk which could reduce the cost to us of getting a new bank comfortable with the financing arrangement We have not yet canvassed all the possible solutions so I have not thought through to the full extent whether this proposal is viable I think that you are aware of the reasons that the determination was made to proceed with WestLB despite the withholding tax issue but if you would like to discuss this any further or if there is anything else you would like to discuss I am happy to do so Greg

you Mike Mike and Jeff Monday morning I am wide open Pls set up with Mollie Chris Laird Dyer AM To Christopher F CT cc Michael CT Michael CT Jeff ES Subject PGE Sempra Energy SoCalGas SDGE Gas Related Opportunities Chris Attached are excel files summarizing data related to PGEs and Sempras core procurement operations Mike Wong did an excellent job in obtaining this data in a very short timeframe The data related to Sempras awards under their procurement incentive mechanisms GCIM for SoCalGas PBRM for SDGE was obtained under strictest confidence by Mike consequently we have been asked to not distribute it Basically this is the story Sempra operates under incentive mechanisms core procurement and productivity PGE operates under only core procurement Sempra is a more attractive candidate for an outsourcing given its structure and incentives Sempra Core Procurement Mechanism The core procurement mechanism although including some transport and storage elements is driven by Sempras ability to buy gas below the st of month index at the southern California border There is a tolerance around the index between which all costs or benefits accrue to ratepayers If the cost of gas is above or below the tolerance band Sempra shares of the cost benefit In most years per the data summary Sempra has realized a benefit The benefit has ranged on a combined basis from MM to MM annually Further Sempra indicates a brokerage fee of MMBtu which reflects its short run avoided cost of procuring gas for core load Effectively this is the credit extended to core load taking service from an alternate provider This is also an indication of Sempras short run variable cost of operation and imputes an annual cost of MM for procurement related activities Bcfyr MMBtu In fact this understates Sempras procurement costs which are better defined by a long term avoided cost A long term avoided cost of procurement would reflect savings from staff reductions and reductions in associated overhead and would at least double the indicated MM number Thus we expect that Sempra would realize about MM in savings from outsourcing its core procurement function and they would retain a substantial portion if not all of this saving under their productivity mechanism Sempra Productivity Mechanism Sempra also operates under a productivity mechanism which is based upon a revenue requirement in a base year say That revenue requirement increases at inflation less a productivity factor determined at the outset The productivity factor X has been in the range of under various applications to the CPUC by SoCalGas SDGE and SCE There is also a mechanism where cost savings relative to the revenue requirement all accrue to ratepayers but the utility is rewarded by a higher rate of return Either way there is a direct correlation of savings to shareholder value under these mechanisms PGE PGE has yet to receive approval for a productivity mechanism It operates only under a core procurement incentive mechanism CPIM and has realized very little shareholder value about MM since its effective date of operation in June PGEs core load is about Bcfyear PGEs brokerage fee is centsMMBtu imputing MM per year in short run procurement costs Much like Sempra PGEs long run cost of procurement likely exceeds MM per year However without a productivity mechanism most if not all savings from outsourcing this function would accrue to ratepayers Conclusions Sempra There is a substantial opportunity with Sempra as its shareholders largely benefit from an outsourcing If we were to propose to take on a full requirement delivery obligation we would probably have to offer a cent per MMBtu discount to the index MMyear However we would have access to Bcf of storage and Bcfd of interstate transmission in order to serve Bcfyear of load Under a scenario where Sempra outsources its procurement function paying Enron say MM per year but retains its procurement obligation shareholder benefit is about MM per year If Enron also assumed the procurement obligation at Index Sempras shareholders would lockin procurement incentive benefits of MM per year I think both scenarios are compelling for Sempra PGE Without a productivity mechanism procurement outsourcing savings would largely accrue to ratepayers PGE has not realized significant benefit under its CPIM except that it is no longer subject to disallowance for its procurement decisions which have been costly to shareholders in the past specifically the AS contracts in Alberta Without taking on the procurement obligation and offering gas at citygate at a discount to index there is little or no incentive to PGE to oursource at this time Final Comments Mike McDonald met with Bob Glynn of PGE yesterday and was directed to the president of the utility Gordon Smith Mike will be speaking to his highplaced contact at Sempra early next week We are working to better define all the parameters under these mechanisms but feel that it is important to get you an early notional indication of the issues at play among Californias gas related IOUs Laird

<11197554.1075843094332.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,christopher.calger@enron.com,2000-08-20 01:49:00,Re PGE Sempra Energy SoCalGas SDGE Gas Related Opportunities Cc great I would like to have a call with you Mike Mike and Jeff Monday morning I am wide open Pls set up with Mollie Chris Laird Dyer AM To Christopher F CT cc Michael CT Michael CT Jeff ES Subject PGE Sempra Energy SoCalGas SDGE Gas Related Opportunities Chris Attached are excel files summarizing data related to PGEs and Sempras core procurement operations Mike Wong did an excellent job in obtaining this data in a very short timeframe The data related to Sempras awards under their procurement incentive mechanisms GCIM for SoCalGas PBRM for SDGE was obtained under strictest confidence by Mike consequently we have been asked to not distribute it Basically this is the story Sempra operates under incentive mechanisms core procurement and productivity PGE operates under only core procurement Sempra is a more attractive candidate for an outsourcing given its structure and incentives Sempra Core Procurement Mechanism The core procurement mechanism although including some transport and storage elements is driven by Sempras ability to buy gas below the st of month index at the southern California border There is a tolerance around the index between which all costs or benefits accrue to ratepayers If the cost of gas is above or below the tolerance band Sempra shares of the cost benefit In most years per the data summary Sempra has realized a benefit The benefit has ranged on a combined basis from MM to MM annually Further Sempra indicates a brokerage fee of MMBtu which reflects its short run avoided cost of procuring gas for core load Effectively this is the credit extended to core load taking service from an alternate provider This is also an indication of Sempras short run variable cost of operation and imputes an annual cost of MM for procurement related activities Bcfyr MMBtu In fact this understates Sempras procurement costs which are better defined by a long term avoided cost A long term avoided cost of procurement would reflect savings from staff reductions and reductions in associated overhead and would at least double the indicated MM number Thus we expect that Sempra would realize about MM in savings from outsourcing its core procurement function and they would retain a substantial portion if not all of this saving under their productivity mechanism Sempra Productivity Mechanism Sempra also operates under a productivity mechanism which is based upon a revenue requirement in a base year say That revenue requirement increases at inflation less a productivity factor determined at the outset The productivity factor X has been in the range of under various applications to the CPUC by SoCalGas SDGE and SCE There is also a mechanism where cost savings relative to the revenue requirement all accrue to ratepayers but the utility is rewarded by a higher rate of return Either way there is a direct correlation of savings to shareholder value under these mechanisms PGE PGE has yet to receive approval for a productivity mechanism It operates only under a core procurement incentive mechanism CPIM and has realized very little shareholder value about MM since its effective date of operation in June PGEs core load is about Bcfyear PGEs brokerage fee is centsMMBtu imputing MM per year in short run procurement costs Much like Sempra PGEs long run cost of procurement likely exceeds MM per year However without a productivity mechanism most if not all savings from outsourcing this function would accrue to ratepayers Conclusions Sempra There is a substantial opportunity with Sempra as its shareholders largely benefit from an outsourcing If we were to propose to take on a full requirement delivery obligation we would probably have to offer a cent per MMBtu discount to the index MMyear However we would have access to Bcf of storage and Bcfd of interstate transmission in order to serve Bcfyear of load Under a scenario where Sempra outsources its procurement function paying Enron say MM per year but retains its procurement obligation shareholder benefit is about MM per year If Enron also assumed the procurement obligation at Index Sempras shareholders would lockin procurement incentive benefits of MM per year I think both scenarios are compelling for Sempra PGE Without a productivity mechanism procurement outsourcing savings would largely accrue to ratepayers PGE has not realized significant benefit under its CPIM except that it is no longer subject to disallowance for its procurement decisions which have been costly to shareholders in the past specifically the AS contracts in Alberta Without taking on the procurement obligation and offering gas at citygate at a discount to index there is little or no incentive to PGE to oursource at this time Final Comments Mike McDonald met with Bob Glynn of PGE yesterday and was directed to the president of the utility Gordon Smith Mike will be speaking to his highplaced contact at Sempra early next week We are working to better define all the parameters under these mechanisms but feel that it is important to get you an early notional indication of the issues at play among Californias gas related IOUs Laird
