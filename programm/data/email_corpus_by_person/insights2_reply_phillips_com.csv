unity of immense proportions Im talking about the socalled glut of fib er optic cable As Ive been telling my TECHNOLOGY INVESTING readers I be lieve the buildout has really just begun In fact I can prove it And com panies that make the fiber are tremendous longterm investments But right now I want to fill you in on just one aspect of the fiber business that w ill make you quite rich a whole lot quicker Heres the deal Yes there is a large amount of unutilized fiber optic cable out there today But that s not a problem for the tech industry Its an opportunity You see of all the fiber that has ever been laid is darkthat is its not activ ated At a recent investment conference I explained it like this You kno w what dark fiber has in common with a bushel of wheat You cant send data over either one of them Before this fiber can be used it has to be li t Who do you call to do the job You call Nortel you call Cisco you cal l Lucent Then they all call ONE COMPANY to get the parts THATS the stock I want you to buy now Low Risk With TenBagger Potential Im looking at a doublepossibly a tripleby this time next year And I fully expect to multiply our money tentimes over by Best of all this stock is so b eatendown theres little risk from here Point is if Im rightand Ill gladly stake my reputation on this calljust a small investment now can mak e you a huge pile of cash The stock None other than optical powerhouse JD S Uniphase NASDAQ JDSU Heres my reasoning When the World Trade Cent er got hit the Internet slowed downvery noticeably slowed down What does that mean There isnt enough capacity or redundancy built into the system to accommodate a blip in demand I believe people in government are very worried about this problem After all this is the second time its happene d Back in July a tunnel fire in Baltimore slowed the Internet to a crawl for two full days because an optical cable got caught in the snare That m eans our communications systemsand therefore our economyare very very vu lnerable Ten years ago it wouldnt have mattered But today commerce an d security is COMPLETELY DEPENDENT on those systems Virtually nothing move s without it Thats how banks

understand Heres one example Qwestone of Americas biggest carri ersrecently said theyre loaded on their network That doesnt sound t oo baduntil you understand how these networks operate You cant load a ne twork much past In fact is virtually catastrophicbecause the net work spends so much time searching for open channels it doesnt spend any time actually sending packets of information The system locks Communicat ions stops The nation comes to a standstill Quite simply America is fall ing behind the rest of the developed world and weve got to catch up fast Internet traffic systems currently run faster in Australia Europe and ev en South America Thats because we push out more data than everyone elseb ut were not increasing capacity at anywhere near the needed rate Get thi sdata traffic is DOUBLING every year now That means a network running at of capacity needs to double its load by this time next year just to kee p up Thats why the fiber mustand willbe lit Otherwise business the ec
