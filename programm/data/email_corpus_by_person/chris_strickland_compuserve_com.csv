Derivatives Pricing and Risk Management Course Leaders Dr Les Clewlow and Dr Chris Strickland Houston March London April Fee STG USD This is an intermediate course aimed at the Energy professional who is familiar with energy derivative products but who requires the mathematical foundations of derivative pricing and an understanding of the pricing and risk management of energy derivatives This course assumes that participants are familiar with standard basic option pricing theory the BlackScholes formula Monte Carlo simulation and the use of binomial trees for option pricing The format for the course will follow our usual highly practical and successful style of alternate sessions of lectures and Excel based computer workshops To facilitate intensive interaction the course will be limited to a maximum of participants so early booking is advisable The Excel based computer workshops deal with oil and gas as well as electricity derivatives and contain detailed calculations for

University of Warwick UK Together they have over years combined experience in the financial and energy derivative markets and have published many articles in academic and trade journals They are the authors of the book Implementing Derivatives Models Wiley and editors of Exotic Options The State of the Art ITP Their forthcoming book Energy Derivatives Pricing and Risk Management is due to be published during the second quarter Currently their interests are concentrated in the energy derivatives area where they have developed a wide range of pricing tools for electricity options and other energy derivatives
