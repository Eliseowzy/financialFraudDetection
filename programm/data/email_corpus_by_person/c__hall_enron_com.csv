and Gary I thought you both might be interested to learn that CDWR was unable to est ablish the cost of power that it sold because it doesnt separately track t he purchase price and sales price for each megawatt It seems unreasonable for the State to be insisting that marketers produce costs for power sold to California when the State does not or cannot track that data for its own power purchases and sales I underlined the relevant passages in the LA Times and San Jose Mercury Stories below Regards Steve Surplus Power Sold at a Loss Electricity Cool summer and effective conservation efforts result in exces s supplies Industry officials say its a routine move By NANCY VOGEL TIMES STAFF WRITER July SACRAMENTO Caught with an excess of electricity as a result of cool weat her and heavy conservation the state government sold power at a loss appro aching million in the first days of July The loss amounts to roughly of the total amount the state spent on pow er during that period To keep power flowing to million Californians the state purchased m illion megawatthours at an average price of per megawatthour accord ing to the state Department of Water Resources It sold off surplus megawatthours at an average price of per megawatthour Department of Water Resources Director Thomas Hannigan disclosed the details in respo nse to an inquiry by Assemblyman John Campbell RIrvine The sales of surplus power get to the issue of do these people really kno w what theyre doing Are they really competent to be managing this to the lowest cost for the ratepayers Campbell said It reinforces to me that w e should get the state out of doing this as soon as practically possible Industry officials however say it is routine for utilities and electricit y companies to at times find themselves with more electricity than their cu stomers need They either sell the power at a loss work out an exchange of power or give it away Its not all that uncommon for utilities to be buying one day and selling the next said one Pacific Northwest trader who asked not to be identified because his company does not permit him to talk to reporters He said a ru le of thumb in the industry is to match supply to demand within to a lthough on a load like California isnt that much Assemblyman Roderick Wright DLos Angeles chairman of the Assembly utili ties committee said he did not see a problem with DWRs power sales Right now the summer is cool he said If this had been a normal July w e would have used all that power The worm could have turned the other way Department of Water Resources spokesman Oscar Hidalgo said the states crew of power purchasers found themselves selling a very minimal amount of electricity in May In June more power was sold but less than was sold i n July he said The department has not released those figures Department officials expect the sales to stop if temperatures heat up later this week The water department was thrust into the role of buying to of the s tates overall electricity in January after the states major utilities bec ame so financially crippled by high wholesale electricity prices that energ y companies refused to sell to them The department has so far spent roughly billion of taxpayer money purcha sing power that is sent to the customers of Pacific Gas Electric Souther n California Edison and San Diego Gas Electric Hidalgo said the sales show that the water department has stabilized the st ates electricity market The average price the department has paid for a m egawatthour is falling from in May to in June to so far in July If we were out scrambling for power right now Hidalgo said the market would reflect that and adjust to it and we would most likely be paying muc h more in overall purchases Campbell said he assumes the department sold its most expensive marginal m egawatts of power But Hidalgo said that is not necessarily so The departm ent does not track what it paid for the power it sells he said The departments statement to Campbell shows sales to different companie s including the federal Bonneville Power Administration the Los Angeles D epartment of Water and Power and several private energy companies that bou ght power plants from Californias utilities under the states deregul ation scheme Those firms include Dynegy Corp Reliant Energy Mirant Corp and Duke Energy Copyright Los Angeles Times Figures show state lost big on extra power Posted at pm PDT Monday July BY JOHN WOOLFOLK Mercury News State figures sho w California may have lost about million this month selling surplus ele ctricity for less than it cost The Mercury News disclosed last week that some power was being sold at a loss But the new figures provide the first indication of just how much excess power the state bought in its desperate effort to avoid blackouts and how cheaply some of that power was sold wh en it turned out not to be needed A Republican lawmaker said Monday the l oss also shows Democratic Gov Gray Davis energy policies are needlessly c osting consumers This whole thing is a mess said Assemblyman John Ca mpbell RIrvine who requested details of the states surplus power sales The government needs to get out of the power business before it costs Ca lifornians even more money A state spokesman didnt dispute the mil lion figure outright but said it is an approximation based on average price s and that the actual loss probably is less Its a number Im sure he l ikes very much but its definitely an estimated number and it could be fa r lower said Oscar Hidalgo spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources Campbell responded that the loss also could be higher The sta te has spent million on power so far this month State officials last week confirmed that cool weather and consumer conservation have left Calif ornia holding more power than it needs The revelation was a stunning turna round for a state that months ago was paying top dollar for power expectin g shortages this summer Price that was paid The state bought million megawatthours of electricity for July at an average price of per meg awatthour according to a response Friday by the Department of Water Resou rces to Campbells inquiry The state has sold surplus megawatthou rs in July at an average price of the department said Based on those average prices the state paid million for the surplus power which it sold for million million less than it cost A more precise calculation of the states loss is difficult because purchased power is acq uired at different times and prices and pooled as a portfolio Purchas es included longterm contracts that averaged per megawatthour as wel l as cheaper spotmarket buys State officials last week said they were se lling surplus at to a megawatthour while some traders cited uncon firmed sales as low as Hidalgo noted that the surplus sales represent just percent of Californias July purchases which totaled million The million from sales will help lower the states power bill he said adding that utilities routinely sell some extra electricity Despite t he fact that were in somewhat of a surplus any powerbuying operation in the world is going to have to plan for these types of situations Hidalgo said Its not unique and in fact its normal operating procedure for a ny utility Other Western utilities including Portland General Electric in Oregon have said they too are selling some surplus power at a loss a nd describe it as a cost of doing business The suppliers buying the state s surplus electricity on the cheap include the big outofstate energy com panies that the governor has called pricegouging snakes Among them ar e Duke Energy Dynegy Power and Marketing El Paso Power Services Mirant Reliant Energy and Williams Energy Best bid taken Hidalgo said the sta te took the best offers it could find Its only reasonable to get the b est bid you can he said Campbell said the million loss is troublin g because ratepayers or taxpayers will have to cover the cost whereas a pr ivate utility could be forced to eat the expense if regulators determined i t was unreasonable State officials say whats more important is that the overall cost of power is dropping from an average daily tab of million in May to million this month in part because the state has so much po wer Contact John Woolfolk at mailtojwoolfolk sjmercurycom or Embedded

years experience in the field State officials say she is doing a good job By JEFFREY L RABIN DARYL KELLEY Times Staff Writers The Davis administration is paying a young business consultant with barely a years experience in the energy industry annually to head a team of traders who secure Californias daily electricity supply State officials hired Susan T Lee in April without competitive bidding under an emergency declaration by Gov Gray Davis Lees contract is equal to the a month that Davis pays his chief energy advisor S David Freeman a top utility executive for decades The twoyear contract will pay Lee up to to oversee the states daytoday energy purchases totaling billions of dollars a year Lees contract reflects the pressure and difficulties the state says it faces to fill key jobs in its new role as one of the nations largest power buyers a role that it took on in January as Californias utilities faltered Lees contract was one of about a dozen released Monday and among the largest Reached at her Sacramento office Lee would not discuss her contract She said only that she heads a person team of traders and schedulers that works long hours to keep Californias power flowing Pete Garris a contracts manager for the state Department of Water Resources who recruited Lee said he met her at industry meetings and had been impressed by her savvy He said he gave her a pay raise to lure her to state service in April after Ron Shimizu her boss at Mieco Inc a trading firm in Long Beach recommended her Shimizu refused comment Tuesday The state according to Garris must compete for employees against an aggressive energy industry and pay good salaries to stay in the game You can consider this situation to be very extraordinary Garris said Unless we can get permanent and fulltime positions approved these are the rules we have to follow to be able to hire consultants Garris insisted that it is unfair to compare Lees contract with the sixmonth deal that Freemanthe former boss at several major utilitiesstruck with the governor I dont want to compare Susan Lee to David Freeman Garris said David comes from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Susan came from a private power marketer With Susan we just followed the standard formula In her new job Lee will direct an immensely complicated aroundtheclock operation responsible for procuring energy scheduling power and associated transmission and reconciling deviations between contracts and deliveries according to her contract Lees resume attached to the contract shows that she had no experience in the energy field until March when she joined Mieco There she was a trader and power scheduler not a manager She was only here for a year or so said Dina Alvarez an administrative manager for the company A graduate of UCLA with a degree in economics she worked as a pension and benefits manager in Los Angeles and New York before joining Mieco Lees contract stands out compared to others disclosed this week not only for its size but for her relative inexperience in the energy field She is being paid an hour and can earn a maximum of including expenses by April Another new consultant William L Green has almost a quarter of a century of experience working for the Bonneville Power Administration Pacific Gas Electric and the California Independent System Operator He is being paid an hour to supervise workers who reconcile the states accounting of energy purchases His twoyear deal is worth up to They are not alone in cutting lucrative deals Richard Ferreira the former assistant general manager at the Sacramento Municipal Utilities District has a contract and is being paid an hour to assist the state in negotiating power purchase contracts He worked for the Department of Water Resources for years before joining the Sacramento agency in Hardy Energy Consulting also has a sixmonth contract that calls for Randy Harvey to be paid an hour Harvey has a quarter of a century of energy experience particularly at the Bonneville Power Administration where he was chief executive officer from to Lees recruiter Garris said her lack of experience is not a concern So far shes done an excellent job he said She has the skills and she has the ability She was doing a similar job Dozens of consultants including Lee have been hired since January when Davis declared an energy emergency and set up a special arm of government to buy power The state filled a vacuum when generators refused to sell to PGE Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas Electric because they were no longer considered creditworthy said Oscar Hidalgo spokesman for the Department of Water Resources Hidalgo said that about of the people now working for the division are consultants The rest are state employees As part of the process Lees unit oversees the purchase of power a day ahead of when it is needed Hidalgo said Lee is involved in contracts that extend no more than three months

Wood on this and he agrees with my analysis on these points We can sell BPA Surplus energy to public bodies and cooperatives munis outside of the Pacific Northwest Therefore the rule that Surplus needs to touch a NW muni should be expandedrelaxed to be Surplus needs to touch a muni Stated in another way the only customers we cannot sell Surplus power to are IOUs and marketers Purchases of BPA Surplus that we sell only within NW are not subject to day recall Likewise for Surplus energy we use to replace nonhydro resources that we then export Therefore the day recall provision only applies to energy that is exported out of the region or that replaces hydro resources that are exported outside of the region Steve Original Message From Wood Marcus mailto Sent Friday August PM To Hall Steve C Legal Subject RE BPA Questions Let me give you the basic answers but I should follow up next week with a discussion of details that are crucial in implementation Sacramento PUD and other out of region public bodies and cooperatives indeed are entitled to be treated as public preference customers However in a sale to an outofstate utility regional preference trumps In other words even if the customer is a public preference customer the sale of power to the customer is subject to day recall Sales of power within the region are not subject to the day recall As a general matter I think you can use federal power to displace a nonhydro resource in the Northwest and then sell the output of that displaced resource out of region However if the resource owner is a private person or agency there will be a defect in the initial resale of Surplus Energy to such resource owner In addition under Section c of the Northwest Power Act a preference customer seeking longterm requirements service from BPA cannot must treat such displaced resource as serving its loads so that BPA is required only to provide service to the reduced load after such imputed service These matters might best be addressed in the context of specific desired transactions Original Message From Hall Steve C mailtoSteveC NRONcom Sent Friday August PM To Wood Marcus Cc Walters Stephen Yoder Christian Subject BPA Questions Marcus After taking a fresh look at the Bonnevillerelated statutes I have some new insights that I would like to test Please read over these conclusions and let me know if you agree disagree etc This can definitely wait until next week Under section a of the Bonneville Project Act no private person or agency may resell BPA power to any private utility or agency engaged in the sale of electric energy to the general public We have always interpreted this to mean that we must sell BPA Surplus Energy to NW munis After reviewing this provision today for the first time in months I now believe that we are not limited in selling to NW munis but instead can sell to public bodies and cooperatives both inside and outside the Northwest My thinking is that the Project Act does not tell us who we can sell to but only who we cannot sell to eg a private utility or agency engaged in the sale of electric energy to the general public Accordingly there being no restrictions on selling to nonNW public bodies and cooperatives we can sell to them I believe that we can sell BPA surplus power consistent with federal law to any public body or coorperative Do you agree Who is eligible to be a preference customer Why cant Sacramento MUD become a preference customer Under Section d of the Project Act the only requirements seem to be that the customer be a public body or cooperative that is within economic transmission distance of the Bonneville project Although the Northwest Power Act incorporates the Project Act I do not see that it limits this eligibility to publics in the the Columbia river drainage basin Can any public body or cooperative that is within economic transmission distance of the Bonneville project ie California New Mexico Arizona become a BPA preference customer Sales of BPA Surplus energy that are sold within the region or that are used to replace nonhydro resources which are exported out of the region are not subject to the day recall provision

Walton Steve Palmer Mark A PR Comnes Alan Badeer Robert Williams III Bill Mallory Chris Denne Karen Belden Tim Yoder Christian Sanders Richard B Subject As the CAISO Turns CAISO involved in scam with CDWR to purchase excess power from CDWRs longterm contracts Everyone This is hot news showing that the CAISOCDWR relationship is even more cozy than we thought I am not sure how to best use this information but this scam needs to be brought to the publics and FERCs attention According to two sources the CAISO is helping to bail Gov Davis out of his highpriced CDWR longterm power contracts by purchasing CDWRs excess energy as an Out Of Market purchaseinstead of purchasing realtime energy from the CAISOs Supplemental Energy auction as required by the CAISO Tariff The costs of purchasing this highcost power is being charged to Scheduling Coordinators who are largely unaware of the CAISOs surreptitious transactions This sweetheart deal violates the CAISO Tariff which requires the CAISO to buy energy from its Supplemental Energy RealTime auction first CAISO Tariff Dispatch Protocol section d Only after the CAISO has used up the Supplemental Energy bids can the CAISO buy Out Of Market OOM energy If the CAISO were following the Tariff CDWRs excess energy would be treated as an uninstructed deviation and CDWR would be paid the clearing price for Supplemental Energywhich is often as low as Therefore under the Tariff the CAISO could have paid CDWR the same price paid to other SCs but instead is buying it at a price agreeable to CDWR By ignoring Supplemental Energy bids in favor of CDWR power the CAISO is able to manipulate the price it pays for energy in the Supplemental Energy market Low CAISO demand for Supplemental Energy drives down prices The clearing price for Supplemental Energy has often been as low as Therefore the CAISO gets to keep all excess energy on the grid for free If CDWR was not getting preferential treatment its energy would be treated as excess energy and it would get little or nothing for it While there is no evidence that Gov Davis has directed the CAISO to buy from CDWR first this behavior clearly benefits Davis Absent the CAISOs purchases of CDWRs excess energy CDWR would be forced to sell its energy at a huge loss in the open market just like many other suppliers The media has been been making hay out of Daviss strategy of buying high and selling low Therefore Davis and CDWR benefit by being able to offset some of their losses under the longterm contracts Of course they are only able to offset their losses through a backdoor deal with the CAISO The costs of this expensive CDWR power are being passed through to unwitting Scheduling Coordinators who frequently seeing minute Ex Post prices of expect that the cost of imbalance energy will be close to These SCs are in for a big surprise According to one source at Sierra Pacific the CAISO charged him as much as MWh for imbalance energy Where is the price mitigation here Who benefits under this scam Davis and CDWR Who loses under this scam Instate generators who are currently obligated to sell to the CAISO Scheduling Coordinators who overgenerate or that have negative imbalances consumers who end up paying higher prices for energy Sources Our client representative from the CAISO has confirmed this practice and the Friday Burrito an industry insider publication mentioned it also Here is the quote from the Friday Burrito There is another problem that is being introduced by the longterm contracts The ISO is utilizing the DWR contracts as Out of Market OOM calls thereby forcing the contract energy into the grid ahead of the supplemental energy bids in the balancing energy ex post BEEP market As one of our faithful observers told me The ISO will be billing some DRWCERS longterm contracts to SCs as OOM energy This has been confirmed by the ISO This means there is no realtime price transparency We may see an hourly expost price of say but this will bear no resemblance to the eventual RealTime settlement price There is no way to estimate what the OOM charge was as the ISO doesnt post that information The implication is that parties buying realtime energy will wait days before theyhave any idea of the price This sort of price uncertainty is completely contrary to the FERCs goals of creating open transparent markets Here is the

Mgmt Subject Revelation Steve Here is a summary of what we have learned regarding how the CAISO is handling Kent at Sierra Power inquired to me why he was being charged is the charge code the CAISO uses when it has to go out of market and purchase power that exceeds mwh is the charge code they use to credit it back for the same hours and intervals that both the INC and DEC prices were zero This was obviously very peculiar and nobody in VM knew the answer So Caroline posed the question to Keoni at the CAISO His response was this that the CAISO is charging regardless of the INC and DEC prices to cover the forward market contracts signed by CDWR and CERS In effect they are ignoring their tariff that states they are supposed to purchase power at the lowest price and are in effect trying to recover costs for CDWR and CERS Kit

Under its Tariff the CAISO was supposed to pay sellers for April deliveries on July Yet to date the CAISO has not paid sellers anything for April deliveries Enron and presumably other Market Participants had expected a higher level of payment for April sales following FERCs April Order which required the CAISO to have a creditworthy counterparty to back the CAISOs purchases from thirdparty suppliers FERCs April Order clarified that the CAISO is required to enforce CAISO Tariff provision with respect to all transactions Section requires each Scheduling Coordinator to maintain an acceptable form of financial security such as a letter of credit or an Approved Credit Rating as defined in the CAISO Tariff It is puzzling that the CAISO would continue to have such defaults if all Scheduling Coordinators are maintaining adequate collateral or Approved Credit Ratings Accordingly please confirm that all Scheduling Coordinators including the California Department of Water Resources CDWR and the California Energy Resources Scheduling CERS have posted financial security sufficient to back their purchases and commitments We also request that the CAISO provide a list of

Definitions Approved Credit Rating Today Keoni Alameda at the ISO informed Kit Blair in Settlements that CDWR hasnt posted any collateral because it is backed by the full faith and credit of the State of California I highly doubt that this is true because CDWRs power transactions have been separate from its functions as a water department ie CDWR vs CERS and all of the CDWR longterm contracts have made it very clear that the States power transactions are not backed by the FFC of California I am not sure how best to approach this problem but Credit and Legal would like for the ISO to formally acknowledge that its biggest debtor is not backed by any financial guarantees but that CDWRCERSs transactions are backed by the FFC of the State of California This would help clarify that the State is on the hook for power purchases and not just the CERS fund Absent this the ISO should require CDWR to post collateral as protection for other market participants against the risk of a default by CDWR

ISOs control room floor and the wealth of marketsensitive information available there Rep Doug Ose RCalif who chairs the committees energy policy panel said access to the ISOs control room allowed DWR traders to cherrypick power purchases and led federal regulators to exclude DWR purchases from consideration in a recent landmark refund order The five fired DWR traders owned stock in Calpine Corp

sold and to whom Church said Any kind of buyer or seller would give their eye teeth for that kind of access she said noting that no other grid operator in the country allows that sort of access Its just unconscionable for them to have that kind of access to market intelligence During the Aug hearing that Ose chaired Winter agreed that having DWR employees in the control room was a problem The

private traders in the early days of Californias powerbuying binge state officials turned to a technique called sleeving They used Lees old Long Beach firm Mieco Inc and Allegheny Power to camouflage the states identity as the buyer ChaosInexperience Hobbled Power Buyers State electricity purchasers often finished second against veteran industry traders By DARYL KELLEY and JEFFREY L RABIN Times Staff Writers August It was the night before the darkest day of the winter energy crisis when Californias first wave of rolling blackouts paralyzed cities from Bakersfield to Eureka Davis administration strategists were huddled in a Sacramento office that January evening trying to figure how to keep the lights on when a speeding tractortrailer slammed into the Capitol like a runaway train I looked out the window and saw the flames and the smoke rising said Ray Hart head of the energy planning team The symbolism was not lost on him The next day with the states electricity supply on the line and the governors political career on the blink Hart was called on to create an organization that overnight would become the biggest power buyer in the West purchasing electricity for million customers whose utilities were going broke Now seven months and billions of dollars later the administration is under fire for paying top dollar for a cadre of inexperienced traders who at times have been exploited by veterans in the cutthroat energy industry Even Gov Gray Davis acknowledges the mismatch Its like the Yankees playing a stickball team he said in a recent interview Were totally out of our league The administrations new longterm contracts also have been criticized for paying too much for power that may not be needed in the future Making matters worse nearly a dozen consultants hired by the administration owned stock in energy companiesa fact revealed only after they were belatedly asked to file personal financial statements Five were hastily fired and the federal government is investigating possible insider trading violations How an agency could forget conflictofinterest codes or ignore them is beyond me said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica This is the way people lose faith in government Hart said it never occurred to him that consultants and buyers in his vastly broadened organization should file declarations of financial interest until requests for the information rolled in including one from Davis Republican political rival Secretary of State Bill Jones Amid all the controversy of recent days Hart said the efforts of his staff in helping to avoid blackouts so far this summer have been overshadowed Frankly said Hart a veteran administrator with the state Department of Water Resources its kind of disconcerting we arent getting the credit we should be getting Patching Together a Team on the Fly The states new energybuying organization was a beg borrow and recruit operation A core group already was working in the Department of Water Resources to buy power for the massive canal pumps of the State Water Project The agency received an immediate infusion of million to create its expanded trading arm of employees and consultants On the fly Hart patched together a team of retired state energy buyers workers from a closed energy exchange and analysts from Pacific Gas Electric Southern California Edison and the energy industry Many were hired to buy electricity on the spot market after repeatedly calling power companies throughout the West to negotiate prices Then they needed to schedule its use on a statewide monitoring system that reflects supply and demand From the start the administration said it would pay higher wages than usual to attract talented traders who could hold their own against wily veterans at private energy marketing firms Energy trading and purchasing is a very complex business with millions of dollars of energy purchased every day a state budget document said It is important to recognize the level of risk and the high level of expertise that is necessary to effectively manage that risk and operate the program effectively Professionals in this business are highly compensated Power buyer William Mead was among the first to get the call in early February They said Can you be up here Tuesday said Mead a yearold former Edison engineer from Duarte I said For a job interview And they said No bring enough stuff for several months They told him to bring his last paycheck and a resume Mead said He worked six weeks he said before he finally got a contract to sign In those early days it was chaos because we were always at Stage on the verge of blackouts he said There was no focus other than to keep the lights on One day Mead said he bought of all power consumed on the states electricity grid during his hour shift But unlike Mead most of the new crew had never bought power before according to their resumes Most worked at the nowdefunct California Power Exchange an energy trading floor similar to a stock market reconciling sales and purchases made by others Before that one worked at a freightforwarding company in Carson and another ran China Noodle House in Arcadia Energy industry insiders said they have spotted a series of rookie moves by the new group Theyre just buying too much or buying too little or buying too much too fast said Mark Palmer spokesman for Houstonbased Enron Corp one of the nations largest energy marketers Its like someone who flies a kite one day and then is told to go fly a the next One veteran said the state traders lack the practiced subtlety that experience brings You dont just come out to someone and say Whats your price and then pay it But thats what some of them have done A senior analyst at a California firm that sells power to the state traders said The word I get from our traders is that a lot of them have made a lot of money off them Palmer said California for the salaries its paying could have done better A particular lightning rod for criticism is the twoyear contract of chief trader Susan T Lee who was hired in April for an hour With barely a years experience in the energy industry she leads a person crew that buys electricity the day before its needed or for nearly immediate use State records show that Lee was paid more than a month including overtime as she began her new duties That ladys got one years experience and shes getting grand Palmer said An experienced trader in private industry he said might make to in a good year plus bonuses Shes certainly making double what I am but shes worth it said Hart who has spent two decades as a bureaucrat at the onceobscure Department of Water Resources Although Lee could not be reached for comment Hart said her short tenure in the industry must be judged by the reality of todays evolving trading market California energy deregulation began only in and energy trading has changed enormously in just the last year he said I would argue that somebody who has been involved and engaged for the last year has as much value as anybody regardless of experience Lees team members meanwhile have been signed to lucrative shortterm contracts worth a maximum of to a month including housing rental cars per diem pay and flights home on days off State records show that many traders have actually received only about half that maximum amount One industry trading manager said he knew nearly all of the new state traders from their work at the Power Exchange He said several had applied to him for a job after the exchange closed in January but he didnt think they were qualified Some traders acknowledge feeling overmatched against veterans of the industry and have had to learn on the job how to compete They know more than me theyve seen it all said state trader Bernard Barretto a Navy electronics technician before he got a job at the Power Exchange in In their own defense the traders also said they had virtually no leverage in their early months because power reserves were so depleted that they had to buy no matter the cost Our job was to buy whatever we could buy former trader Elaine Griffin said California was truly a captive market Hart says the relative inexperience of his traders hardly matters because they follow strategies devised by higherups Do the traders go out and start the deal Yes Hart said Do they cut the final deal No Far from the trading trenches the governor sees things differently The trading arms of companies such as Enron far surpass that of the Department of Water Resources he said These are very sophisticated operations Davis said They have several meteorologists and banks of media people To protect taxpayer money from being devoured by these savvy private traders in the early days of Californias powerbuying binge state officials turned to a technique called sleeving They used Lees old Long Beach firm Mieco Inc and Allegheny Power to camouflage the states identity as the buyer The technique also allowed California to buy power from companies that had questioned whether the state would pay its bills Some traders however saw through the guise The volume of energy being bought on the market by Mieco and Allegheny was the tipoff that California had weighed in I knew it and Im pretty sure the rest of the traders out there know about it too said one trader who like others asked not to be named because he still trades power with the state But it worked for a while It helped keep the shortterm prices down Controversy Over Stock Holdings The state traders were powerless however to protect themselves Just as they were settling into their new jobs and energy prices were falling the administration was stung by the disclosures that of its traders and consultants owned energy stocks The governor ordered them to divest the holdings within hours or be fired Five were ousted anyway because they had previously bought power for the state from a firmSan Josebased Calpine Corpin which they had owned stock The highestranking of them was former Sacramento utility executive Richard Ferreira who was hired on a contract in January to negotiate longterm power contracts The four others were the veteran Mead and three younger buyers Herman Leung Constantine Louie and Peggy Cheng Elaine Griffin who had resigned just days before the firings also held Calpine stock while trading for the state Most of the traders who had worked together at the Power Exchange in Alhambra said they bought the stock before they went to work for the state and had never been warned that ownership was a problem They said no one asked if they even held any energy shares Mead said traders on his state teamsuch as Cheng Leung and Louiehad no ability to influence Calpines stock price because their purchases of the companys electricity were infrequent and small Mead said he had openly touted Calpine stock to his colleagues because hed made so much money on it He said his investments of in and last fall brought him about when he was ordered to sell last month You want to know how I picked Calpine he said Investors Business Daily has a system for selecting stocks and Calpine showed up on its list of stocks with strong potential Leung said he rarely dealt with Calpine and bought his worth of shares on Jan while still at the Power Exchange which had a conflictofinterest policy barring ownership of energy stock I didnt know I would have an opportunity like this at the time Leung said of his briefly held state job I bought it just because Im interested in the market all the time I follow it Today shipped back home from their rented apartments outside Sacramento the fired traders see themselves as victims of Davis effort to fend off further criticisms of his handling of the energy crisis They bristle at the fact that Davis has not required some of his most influential private advisors to file the kind of disclosure statements that led to their firings The big boys the ones hiding behind the right not to disclose those are the ones that ought to be drawing attention Mead said Theyre the ones who knew how things worked Times staff writer Nancy Vogel in Sacramento contributed to this story For information about reprinting this article go to rightsregisterhtm

San Jose Mercury News Western power grid has close call Delivery problem could have led to blackouts throughout region Stern warning issued to power generators who didnt deliver last week federal investigation urged BY JOHN WOOLFOLK mailto AND STEVE JOHNSON mailto Mercury News The Western power grid serving million people nearly collapsed a week ago when generators failed to deliver promised electricity a problem California officials warned Wednesday is occurring with alarming frequency Last Thursdays close call could have knocked out power in states and parts of Canada and Mexico causing the regions worst outages in five years Youre standing on the edge of a cliff when a generator fails to do what you order them to do said Jim Detmers vice president of grid operations at the California Independent System Operator Its not just California thats at risk Its the whole Western United States The dire warning comes as Californias energy crisis seems to be easing with not one of the predicted blackouts rolling across the state so far this summer The intricately balanced system came so close to failure last Thursday that an unexpected outage at just one generator anywhere in the region could have triggered blackouts Detmers said Airtraffic analogy Detmers likened the problem to airliners ignoring orders from the airtraffic control tower The ISO controls the California grid scheduling delivery of electricity much as control towers schedule airplanes for landings Its really no different than if a plane comes into San Francisco International Airport and doesnt follow the rules of the air traffic controller Detmers said We had a near miss on our system You had two planes getting very close Although the ISO has seen similar problems as far back as December last weeks event prompted grid managers to fire a stern warning late Wednesday to Californias power generators and to call for federal regulators to investigate The warning cited a growing pattern among market participants of untenable acts that include failure to comply with dispatch instructions Such system performance threatens the reliability of the Western Interconnection and cannot be tolerated the ISO report said Steve Maviglio spokesman for Gov Gray Davis said he hadnt been notified of the grid managers concerns but after being read language in the report said it was pretty strong stuff coming from the ISO Jan SmutnyJones a former ISO official who heads the Independent Energy Producers Association which represents generators said he was unaware of the reported problems but agreed the matter is a serious one The issue that the ISO is identifying here I cant recall ever seeing that before SmutnyJones said adding that it is crucial to get to the bottom of what the problem is and fix it quick System reliability is important to everybody he said Companies not named Grid officials would not name the companies involved or say whether they believe the problems resulted from confusion or attempts to manipulate the system to boost market prices The offenders were reported to federal regulators who will make that call Detmers said SmutnyJones said the problem may stem from lingering confusion among energy sellers over the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions June order extending price controls throughout the West I dont think anybody is deliberately trying to put the system in jeopardy SmutnyJones said There is some confusion and some controversy around Grid managers cited two recent examples of problems that are threatening the stability of the system In one case a generator scheduled far more power than it was capable of delivering and fell more than megawatts short A megawatt is enough to power some homes or more In another case a generator balked at an ISO order to deliver power needed to stabilize the system Because electricity must be used as it is produced the grid manager must precisely match power supply with demand throughout the day A mismatch can trigger circuit breakers throughout the system causing widespread blackouts The last major failure on the Western grid was on July when a tree growing too close to a highvoltage line in Idaho sparked outages across the region affecting million customers Managers goal Grid managers aim to keep the system running at a frequency of hertz It normally fluctuates between and hertz Detmers said Last Thursday it fell to hertz Blackouts can begin when it gets down to hertz he said Every loss of megawatts costs the system hertz he said A substantial drop in frequency can cause widespread outages that can take days to fix he said To maintain balance the ISO must keep supply and demand within megawatts Detmers said Last Thursday the system slipped more than megawatts out of balance for more than minutes and was as much as megawatts off Contact John Woolfolk at mailto or Embedded Picture Metafile Embedded Picture Metafile

the Nov and Dec Orders Hi Dave Of course the decision is politically motivated But arent they all Its just that now its our ox being gored In general review of agency decisions by courts is very deferential ie courts give agencies a lot of discretionwhich is why it is often difficult to overturn an agency decision But if a court concludes that the agencys action was arbitrary and capricious it may overturn the decision Our argument would be that FERC is acting arbitrarily in its most recent order because it has disregardedwithout explanationits earlier rulings in this case Its no slam dunk but its the best argument we have We will never win an argument in any court that FERC could have or should have crafted its order a certain way a court will almost always say the agency can fix the energy crisis in any way it deems fit However courts take a dim view of inconsistent agency decisions because it demonstrates a lack of Constitutional Due Process As for the publics opinion of Enron as a profiteerfor better or worse its already established And no matter what action we take Davis will cast a negative spin on it So why not fight for our interests The stakes in this order are worth it This recent order sets a bad precedent for the future viability of our business model power marketing its hard to run a business when the government can reach back in time and recalculate your selling price with complete disregard of your costs The generators get to offset refunds with input costs we should be able to use our purchased power costs I dont see much downside for us to argue that FERC should keep its word that refunds can only be ordered within days and all sellers are entitled to marginal costs We are just holding the Commission to its promise At a minimum the

Most Recent Refund Order and the Nov and Dec Orders The FERC apparently has a very short memory In its Dec Order FERC clarified that liability for refunds would only last for days after the transaction was filed with FERC How can FERC now say that transactions from Nov through April are subject to refund The Dec Order said that only transactions that were identified by Commission staff for further review would be subject to continued refund liability Otherwise refund potential for transactions over MWh would close after days Presumably liability for transactions under MWh would close after days too Here is the excerpt from the Dec Order We clarify that unless the Commission issues some form of notification to a seller that its transaction is still under review refund potential on a particular transaction will close days after the initial report is filed with the Commission The institution of a day period for the review of the transactions will provide sellers with the certainty they request and allows a reasonable period for analysis by staff Dec Order at In its Nov Order FERC said that it would limit refund liability to sellers marginal costs or legitimate and verifiable opportunity costs FERC now says that marketers cannot use their purchased power costsmuch less opportunity coststo offset potential refunds From the Nov Order However should we find it necessary to order refunds we will limit refund liability to no lower than the sellers marginal costs or legitimate and verifiable opportunity costs Nov Order at FERCs July Order makes no attempt to

the ISO Sempras trading unit generates a windfall By Craig D Rose STAFF WRITER July Sempra Energy the parent company of SDGE reported a percent surge in profit to million last quarter but said yesterday it lost money on the sale of electricity under a longterm contract to California On the other hand Sempra said its largest source of profits was its energy trading unit a middleman that earned million during the quarter buying and selling energy produced by others The results underscore the transformation of relatively simple utility companies into diversified energy holding companies that have learned to profit in new ways from the deregulation of electricity and the turmoil in energy markets The surprising announcement that a company lost money selling power during Californias runup in electricity prices was explained by Sempra as an intentional consequence of the longterm contract it signed with the state to provide power Stephen Baum chairman and chief executive officer of Sempra said the company agreed to provide a steep discount to California during the summer months but would recoup the losses later in the year deal California sought longterm electricity purchase contracts so it could reduce its purchases in daily and nearterm power markets where prices reached record levels Critics say Gov Gray Davis rushed into longterm deals because of concerns about getting through next years election They also say the contracts will saddle customers with higher costs for years The governor has acknowledged that longterm contracts might cause consumers to pay relatively high prices for electricity in later years but he maintains it is a fair price to pay for lowering prices that were devastating the state economy Michael Shames executive director of the Utility Consumers Action Network in San Diego said the steep discount Sempra provided to the state on power this summer raised questions about the governors proposal to help San Diego Gas Electric Co clear a debt of million SDGE says it is owed that money for power purchases on behalf of its customers In a media conference last month Davis said the agreement would eliminate the threat of a possible balloon payment for consumers who he said might have faced the socalled balancing account debt as early as next year Shames says the proposal which took the form of a memorandum of understanding or MOU is costly for consumers and a bonanza for Sempra He said the relatively cheap power provided by Sempra this summer makes the MOU sound like more of a hidden payback to Sempra than a real relief plan for local ratepayers Shames said he will release an analysis of the states Sempra plan next week The state Public Utilities Commission is expected to rule on the plan in August A Sempra spokesman said there is no connection between discount power and the tentative agreement to clear the million debt Doug Kline the Sempra spokesman said the power contract with the state was signed in early May and the agreement on the balancing account was reached in midJune Sempra Energy Trading meanwhile said only percent of its million profit was earned from sales of energy in the western region which includes California The trading operation earned million in profit during the comparable period last year Californias Independent System Operator which manages most of the state power grid and other investigators have said trading and bidding strategies were tools used by energy companies to raise prices during the California power crisis Though Sempra earned money on trading its wholesale power generating business lost million during the quarter Baum said the discounts on electricity provided the state were the prime cause of the loss for Sempra Energy Resources but added that a plant outage also contributed Sempra Energy Resources which coowns a generating plant near Las Vegas with Reliant Energy earned million during the second quarter last year Baum added that Sempras longterm contract with the state under which it will provide up to megawatts has allowed its wholesale business to presell about half the power it expects to generate from the Nevada plant which will be expanded and three generating facilities it expects to build Profits at SDGE slipped to million during the quarter ended June down from million last year according to Sempra SDGE whose business is restricted to delivering gas and electricity said it provided increased customer service during the crisis which lowered profits Wall Street analysts generally applauded Sempras results

Higher Prices Power CalISO study says suppliers continued to charge as much as five times more than the imposed limits By NANCY VOGEL TIMES STAFF WRITER July SACRAMENTO After federal regulators limited wholesale electricity prices last month big private sellers of power in California continued to ask as much as five times more for electricity than the federal cap according to a confidential study by state grid operators The analysis by the California Independent System Operator covers only the first week after the caps were imposed June CalISO has submitted the data to federal regulators for potential investigation The report is a summary of what CalISO calls possible anticompetitive behavior by Duke Energy Williams Cos Mirant Corp Reliant Energy and Dynegy Corp In a truly competitive market we would expect these suppliers to bid very close to their actual operating cost said Greg Cook senior policy analyst with CalISOs Department of Market Analysis The state did not necessarily purchase any power at the high prices being demanded Instead the significance of the bids is that they show how California could find itself paying exorbitant prices for electricity again if hot weather returns and conservation slackens said Frank Wolak a Stanford University economist who studies the California electricity market The bottom line is that the generators are putting out these bids in expectation of high demand he said If weather all of a sudden gets really hot from Southern to Northern California the bids submitted by generators could be very costly to California CalISO calculated the cost of production for each company based on the efficiency of its power plants and estimates of what each paid for natural gas to fuel the plants The average cost for the five was per megawatthour which closely matches the federal price limit in California which now stands at per megawatthour According to the power bidding procedures companies that bid at or below their cost of production often still get paid a higher price allowing them to make a substantial profit On average four of the five companies submitted bids either slightly below or slightly above their cost of production But with the exception of Atlantabased Mirant each company at times submitted bids that were substantially higher Houstonbased Reliant for example bid as much as per megawatthour more than five times its estimated cost Overall Reliants average bid was close to costs according to the analysis CalISO identified companies by code in its report Sources familiar with the study identified the companies for The Times The CalISO report singled out Supplier identified by sources as Charlotte NCbased Duke Energy saying the company continues to bid significantly in excess of its operating costs Duke owns two large power plants on the central coast It marked up its bids an average of beyond its cost to produce electricity according to the analysis For example it cost Duke to to generate a megawatthour of electricity in the time period studied the report shows but the company offered to sell a megawatthour from to Duke spokesman Tom Williams on Thursday said The use of the data in some cases doesnt appear to add up and in all cases appears to be selective and could easily be misunderstood Duke sells nearly the entire output of its power plants under longterm contracts and not on the spot market which the CalISO report studied he noted Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley said Were looking at the data and we question whether or not it is correct A combination of cool weather heavy conservation the startup of new power plants and recently signed longterm power contracts that guarantee supplies have eased the states electricity crisis in recent weeks Market prices that as recently as May averaged per megawatthour have dropped to less than per megawatthour The more abundant power supplies have freed grid operators to ignore higherpriced bids But they will have to consider paying such prices to avoid blackouts if supplies tighten Wolak said Such a scenario would test the effectiveness of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission order issued June he said The bids of the five companies analyzed were offers of sales to CalISO a Folsombased agency that manages the electrical transmission grid serving of California CalISO buys power on short notice to smooth the flow on the states electrical freeway and avert blackouts As Californias fledgling market began to go haywire last fall CalISO workers struggled to purchase as much as of the states power demand with just hours to spare Since then the market has stabilized and CalISOs purchases now amount to roughly of the electricity California consumes RELATED STORY Power profits Power plant operator

NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow JonesThree former employees who last week told California lawmakers Duke Energy DUK investmentsquotessymbolDUK news investmentsnewssymbolDUK msgs investmentsdiscusssymbolDUK ramped down its South Bay power plant when supplies were tight filed a total of complaints while they were still working at the plant including allegations of harassment and racial discrimination the men told Dow Jones Newswires Most of the grievances were filed between and against the plants previous owner Sempra Energy SRE investmentsquotessymbolSRE news investmentsnewssymbolSRE msgs investmentsdiscusssymbolSRE unit San Diego Gas Electric for which the men continued to work while Duke controlled the plant But interviews with the three men also revealed a dissatisfaction with Dukes profitcentered management style in the deregulated market Duke has called the employees allegations about its operating procedures baseless Duke has said the employees have an ax to grind because they werent hired by the company in April when escrow on the power plant closed and Duke acquired some of SDGEs workforce The men are the first to come forward publicly and testify against their employers who are locked in a highstakes struggle with the state of California over allegations of price gouging The state is pursuing billions of dollars in refunds from power producers and hopes to bring criminal charges against their executives Glenn Johnson a mechanic at the South Bay power plant alone filed complaints On one occasion Johnson said he called the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health because an unqualified employee was found scraping up asbestos He also has a harassment complaint against SDGE regarding an employee who now works for Duke but Johnson said his lawyer told him not to discuss it Aside from the formal complaints Johnson said under the Duke regime he was disciplined for taking too much sick time after being out for months for cancer treatment This is just the kind of abuse we had to endure ever since this became a business he said One of the other employees Jim Olkjer a former assistant control room operator at the power plant filed three complaints against SDGE while Duke operated the plant because his evaluations consistently said he needed supervision The grievances were either turned down or settled he said Olkjer said he decided to testify against Duke after he learned he wouldnt be hired by the energy company when it took over plant operations in April Im on a fixed income now Olkjer said in an interview I cant afford my utility bills on a fixed income The third employee Ed Edwards a certified power plant mechanic said he filed one complaint against three SDGE employees in for racial discrimination One of the employees was hired by Duke That case is still pending Edwards an AfricanAmerican said Duke didnt hire qualified minority employees after it took over the plant and instead hired lessqualified white employees Edwards said the two minority supervisors that worked at the plant under SDGE were replaced with white employees when Duke took over Edwards who stopped working at the plant in February said he decided to testify against Duke after receiving a phone call from Johnson I knew I wouldnt be hired he said Edwards and Johnson filed charges of harassment and racial discrimination against SDGE with the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission SDGE spokesman Art Larson wouldnt comment on the allegations Duke spokesman Tom Williams said the company stands by its hiring practices and always hires the most qualified employees In Duke settled a discrimination claim with the US Department of Labor for in which the department found some areas where white females and black males were paid less than white male and black female counterparts in similar positions Dissatisfaction With New Priorities The former employees said they werent motivated to blow the whistle on Duke by the prospects of cashing in on a possible settlement with the state Johnson first alerted the media about Dukes behavior before state Attorney General Bill Lockyer mentioned financial rewards for whistleblowers The employees each earned about a week All three employees said they believe Duke mismanaged the South Bay power plant by ramping the units up and down tossing out spare parts and operating machinery when it was broken Olkjer said he saw the plants output reduced during the worst power emergencies at least times When Edwards questioned his supervisors about the behavior he said they told him Its none of your business The employees said that Duke was more concerned with making money than the happiness of its staff and that the company tried to bust its union contract when it first took over the plant I was paid to twist wrenches Johnson said The last raise I got two years ago was Thats an insult to my skill Duke said it is bringing the former SDGE employees under its contract with International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local The workers were previously represented by another local and Duke wanted a single contract Johnson said he decided to blow the whistle on Duke because he was disgusted by the companys gluttony and greed He said he stole the control room logs in February after a colleague pointed out to him that Duke was reducing output at the plant Johnson Edwards and Olkjer said in the old days the power plant ran at full throttle and never ramped up or down But as soon as deregulation became law in the state things started to change SDGE would also vary the plants output but not as dramatically as Duke did they said To the best of my recollection we had years of being extremely reliable and being on line all the time Edwards said Once Duke took the reins that changed We were no longer a family Duke has said that it adjusted the plants output to meet its contractual commitments and to respond to the directions of the California Independent System Operator manager of the states power grid The ISO frequently directed plants to ramp output up and down to meet changing requirements on the grid and the employees who testified werent in a position to know the whole picture said Bill Hall vice president of Dukes western operations Duke spokesman Tom Williams said the company plans to release data showing the ISO ordered the plant to ramp up and down Jan the period cited from the controlroom logs to keep supply in balance A copy of the ISO controlroom logs obtained by Dow Jones Newswires shows that the ISO did make such orders

Stanley now controls about onethird of the Southern Interties total northbound capacity or about megawatts until February Then its share drops to just over megawatts until March sch Wall Street joins the energy players By Les Blumenthal Bee Washington Bureau Published June WASHINGTON Wall Streets interest in the West Coast electricity crisis extends far beyond trading energy futures in some Manhattan skyscraper or arranging financing for muchneeded generating plants Morgan Stanley which earned more than billion last year has quietly purchased a major share of one of the Bonneville Power Administrations huge transmission lines that link California with the Pacific Northwest The million deal caught Bonneville off guard and has sparked concern among regional utility executives and lawmakers on Capitol Hill Morgan Stanley officials said they would use their capacity on the socalled intertie to ship power purchased in the Southwest for sale to utilities in Washington state and Oregon Although most of the attention in the Western power crisis has focused on major energy companies from Texas and other Southern states Morgan Stanley ranks among the largest power marketers in the nation according to reports filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Morgan Stanley registered as a power marketer with federal regulators in the first Wall Street firm to take such a step Merrill Lynch also is registered with the commission Wall Street firms have long played a role in the trading of commodities including energy said Judy Hitchen a Morgan Stanley spokeswoman in New York But many in the utility industry said they hadnt realized Morgan Stanley was buying and selling electricity for actual sale and not just engaging in electronic trading I wasnt aware of it Mark Crisson superintendent of Tacoma Power said of Morgan Stanleys purchase of capacity on the intertie It shows how things are changing And in Congress Rep Peter DeFazio DOre said Morgan Stanleys direct involvement in West Coast electricity markets wasnt all that surprising Its wonderfully lucrative for a few folks DeFazio said This is the big new game Its the new world of deregulated energy Bonneville has four major transmission lines linking California and the Northwest capable of carrying enough electricity to power almost seven cities the size of Seattle The lines were built by the federal government are operated by the transmission arm of BPA and soon may be turned over to an independent operator to quiet utility fears that Bonneville could hog the regions power grid Morgan Stanley now controls about onethird of the lines total northbound capacity or about megawatts until February Then its share drops to just over megawatts until March BPA and several other utilities own the rest of the capacity They sent us a fax telling us they wanted to buy capacity on such and such a date and ending on such and such a date said Shepard Buchanan a spokesman for BPAs transmission side No one had ever made a longterm purchase of that transmission path before It had never come up before Under federal regulation BPA had no choice but to accept the Morgan Stanley bid The transmission lines act like huge spigots that can be turned off and on depending on demand Though federal regulations prohibit manipulating the lines for profit theoretically the company that controls the spigot has a huge say in the market Buchanan said Bonneville would be keeping a close watch on Morgan Stanley We are concerned he said We dont want anyone gaming the market by controlling the transmission system We will keep a close eye on Morgan Stanley and others Although not a secret the deal was finalized in early January and since then has been accompanied by little public notice We purchase transmission capacity from time to time to help us meet our delivery obligations Hitchen said in response to written questions Morgan Stanleys Internet site and annual report make only passing mention of its power marketing Commodity trading revenues rose percent to a record level in fiscal primarily driven by higher revenues from certain energyrelated products including electricity natural gas and crude oil the companys annual report said Increases in energy prices were primarily attributable to strong demand for energy products relatively low inventory and reduced production values Morgan Stanley officials are quick to deny they have any intent to manipulate the market saying that though it may be required to sell any capacity on the intertie it doesnt use to other power marketers federal regulations prohibit it from making a profit on such sales We have also offered capacity for resale to third parties Hitchen said Others remain skeptical Bonnevilles powermarketing arm also has expressed unease with the Morgan Stanley contract Bonneville sells about percent of the wholesale electricity in the Northwest most of it lowcost hydropower generated at the federal dams on the Columbia and Snake rivers It also controls about percent of the regions electric transmission grid Crisson said he also was concerned about a possible conflict of interest because Morgan Stanley and other Wall Street firms help arrange financing for new generating plants It doesnt surprise me a lot that they are marketing power he said They are capitalists But they need to be careful because they underwrite debt equity for utilities

to be a crook there wouldnt be a municipal bond market Energy crisis back on front burner Staffers stocks rekindle political heat and may jeopardize power contracts August By JOHN HOWARD and JAMES B KELLEHER The Orange County Register Just when California seemed to be crawling out from under the wreckage of its yearold energy crisis the state finds itself embroiled in a new crisis In the past week more than half a dozen advisers to Gov Gray Davis including some hired at taxpayer expense specifically to buy power from generating companies admitted that they owned shares of generating companies or utilities Five were fired and one resigned One of the states top negotiators of longterm powerpurchase contracts consultant Vikram Budhraja is the subject of an inquiry by the US Securities and Exchange Commission He disclosed he profited from trading shares of Edison International parent of Southern California Edison during days when the state was negotiating energy contracts and buying electricity to keep the firm from bankruptcy These conflictofinterest revelations represent more than an embarrassment for the governor They also threaten to prolong a crisis that has already cost weary Californians as much as billion by some estimates easily the most expensive publicpolicy disaster in state history If the contracts are found to have been compromised by state negotiators who had conflicts of interest they could be nullified If that happens the state could find itself back where it was in January scrambling to find reliable inexpensive sources of power to stave off blackouts and avoid breaking the state budget Some in Sacramento would like nothing better than to undo the contracts which they say cost the state too much at billion over years The Legislature is dying to find a way out of those contracts said Peter Navarro a professor of economics at University of California Irvine If there is any possibility that the conflict of interest can nullify some or all of those then you will see some forward movement on this Navarro said Of course if the state does renegotiate the contracts it could wind up getting better prices Assemblyman Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek the author of Californias electricitypurchasing law ABX said there has been sentiment in the Legislature to renegotiate some contracts if possible I guess it would be too much to hope for to have the luck to have the ability to renegotiate or unwind some of the contracts he said adding that it was clear that under some contracts the prices were high However there are a lot of people like me who think the governor did exactly the right thing in these contracts by buying long which is what we instructed him to do in ABX he said The revelations come at an awkward time for the state Last week while the disclosures mounted state Treasurer Phil Angelides was on Wall Street trying to drum up interest in the billion bond sale intended to repay the state for the billion it has spent purchasing power for consumers so far this year But so far the disclosures dont seem to have raised more than an eyebrow or two on Wall Street What were interested in is are we going to get paid back said Mary Beth Syal a municipal bond portfolio manager at Payden Rygel a Los Angeles investment firm with expertise in fixed income As a bondholder you really dont care about conflicts of interest except if theres fraud Then it becomes an issue Anything else and it really doesnt have an impact Or as Zane Mann the editor of the California Municipal Bond Advisor put it If municipal bond investors didnt buy bonds every time some adviser turned out to be a crook there wouldnt be a municipal bond market The current crisis over conflicts of interest has its roots in January With power prices skyrocketing Southern California Edison defaulting on bond payments and energy producers threatening to push the states utilities into bankruptcy and stop selling electricity into California Davis declared an emergency putting the state in the electricitybuying business Davis tried to bring some expertise on board hurriedly hiring consultants buyers schedulers and others in what his spokesman Steve Maviglio concedes was a chaotic and desperate push Many qualified people had already been hired by powertrading companies leaving a small pool of candidates for the specialized tasks said Maviglio DWR was in an emergency situation and we hired the best people we could that were available he said The number of people in the energybuying business in California is limited This is not a job where you just put an ad in the classifieds There were not a lot of experienced traders in the field In the rush to bring staff on board and keep the lights on in the state however Davis and his team neglected to get many of the new hires to fill out personal financial disclosures required by Californias Political Reform Act Under that law state employees have days to disclose their financial interests and must update them yearly Then last month under prodding from Secretary of State Bill Jones who blasted Davis failure to ensure his energy advisers complied with the act disclosures started pouring in and revelations started pouring out Jones a Republican candidate for governor next year says at least some of the contracts may be at risk State Attorney General Bill Lockyer is reviewing the financialdisclosure statements of the DWRs energy consultants for conflicts of interest and potential prosecutions said Lockyer spokesman Nathan Barankin State law bars government employees from negotiating contracts with companies in which they have a financial interest It also says those contracts may be invalidated if conflicts existed but only if at least one of the parties to a contract requests it Then a court must rule whether there was a conflict and if it was of a magnitude to warrant nullifying the contract But the Davis administrations review of the contracts shows that none is imperiled Maviglio said Our understanding is that they are solid all of them he said Everything is being reviewed but at first glance they appear to be solid Others question whether Davis can review the contracts impartially since he hired the advisers who negotiated them and he trumpeted them as a key solution that helped bring down power prices and kept the state blackoutfree this summer Davis cant question the propriety of the contracts without questioning his own propriety Navarro said Maviglio has to circle the wagons Maviglio disclosed last week that he bought worth of shares of San Josebased generator Calpine Corp in June He sold it last week at a loss of about As the debate goes on in Sacramento investors on Wall Street seem keen only to learn more about the bond deals structure and timing The bond sale has been delayed from May until at least October and could be delayed further because of opposition by the states utilities to the way consumer rates would repay the bonds Angelides who believes the sale will take place by late October bragged last week that most of the uncertainties that forced the state to postpone the bond deal had cleared up thanks to conservation the states actions and some luck As a factual matter Angelides said costs and prices are down volatility is reduced through a combination of efforts everything from contracts to federal controls to return to production to conservation efforts The importance of this for the financing program and I want to stress this is that the level of volatility in the marketplace and with respect to DWR costs has been dramatically reduced which is important in terms of folks looking at the stability and certainty of the revenue flow going forward But if contracts are nullified some of that volatility could return DWR would be forced to make more purchases on the unpredictable spot market That could throw another wrench into the states plans to recover its powerbuying expenditures and return normalcy to the market Every time there is another layer of stench put on top of one of these contracts there is more risk perceived in Wall Street and more burden placed on taxpayers and ratepayers Navarro said State staffers and advisers posing conflictofinterest questions A rundown of known conflicts of interest actual and potential Five consultants at the Department of Water Resources William F Mead Richard Ferreira Peggy Cheng Herman Leung and Constantine Louie were fired after their disclosure statements filed under pressure six months late showed they negotiated state power purchases with companies whose stock they owned A sixth consultant who also had purchased stock Elaine Griffin resigned July to take another job The DWRs top attorney Susan Weber who had a role in advising the consultants was reassigned to another state job unrelated to energy She had no financial conflict Gov Gray Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio bought shares of Calpine Corp in June at a share Under pressure he sold it Thursday at a share Calpine a San Josebased power generator received about billion in electricity contracts with the state for the next years Two political consultants Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani whose firm has done work for Southern California Edison were hired by Davis and placed on the state payroll at a month Both left under pressure including a lawsuit by a taxpayers group and complaints that the governor used state funds to finance political work Senate leader John Burton DSan Francisco the author of energyrelated legislation including the creation of the states Public Power Authority has investments in El Paso Energy Co which he acquired last July and Exxon Mobil Corp Haliburton Co and Meeker Investments He also bought and sold between and worth

April Vikram Budhraja a former Edison executive has a million contract to negotiate longterm energy contracts for the state He bought and sold Edison and Dynegy stock during January when he was hired The Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing his transactions his lawyer said William Keese the chairman of the California Energy Commission which licenses power plants has purchased and sold energy stocks during his tenure on the commission The stocks were in managed portfolios not subject to his control Keese has asked the Fair Political Practices Commission to investigate Bruce G Willison a member of the states Electricity Oversight Board owns about in Enron stock Disclosing conflicts can be a convoluted process Public officials at every level of state and local government must reveal personal financial information Elected officials judges and highranking appointed officials must make the most comprehensive disclosures This includes interests in real property investments sources of personal income and outside employment including directorships and consulting contracts The reports are filed annually at the headquarters of the states Fair Political Practices Commission For other officials such as the employees of state and local governments it is up to each agency to set disclosure requirements following the policy set by the FPPC These reports are filed with the individual agency Not every person on the public payroll however is required to disclose personal financial information At the Department of Water Resources for example consultants who were hired to perform duties that are limited in scope are exempt A conflict of interest occurs when a public official uses his or her position to make decisions that result in personal financial gain Assets and income that could be affected by an officials actions must be disclosed and in many cases divested Officials cannot negotiate contracts with companies in which they have a financial interest If this happens the contracts could be subject to nullifcation The state attorney general or local prosecutors determine whether a conflict has occurred and whether a criminal prosecution is necessary The FPPC can investigate but not prosecute and can impose civil fines of up to per violation
