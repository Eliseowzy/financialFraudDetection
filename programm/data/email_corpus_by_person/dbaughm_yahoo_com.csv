Breaker Box To MIMEVersion ContentType multipartmixed boundarypartabdaboundary XMailer AOL for Windows sub ContentLength NEWS from CPSC US Consumer Product Safety Commission Office of Information and Public Affairs Washington DC FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE March Release Commission Closes Investigation Of FPE Circuit Breakers And Provides Safety Information For Consumers WASHINGTON DC The Consumer Product Safety Commission announced today that it is closing its two year investigation into Federal Pacific Electric Stablok type residential circuit breakers This action was taken because the data currently available to the Commission does not establish that the circuit breakers serious risk of injury to consumers The Commission investigation into Federal Pacific Electric FPE circuit breakers began in June when Reliance Electric Co a subsidiary of Exxon Corporation and the parent to FPE reported to the Commission that many FPE circuit breakers did not fully comply with Underwriters Laboratories Inc UL requirements Commission testing confirmed that these breakers fail certain UL calibration test requirements The Commission investigation focused primarily on pole residential circuit breakers manufactured before Reliance acquired FPE in To meet UL standards residential circuit breakers must pass a number of socalled calibration tests The purpose of these tests is to determine whether the circuit breakers will hold the current for which they are rated and also automatically open or trip shut off the current within specified time limits if overloading of the circuit causes current levels in excess of the breakers amperage rating Overloading can occur because a consumer plugs too many products into a circuit or due to the failure of a product or component connected to that circuit While the Commission is concerned about the failure of these FPE breakers to meet UL calibration requirements the Commission is unable at this time to link these failures to the development of a hazardous situation According to Reliance failures of these FPE breakers to comply with certain UL calibration requirements do not create a hazard in the household environment It is Reliances position that FPE breakers will trip reliably at most overload levels unless the breakers have been operated in a repetitive abusive manner that should not occur during residential use Reliance maintains that at those few overload levels where FPE breakers may fail to trip under realistic use conditions currents will be too low to generate hazardous temperatures in household wiring Reliance believes its position in this regard is supported by test data that it provided to the Commission The Commission staff believes that it currently has insufficient data to accept or refute Reliances position The Commission staff estimates that it would cost several million dollars to gather the data necessary to assess fully whether those circuit breakers which are installed in homes but which may fail UL calibration tests present a risk to the public Based on the Commissions limited budget million for fiscal year the known hazards the Commission has identified and must address involving products of other manufacturers and the uncertainty of the results of such a costly investigation the Commission has decided not to commit further resources to its investigation of FPEs circuit breakers However despite its decision to close this particular investigation the Commission will continue its investigation of circuit breakers generally The Commission can reopen its investigation of FPE circuit breakers if further information warrants The Commission advises consumers to take certain safety precautions with all circuit breakers and fuses Consumers should Know your electrical circuit Know which outlets and products are connected to each circuit Never overload any electrical circuit by connecting too many products to the circuit Be particularly careful not to connect several products that demand high current such as heating appliances to a low amperage circuit Comply with local building codes in wiring or adding electrical circuits Make sure the wiring and devices used in the circuit are connected to a circuit breaker or fuse of the proper size Immediately disconnect any electrical product if problems develop Have the product examined by a competent repair person Investigate to determine why a fuse blows or circuit breaker trips Do not simply replace the fuse or reset the breaker If a fuse blows or breaker trips it is often a warning that the circuit is overloaded Check the circuit for causes of overloading for example too many appliances plugged in a malfunctioning product a short circuit When in doubt consult a licensed electrician
