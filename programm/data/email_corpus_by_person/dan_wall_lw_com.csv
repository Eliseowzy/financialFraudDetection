Chronicle Soaring Electric Use More Fiction Than Fact Chronicle investigation finds power companies manipulate data to excuse their towering rates Christian Berthelsen Scott Winokur Chronicle Staff Writers mailto Sunday March San Francisco Chronicle chronicleinfocopyright URL cgibinarticlecgifilechroniclearchive MNDTL Power companies say it so often and with such certainty that it has become a virtual mantra Skyrocketing energy use by Californians is a root cause of the states power crisis and justification for surging electricity prices But a computer analysis of electricity usage data by The Chronicle reveals that the mantra is a myth that overall growth in electricity demand hasnt been nearly as great as the industry portrays it The industry has painted the summer of as the equivalent of a year storm in meteorology an event so powerful and unexpected that the existing infrastructure was devastated by its force The statistics show that taken in total was nothing of the sort Moreover two independent state agencies assessments of Californias power plant capacity appear to show that the growth should have been easily accommodated The companies have defended their practice of increasingly taking power generation plants out of service by arguing that heavy demand and consequent plant usage necessitated major timeconsuming repairs The claims that demand growth is rampant and that it was totally unexpected and due to the Internet economy to Silicon Valley or server farms or people recharging cell phones thats bogus said Tom Kelly assistant executive director of the California Energy Commission About as bogus as you can get The Chronicles findings are based on data collected by the California Independent System Operator a manager of the states electricity grid They show Total electricity consumption in California increased only percent in from a sharp contrast to claims of industry representatives who have repeatedly relied on isolated loose or selective comparisons that make growth appear as high as percent In fact the single greatest hour of electricity usage in was actually lower than any peak demand period in or Average peak demand the average of the highest hour of electricity usage for each day increased only percent from to Even during the months of May to September in when the greatest spikes in electricity usage occur demand growth was only percent higher than the same period the year before More than days of critical power shortage warnings socalled Stage emergencies and two days of blackouts this year occurred at times of moderate energy use levels often below those at which neither warnings nor blackouts have occurred in the past The findings appear to buttress suspicions that the skyrocketing demand explanation for rising energy prices is a cover for what is really happening that power companies have simply started charging more for an essential commodity regardless of whether it is in short supply Presented with The Chronicles findings Gary Ackerman a representative for the Western Power Trading Forum a trade group representing power companies said the calculations support the industry position that electricity demand is growing strong Thats pretty healthy growth for California as opposed to the longterm historical average which is close to percent he said To me thats really strong growth Energy demand is certainly on the rise in California growth of more than percent is still double what was projected and the state has obviously fallen behind in building power plants Even though a recent study found California ranked th out of the states in percapita energy consumption the surging demand explanation has become so accepted that leading officials accept it as gospel Gov Gray Davis has made energy conservation percent at that a centerpiece of his efforts to solve the crisis Energy use is growing said state Sen John Burton DSan Francisco citing the growth of Silicon Valley and hightech operations statewide Theres been tremendous growth whether manufacturing or high tech cell phones faxes whatever The stuff is growing Yet the energy industry has been steadfast in its insistence that the consumer is largely to blame In testimony and submissions to government bodies considering prescriptions for the crisis energy demand growth has consistently been overstated Joe Bob Perkins the chief operating officer of Houstonbased Reliant Energy Inc told the US Senate in January that Californias growing economy and high summer temperatures caused electricity use to surge dramatically a demand growth of percent Richard Wheatley a spokesman for Reliant said Perkins testimony was based on estimates by the federal Energy Information Administration of monthly retail electricity sales We do stand by that Wheatley said Unfortunately it does not track with ISO data The industrybacked Edison Electric Institute said in a report that electricity demand grew by anywhere from percent to percent during the spring of compared with the same period a year earlier Russell Tucker an economist for the institute said the groups figures were derived by identifying the single highest hour of electricity demand for each spring month of and and comparing them finding the May peak rose percent Granted the state Energy Commission uses the same model to determine whether California has enough plant capacity to meet demand But the presentation makes it appear that overall demand not just the absolute peak is growing by percent When the peak of each day is averaged and compared from year to year Mays figure was much lower percent Also nowhere did Edisons report note that the peak hour of a load of megawatts on Aug was actually lower than the peak hours of either of the previous two years on July or on Sept The Chronicle analysis of average peak demand showed that no month last year grew more than Junes percent though no blackouts occurred in that month May and June were the only months when demand growth exceeded percent the analysis showed Most months recorded percent or percent and some such as September were less than percent Two months October and December had demand levels lower than the year before percent less for October percent lower for December Mike Florio a consumer lawyer and board member of the ISO said that even growth of less than percent from to would seem overstated since was a relatively mild weather year and was a much hotter one You are quite right Florio said Skyrocketing demand is a myth MARKET MANIPULATION Consumer representatives and some politicians have long suspected that rather than dire imbalances between supply and demand market manipulation is behind the crisis Generators and power marketers adamantly deny this saying they have done everything they could to keep the lights on They say they ran aging decrepit plants at higherthannormal levels last summer to accommodate what they described as unprecedented demand They also say that at great expense they delayed muchneeded maintenance in order to keep the power flowing Their claims have received some support from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which said in a report last month that it found no evidence power companies were using maintenance schedules to manipulate supply The report however was heavily qualified by the FERC which said it did not investigate other forms of manipulation Moreover the agency acknowledged that the bulk of its investigation was conducted by simply calling power plants and questioning them over the telephone The supply side of the energy equation is harder to penetrate in part because supply data are confidential Thus the question of how blackouts could have occurred at such low levels of demand in January is hard to answer What is clear is that at times during the crisis this year as much as megawatts of electricity supply have been unavailable for use mostly because of unplanned plant outages about four times the level anticipated by the ISO Power companies say the old plants they bought were not capable of producing to the levels sketched out by the ISO and the Energy Commission and that everything from low water conditions emissions limitations and high temperatures last year caused less energy to be available than was anticipated But others suggest that what began as a shortage caused by a withholding of supply to drive up price has turned into one caused by withholdings out of fear of not being paid What did go up unquestionably were wholesale electricity prices While average electricity usage during the heaviest hours last year increased by less than percent prices charged by power companies to the utilities that deliver juice to consumers increased more than percent In June the cost of a megawatt hour increased more than fivefold going from the level of to In October prices doubled over the same period a year earlier going from to And in December despite a percent decline in electricity usage from the previous December peak wholesale electricity prices hit Theyd been one year before Then the pace of price increases began to accelerate within the last six months of Overall average peak usage during December was about megawatts about a fifth lower than it was in August Average prices in December They just about doubled to a megawatt hour The companies explanation for rising prices despite falling demand was that more and more plants had to be taken offline for repairs decreasing supply Even given the high number of inoperable plants questions remain about why the existing supply could not cover demand On the blackout days of Jan and fewer plants were offline and more electricity was available than on days when the state managed to squeeze by without turning out the lights Even today with Stage alerts having faded away at least temporarily demand levels remain more or less the same as when California was in a constant state of emergency Moreover the lists of offline plants are as long as ever AMPLE POWER SHOULD EXIST The Energy Commission and the ISO have concluded that Californias power plants are capable of generating more than megawatts of electricity That means that even with plant repair outages low water levels decreasing hydraulic generation airpollution rules and other environmental constraints the power companies should be able to accommodate all but the most extreme spikes in demand According to industry data obtained by The Chronicle the Western Systems Coordinating Council a governmentbacked trade group in Salt Lake City concluded California would have considerable surpluses throughout including margins as high as percent in December based on data provided to it by the ISO Even under low water conditions the ISO reported the state would have total power resources of megawatts in that month Yet unplanned outages were far higher and the system began to crash that month and into this year at far lower levels of demand Clearly Florio said we should not be having a shortage at am on Christmas Eve when the only person awake is Santa Claus This email may contain

a brief report on the relevant parts Notably the Lieff Cabreser duo of Bill Bernstein and Barry Himmelstein were there listening carefully The program consisted of the presentation of economic studies followed by comments from two discussants followed by audience questionscomments The following is a list of the papers and the discussants who presented with slides taken from the website of the UC Energy Institute uceiconforderpapershtml You can click on this to see the slides in PDF format The papers in green are not particularly relevant for our purposes and I wont say more about them beyond the note in brackets The presenters name is in bold Bidding Asymmetries in MultiUnit Auctions Implications of Bid Function Equilibria in the British Spot Market for Electricity by Greg Crawford Duke University Joe Crespo NERA and Helen Tauchen University of North Carolina Pricing and Firm Conduct in Californias Deregulated Electricity Market by Steve Puller UC Berkeley Discussion by Anjali Sheffrin California Independent System Operator Identification and Estimation of Cost Functions Using Observed Bid Data An Application to Electricity Markets by Frank Wolak Stanford University A paper about economic tools to study power markets Forward Contracts and the Curse of Market Power by Jeffrey Lien University of Maryland The Impact of Retail Rate Deregulation on Electricity Consumption in San Diego by James Bushnell and Erin Mansur UC Berkeley This looks at whether consumption declined with price increases Not much Consumption and Home Energy Costs How Prevalent is the Heat or Eat Decision by Julie Berry Cullen University of Michigan Leora Friedberg University of Virginia and Catherin Wolfram UC Berkeley A macro study on how consumers change overall spending patterns when they have to shell out more for power A Quantitative Analysis of Pricing Behavior in Californias Wholesale Electricity Market During Summer by Paul Joskow MIT and Edward Kahn Analysis Group Electricity Restructuring and the Cost of Pollution Reduction by Dallas Burtraw Karen Palmer Ranjit Bharvirkar and Anthony Paul Resources for the Future Before I discuss the specific papers and presenters one big picture point needs to be made There was an unchallenged consensus at this conference that the generators have exercised market power to the tune of billions of dollars The focus was on how and how much not whether The good news is that I heard no evidence supporting any collusion theory the thought was that generators are making independent output and pricing decisions knowing they could influence the market price given the auction rules and the completely inelastic demand On the other hand I would have to say that the economic work on the tacit collusion hypothesis in incomplete at best The bad news is that the scale of potential overcharges is pretty staggering billion The plaintiffs will be able to put together quite a damage study Crespo Bidding Asymmetries in UK This is a marginally relevant paper examining whether bidders in the UK electricity auction markets behaved in a leaderfollower mode ie asymmetrically Crespos model shows that in a uniform pricesetting auction with clearing price rules a price setter will emerge and take all prices above marginal cost Thus above marginal cost pricing does not require coordination Crespo from NERA appeared knowledgeable but is not an inspiring speaker His paper also got roughed up a bit in the audience questioning segment Puller Pricing and Firm Conduct in Californias Deregulated Electricity Market This is a very relevant paper as it tries to determine whether market power presumably exercised in California was static or dynamic meaning the product of individual firm decisionmaking static or tacit collusion dynamic The period studied was to Puller found evidence of static market power consistent with socalled Cournot pricing This theory posits that in an oligopoly firms will take their rivals observed priceoutput decisions as a given and decide how to maximize profitability given that behavior He then tried to determine whether any dynamic games were occurring meaning a game where firms recognize their interdependence and try to follow a supergame trigger strategy in which firms try to induce favorable responses from rivals Its quite complicated how he goes about this but fundamentally he tries to correlate observed output decisions with how a firm at that time might have expected a change in its behavior to affect its future share of the market With this methodology Puller finds what he called weak evidence of forwardlooking dynamic pricing for a brief time in but not otherwise My impression was that the evidence for was very weak and the logic used to arrive at this conclusion was also weak Puller then went at this a second time with a theory that attempts to determine what a firms supply function would look like if it was exercising static and dynamic market power and then comparing this to an estimate of that firms actual supply function I found this even more speculative than the first theory Nonetheless the results are basically the same evidence of static but not dynamic market power Puller took a lot of heat for the methodology of this paper during the questioning segment Hes not a dynamic speaker and does not appear to me to be a strong expert candidate Anjali Sheffrins commentary was very important She is the Director of Market Analysis for CAISO After general comments on Crespo and Puller she launched in to a discussion of whether their models explained the California experience This turned out to be a preview of the CAISO FERC filing of last week in which they allege billion in market powerrelated overcharges from May to Feb That filing and Sheffrins report follow They are essential reading pdfpdf pdfpdf Sheffrin maintains that it was the absence of imports during this period that left the market power of the California generators unchecked This permitted the instate generators to engage in either economic or physical withholding of power Economic withholding is bidding a higherthanneeded supply curve physical withholding is cutting output at the plant Her study was intended to Identify individual firms engaging in market power activity and Analyze how each firms actions set market clearing prices She utilized full bidding data in CA ISO real time market for each hour between May and Nov defined and categorized bidding patterns and identified economic or physical withholding and then calculated bidcost markup and a monopoly rent She found what she claimed was strong evidence of both types of withholding but that economic withholding is the dominant bidding pattern used by the five large California generators While Sheffrins study does not name names it claims that most of the five instate suppliers and many of the large importers displayed bidding patterns which were consistent with the exercise of market power Bernstein and Himmelstein were positively gleeful during this presentation On the question of collusion Sheffrins study is not terribly illuminating She maintains that the dominant bidding pattern is consistent with two characteristics of a supply function equilibrium model of oligopolist pricing I take that to mean Cournot which is a static noncollusive model However when you read her study youll see the picture is not entirely clear Lien The Curse of Market Power This is only marginally relevant for us as its thesis is that forwardlooking supply contracts are better for both producers and society Everyone seemed to agree and were confused why we needed a paper to prove it Lien U Md is young and not expert material Joskow and Kahn peoplepjoskowJKPaperREVISEDpdf paper uceiconfSlidesKahnSlidespdf Kahns slides Im sure many of you have already read this everyone should Prepared for SoCal Edison it contends that instate generators Reliant Dynegy AESWilliams and SouthernMirant exercised market power by withholding capacity during the summer or JK use publicly available data on loads market prices and generation to a quantify combined effects of market fundamentals on market prices b calculate price gap difference between actual prices and competitive market benchmarks c account for quantify effects of ISOs ancillary services requirements and forced outages and then d calculate the output gap for high priced hours meaning the difference between observed and maximum profitable levels of generation They conclude that prices were far in excess of the competitive benchmark and that the instate generators could have produced more power at competitive prices but chose not to Hence market power was exercised Kahn the Analysis Group economist who presented is a very colorful and rather undisciplined advocate of his position He threw around allegations of conspiracy rather casually but mostly to be funny I couldnt tell whether he believed his study proved that I dont think it even speaks to it But Bernstein and Himmelstein applauded him when he finished grinning ear to ear Severin Borenstein UC Berkeley and the conference director was supposed to comment on JK but hardly did He said that the generators would have been stupid not to exercise market power given the supplydemand conditions and the market rules and argued that permitting long term contracts and requiring realtime residential pricing were the solutions to all of this Borenstein was the best expert material I saw at this conference and the fact he took a pass on the details of the JK paper is puzzling to me It made me wonder whether he already has a horse in this race or perhaps is trying to stay above it all Hope
