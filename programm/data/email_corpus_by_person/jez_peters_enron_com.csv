Mcclellan George Staley Stuart Shankman Jeffrey A Kitchen Louise Subject RE Bengalla Biz Jez our concerns are not just an internal approval issue Under Australian Law the Directors of ECAPPL need to be satisfied when a company incurs a debt that it can be paid Failure to discharge this duty can mean the directors would be personally for the debt If the Coal Group is comfortable to make to enter into these commitments then that is the obvious way forward One of the Coal Group in the Sydney office presumably Paul McPhee could replace Heidi Mason as resident director Original Message From

Kitchen Louise Subject RE Bengalla Biz We seem to be going round in circles here and hence hopefully all the relevant people are now on copy of this email so we can resolve swiftly This cargo is due to be shipped in seven days with the coal already being railed to port It is coal which will be shipped to service European commitments and represents the cheapest way to do so taking all costs into account including financing Needless to say if we pull out of this deal at this stage it will have huge ramifications with our customer and send all the wrong signals to our counterparties in this part of the world Last but not least we will need to look elsewhere to procure coal for these European sales at what is likely to be a higher price Appreciate the green light Thks Jez Original Message
