WEATHER CLIMATE TO ECONOMY Data Show Effect of Climate Conditions on Corn and Soybean Yield and Residential Energy Needs October NOAA today unveiled two new indices that evaluate the effect of climate conditions on corn and soybean yield and on residential energy needs The development of the indices is part of NOAAs Environomics program oaclimateresearchenvironomicsenvironomicshtml an effort to better understand the impact of weather and climate on socioeconomic sectors of the nation The indices were developed by NOAAs National Climatic Data Center oancdchtml in Asheville NC which maintains the worlds largest weather database Click NOAA image for larger view of standardized temperature index for Sept Anecdotal statements about the weather are often used to explain variations in economic activity and these statements are often based on perceptions about the weather that may or may not be valid Through NOAAs Environomics program relationships between the nations climate and vital economic sectors of the nation are clearly defined using climate indices which enhance the understanding of how yeartoyear variations and trends in weather and climate affect associated sectors Thomas Karl oaaboutwelcomefromdirectorhtml director of NOAAs National Climatic Data Center said Climate indices developed through the Environomics program provide quantitative information regarding climates influence while providing historical perspective on how weather and climate conditions affecting our economy and society today compare with conditions of the past The period of high energy demand and prices of the late s coincided with extremely cold winters that contributed to higher residential energy usage The Residential Energy Demand Temperature Index REDTI which provides information related to climate sensitive residential energy demand reflects this increased demand through historically high index values and can be used in part to explain the cause of the historically high energy demand of that time By providing continuing updates to the index a clearer understanding of future fluctuations in energy demand will be possible The REDTI tracks both unusually hot and unusually cold conditions It varies from year to year due to variability and trends in temperature and it responds most strongly to temperature conditions in heavily populated regions REDTI values range from to Values greater than indicate a much above average temperaturerelated energy demand and values less than reflect much below average conditions The REDTI for the AprilSeptember season was indicative of slightly below average residential energy demand for cooling and heating Based on the year record the populationweighted REDTI value of ranks as the th lowest value The nations warm season AprilSeptember ranked as the fourth warmest such period since the first year of complete climate records The preliminary national average temperature was F C which was F C above the longterm mean Although the areaweighted national temperature gave the season a rank of fourth warmest on record the persistence of average to cooler than average temperatures in some of the most heavily populated regions of the US contributed to a REDTI that was below average Energy usage statistics for will be available from the Department of Energys Energy Information Administration in While the REDTI provides information on the impacts of temperature on energy demand the Moisture Stress Index MSI was developed to quantify the effect of soil moisture conditions on crop yield It provides historical perspective on conditions such as moisture stress that are closely associated with corn and soybean yields and is a source of information for explaining the cause of lower national yields The MSI ranges from zero to and specifically measures the proportion of the nations corn or soybeans affected by severe to catastrophic drought or catastrophic wetness Values near zero indicate that few productive corn or soybean growing areas were affected by severe drought or catastrophic wetness This index reflects conditions during July and August and is weighted by the mean annual crop productivity within climate divisions in the contiguous US Although a number of factors affect the success of a single crop growing season drought or excessive wetness during critical phases of crop growth have a significant impact on the nations corn and soybean yield Although warmer than average temperatures coincided with drought in some parts of the country during the warm season months of conditions in the heart of the major corn and soybean crop growing regions were generally normal to wetter than normal The corn MSI for the crop growing season was eight and the soybeans MSI was seven This means that severe to catastrophic drought or catastrophic wetness affected only percent and percent of the nations corn and soybeans respectively Both index values were below average and reflect favorable soil moisture throughout a large part of the crop growing regions during July and August the reproductive season The MSI for corn exceeded during the droughtplagued growing seasons of and and during the catastrophically wet summer of years in which corn yields were less than percent of the yield The growing season MaySeptember followed several years in which national corn and soybean yields were generally high according to the US Department of Agriculture The low values of this years corn and soybean MSI indicate that conditions associated with this index were again favorable for good corn and soybean yields National crop yields for will be available from the United States Department of Agriculture following the harvest season NOAA is dedicated to enhancing economic security and national safety through the prediction and research of weather and climaterelated events and providing environmental stewardship of our nations coastal and marine resources

WEATHER CLIMATE TO ECONOMY Data Show Effect of Climate Conditions on Corn and Soybean Yield and Residential Energy Needs October NOAA today unveiled two new indices that evaluate the effect of climate conditions on corn and soybean yield and on residential energy needs The development of the indices is part of NOAAs Environomics program oaclimateresearchenvironomicsenvironomicshtml an effort to better understand the impact of weather and climate on socioeconomic sectors of the nation The indices were developed by NOAAs National Climatic Data Center oancdchtml in Asheville NC which maintains the worlds largest weather database Click NOAA image for larger view of standardized temperature index for Sept Anecdotal statements about the weather are often used to explain variations in economic activity and these statements are often based on perceptions about the weather that may or may not be valid Through NOAAs Environomics program relationships between the nations climate and vital economic sectors of the nation are clearly defined using climate indices which enhance the understanding of how yeartoyear variations and trends in weather and climate affect associated sectors Thomas Karl oaaboutwelcomefromdirectorhtml director of NOAAs National Climatic Data Center said Climate indices developed through the Environomics program provide quantitative information regarding climates influence while providing historical perspective on how weather and climate conditions affecting our economy and society today compare with conditions of the past The period of high energy demand and prices of the late s coincided with extremely cold winters that contributed to higher residential energy usage The Residential Energy Demand Temperature Index REDTI which provides information related to climate sensitive residential energy demand reflects this increased demand through historically high index values and can be used in part to explain the cause of the historically high energy demand of that time By providing continuing updates to the index a clearer understanding of future fluctuations in energy demand will be possible The REDTI tracks both unusually hot and unusually cold conditions It varies from year to year due to variability and trends in temperature and it responds most strongly to temperature conditions in heavily populated regions REDTI values range from to Values greater than indicate a much above average temperaturerelated energy demand and values less than reflect much below average conditions The REDTI for the AprilSeptember season was indicative of slightly below average residential energy demand for cooling and heating Based on the year record the populationweighted REDTI value of ranks as the th lowest value The nations warm season AprilSeptember ranked as the fourth warmest such period since the first year of complete climate records The preliminary national average temperature was F C which was F C above the longterm mean Although the areaweighted national temperature gave the season a rank of fourth warmest on record the persistence of average to cooler than average temperatures in some of the most heavily populated regions of the US contributed to a REDTI that was below average Energy usage statistics for will be available from the Department of Energys Energy Information Administration in While the REDTI provides information on the impacts of temperature on energy demand the Moisture Stress Index MSI was developed to quantify the effect of soil moisture conditions on crop yield It provides historical perspective on conditions such as moisture stress that are closely associated with corn and soybean yields and is a source of information for explaining the cause of lower national yields The MSI ranges from zero to and specifically measures the proportion of the nations corn or soybeans affected by severe to catastrophic drought or catastrophic wetness Values near zero indicate that few productive corn or soybean growing areas were affected by severe drought or catastrophic wetness This index reflects conditions during July and August and is weighted by the mean annual crop productivity within climate divisions in the contiguous US Although a number of factors affect the success of a single crop growing season drought or excessive wetness during critical phases of crop growth have a significant impact on the nations corn and soybean yield Although warmer than average temperatures coincided with drought in some parts of the country during the warm season months of conditions in the heart of the major corn and soybean crop growing regions were generally normal to wetter than normal The corn MSI for the crop growing season was eight and the soybeans MSI was seven This means that severe to catastrophic drought or catastrophic wetness affected only percent and percent of the nations corn and soybeans respectively Both index values were below average and reflect favorable soil moisture throughout a large part of the crop growing regions during July and August the reproductive season The MSI for corn exceeded during the droughtplagued growing seasons of and and during the catastrophically wet summer of years in which corn yields were less than percent of the yield The growing season MaySeptember followed several years in which national corn and soybean yields were generally high according to the US Department of Agriculture The low values of this years corn and soybean MSI indicate that conditions associated with this index were again favorable for good corn and soybean yields National crop yields for will be available from the United States Department of Agriculture following the harvest season NOAA is dedicated to enhancing economic security and national safety through the prediction and research of weather and climaterelated events and providing environmental stewardship of our nations coastal and marine resources

WEATHER CLIMATE TO ECONOMY Data Show Effect of Climate Conditions on Corn and Soybean Yield and Residential Energy Needs October NOAA today unveiled two new indices that evaluate the effect of climate conditions on corn and soybean yield and on residential energy needs The development of the indices is part of NOAAs Environomics program oaclimateresearchenvironomicsenvironomicshtml an effort to better understand the impact of weather and climate on socioeconomic sectors of the nation The indices were developed by NOAAs National Climatic Data Center oancdchtml in Asheville NC which maintains the worlds largest weather database Click NOAA image for larger view of standardized temperature index for Sept Anecdotal statements about the weather are often used to explain variations in economic activity and these statements are often based on perceptions about the weather that may or may not be valid Through NOAAs Environomics program relationships between the nations climate and vital economic sectors of the nation are clearly defined using climate indices which enhance the understanding of how yeartoyear variations and trends in weather and climate affect associated sectors Thomas Karl oaaboutwelcomefromdirectorhtml director of NOAAs National Climatic Data Center said Climate indices developed through the Environomics program provide quantitative information regarding climates influence while providing historical perspective on how weather and climate conditions affecting our economy and society today compare with conditions of the past The period of high energy demand and prices of the late s coincided with extremely cold winters that contributed to higher residential energy usage The Residential Energy Demand Temperature Index REDTI which provides information related to climate sensitive residential energy demand reflects this increased demand through historically high index values and can be used in part to explain the cause of the historically high energy demand of that time By providing continuing updates to the index a clearer understanding of future fluctuations in energy demand will be possible The REDTI tracks both unusually hot and unusually cold conditions It varies from year to year due to variability and trends in temperature and it responds most strongly to temperature conditions in heavily populated regions REDTI values range from to Values greater than indicate a much above average temperaturerelated energy demand and values less than reflect much below average conditions The REDTI for the AprilSeptember season was indicative of slightly below average residential energy demand for cooling and heating Based on the year record the populationweighted REDTI value of ranks as the th lowest value The nations warm season AprilSeptember ranked as the fourth warmest such period since the first year of complete climate records The preliminary national average temperature was F C which was F C above the longterm mean Although the areaweighted national temperature gave the season a rank of fourth warmest on record the persistence of average to cooler than average temperatures in some of the most heavily populated regions of the US contributed to a REDTI that was below average Energy usage statistics for will be available from the Department of Energys Energy Information Administration in While the REDTI provides information on the impacts of temperature on energy demand the Moisture Stress Index MSI was developed to quantify the effect of soil moisture conditions on crop yield It provides historical perspective on conditions such as moisture stress that are closely associated with corn and soybean yields and is a source of information for explaining the cause of lower national yields The MSI ranges from zero to and specifically measures the proportion of the nations corn or soybeans affected by severe to catastrophic drought or catastrophic wetness Values near zero indicate that few productive corn or soybean growing areas were affected by severe drought or catastrophic wetness This index reflects conditions during July and August and is weighted by the mean annual crop productivity within climate divisions in the contiguous US Although a number of factors affect the success of a single crop growing season drought or excessive wetness during critical phases of crop growth have a significant impact on the nations corn and soybean yield Although warmer than average temperatures coincided with drought in some parts of the country during the warm season months of conditions in the heart of the major corn and soybean crop growing regions were generally normal to wetter than normal The corn MSI for the crop growing season was eight and the soybeans MSI was seven This means that severe to catastrophic drought or catastrophic wetness affected only percent and percent of the nations corn and soybeans respectively Both index values were below average and reflect favorable soil moisture throughout a large part of the crop growing regions during July and August the reproductive season The MSI for corn exceeded during the droughtplagued growing seasons of and and during the catastrophically wet summer of years in which corn yields were less than percent of the yield The growing season MaySeptember followed several years in which national corn and soybean yields were generally high according to the US Department of Agriculture The low values of this years corn and soybean MSI indicate that conditions associated with this index were again favorable for good corn and soybean yields National crop yields for will be available from the United States Department of Agriculture following the harvest season NOAA is dedicated to enhancing economic security and national safety through the prediction and research of weather and climaterelated events and providing environmental stewardship of our nations coastal and marine resources
