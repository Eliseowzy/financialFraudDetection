the Sacramento Press Club and of his news conference this afternoon announcing a lawsuit against FERC John Burton held what amounted mostly to a QA session at alunch with the Sacramento Press Club today He started by talking about the Edison MOU which he said will be assigned to the Senate Utility Committee for review the Judiciary Committee will look at the legal elements and the Natural Resources Committee will look at issues surrounding easements One columnist commented that Burton would love it to death meaning it would get so much attention it will be hard for it to advance The MOU he said includes language that eliminates oversight by the PUC He said that will not be the case when it leaves the Senate Burton is obviously troubled bythe MOU he said some people say it doesnt just make Edison creditworthy it makes them whole He said the following would have to take place for the MOU to be acceptable Back debt must be verified All creditors must take a haircut The transmission lines would need to be purchased for an amount close to what the governor has mentioned million or more must come from Edisons parent to pay back debt When asked whether million was enough he said no and that he feels the parent should pay a ton That led to a discussion of the dedicated rate component which he doesnt likeHe used the example that if electricity costs and the dedicated rate component is if prices drop to people will unnecessarily pay higher rates A larger infusion of cash from Edisons parent could eliminate the need for the dedicated rate component Burton calledthe dedicated rate component a big problem and said it could be the strongest argument for use in an initiative campaign He said he planned to tell the governor this afternoon that the state should set an acceptable purchase price for power and not pay anything more note this is a populist approach that is getting a lot of support from radio talk shows and other media He later threw out the number The state is going to have blackouts whether or not it pays top dollar he said so this is one way he sees to fight back Its tough medicine but as he put it Youve got to take castor oil and it tastes crappy but two days later youre over it and your stomachs OK Burton also used a quote from his late brother Phil on how he believe the situation should be handled The only way to deal with exploiters is to terrorize the bastards Asked how long the committee process would take re the MOU Burton said the MOU sets August as a deadline but that if there is ongoing progress there are allowances that would let the process go as long as into December LAWSUIT PRESS CONFERENCE Shortly after the lunch Burton held a press conference to announce a lawsuit against FERC was filed today in the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit A copy of the brief and press release was faxed earlier this afternoon to Jim Steffes and should be available in his office If additional copies are needed please contact me or Scott Govenar The plaintiffs are Burton individually and on behalf of the Senate Bob Hertzberg individually and on behalf of the Assembly and the City of Oakland At the event were Burton Hertzberg Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown atty Joe Cotchett of Cotchett Pitre Simon in Burlingame atty Clark Kelso a constitutional scholar from McGeorge School of Law Sen Liz Figueroa and Joan Breuner vice mayor of Oakland The suit asks for FERC to respond within days and a ruling within days Burton opened by explaining that they were suing FERC for not fulfilling its statutory authority to maintain fair and justifiable rates Hertzberg added that FERC had ignored the law and that they were compelled to file suit for Californians relief Joe Cotchett said the suit is very basic and is based on the Federal Power Act which he says limits power costs to fair and justifiable ratesA primarystrategy in this suit is to present it as a health and welfare and public safety suit he noted that there are million disabled children and convalescent homes in CA who can be adversely affected by blackouts He said it is not an economic lawsuit its about senior citizens disabled kids and convalescent facilities Today also happened to be the legislative day for the California Association of Health Facilities the nursing home trade assn and several nursing home workers were apparently asked to sit at the back of the room for effect Cotchett said FERC has been told for years that there were opportunities to exert market power He also claimed that a Redondo Beach facility obviously AES was fined million by FERC for taking its plant offline and substituting higher rates He said however that this order had been sealed He cited an industry report that predicts hours of blackouts this summer which could mean four hours a day That could be he said potentially the ruination of a lot of medicine in refrigeration Cotchett noted that only hospitals with more than beds are exempt from blackouts which does not protect surgical centers or many health facilities Jerry Brown added that prices are unjust and people are suffering Continued high prices could mean potential civic disruption and that there will be more actions to mobilize Western mayors Liz Figueroa spoke briefly to reiterate the health aspects of the lawsuit Burton had mentioned Clark Kelso who regularly appears on TV here as a legal expert and I believe was a colleague of Justice Anthony Kennedy in his Press Club appearance He said Kelso had appeared regularly in the media early on to say that the state had no standing to file the suitBurtons lawyers sent him the brief and Kelso thought enough of it tojoin the legal team Kelso reiterated that FERC has been aware of potential market power for three years and that the commission has delayed actionunreasonably It has failed to define fair and justifiable that failure he said violates the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of the Constitution Kelso said this is not a partisan issue and called upon fellow Republicans to support the effort Joan Breuner sp Oaklands vice mayor said only that she believed that if the energy situation were happening in Texas rather than California the president and FERC would have acted long ago During the QA session Cotchett said the urgency filing is necessary because generators supply of the electricity in CA and all five have rate renewals before FERC He also said one of the cases that is relevant is Bush v Gore in which the Supreme Court found that failure to set standards regarding elections obviously in that case violates the Equal Protection clause He also said six states have expressed interest in the case and have requested briefs Oregon Nevada Arizona Washington Minnesota and one other he didnt name None of these states has yet committed to joining the suit

the Sacramento Press Club and of his news conference this afternoon announcing a lawsuit against FERC John Burton held what amounted mostly to a QA session at alunch with the Sacramento Press Club today He started by talking about the Edison MOU which he said will be assigned to the Senate Utility Committee for review the Judiciary Committee will look at the legal elements and the Natural Resources Committee will look at issues surrounding easements One columnist commented that Burton would love it to death meaning it would get so much attention it will be hard for it to advance The MOU he said includes language that eliminates oversight by the PUC He said that will not be the case when it leaves the Senate Burton is obviously troubled bythe MOU he said some people say it doesnt just make Edison creditworthy it makes them whole He said the following would have to take place for the MOU to be acceptable Back debt must be verified All creditors must take a haircut The transmission lines would need to be purchased for an amount close to what the governor has mentioned million or more must come from Edisons parent to pay back debt When asked whether million was enough he said no and that he feels the parent should pay a ton That led to a discussion of the dedicated rate component which he doesnt likeHe used the example that if electricity costs and the dedicated rate component is if prices drop to people will unnecessarily pay higher rates A larger infusion of cash from Edisons parent could eliminate the need for the dedicated rate component Burton calledthe dedicated rate component a big problem and said it could be the strongest argument for use in an initiative campaign He said he planned to tell the governor this afternoon that the state should set an acceptable purchase price for power and not pay anything more note this is a populist approach that is getting a lot of support from radio talk shows and other media He later threw out the number The state is going to have blackouts whether or not it pays top dollar he said so this is one way he sees to fight back Its tough medicine but as he put it Youve got to take castor oil and it tastes crappy but two days later youre over it and your stomachs OK Burton also used a quote from his late brother Phil on how he believe the situation should be handled The only way to deal with exploiters is to terrorize the bastards Asked how long the committee process would take re the MOU Burton said the MOU sets August as a deadline but that if there is ongoing progress there are allowances that would let the process go as long as into December LAWSUIT PRESS CONFERENCE Shortly after the lunch Burton held a press conference to announce a lawsuit against FERC was filed today in the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit A copy of the brief and press release was faxed earlier this afternoon to Jim Steffes and should be available in his office If additional copies are needed please contact me or Scott Govenar The plaintiffs are Burton individually and on behalf of the Senate Bob Hertzberg individually and on behalf of the Assembly and the City of Oakland At the event were Burton Hertzberg Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown atty Joe Cotchett of Cotchett Pitre Simon in Burlingame atty Clark Kelso a constitutional scholar from McGeorge School of Law Sen Liz Figueroa and Joan Breuner vice mayor of Oakland The suit asks for FERC to respond within days and a ruling within days Burton opened by explaining that they were suing FERC for not fulfilling its statutory authority to maintain fair and justifiable rates Hertzberg added that FERC had ignored the law and that they were compelled to file suit for Californians relief Joe Cotchett said the suit is very basic and is based on the Federal Power Act which he says limits power costs to fair and justifiable ratesA primarystrategy in this suit is to present it as a health and welfare and public safety suit he noted that there are million disabled children and convalescent homes in CA who can be adversely affected by blackouts He said it is not an economic lawsuit its about senior citizens disabled kids and convalescent facilities Today also happened to be the legislative day for the California Association of Health Facilities the nursing home trade assn and several nursing home workers were apparently asked to sit at the back of the room for effect Cotchett said FERC has been told for years that there were opportunities to exert market power He also claimed that a Redondo Beach facility obviously AES was fined million by FERC for taking its plant offline and substituting higher rates He said however that this order had been sealed He cited an industry report that predicts hours of blackouts this summer which could mean four hours a day That could be he said potentially the ruination of a lot of medicine in refrigeration Cotchett noted that only hospitals with more than beds are exempt from blackouts which does not protect surgical centers or many health facilities Jerry Brown added that prices are unjust and people are suffering Continued high prices could mean potential civic disruption and that there will be more actions to mobilize Western mayors Liz Figueroa spoke briefly to reiterate the health aspects of the lawsuit Burton had mentioned Clark Kelso who regularly appears on TV here as a legal expert and I believe was a colleague of Justice Anthony Kennedy in his Press Club appearance He said Kelso had appeared regularly in the media early on to say that the state had no standing to file the suitBurtons lawyers sent him the brief and Kelso thought enough of it tojoin the legal team Kelso reiterated that FERC has been aware of potential market power for three years and that the commission has delayed actionunreasonably It has failed to define fair and justifiable that failure he said violates the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of the Constitution Kelso said this is not a partisan issue and called upon fellow Republicans to support the effort Joan Breuner sp Oaklands vice mayor said only that she believed that if the energy situation were happening in Texas rather than California the president and FERC would have acted long ago During the QA session Cotchett said the urgency filing is necessary because generators supply of the electricity in CA and all five have rate renewals before FERC He also said one of the cases that is relevant is Bush v Gore in which the Supreme Court found that failure to set standards regarding elections obviously in that case violates the Equal Protection clause He also said six states have expressed interest in the case and have requested briefs Oregon Nevada Arizona Washington Minnesota and one other he didnt name None of these states has yet committed to joining the suit

the Sacramento Press Club and of his news conference this afternoon announcing a lawsuit against FERC John Burton held what amounted mostly to a QA session at alunch with the Sacramento Press Club today He started by talking about the Edison MOU which he said will be assigned to the Senate Utility Committee for review the Judiciary Committee will look at the legal elements and the Natural Resources Committee will look at issues surrounding easements One columnist commented that Burton would love it to death meaning it would get so much attention it will be hard for it to advance The MOU he said includes language that eliminates oversight by the PUC He said that will not be the case when it leaves the Senate Burton is obviously troubled bythe MOU he said some people say it doesnt just make Edison creditworthy it makes them whole He said the following would have to take place for the MOU to be acceptable Back debt must be verified All creditors must take a haircut The transmission lines would need to be purchased for an amount close to what the governor has mentioned million or more must come from Edisons parent to pay back debt When asked whether million was enough he said no and that he feels the parent should pay a ton That led to a discussion of the dedicated rate component which he doesnt likeHe used the example that if electricity costs and the dedicated rate component is if prices drop to people will unnecessarily pay higher rates A larger infusion of cash from Edisons parent could eliminate the need for the dedicated rate component Burton calledthe dedicated rate component a big problem and said it could be the strongest argument for use in an initiative campaign He said he planned to tell the governor this afternoon that the state should set an acceptable purchase price for power and not pay anything more note this is a populist approach that is getting a lot of support from radio talk shows and other media He later threw out the number The state is going to have blackouts whether or not it pays top dollar he said so this is one way he sees to fight back Its tough medicine but as he put it Youve got to take castor oil and it tastes crappy but two days later youre over it and your stomachs OK Burton also used a quote from his late brother Phil on how he believe the situation should be handled The only way to deal with exploiters is to terrorize the bastards Asked how long the committee process would take re the MOU Burton said the MOU sets August as a deadline but that if there is ongoing progress there are allowances that would let the process go as long as into December LAWSUIT PRESS CONFERENCE Shortly after the lunch Burton held a press conference to announce a lawsuit against FERC was filed today in the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit A copy of the brief and press release was faxed earlier this afternoon to Jim Steffes and should be available in his office If additional copies are needed please contact me or Scott Govenar The plaintiffs are Burton individually and on behalf of the Senate Bob Hertzberg individually and on behalf of the Assembly and the City of Oakland At the event were Burton Hertzberg Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown atty Joe Cotchett of Cotchett Pitre Simon in Burlingame atty Clark Kelso a constitutional scholar from McGeorge School of Law Sen Liz Figueroa and Joan Breuner vice mayor of Oakland The suit asks for FERC to respond within days and a ruling within days Burton opened by explaining that they were suing FERC for not fulfilling its statutory authority to maintain fair and justifiable rates Hertzberg added that FERC had ignored the law and that they were compelled to file suit for Californians relief Joe Cotchett said the suit is very basic and is based on the Federal Power Act which he says limits power costs to fair and justifiable ratesA primarystrategy in this suit is to present it as a health and welfare and public safety suit he noted that there are million disabled children and convalescent homes in CA who can be adversely affected by blackouts He said it is not an economic lawsuit its about senior citizens disabled kids and convalescent facilities Today also happened to be the legislative day for the California Association of Health Facilities the nursing home trade assn and several nursing home workers were apparently asked to sit at the back of the room for effect Cotchett said FERC has been told for years that there were opportunities to exert market power He also claimed that a Redondo Beach facility obviously AES was fined million by FERC for taking its plant offline and substituting higher rates He said however that this order had been sealed He cited an industry report that predicts hours of blackouts this summer which could mean four hours a day That could be he said potentially the ruination of a lot of medicine in refrigeration Cotchett noted that only hospitals with more than beds are exempt from blackouts which does not protect surgical centers or many health facilities Jerry Brown added that prices are unjust and people are suffering Continued high prices could mean potential civic disruption and that there will be more actions to mobilize Western mayors Liz Figueroa spoke briefly to reiterate the health aspects of the lawsuit Burton had mentioned Clark Kelso who regularly appears on TV here as a legal expert and I believe was a colleague of Justice Anthony Kennedy in his Press Club appearance He said Kelso had appeared regularly in the media early on to say that the state had no standing to file the suitBurtons lawyers sent him the brief and Kelso thought enough of it tojoin the legal team Kelso reiterated that FERC has been aware of potential market power for

Constitution Kelso said this is not a partisan issue and called upon fellow Republicans to support the effort Joan Breuner sp Oaklands vice mayor said only that she believed that if the energy situation were happening in Texas rather than California the president and FERC would have acted long ago During the QA session Cotchett said the urgency filing is necessary because generators supply of the electricity in CA and all five have rate renewals before FERC He also said one of the cases that is relevant is Bush v Gore in which the Supreme Court found that failure to set standards regarding elections obviously in that case violates the Equal Protection clause He also said six states have expressed interest in the case and have requested briefs Oregon Nevada Arizona Washington Minnesota and one other he didnt name None of these states has yet committed to joining the suit

the Sacramento Press Club and of his news conference this afternoon announcing a lawsuit against FERC John Burton held what amounted mostly to a QA session at alunch with the Sacramento Press Club today He started by talking about the Edison MOU which he said will be assigned to the Senate Utility Committee for review the Judiciary Committee will look at the legal elements and the Natural Resources Committee will look at issues surrounding easements One columnist commented that Burton would love it to death meaning it would get so much attention it will be hard for it to advance The MOU he said includes language that eliminates oversight by the PUC He said that will not be the case when it leaves the Senate Burton is obviously troubled bythe MOU he said some people say it doesnt just make Edison creditworthy it makes them whole He said the following would have to take place for the MOU to be acceptable Back debt must be verified All creditors must take a haircut The transmission lines would need to be purchased for an amount close to what the governor has mentioned million or more must come from Edisons parent to pay back debt When asked whether million was enough he said no and that he feels the parent should pay a ton That led to a discussion of the dedicated rate component which he doesnt likeHe used the example that if electricity costs and the dedicated rate component is if prices drop to people will unnecessarily pay higher rates A larger infusion of cash from Edisons parent could eliminate the need for the dedicated rate component Burton calledthe dedicated rate component a big problem and said it could be the strongest argument for use in an initiative campaign He said he planned to tell the governor this afternoon that the state should set an acceptable purchase price for power and not pay anything more note this is a populist approach that is getting a lot of support from radio talk shows and other media He later threw out the number The state is going to have blackouts whether or not it pays top dollar he said so this is one way he sees to fight back Its tough medicine but as he put it Youve got to take castor oil and it tastes crappy but two days later youre over it and your stomachs OK Burton also used a quote from his late brother Phil on how he believe the situation should be handled The only way to deal with exploiters is to terrorize the bastards Asked how long the committee process would take re the MOU Burton said the MOU sets August as a deadline but that if there is ongoing progress there are allowances that would let the process go as long as into December LAWSUIT PRESS CONFERENCE Shortly after the lunch Burton held a press conference to announce a lawsuit against FERC was filed today in the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit A copy of the brief and press release was faxed earlier this afternoon to Jim Steffes and should be available in his office If additional copies are needed please contact me or Scott Govenar The plaintiffs are Burton individually and on behalf of the Senate Bob Hertzberg individually and on behalf of the Assembly and the City of Oakland At the event were Burton Hertzberg Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown atty Joe Cotchett of Cotchett Pitre Simon in Burlingame atty Clark Kelso a constitutional scholar from McGeorge School of Law Sen Liz Figueroa and Joan Breuner vice mayor of Oakland The suit asks for FERC to respond within days and a ruling within days Burton opened by explaining that they were suing FERC for not fulfilling its statutory authority to maintain fair and justifiable rates Hertzberg added that FERC had ignored the law and that they were compelled to file suit for Californians relief Joe Cotchett said the suit is very basic and is based on the Federal Power Act which he says limits power costs to fair and justifiable ratesA primarystrategy in this suit is to present it as a health and welfare and public safety suit he noted that there are million disabled children and convalescent homes in CA who can be adversely affected by blackouts He said it is not an economic lawsuit its about senior citizens disabled kids and convalescent facilities Today also happened to be the legislative day for the California Association of Health Facilities the nursing home trade assn and several nursing home workers were apparently asked to sit at the back of the room for effect Cotchett said FERC has been told for years that there were opportunities to exert market power He also claimed that a Redondo Beach facility obviously AES was fined million by FERC for taking its plant offline and substituting higher rates He said however that this order had been sealed He cited an industry report that predicts hours of blackouts this summer which could mean four hours a day That could be he said potentially the ruination of a lot of medicine in refrigeration Cotchett noted that only hospitals with more than beds are exempt from blackouts which does not protect surgical centers or many health facilities Jerry Brown added that prices are unjust and people are suffering Continued high prices could mean potential civic disruption and that there will be more actions to mobilize Western mayors Liz Figueroa spoke briefly to reiterate the health aspects of the lawsuit Burton had mentioned Clark Kelso who regularly appears on TV here as a legal expert and I believe was a colleague of Justice Anthony Kennedy in his Press Club appearance He said Kelso had appeared regularly in the media early on to say that the state had no standing to file the suitBurtons lawyers sent him the brief and Kelso thought enough of it tojoin the legal team Kelso reiterated that FERC has been aware of potential market power for three years and that the commission has delayed actionunreasonably It has failed to define fair and justifiable that failure he said violates the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of the Constitution Kelso said this is not a partisan issue and called upon fellow Republicans to support the effort Joan Breuner sp Oaklands vice mayor said only that she believed that if the energy situation were happening in Texas rather than California the president and FERC would have acted long ago During the QA session Cotchett said the urgency filing is necessary because generators supply of the electricity in CA and all five have rate renewals before FERC He also said one of the cases that is relevant is Bush v Gore in which the Supreme Court found that failure to set standards regarding elections obviously in that case violates the Equal Protection clause He also said six states have expressed interest in the case and have requested briefs Oregon Nevada Arizona Washington Minnesota and one other he didnt name None of these states has yet committed to joining the suit

the Sacramento Press Club and of his news conference this afternoon announcing a lawsuit against FERC John Burton held what amounted mostly to a QA session at alunch with the Sacramento Press Club today He started by talking about the Edison MOU which he said will be assigned to the Senate Utility Committee for review the Judiciary Committee will look at the legal elements and the Natural Resources Committee will look at issues surrounding easements One columnist commented that Burton would love it to death meaning it would get so much attention it will be hard for it to advance The MOU he said includes language that eliminates oversight by the PUC He said that will not be the case when it leaves the Senate Burton is obviously troubled bythe MOU he said some people say it doesnt just make Edison creditworthy it makes them whole He said the following would have to take place for the MOU to be acceptable Back debt must be verified All creditors must take a haircut The transmission lines would need to be purchased for an amount close to what the governor has mentioned million or more must come from Edisons parent to pay back debt When asked whether million was enough he said no and that he feels the parent should pay a ton That led to a discussion of the dedicated rate component which he doesnt likeHe used the example that if electricity costs and the dedicated rate component is if prices drop to people will unnecessarily pay higher rates A larger infusion of cash from Edisons parent could eliminate the need for the dedicated rate component Burton calledthe dedicated rate component a big problem and said it could be the strongest argument for use in an initiative campaign He said he planned to tell the governor this afternoon that the state should set an acceptable purchase price for power and not pay anything more note this is a populist approach that is getting a lot of support from radio talk shows and other media He later threw out the number The state is going to have blackouts whether or not it pays top dollar he said so this is one way he sees to fight back Its tough medicine but as he put it Youve got to take castor oil and it tastes crappy but two days later youre over it and your stomachs OK Burton also used a quote from his late brother Phil on how he believe the situation should be handled The only way to deal with exploiters is to terrorize the bastards Asked how long the committee process would take re the MOU Burton said the MOU sets August as a deadline but that if there is ongoing progress there are allowances that would let the process go as long as into December LAWSUIT PRESS CONFERENCE Shortly after the lunch Burton held a press conference to announce a lawsuit against FERC was filed today in the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit A copy of the brief and press release was faxed earlier this afternoon to Jim Steffes and should be available in his office If additional copies are needed please contact me or Scott Govenar The plaintiffs are Burton individually and on behalf of the Senate Bob Hertzberg individually and on behalf of the Assembly and the City of Oakland At the event were Burton Hertzberg Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown atty Joe Cotchett of Cotchett Pitre Simon in Burlingame atty Clark Kelso a constitutional scholar from McGeorge School of Law Sen Liz Figueroa and Joan Breuner vice mayor of Oakland The suit asks for FERC to respond within days and a ruling within days Burton opened by explaining that they were suing FERC for not fulfilling its statutory authority to maintain fair and justifiable rates Hertzberg added that FERC had ignored the law and that they were compelled to file suit for Californians relief Joe Cotchett said the suit is very basic and is based on the Federal Power Act which he says limits power costs to fair and justifiable ratesA primarystrategy in this suit is to present it as a health and welfare and public safety suit he noted that there are million disabled children and convalescent homes in CA who can be adversely affected by blackouts He said it is not an economic lawsuit its about senior citizens disabled kids and convalescent facilities Today also happened to be the legislative day for the California Association of Health Facilities the nursing home trade assn and several nursing home workers were apparently asked to sit at the back of the room for effect Cotchett said FERC has been told for years that there were opportunities to exert market power He also claimed that a Redondo Beach facility obviously AES was fined million by FERC for taking its plant offline and substituting higher rates He said however that this order had been sealed He cited an industry report that predicts hours of blackouts this summer which could mean four hours a day That could be he said potentially the ruination of a lot of medicine in refrigeration Cotchett noted that only hospitals with more than beds are exempt from blackouts which does not protect surgical centers or many health facilities Jerry Brown added that prices are unjust and people are suffering Continued high prices could mean potential civic disruption and that there will be more actions to mobilize Western mayors Liz Figueroa spoke briefly to reiterate the health aspects of the lawsuit Burton had mentioned Clark Kelso who regularly appears on TV here as a legal expert and I believe was a colleague of Justice Anthony Kennedy in his Press Club appearance He said Kelso had appeared regularly in the media early on to say that the state had no standing to file the suitBurtons lawyers sent him the brief and Kelso thought enough of it tojoin the legal team Kelso reiterated that FERC has been aware of potential market power for three years and that the commission has delayed actionunreasonably It has failed to define fair and justifiable that failure he said violates the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of the Constitution Kelso said this is not a partisan issue and called upon fellow Republicans to support the effort Joan Breuner sp Oaklands vice mayor said only that she believed that if the energy situation were happening in Texas rather than California the president and FERC would have acted long ago During the QA session Cotchett said the urgency filing is necessary because generators supply of the electricity in CA and all five have rate renewals before FERC He also said one of the cases that is relevant is Bush v Gore in which the Supreme Court found that failure to set standards regarding elections obviously in that case violates the Equal Protection clause He also said six states have expressed interest in the case and have requested briefs Oregon Nevada Arizona Washington Minnesota and one other he didnt name None of these states has yet committed to joining the suit

suppliers charged more than the firms that Davis has pilloried records show RICH CONNELL ROBERT J LOPEZ DOUG SMITH TIMES STAFF WRITERS Los Angeles Times Home Edition B Copyright The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO Californias energy meltdown involves a far more diverse group of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov Gray Davis who has aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies state records show During the first three months of this yearone of the worst stretches of power shortages during the crisisan assortment of public and private entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid to Texas firms according to documents released to The Times on Monday by the Department of Water Resources which now buys power for California Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per megawatthour were a Canadian public utility a subsidiary of San Diego Gas Electrics parent company and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power the report shows Their average prices ranged from a megawatthour charged by Powerex the trading arm of British Columbias BC Hydro to an hour by the DWP In fact some of the biggest private power companies singled out for criticism by Davis and other state officialsDynegy Inc Duke Energy and Mirantcharged less than the average prices the state paid for the period Those companies average prices ranged from to per megawatthour according to an analysis of the documents The figures cover the various types of spot and longerterm power purchased by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more than a month of razorthin reserves leading to continuous power emergencies Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest barbs at private outofstate generators because in general they have reaped the highest profits over the longest period You have to look at the whole picture Maviglio said The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the generators who wear cowboy hats he said Their profits were to above last year Just because there are other entities who are charging us more per megawatthour doesnt change the fact that we are getting ripped off by companies from Houston Tulsa Atlanta or Charlotte The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times on the same day the state released pages of documents on Californias electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the years first quarter The records detail how the state spent nearly billion buying power in the first five months of the year and underscore the complexity of the states energy problem They also show that patterns of high prices are not limited to a few generators Oscar Hidalgo a spokesman for the water resources agency said that the reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year All the prices were high he said noting the downward trend in costs since his agency began buying power in midJanuary The average price per megawatthour for all state purchases went from in January to in May Spot prices fell from an average of per hour to the reports show In the first quarter of the year some public entities prices far exceeded those of the biggest private companies For example Houstonbased Enron one of the nations biggest power traders charged an average of per megawatthour And Atlantabased Mirant which sold the most to the state a total of million charged an average of per megawatthour By contrast a Calgary Canada firm TransAlta Energy averaged a megawatthour and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average charges of per megawatthour A spokesman for Enron Mark Palmer said recently that the vilification of Enron was based on politics not facts Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not be reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state In the past the utility has defended its pricing practices saying it has offered lastminute hydroelectric power that helped keep Californias lights on A spokeswoman for Sempra the parent company of San Diego Gas Electric said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to see the figures released by the state Officials at DWP who could not be reached Monday evening have defended their pricing saying the costs of producing the power needed by the state were extremely high More Power Bought Than Projected Hidalgo of the Department of Water Resources said his agencys efforts coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas prices have begun to tame the states market Still the state had to purchase million in power in April and May about more than Davis analysts had projected Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply problems in April He said reports will show that power purchases fell short of state projections in June and early July The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June and July partly because spot prices have fallen sharply often to well under a megawatthour A summary Department of Water Resources report released Monday credited Davis program of nurturing

School Hes from Stockton and a former San Joaquin County DA Hes also a retired San Joaquin County judge I dont know if that wasa fulltime elected position or whether he would be on call to serve as caseloads determine He was president of the California Trial Lawyers Association now California Association of Consumer Attorneys around and is currently chairman of the board of trustees of Humphreys School of Law in Stockton Hes been involved in at least acouple of high profile case in the Central Valley including the case against Ford detailed in the articles below apparently the verdict was later overturned due to juror misconduct and a TV show tainted the million verdict He was also involved in a highly publicized case in which the Catholic Dioceseof Stocktonwas ordered to pay million as the result of molestations by a priest Hes well known in trial lawyer circles and has been a leader in CTLACAOC for years Im sure that includes working hard to raise funds for atttorneybacked initiatives including insurance issues and candidates Ill try to get some more substantive info ASAP Ken From the Texas tort reform assn publication Astronomical damage awards set a bad precedent by JIM LAFFERTY Lubbock Avalanche Journal Saturday November IMAGEEMail this articleIMAGEPrinterfriendly version MODESTO Calif Now high is up Thats the question that thousands of giddy personal injury lawyers are asking themselves in the wake of two astronomical punitive damage awards handed out by California juries within three days of each other in July In one of the judgments Modesto jurors ordered Ford Motor Co to pay million in punitive damages to a young man whose mother father and brother were killed when he tipped over his Bronco on Fathers Day At the time of the accident Juan Ramon Romo then had been driving for a lengthy period of time so long in fact that everyone else in the Bronco his mother and father a brother and two sisters had fallen asleep Going slightly over the speed limit on an interstate highway Romo attempted illegally to pass another vehicle on the right When the other driver decided to move back into the right lane Romo swerved left and rolled over His mother father and brother were killed he and his two sisters survived The million judgment in the Romo case was the second largest ever entered against a US car manufacturer yet it received little media attention outside the immediate Modesto area Hardly surprising perhaps since only three days before a Las Angeles jury had set the punitive damage bar impossibly high by ordering General Motors to pay a staggering punitive damage award of billion By way of a yardstick that amount surpasses the combined Gross National Product of Afghanistan and Albania Almost obscured by the astonishing generosity of the jurors in Los Angeles and Modesto was a salient point that still sends shivers through corporate defense lawyers around the country By any objective criteria neither Ford nor General Motors appeared to bear any responsibility for the accidents In the Los Angeles case Patricia Anderson her four children and a family friend were stopped at a red light in her Chevy Malibu on Christmas Eve A drunken driver traveling at mph slammed his car into the Malibus rear end The collision ruptured the Malibus gas tank and ignited the spilled fuel Mrs Andersons four children suffered severe burns When police tested the drunken driver he registered a blood alcohol content of twice the legal limit for drivers in California Similarly in the Modesto case driver error and misjudgment on the part of Romo clearly appeared to be the cause of the accident But Romos lawyer Lawrence Drivon immediately blamed the deaths on the Bronco which he said was susceptible to rollover and had a defectively designed roof Yet the Bronco exceeded all federal safety standards for roof strength in by more than percent and in fact exceeds the standard by more than percent Romos Bronco also exceeded all federal rollover standards for model and federal accident data show the Ford Broncos rollover rate was no higher than that of other SUVs Its open to question whether the Bronco had been properly maintained prior to the accident The vehicle had been on the road for years had numerous changes in ownership and had nearly miles on the odometer In addition Drivon engaged in conduct that borders on jury tampering mailing to each juror a copy of his book The Civil War on Consumer Rights whose main thesis is that large American corporations like Ford are attempting to close the courthouse doors to average Americans by pressing for judicial reforms In the book Drivon devotes an entire chapter to Fords alleged misdeeds In part because of Drivons behavior a California judge granted Fords motion to set aside the punitive damage part of the verdict and ordered a new trial Among other things he cited improper discussions among the jurors that prejudiced deliberations But Ford could be entering double jeopardy with a new trial Drivon has indicated he will seek to raise the initial punitive award threefold to more than billion With a sympathetic jury that could happen Damage award of a few hundred million here and a few hundred million there are still unusual but California is a national trendsetter If juries elsewhere start emulating the ones in Los Angeles and Modesto our now booming economy could well begin to sputter Jim Lafferty is a former Associated Press and Philadelphia Daily News reporter who now covers national and international Legal trends as an independent journalist

Zevitas AtAGlance Size of verdict million million in punitive damages million in compensatory damages Status Punitive award overturned and new trial pending State California Date of Verdict July Length of Trial months Length of Deliberations week Case Name Romo v Ford Motor Co Court Stanislaus County Superior Court Modesto Calif Plaintiffs Lawyers Joseph W Carcione Jr of Law Offices of Joseph Carcione in Redwood City Calif lawyers Laurence Drivon of Drivon Tabak in Stockton Calif lawyers Defense Lawyers Frank Kelly of Dryden Margoles Schimaneck Hartman Kelly Wait in San Francisco Douglas Seitz of Snell Wilmer in Phoenix Ariz Gary S Davis of Davis Echols Boyd in Modesto Calif lawyers Just three days after a Los Angeles jury hammered General Motors with the largest verdict of the year another California jury slammed Ford Motor Co with the years fifthlargest verdict The Modesto jury awarded million to three children whose parents and brother died when their Ford Bronco rolled over in a highway accident The verdict included million in punitive damages the second largest punitive award ever against an automaker The defense argued that the drivers of the two vehicles not the company were responsible for the tragedy But a person jury found the automaker liable for the deaths concluding that Ford chose to save money by opting for a less sturdy roof design The jury divided the remaining liability between the two drivers A company spokesman told The Modesto Bee that as tragic as the accident was it wasnt our fault and it wasnt the vehicles fault Lawyers for neither the plaintiff nor the defendant could be reached for comment This story is based on local newspaper and wire stories from the time of the verdict Bronco Rolls Over On June yearold Juan Romo was driving five other family members home to northern California when he attempted to pass a van on the right at approximately mph The vans driver didnt see Romo and changed lanes at the same time forcing Romo to swerve hard to the right to avoid him Romo then overcorrected with a hard turn to the left lost control and while traveling about mph the vehicle rolled over killing Romos mother Salustia his father Ramon and his brother Ramiro Romos parents and brother were all wearing their seatbelts and died because the Broncos roof smashed straight down onto the dashboard and crushed their heads according to plaintiffs attorneys Juan and his two sisters Evangelina and Maria suffered only minor injuries Plaintiffs attorney Joseph Carcione Jr told The Modesto Bee that the sisters survived because they werent wearing their seatbelts and were thrown from the Bronco Romo survived because he ducked below the dashboard said Carcione name partner in a lawyer firm in Redwood City Calif Romo and his sisters sued Ford alleging that the automaker knew the Broncos roof which was twothirds plastic would not hold up in a rollover Carcione and his cocounsel Laurence Drivon argued that Ford knew the roof was unsafe but decided to save the relatively small cost of reinforcing it with steel a defect the company corrected in post model years According to a press release Carcione described the roof as a camper top To manufacture the vehicle Ford basically chopped off the back portion of a pickup truck and stuck on the plastic camper top put a bench seat in the back and removed a warning that had been posted on the camper top that said Do Not Ride Under This Camper Top Carcione said in the release The plaintiffs attorneys also contended that the Bronco was unsafe because it was prone to rollover The vehicles rollover rate is three to five times higher than any other passenger car and its rollover death rate is almost three times greater than the model Broncos they say in a press release Although Carcione and Drivon lacked explicit documentation to illustrate the Broncos structural weaknesses they filled that gap with a prize witness former Ford executive vice president Tom Feeney who testified that company officials were aware that the roof was virtually certain to fail in a rollover Feeney gave additional testimony that in the years he had worked for the company the Bronco was the worst vehicle Ford ever put out in terms of crashworthiness Ford countered that the Bronco was perfectly sound and met all federal safety standards noting that Feeney had never worked in truck product development Defense attorneys also argued that Romo was at fault and that his righthand passing maneuver was illegal They contended that the vans driver was also partly to blame On July the jury awarded the Romo family million in compensatory damages and million in punitives At the close of the threemonth trial the plaintiffs attorneys urged jurors to award punitives totaling billion They noted after the trial that the million award amounts to only days worth of Fords net profits Drivon partner in a fourlawyer firm in Stockton Calif also called the Bronco the most dangerous vehicle Ford ever made The American public is waking up to the carnage thats being visited upon the public by some American industries such as tobacco and automobiles he told the Associated Press New Trial Pending Following the verdict defense attorneys asked for a mistrial claiming that Romos counsel made inflammatory public statements supporting the billion GM verdict which came down while jurors in his own case were still in deliberations The motion was denied Ford appealed and on Sept the trial judge ordered a new trial on punitives finding that the case was tainted by juror misconduct One juror told others of a Minutes II segment about Ford Mustangs and fueltank fires and told them it was evidence of Fords malice regarding the Bronco wrote Superior Court Judge Roger Beauchesne Another juror told the jury of a morbid nightmare she had in which her child and other jurors children were killed in a Bronco rollover while being taunted by Ford attorneys the judge wrote Beauchesne said the two jurors comments may have influenced the deliberations and noted that the jury vote on punitive damages was the exact majority needed The Wall Street Journal reported that Carcione said hes delighted to try the case again Reversing the million award was no victory for Ford The next jury will award even higher damages said Carcione in a press release Four of the jurors in the last trial wanted to assess punitive damages at a billion dollars or more The million amount was reached as a compromise Drivon echoed Carciones thoughts Sooner of later Ford will have to accept what American jurors will continue to say That this Bronco is the result of malicious actions by Ford who willfully put profits ahead of people he said in a press release Beauchesne upheld the jurys unanimous finding that the Broncos defective roof caused the deaths of Romos family members While Ford expressed its gratitude at the new punitives trial it may appeal the compensatory damage award as well as the jurys finding of liability According to wire reports Drivon advised Ford not to celebrate prematurely The best they get out of this is that theyre exposed to the verdict of a second jury he told the Associated Press Lawyers Weekly Inc All Rights Reserved emailgif printgif ehhotgif

as the result of molestations by a priest Hes well known in trial lawyer circles and has been a leader in CTLACAOC for years Im sure that includes working hard to raise funds for atttorneybacked initiatives including insurance issues and candidates Ill try to get some more substantive info ASAP Ken From the Texas tort reform assn publication Astronomical damage awards set a bad precedent by JIM LAFFERTY Lubbock Avalanche Journal Saturday November IMAGEEMail this articleIMAGEPrinterfriendly version MODESTO Calif Now high is up Thats the question that thousands of giddy personal injury lawyers are asking themselves in the wake of two astronomical punitive damage awards handed out by California juries within three days of each other in July In one of the judgments Modesto jurors ordered Ford Motor Co to pay million in punitive damages to a young man whose mother father and brother were killed when he tipped over his Bronco on Fathers Day At the time of the accident Juan Ramon Romo then had been driving for a lengthy period of time so long in fact that everyone else in the Bronco his mother and father a brother and two sisters had fallen asleep Going slightly over the speed limit on an interstate highway Romo attempted illegally to pass another vehicle on the right When the other driver decided to move back into the right lane Romo swerved left and rolled over His mother father and brother were killed he and his two sisters survived The million judgment in the Romo case was the second largest ever entered against a US car manufacturer yet it received little media attention outside the immediate Modesto area Hardly surprising perhaps since only three days before a Las Angeles jury had set the punitive damage bar impossibly high by ordering General Motors to pay a staggering punitive damage award of billion By way of a yardstick that amount surpasses the combined Gross National Product of Afghanistan and Albania Almost obscured by the astonishing generosity of the jurors in Los Angeles and Modesto was a salient point that still sends shivers through corporate defense lawyers around the country By any objective criteria neither Ford nor General Motors appeared to bear any responsibility for the accidents In the Los Angeles case Patricia Anderson her four children and a family friend were stopped at a red light in her Chevy Malibu on Christmas Eve A drunken driver traveling at mph slammed his car into the Malibus rear end The collision ruptured the Malibus gas tank and ignited the spilled fuel Mrs Andersons four children suffered severe burns When police tested the drunken driver he registered a blood alcohol content of twice the legal limit for drivers in California Similarly in the Modesto case driver error and misjudgment on the part of Romo clearly appeared to be the cause of the accident But Romos lawyer Lawrence Drivon immediately blamed the deaths on the Bronco which he said was susceptible to rollover and had a defectively designed roof Yet the Bronco exceeded all federal safety standards for roof strength in by more than percent and in fact exceeds the standard by more than percent Romos Bronco also exceeded all federal rollover standards for model and federal accident data show the Ford Broncos rollover rate was no higher than that of other SUVs Its open to question whether the Bronco had been properly maintained prior to the accident The vehicle had been on the road for years had numerous changes in ownership and had nearly miles on the odometer In addition Drivon engaged in conduct that borders on jury tampering mailing to each juror a copy of his book The Civil War on Consumer Rights whose main thesis is that large American corporations like Ford are attempting to close the courthouse doors to average Americans by pressing for judicial reforms In the book Drivon devotes an entire chapter to Fords alleged misdeeds In part because of Drivons behavior a California judge granted Fords motion to set aside the punitive damage part of the verdict and ordered a new trial Among other things he cited improper discussions among the jurors that prejudiced deliberations But Ford could be entering double jeopardy with a new trial Drivon has indicated he will seek to raise the initial punitive award threefold to more than billion With a sympathetic jury that could happen Damage award of a few hundred million here and a few hundred million there are still unusual but California is a national trendsetter If juries elsewhere start emulating the ones in Los Angeles and Modesto our now booming economy could well begin to sputter Jim Lafferty is a former Associated Press and Philadelphia Daily News reporter who now covers national and international Legal trends as an independent journalist

Length of Trial months Length of Deliberations week Case Name Romo v Ford Motor Co Court Stanislaus County Superior Court Modesto Calif Plaintiffs Lawyers Joseph W Carcione Jr of Law Offices of Joseph Carcione in Redwood City Calif lawyers Laurence Drivon of Drivon Tabak in Stockton Calif lawyers Defense Lawyers Frank Kelly of Dryden Margoles Schimaneck Hartman Kelly Wait in San Francisco Douglas Seitz of Snell Wilmer in Phoenix Ariz Gary S Davis of Davis Echols Boyd in Modesto Calif lawyers Just three days after a Los Angeles jury hammered General Motors with the largest verdict of the year another California jury slammed Ford Motor Co with the years fifthlargest verdict The Modesto jury awarded million to three children whose parents and brother died when their Ford Bronco rolled over in a highway accident The verdict included million in punitive damages the second largest punitive award ever against an automaker The defense argued that the drivers of the two vehicles not the company were responsible for the tragedy But a person jury found the automaker liable for the deaths concluding that Ford chose to save money by opting for a less sturdy roof design The jury divided the remaining liability between the two drivers A company spokesman told The Modesto Bee that as tragic as the accident was it wasnt our fault and it wasnt the vehicles fault Lawyers for neither the plaintiff nor the defendant could be reached for comment This story is based on local newspaper and wire stories from the time of the verdict Bronco Rolls Over On June yearold Juan Romo was driving five other family members home to northern California when he attempted to pass a van on the right at approximately mph The vans driver didnt see Romo and changed lanes at the same time forcing Romo to swerve hard to the right to avoid him Romo then overcorrected with a hard turn to the left lost control and while traveling about mph the vehicle rolled over killing Romos mother Salustia his father Ramon and his brother Ramiro Romos parents and brother were all wearing their seatbelts and died because the Broncos roof smashed straight down onto the dashboard and crushed their heads according to plaintiffs attorneys Juan and his two sisters Evangelina and Maria suffered only minor injuries Plaintiffs attorney Joseph Carcione Jr told The Modesto Bee that the sisters survived because they werent wearing their seatbelts and were thrown from the Bronco Romo survived because he ducked below the dashboard said Carcione name partner in a lawyer firm in Redwood City Calif Romo and his sisters sued Ford alleging that the automaker knew the Broncos roof which was twothirds plastic would not hold up in a rollover Carcione and his cocounsel Laurence Drivon argued that Ford knew the roof was unsafe but decided to save the relatively small cost of reinforcing it with steel a defect the company corrected in post model years According to a press release Carcione described the roof as a camper top To manufacture the vehicle Ford basically chopped off the back portion of a pickup truck and stuck on the plastic camper top put a bench seat in the back and removed a warning that had been posted on the camper top that said Do Not Ride Under This Camper Top Carcione said in the release The plaintiffs attorneys also contended that the Bronco was unsafe because it was prone to rollover The vehicles rollover rate is three to five times higher than any other passenger car and its rollover death rate is almost three times greater than the model Broncos they say in a press release Although Carcione and Drivon lacked explicit documentation to illustrate the Broncos structural weaknesses they filled that gap with a prize witness former Ford executive vice president Tom Feeney who testified that company officials were aware that the roof was virtually certain to fail in a rollover Feeney gave additional testimony that in the years he had worked for the company the Bronco was the worst vehicle Ford ever put out in terms of crashworthiness Ford countered that the Bronco was perfectly sound and met all federal safety standards noting that Feeney had never worked in truck product development Defense attorneys also argued that Romo was at fault and that his righthand passing maneuver was illegal They contended that the vans driver was also partly to blame On July the jury awarded the Romo family million in compensatory damages and million in punitives At the close of the threemonth trial the plaintiffs attorneys urged jurors to award punitives totaling billion They noted after the trial that the million award amounts to only days worth of Fords net profits Drivon partner in a fourlawyer firm in Stockton Calif also called the Bronco the most dangerous vehicle Ford ever made The American public is waking up to the carnage thats being visited upon the public by some American industries such as tobacco and automobiles he told the Associated Press New Trial Pending Following the verdict defense attorneys asked for a mistrial claiming that Romos counsel made inflammatory public statements supporting the billion GM verdict which came down while jurors in his own case were still in deliberations The motion was denied Ford appealed and on Sept the trial judge ordered a new trial on punitives finding that the case was tainted by juror misconduct One juror told others of a Minutes II segment about Ford Mustangs and fueltank fires and told them it was evidence of Fords malice regarding the Bronco wrote Superior Court Judge Roger Beauchesne Another juror told the jury of a morbid nightmare she had in which her child and other jurors children were killed in a Bronco rollover while being taunted by Ford attorneys the judge wrote Beauchesne said the two jurors comments may have influenced the deliberations and noted that the jury vote on punitive damages was the exact majority needed The Wall Street Journal reported that Carcione said hes delighted to try the case again Reversing the million award was no victory for Ford The next jury will award even higher damages said Carcione in a press release Four of the jurors in the last trial wanted to assess punitive damages at a billion dollars or more The million amount was reached as a compromise Drivon echoed Carciones thoughts Sooner of later Ford will have to accept what American jurors will continue to say That this Bronco is the result of malicious actions by Ford who willfully put profits ahead of people he said in a press release Beauchesne upheld the jurys unanimous finding that the Broncos defective roof caused the deaths of Romos family members While Ford expressed its gratitude at the new punitives trial it may appeal the compensatory damage award as well as the jurys finding of liability According to wire reports Drivon advised Ford not to celebrate prematurely The best they get out of this is that theyre exposed to the verdict of a second jury he told the Associated Press Lawyers Weekly Inc All Rights Reserved emailgif printgif ehhotgif

suppliers charged more than the firms that Davis has pilloried records show RICH CONNELL ROBERT J LOPEZ DOUG SMITH TIMES STAFF WRITERS Los Angeles Times Home Edition B Copyright The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO Californias energy meltdown involves a far more diverse group of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov Gray Davis who has aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies state records show During the first three months of this yearone of the worst stretches of power shortages during the crisisan assortment of public and private entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid to Texas firms according to documents released to The Times on Monday by the Department of Water Resources which now buys power for California Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per megawatthour were a Canadian public utility a subsidiary of San Diego Gas Electrics parent company and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power the report shows Their average prices ranged from a megawatthour charged by Powerex the trading arm of British Columbias BC Hydro to an hour by the DWP In fact some of the biggest private power companies singled out for criticism by Davis and other state officialsDynegy Inc Duke Energy and Mirantcharged less than the average prices the state paid for the period Those companies average prices ranged from to per megawatthour according to an analysis of the documents The figures cover the various types of spot and longerterm power purchased by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more than a month of razorthin reserves leading to continuous power emergencies Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest barbs at private outofstate generators because in general they have reaped the highest profits over the longest period You have to look at the whole picture Maviglio said The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the generators who wear cowboy hats he said Their profits were to above last year Just because there are other entities who are charging us more per megawatthour doesnt change the fact that we are getting ripped off by companies from Houston Tulsa Atlanta or Charlotte The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times on the same day the state released pages of documents on Californias electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the years first quarter The records detail how the state spent nearly billion buying power in the first five months of the year and underscore the complexity of the states energy problem They also show that patterns of high prices are not limited to a few generators Oscar Hidalgo a spokesman for the water resources agency said that the reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year All the prices were high he said noting the downward trend in costs since his agency began buying power in midJanuary The average price per megawatthour for all state purchases went from in January to in May Spot prices fell from an average of per hour to the reports show In the first quarter of the year some public entities prices far exceeded those of the biggest private companies For example Houstonbased Enron one of the nations biggest power traders charged an average of per megawatthour And Atlantabased Mirant which sold the most to the state a total of million charged an average of per megawatthour By contrast a Calgary Canada firm TransAlta Energy averaged a megawatthour and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average charges of per megawatthour A spokesman for Enron Mark Palmer said recently that the vilification of Enron was based on politics not facts Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not be reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state In the past the utility has defended its pricing practices saying it has offered lastminute hydroelectric power that helped keep Californias lights on A spokeswoman for Sempra the parent company of San Diego Gas Electric said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to see the figures released by the state Officials at DWP who could not be reached Monday evening have defended their pricing saying the costs of producing the power needed by the state were extremely high More Power Bought Than Projected Hidalgo of the Department of Water Resources said his agencys efforts coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas prices have begun to tame the states market Still the state had to purchase million in power in April and May about more than Davis analysts had projected Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply problems in April He said reports will show that power purchases fell short of state projections in June and early July The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June and July partly because spot prices have fallen sharply often to well under a megawatthour A summary Department of Water Resources report released Monday credited Davis program of nurturing

the Sacramento Press Club and of his news conference this afternoon announcing a lawsuit against FERC John Burton held what amounted mostly to a QA session at alunch with the Sacramento Press Club today He started by talking about the Edison MOU which he said will be assigned to the Senate Utility Committee for review the Judiciary Committee will look at the legal elements and the Natural Resources Committee will look at issues surrounding easements One columnist commented that Burton would love it to death meaning it would get so much attention it will be hard for it to advance The MOU he said includes language that eliminates oversight by the PUC He said that will not be the case when it leaves the Senate Burton is obviously troubled bythe MOU he said some people say it doesnt just make Edison creditworthy it makes them whole He said the following would have to take place for the MOU to be acceptable Back debt must be verified All creditors must take a haircut The transmission lines would need to be purchased for an amount close to what the governor has mentioned million or more must come from Edisons parent to pay back debt When asked whether million was enough he said no and that he feels the parent should pay a ton That led to a discussion of the dedicated rate component which he doesnt likeHe used the example that if electricity costs and the dedicated rate component is if prices drop to people will unnecessarily pay higher rates A larger infusion of cash from Edisons parent could eliminate the need for the dedicated rate component Burton calledthe dedicated rate component a big problem and said it could be the strongest argument for use in an initiative campaign He said he planned to tell the governor this afternoon that the state should set an acceptable purchase price for power and not pay anything more note this is a populist approach that is getting a lot of support from radio talk shows and other media He later threw out the number The state is going to have blackouts whether or not it pays top dollar he said so this is one way he sees to fight back Its tough medicine but as he put it Youve got to take castor oil and it tastes crappy but two days later youre over it and your stomachs OK Burton also used a quote from his late brother Phil on how he believe the situation should be handled The only way to deal with exploiters is to terrorize the bastards Asked how long the committee process would take re the MOU Burton said the MOU sets August as a deadline but that if there is ongoing progress there are allowances that would let the process go as long as into December LAWSUIT PRESS CONFERENCE Shortly after the lunch Burton held a press conference to announce a lawsuit against FERC was filed today in the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit A copy of the brief and press release was faxed earlier this afternoon to Jim Steffes and should be available in his office If additional copies are needed please contact me or Scott Govenar The plaintiffs are Burton individually and on behalf of the Senate Bob Hertzberg individually and on behalf of the Assembly and the City of Oakland At the event were Burton Hertzberg Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown atty Joe Cotchett of Cotchett Pitre Simon in Burlingame atty Clark Kelso a constitutional scholar from McGeorge School of Law Sen Liz Figueroa and Joan Breuner vice mayor of Oakland The suit asks for FERC to respond within days and a ruling within days Burton opened by explaining that they were suing FERC for not fulfilling its statutory authority to maintain fair and justifiable rates Hertzberg added that FERC had ignored the law and that they were compelled to file suit for Californians relief Joe Cotchett said the suit is very basic and is based on the Federal Power Act which he says limits power costs to fair and justifiable ratesA primarystrategy in this suit is to present it as a health and welfare and public safety suit he noted that there are million disabled children and convalescent homes in CA who can be adversely affected by blackouts He said it is not an economic lawsuit its about senior citizens disabled kids and convalescent facilities Today also happened to be the legislative day for the California Association of Health Facilities the nursing home trade assn and several nursing home workers were apparently asked to sit at the back of the room for effect Cotchett said FERC has been told for years that there were opportunities to exert market power He also claimed that a Redondo Beach facility obviously AES was fined million by FERC for taking its plant offline and substituting higher rates He said however that this order had been sealed He cited an industry report that predicts hours of blackouts this summer which could mean four hours a day That could be he said potentially the ruination of a lot of medicine in refrigeration Cotchett noted that only hospitals with more than beds are exempt from blackouts which does not protect surgical centers or many health facilities Jerry Brown added that prices are unjust and people are suffering Continued high prices could mean potential civic disruption and that there will be more actions to mobilize Western mayors Liz Figueroa spoke briefly to reiterate the health aspects of the lawsuit Burton had mentioned Clark Kelso who regularly appears on TV here as a legal expert and I believe was a colleague of Justice Anthony Kennedy in his Press Club appearance He said Kelso had appeared regularly in the media early on to say that the state had no standing to file the suitBurtons lawyers sent him the brief and Kelso thought enough of it tojoin the legal team Kelso reiterated that FERC has been aware of potential market power for three years and that the commission has delayed actionunreasonably It has failed to define fair and justifiable that failure he said violates the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of the Constitution Kelso said this is not a partisan issue and called upon fellow Republicans to support the effort Joan Breuner sp Oaklands vice mayor said only that she believed that if the energy situation were happening in Texas rather than California the president and FERC would have acted long ago During the QA session Cotchett said the urgency filing is necessary because generators supply of the electricity in CA and all five have rate renewals before FERC He also said one of the cases that is relevant is Bush v Gore in which the Supreme Court found that failure to set standards regarding elections obviously in that case violates the Equal Protection clause He also said six states have expressed interest in the case and have requested briefs Oregon Nevada Arizona Washington Minnesota and one other he didnt name None of these states has yet committed to joining the suit
