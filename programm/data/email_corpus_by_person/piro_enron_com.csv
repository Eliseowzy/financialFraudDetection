<13428599.1075844982356.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,piro@enron.com,2001-06-06 16:44:00,Q forecast Cc a spreadsheet that compares our original plan budget plus overview to our forecast for the nd quarter with actuals for April and May and last months forecast for June We are in the process of completing our May closing but the IBIT number for May is complete The June forecast was prepared last month and we are now in the process of updating our forecast of power cost and IBIT for June We should complete that next week Curves in the west continue to come down which will potentially reduce our IBIT for June but I will know more next week The spreadsheet shows million IBIT compared to what I provided you early this week of million The primary difference is power cost and our view that given the current movement in wholesale prices from May that power cost could rise by an additional million from that level We are currently in the dead band zone for the PCA so any change in power cost go right to IBIT There is one other issue related to power cost concerning our need to potentially increase our reserves for the California receivables AA continues to push us on this issue to increase the amount of reserves If we have a good June we might want to increase our reserves however this is something we will talk with Bob Butz about early next month when June results are available Please call if you would like to discuss this further We will have a better look at June next week once the updated forecast is completed

<521697.1075844978629.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,piro@enron.com,2001-06-04 16:45:00,nd quarter PGG EBIT Cc is an update on PGG earnings for the nd quarter and our ability increase our EBIT for PGG from our last current estimate of million to at least million I talked with Kirk Stevens this afternoon and after looking at our preliminary closing estimates for power cost for May our June current estimate of power cost and the amount of overview million we had targeted for the second quarter here is what we concluded based upon the assumption that prices for June do not continue to degrade from current levels like they have over the last month Current Estimate Provided to Enron for Q million Power Cost OM Improvement Overview million Catchup on Enron Allocations million Total EBIT million There are two sensitivities to this estimate that could lower this number by a combined million First we understand that we may be allocated charges for the Tomas transaction that ran through the PGG books last year We reserved million last year and we understand the total charges from GATX could be as much as million We did not include anything in our targets or plan for additional charges since this transaction was originated in Houston Second we have incurred million in costs associated with supply chain software associated with the sale of PGE to Sierra We will have to writeoff these costs in the second quarter since the software would only have value in a peoplesoft system environment We have had good discussions with Bob Butz about Enron covering these costs with some of the money they received from Sierra to terminate the transaction We will need to resolve this in the nd quarter or take the writeoff which would reduce our EBIT In addition as we have communicated before with you we still have an open long power position in June and all of the third quarter for reliability purposes which will continue to cause our earnings to be volatile Recently power curves in the west have been trading down but we would expect them to rise as the warm weather comes on and loads in California increase There have been some structural changes in the California market that could tend to dampen the price curves for this summer We will continue to keep you informed on what changes we are seeing as we go through June in terms of meeting the nd Quarter adjusted current estimate EBIT numbers discussed above If you have any questions or would like to discuss this further feel free to call me at
