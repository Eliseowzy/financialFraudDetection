For fun I love to hang out with my friends and family go on spontaneous adventurous trips go to parties read hike and attend sporting events The types of music that move me are songs that actually have something to say about life and romantic classical music I am the happiest when Im healthy and everything is going great I am happy when Im with my family and friends and the person that I am with I am the most at peace when I am away from noise and surrounded by beauty What I have done that makes me the proudest of myself is achieving things that I thought I never could If I could invite any people to dinner it would be my parents my best friend the person that Im in love with and my favorite cousin My idea of a perfect date is having a nice dinner and staying up all night talking I am looking for someone who is easy to talk to nonjudgemental and who enjoys life to the fullest I am not the type of person who likes to meet people in a bar setting I am looking for someone who makes me laugh and appreciates who I am ADDITIONAL TIPS from Matchcom Our anonymous remailer will strip away your real email address so that it will NOT appear in the From line You may also contact this
