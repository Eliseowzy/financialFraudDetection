Mika W ood Doug Yeung Charles Yoho Lisa SubjectGovernment Affairs Organization Announcement With the announcement of Enrons acquisition by Dynegy behind us and with the initial severance process completed it seemed an appropriate time to e ffect some organizational changes so that we as a group are better prepared to meet the challenges of the future Before I turn to the organizational changes I would like to say a few words about those who will be leaving t he company as a result of the initial severance youll know who they are b y their absence on the organizational chart Leading and being a part of t his group has been a privilegeI am thankful for every day that I have had that responsibility and thankful for however long I continue to have the re sponsibility This sense of privilege and thankfulness is primarily driven by having had the opportunity to get to know and care about such a dedicat ed group of professionals and support staff and who to a person are also very decent and good people To say goodbye to some of our colleagues is not easy I want to on behalf of all of us thank them for their hard wor k their integrity their decency and the good times and laughter that we shared I trust that many of us will find ways to sustain friendships that have been and will continue to be very special Thanks to each of you who are leaving for all you have done As to the organizational structure it has become increasingly apparent to me that the existing organization with a mix of groups organized along fun ctional and regional lines particularly within the US has impeded our ability to get things done in the most efficient fashion at times The nee d to rationalize the organizational structure in order to consolidate all US energy functions is a strong need from my perspective As a result Jim Steffes will lead the US Energy group along with Sue Nord who will j ointly report to Jim and myself Sue will assist Jim in the leadership of the group and take on project management responsibilities as warranted to h elp Jim shoulder a significant burden Also reporting to Jim will be a lea dership group for US Energy that will be as follows Wholesale Electrici ty will be led by Christi Nicolay Retail Electricity and Natural Gas will be led by Harry Kingerski Wholesale Gas will be led by Leslie Lawner La st but not least Jeff Dasovich and Sue Mara who will continue to focus o n California energy issues will report to Jim Sue Mara will also be part of the Wholesale electricity team Steve Montovano who will continue to report to me will lead a commercial development effort along with Dan Allegretti With the elimination of the regional groups I also recognize that there is a need to continue to focus on how we as a group address our politicalleg islative needs across the US Paul Kaufman will lead a small group that w ill address that need and that will focus on state political support Paul will also take the lead for Government Affairs in support of corporate dev elopment efforts across the US Much of the rest of the group remains the same Linda Robertson will conti nue to lead the Washington group with Sarah Novosel who reports to Linda taking the lead role in our coordination of activities at FERC Amr Ibrahi m will continue to lead the support of the Global Assets group and also con tinue to manage the Risk Analytics function Maggy Huson will take over su pport of the nonenergy business units which are as follows Global Market s Industrial Markets Networks and Broadband Rob Hemstock will continue to lead the support of Enron Canada Paul Dawson who heads up government affairs for Europe Sergio Assad who heads up government affairs for Sout h America and Mike Grimes and Mark Crowther who head up our Asian efforts will continue to jointly report to the business units and myself I am also forming a North American leadership group for Government Affairs to provide policy guidance for the larger group and the company That Comm ittee will consist of Rob Hemstock Maggy Huson Amr Ibrahim Paul Kaufman Harry Kingerski Leslie Lawner Steve Montovano Christi Nicolay Sue Nord Sarah Novosel Linda Robertson Jim Steffes and myself We will also con tinue to have an RCR Committee that will consist of Maggy Huson Harry King erski Sue Nord Linda Robertson Jim Steffes myself Finally I am form ing a DynegyEnron regulatory approvals working group that will consist of Jose Bestard Paul Dawson Paul Kaufman Sue Nord Sarah Novosel and myself No organizational structure or set of organizational changes is either perf ect or permanent I believe these changes will make us better and more pre pared for the future However we must be prepared to further adjust as th e future unfolds for the company One final note I am deeply sorry that each of you has had to live through this uncertain and troubled period for the company We are all saddened by the recognition that we are in the midst of changes that will leave our gr oup fundamentally altered but we must resolve to do our best for each othe r and ourselves during this period of change to ensure that what emerges f or those of us who do remain a part of the new Dynegy reflects the excelle nce and integrity that has characterized our group Personally I will do all I can for as long as I can to steer the group through this to the ver y best place possible Your continued dedication and support is very much appreciated Hang in there and thanks
