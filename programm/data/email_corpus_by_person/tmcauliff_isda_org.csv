Quarterly OCC Derivatives Report Shows BNA The Korea Herald Report Says Banks Brokerages Need to Advance into Investment For the survival of the domestic financial industry in global competition banks and securities companies need to be pushed to advance into investment banking the Korea Securities Research Institute asserted yesterday In a seminar on stock market development the institute presented a paper calling for expanded participation in investment banking by domestic financial institutions The global financial industry is heading for a single market as evidenced by the growing synchronization of financial markets around the world the report said Since the global financial industry is increasingly reshaped by mergers and acquisitions and business crossovers domestic financial institutions should pursue investment banking To promote investment banking in Korea the institute said measures should be taken to build reliable databases of economic and financial statistics foster experts encourage brokerages to develop their underwriting capabilities expand the concept of securities and encourage business crossovers among financial institutions As promising areas of investment banking the institute cited asset management mergers and acquisitions asset assessment trading of overthecounter products and derivatives and securities designing According to the institute the global financial market is experiencing a transition from direct funding through banks to direct funding through stock exchanges This sea change is demolishing the distinction between banks and securities firms Furthermore it said capital liberalization in a growing number of countries is accelerating the integration of national capital markets into a single global market The pursuit of large size and business crossovers will intensify in the future At the same time progress in financial engineering and information technology will give rise to more complicated financial products which will further liven up indirect investment instruments it said The institute said foreign financial institutions inroads into the domestic market would increase helping domestic institutions improve their business practices and financial technology Capital Markets Report OCC Official Still Hopeful For Derivatives Reform By Jonathan Nicholson WASHINGTON Dow Jones A top banking watchdog on Wednesday held out hope that laws dealing with derivatives transactions and bankruptcies may yet be updated this year If nothing happened it would not be disastrous Theres not a lot of time left on the calendar said Mike Brosnan deputy comptroller for risk evaluation for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency It would certainly be a better world if the bankruptcy and insolvency provisions were finalized Theres a chance that could happen he said Brosnan spoke to reporters during the agencys quarterly briefing on bank derivatives trading revenues The second session of the th Congress is expected to adjourn by early October as lawmakers make their way home for the fall campaign Brosnan said he hoped they could get to the provisions in a pending bankruptcy reform bill dealing with derivatives contracts The White House and Congressional Republicans have been bogged down in negotiations over bankruptcy for some time now The issues of contention however have revolved around consumer protection Brosnan said he hoped the comparatively noncontroversial sections regarding derivatives could be split from the bill and enacted separately if the bankruptcy bill fails to show progress It is my hope that that would occur and I think it would make for a safer and sounder banking system Brosnan said More sweeping reform in the shape of a reauthorization and updating of the Commodities Exchange Act is also pending in Congress The CEA includes the structural framework for derivatives trading and regulation in the US and modernizing it has been a priority for some years among regulators and trade groups However differing versions of CEA modernization have been approved by three committees in the US House Such divergent approaches are seen by many as limiting the chances for passage To the extent you could get one or both of those finalized in an agreeable format it would add certainty to US banks Brosnan said By increasing the legal certainty about the enforceability of derivatives contracts it would lower costs and keep business from moving overseas he said Dow Jones International News UK ROAD TO EURO Little Evidence of EuroCreep in UK By David Cottle LONDON Dow Jones When highprofile industrial giants Toyota and Unilever asked UK suppliers to price their goods in euros many thought more multinationals in the UK would follow suit possibly making the euro the effective business currency of the UK irrespective of a decision to join But socalled eurocreep where the euro becomes the de facto currency for British companies despite the UK retaining the pound has so far failed to materialize UKbased businesses are still overwhelmingly loyal to sterling despite big fluctuations against the euro I think there is disappointment in official proEurope circles that there hasnt been as much eurocreep as hoped for said Stephen Lewis chief economist at Monument Derivatives in London With Britain still undecided over whether it should adopt the euro many in the proeuro lobby say the commercial reality faced by many companies dealing with other European countries will mean they will end up having to use the single currency like it or not The issue gathered extra intensity recently when the British press highlighted the issue Eurocreep Overstated But many now say eurocreep has been overstated The fact is that eurocreep is hardly a factor at the moment said David Page UK economist at Investec Research What is more some analysts say that the euro has been almost as invisible in many eurozone countries where local currencies continue to hold sway and will remain so at least until euro notes and coins come into circulation in There is an obvious temptation for companies with large operations in the UK and significant sales in Europe to ask UK suppliers to invoice in euros This way they pass on the exchange risk down the supply chain Most of Toyotas UK production goes to Europe said an analyst at consultants Business Strategies so theyll lose significantly in terms of the exchange rate and its volatility should their suppliers price in sterling But Business Strategies reckon that these companies are reacting to a strong pound rather than displaying an undying loyalty for the single currency and that the weakness of the euro is a factor in its unpopularity as a trading currency Weak Euro Hobbles Acceptance Others share this view With the euro at current levels it would be odd to see a big push towards its use by European businesses said Klaus Baader senior international economist at Lehman Brothers in London Of the companies that are using the euro in the UK Toyota says it will only demand euro pricing from some of its new supply contracts We have only asked a few of our new suppliers to tender in euros and we have no plans at all to extend that base said Richard Ayres a spokesman for Toyota in the UK Unilever meanwhile has invited all its British contractors to tender in euros but a spokesman for the company said it wasnt compulsory for them to do so nor were there any plans to make it so We now obviously produce all our financial reports in euros and this is just an extension of that he added BNA Banks Trading Revenue Remains High Quarterly OCC Derivatives Report Shows By Adam Wasch Although trading revenue was down from the record billion recorded in the first quarter of US commercial banks earned billion from trading activities in the three months ending June the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency reported Sept The second quarter of represented only the third time the banking industry has earned more than billion from trading activities in a single quarter The first time it happened was in the first quarter of when commercial banks earned billion from trading according to the OCC which released its quarterly Bank Derivatives Report It has been six and a half years since the seven banks most active in trading have lost revenue from trading Trading revenue is earned from cash instruments and offbalance sheet derivative instruments A derivative is a financial instrument with a value based on the performance of an underlying asset interest rate foreign exchange rate or other indexes The OCCs quarterly report is based on quarterly call report information provided by domestic commercial banks More Banks Using Derivatives OCC also reported that the number of commercial banks holding derivatives increased by to The notional amount of derivatives reported by commercial banks grew percent to a record high trillion in the second quarter Most derivatives trading activity percent the OCC explained is used by banks in their capacity as a dealer to service bank customers The remainder is used to manage their own interest rate and other financial risk positions Contract volumes showed strong growth as bank customers managed risk positions in an environment characterized by rising interest rates and volatile and more uncertain market positions said Mike Brosnan OCC Deputy Comptroller for Risk Evaluation told reporters at a press briefing The average credit exposure from derivatives at the top seven trading banks fell to percent of riskbased capital OCC said although Brosnan still called this a huge percentage Credit exposure has declined since reaching a record high of percent of riskbased capital in the fourth quarter of There were no losses to speak of in the second quarter of Brosnan said The absence of pastdues and chargeoffs produced a credit quality of overthecounter derivatives that is noticeably better than that seen in most commercial and industrial loans portfolios he said Most banks use derivatives to hedge credit risk Brosnan said The current economic climate with its relatively large global swings in interest rates gives banks added incentive to use derivatives he said Even so less than percent of banks currently use derivatives But those that do are heavily scrutinized because of the highly sophisticated nature of derivatives and their potential to cost banks billions if deals go awry We watch banks derivative activity to a disproportionate degree Brosnan said Derivative Bills Pending in Congress Three separate but similar bills are pending in Congress that would offer more predictability for derivatives market participants if their transaction counterparties fail The bipartisan provisions which the OCC supports provide derivatives greater legal definition The relevant language appears in pending bankruptcy reform legislation legislation to reform the Commodities Exchange Act and in a standalone bill HR introduced by House Banking Committee Chairman James A Leach RIowa and passed by the banking committee July Such legislation would add certainty to the US derivatives market Brosnan said and prevent derivatives trading activity from migrating to other countries that better legally define derivatives If nothing happens in Congress it would not be a disaster but I hope it would occur he said Report Confirms Trends The notional volume of foreign exchange derivatives leveled off in the second quarter at trillion Continuing a trend interest rate derivatives rose to a record trillion Since when banks first began reporting data on credit derivatives the notional volume of these contracts has increased from billion to billion during the most recent quarter according to OCC Also there has been a pronounced and continued shift in the kind of derivatives contracts banks use Brosnan noted that as the volume of swap contracts has nearly doubled to trillion since the second half of the volume of futures and forwards trillion and options trillion has all but leveled off during the same period Brosnan said that this was due primarily to bank customers preference for overthecounter derivatives contracts such as swaps which can be tailored to meet a customers specific risk management needs Other trends include the increasing popularity of onetofive year equity contracts which rose percent in notional amounts Equity contracts of less than a year have also become more popular OCC said The OCCs latest quarterly report is available on the agencys Web site at

Issues New Credit Risk Guidance Financial Products Community Bankers Debate FASB on Loan Loss Reserves Fair Value Excerpted BNA Armey Pushes for Compromise on Swaps American Banker Deals Close But Obstacles Remain for US Commodities Bill Dow Jones News Service Talk of Euros Revival May Be Premature New York Times By Edmund L Andrews PRAGUE Sept As a show of market power the joint intervention to rescue the euro seems not to have much impressed its audience Today on the first full business day after major central banks intervened in the currency markets to revive the downtrodden European common currency and threatened to do so again the markets barely reacted The euro the currency adopted by European nations nearly two years ago traded throughout the day around cents to the dollar and weakened to cents in late New York trading compared with late Friday At its high point after the intervention the euro sold for about cents Todays rate is only around cents above its low and well below what some European officials consider its true value Indeed as finance ministers and central bankers from around the world attended annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank here today there were new signs that the American leaders are less worried than Europeans about reversing the euros decline The unexpected decision by the United States to join the rescue attempt on Friday surprised investors and lent further credibility to the European Central Banks move Japan and Canada intervened too But the tone of American statements was more ambivalent than that of European bankers Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence H Summers insisted over the weekend that the United States had not changed its view that a strong dollar was in the interests of the United States Ernst Welteke president of Germanys central bank let it be known today that he and other German officials were frustrated by Mr Summerss remarks as they seemed to undermine the use of future interventions They thought the remarks of Larry Summers had not been very helpful said RolfErnst Breuer chief executive of Deutsche Bank who met with Mr Welteke and other senior German officials here this morning European leaders made clear that they wanted to do more than simply stop the decline of the euro which has lost about percent of its value against the dollar since its introduction in January Over the weekend Finance Minister Laurent Fabius of France emphasized the need to achieve a higher rate Wim Duisenberg the European Central Bank president talked about achieving an orderly reversal in the euros decline Because a failed intervention would do greater damage to the euros credibility than no intervention at all it is hard to imagine that the European Central Bank will not act again European officials meeting here in Prague said repeatedly in the last couple of days that they would intervene again if appropriate and made clear that the euros current value is nowhere near the level they want But there was no hint of a followup campaign today nor was there any anxious repositioning of portfolios by currency traders in anticipation of one Adding to the pressure European officials are preparing for the possibility of more bad publicity on Thursday when Denmark votes on whether to adopt the euro Polls have shown the Danes almost evenly divided but the euros decline in the last few weeks appears to have strengthened the opponents While a Danish rejection of the euro might have little immediate impact on its trading value it could increase resistance in the two bigger countries that have stayed out of the monetary union Britain and Sweden Of course it would be bad news for the euro said Klaus Friedrich chief economist at Dresdner Bank Right now all news about the euro is bad news The more fundamental problem analysts say is that the euros weakness does not lend itself to a quick fix through central bank intervention Intervening on behalf of a currency generally works best if a large number of speculators have already been betting heavily in one direction because central banks can often squeeze out traders with a short but intense bout of buying in the other direction But the euros core troubles are reflected in longterm investment flows and may stem from the effects of corporate mergers and acquisitions as well as portfolio investments In general those investments have been pouring out of Europe and into the United States reflecting higher American growth It is the longterm flows that are leaving the country said Tony Norfield chief currency analyst at ABN Amro not the mad speculators There are very few positions out there to squeeze Indeed analysts say that money managers particularly in Asia bet too heavily in favor of the euro Many did so initially because they liked the idea of having an alternative to the dollar but then funds invested heavily on the mistaken conviction that the euro was overdue for a rebound after its early declines Those expectations were kindled by almost all major bank and investment banks which were overly optimistic about the euros prospects Axel Siedenberg head of economic research at Deutsche Bank said the goal of intervention is not so much to strengthen the euro as to keep it from sinking further And that he said is an attainable goal The intervention was not intended to start a new trend toward a strong euro Mr Siedenberg said The message to the market is that this is the bottom Financial Products Basel Issues New Credit Risk Guidance By Emma Davey The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision part of the Bank for International Settlement has issued revised guidance on credit risk management and disclosure intended to be applicable in a wide range of jurisdictions and for banks of varying degrees of sophistication The paper titled Principles for the Management of Credit Risk specifically addresses the following areas Establishing an appropriate credit risk environment Operating under a sound credit granting process Maintaining an appropriate credit administration measurement and monitoring process Ensuring adequate controls over credit risk The paper titled Best Practices for Credit Risk Disclosure aims to promote adequate and effective transparency of banks credit risk profiles by providing guidance to banks on useful credit risk disclosures and discussing supervisory information needs with respect to credit risk in banks The guidance covers credit risk in all types of banking activities including lending trading investments liquidityfunding management and asset management The Basel Committee said the revised guidance had taken into account the consultative drafts issued in July last year While these comments did not suggest fundamental changes to the papers but rather enhancements to what was there the treatment of proprietary information for example has been addressed in the disclosure paper Roger Cole chairman of the committees risk management group said that banks would differ in their specific credit risk management practices but the principles were described in the paper These principles should be applied in conjunction with sound practices related to the assessment of asset quality and adequacy of provisions and reserves which have been addressed in other recent Basel Committee documents along with the paper on disclosure of credit risk Chairman of the Transparency Group Jan Brockmeijer added that the objective of the disclosure paper was to encourage banks to provide market participants and the public with the information they need to make meaningful assessments of a banks credit risk profile Transparency in this area is particularly important BNA Community Bankers Debate FASB on Loan Loss Reserves Fair Value Excerpted By Steve Burkholder NORWALK ConnA discussion on bad debt reserves by a leading group of community bankers and the Financial Accounting Standards Board turned into sharp debate Sept as the bankers and FASB members spoke of the clash of bank regulators concerns with the basic motive of accounting rulemakers to ensure that reporting rules are followed properly For more than a year accounting for loan loss allowances has been a hot topic among banks their federal regulators standardsetters at the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants accountants at the Securities and Exchange Commission andso far peripherally but significantlyFASB The SEC was not mentioned in the verbal sparring between FASB members and delegates from the Independent Community Bankers of America ICBA However it was SEC Chairman Arthur Levitts comments in late about loan loss allowances that sparked the wider debate in industry public accounting and among regulators Levitt cited loan loss accounting as one way by which corporate earnings reportsin this case those of bankscan be manipulated through use of socalled cookie jar reserves That view led in large part to a public debate between the commission and the banking agencies including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve Board and carefully crafted interagency statements offered from Washington to calm bankers Doubts About Utility of Fair Value Accounting Separately at the meeting with FASB representatives of the community bankers group voiced doubts about the utility of moving to fair valuebased accounting for all financial assets and financial liabilities and more debate ensued The accounting board has embarked on a rulemaking project that would lead to a goal of full fair value accounting for financial instruments provided difficult measurement questions can be answered That effort is expected to last years As a user of financial statements Id rather have costbased amounts in financial statements said Kurt Henstorf of First National Bank headquartered south of Omaha Neb I totally disagree said FASBs Foster His view was buttressed by comments from Lucas who said as an auditor he would rather seek to check fair valuebased amounts for banks loans that depend on current accounting for bad debt reserves Henstorf disputed that The boards staff project manager of the fair value effort Ronald Lott offered an anecdote that counters a refrain sounded by the banking communitythat security analysts are not clamoring for fair values in financial statements Lott said he took part in a recent panel discussion in which analysts appeared to voice a desire for more fair valuebased information They seem very interested in fair value said Lott They just didnt trust whats in the financial statements Near the end of the discussion on fair value Foster offered a prediction about the length of FASBs rulemaking project He ventured that his colleagues would not disagree Looking at the gathered bankers Foster said All of you will be retired by the time this goes through American Banker Armey Pushes for Compromise on Swaps By Rob Garver WASHINGTON In a sign that Republicans are serious about passing a bill to revise the laws governing derivatives transactions Majority Leader Richard K Armey met Tuesday with representatives of three House committees each pushing different versions of the same bill and urged them to hammer out a deal A spokeswoman for Rep Armey said He pulled them together to say Look we need to get this done this year so lets wrap it up She added that Rep Armey believes that the differences between the competing bills can be resolved by Thursday in time to schedule a vote on the House floor next week The House Agriculture Banking and Commerce committees have passed versions of a bill that would modernize the Commodity Exchange Act Of the three the Banking Committee version sponsored by Chairman Jim Leach is most popular with the financial services industry because it would provide socalled legal certainty for swaps transactions Swaps and other overthecounter derivatives are private agreements under which two parties agree to exchange the risk on certain assets as a hedge against loss Bankers have expressed concern that because swaps bear a strong resemblance to futures the Commodity Futures Trading Commission might assert regulatory authority over them This would create a huge problem for US banks which held swaps with more than trillion in notional value at the end of June because futures are legal only if they are traded on an exchange If the CFTC were to successfully argue that swaps are futures the legal enforceability of swaps could be in jeopardy because they are not traded on an exchange but are negotiated on an individual basis The House Banking bill would explicitly bar the CFTC from regulating swaps Rep Leach said in an interview with American Banker last month that passing a bill that would provide legal certainty for swaps was his top priority during his final month as committee chairman Rep Leachs bill is also the most likely to satisfy several requirements laid out by Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm The Texas Republican told reporters last week at the American Bankers Associations annual convention that legal certainty for swaps is one of his central concerns and added that a bill that protects swaps only from regulation by the CFTC would not go far enough He wants the Securities and Exchange Commission to explicitly be barred from regulating swaps as well Right now the uncertainty is about the CFTC exerting some supposed authority over swaps and casting doubt on their validity But if the CFTC is banned regulation doth abhor a vacuum what is to keep the SEC from coming in and doing exactly the same thing Once that is fixed then we are really going to begin in earnest to try to pass this bill But Im not getting on board until thats done Sen Gramm said that he would prefer a bill in which the SEC and the CFTC have no jurisdiction at all over swaps but he has suggested a compromise under which the SEC would have the authority to intervene to protect consumers from price manipulation or fraud Thats a good compromise I think they ought to take it Sen Gramm said Swaps are not the only contentious issue raised by the competing bills Also being debated is the repeal of the ShadJohnson accord which for years has barred the trading of futures contracts based on single stocks The issue had been holding up all three versions of the bill as the CFTC and the SEC debated how to regulate them A deal between the agencies announced Sept apparently cleared the way for the ShadJohnson repeal although it raised loud objections from stock and futures exchanges Administration officials have shown a high degree of support for updating derivatives rules The CFTCSEC deal was brokered by Treasury Secretary Lawrence H Summers and in a meeting with lobbyists last week other Treasury officials said the administration was committed to lobbying lawmakers to pass a bill this session modernizing swaps and other derivatives trading Treasury Assistant Secretary Lewis A Sachs reiterated the administrations position on Tuesday It would be unfortunate if we were to miss this historic opportunity to modernize the regulatory structure of our derivatives markets he said during a speech in New York Dow Jones News Service Deals Close But Obstacles Remain for US Commodities Bill By Dawn Kopecki WASHINGTON Dow Jones Lawmakers working on drafting new commodities laws have several key agreements in the works but arent likely to have legislation ready to go by Monday as some lawmakers predicted House Majority Leader Dick Armey RTexas told reporters Tuesday that GOP leaders expected to officially file a bill that rewrites US commodities laws Thursday and vote on the legislation Monday But interviews with lawmakers regulators committee staff and lobbyists indicate that they still have a lot of work left to do on a complicated bill with a limited amount of time left in this congressional session Lawmakers have less than a month left to finish their work for the year with only two of mustpass federal spending bills have been signed into law The Senate and House are engaged Theyre engaged at the leadership level the various exchanges are engaged the regulators are engaged The greatest challenge is the clock one Treasury Department official told Dow Jones Newswires All parties are in the process of open and constructive dialogue Lawmakers are rushing to finish legislation that would free overthecounter derivatives transactions from federal oversight ease regulations of futures exchanges and lift the year ban on trading singlestock futures GOP leaders have put the legislation on the fast track in Congress amid fears that US markets are rapidly losing out to foreign rivals that operate under less stringent laws That anxiety was intensified last week after the London International Financial Futures Options Exchange announced that it will begin trading futures on individual US and European stocks Jan Lawmakers and regulators are just about finished with a deal that would repeal the socalled ShadJohnson accord responsible for banning singlestock futures in the US nearly two decades ago While the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission reached their own agreement on the issue about two weeks ago the deal prompted securities exchanges to pull their support from the bill Equities markets felt the deal gave singlestock futures an unfair competitive advantage over stock options with regards to margin requirements transaction fees and tax treatment The new deal worked out over the last week or so is said to even margin requirements and tax treatment for the two products and set a twocent transaction fee on singlestock futures The details for margin requirements were not immediately available and House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer RTexas is said to still be drafting the legislation that would guarantee equal tax treatment for the two products The tax issue is said to still be open A number of other issues similarly remain unresolved Lawmakers and regulators have yet to solve differences of opinion over how to regulate energy and metal swaps And Senate Banking Chairman Phil Gramm RTexas said he still isnt satisfied with how the legislation treats other swaps agreements It is not clear that most swaps contracts used by institutional investors to hedge interest rate currency or other types of risk are legally enforceable if challenged in court Sen Gramm told reporters last week that he wants legislation that would essentially bar the SEC and CFTC from regulating swaps transactions except in cases of fraud or price manipulation But regulators are trying to strike a balance that doesnt diminish the authority of the CFTC and SEC to regulate other products or markets There are also still disagreements over whether or not swaps agreements based on bank products should be overseen by bank regulators Some concerns have been raised about the language which the banking committee approved said David Runkel spokesman for the House Banking Committee referring to a provision that requires bank regulators to oversee those products No one wants to talk about specifics when theyre still trying to work out an agreement on the bill Runkel added eluding to give any other details The CFTC and Treasury are said to have problems with that aspect of the bill While regulators and lawmakers agree its important to limit onerous regulations of swaps for large institutional investors no one can agree on what to do with the possibility of selling swaps to small retail investors The House Banking Committee added a provision to their version of the bill that opens the door to that new market The product doesnt currently exist And the prospect of allowing institutions to sell derivatives products to the general public makes many in Washington a little queasy Wed love to have it But weve told everyone that we dont want it if it blows up the bill one derivatives industry source said in an interview It doesnt do anyone any good if we dont get a bill Still lawmakers and regulators are working day and night to try to beat the clock and get a bill passed before lawmakers dash out of town to campaign for Novembers federal elections The dilemma lawmakers face in getting the bill passed this year is the many constituencies that have a stake in the issue Because Congress has so little time left the bill has to garner nearly unanimous approval from the House agriculture banking commerce and ways and means committees as well as the Senate agriculture and banking committees the securities and futures exchanges brokerage firms banks and the rest of Wall Street Then there are the securities bank and futures regulators who all have to sign off on the bill to give it even the slimmest chance of passing before the end of this year But everyone is remaining optimistic Theres a genuine effort from all sides to get together and work this thing out said a spokesman for House Commerce Chairman Tom Bliley RVa Bliley had previously promised to block the bill

riskbased capital OCC said although Brosnan still called this a huge percentage Credit exposure has declined since reaching a record high of percent of riskbased capital in the fourth quarter of There were no losses to speak of in the second quarter of Brosnan said The absence of pastdues and chargeoffs produced a credit quality of overthecounter derivatives that is noticeably better than that seen in most commercial and industrial loans portfolios he said Most banks use derivatives to hedge credit risk Brosnan said The current economic climate with its relatively large global swings in interest rates gives banks added incentive to use derivatives he said Even so less than percent of banks currently use derivatives But those that do are heavily scrutinized because of the highly sophisticated nature of derivatives and their potential to cost banks billions if deals go awry We watch banks derivative activity to a disproportionate degree Brosnan said Derivative Bills Pending in Congress Three separate but similar bills are pending in Congress that would offer more predictability for derivatives market participants if their transaction counterparties fail The bipartisan provisions which the OCC supports provide derivatives greater legal definition The relevant language appears in pending bankruptcy reform legislation legislation to reform the Commodities Exchange Act and in a standalone bill HR introduced by House Banking Committee Chairman James A Leach RIowa and passed by the banking committee July Such legislation would add certainty to the US derivatives market Brosnan said and prevent derivatives trading activity from migrating to other countries that better legally define derivatives If nothing happens in Congress it would not be a disaster but I hope it would occur he said Report Confirms Trends The notional volume of foreign exchange derivatives leveled off in the second quarter at trillion Continuing a trend interest rate derivatives rose to a record trillion Since when banks first began reporting data on credit derivatives the notional volume of these contracts has increased from billion to billion during the most recent quarter according to OCC Also there has been a pronounced and continued shift in the kind of derivatives contracts banks use Brosnan noted that as the volume of swap contracts has nearly doubled to trillion since the second half of the volume of futures and forwards trillion and options trillion has all but leveled off during the same period Brosnan said that this was due primarily to bank customers preference for overthecounter derivatives contracts such as swaps which can be tailored to meet a customers specific risk management needs Other trends include the increasing popularity of onetofive year equity contracts which rose percent in notional amounts Equity contracts of less than a year have also become more popular OCC said The OCCs latest quarterly report is available on the agencys Web site at

Issues New Credit Risk Guidance Financial Products Community Bankers Debate FASB on Loan Loss Reserves Fair Value Excerpted BNA Armey Pushes for Compromise on Swaps American Banker Deals Close But Obstacles Remain for US Commodities Bill Dow Jones News Service Talk of Euros Revival May Be Premature New York Times By Edmund L Andrews PRAGUE Sept As a show of market power the joint intervention to rescue the euro seems not to have much impressed its audience Today on the first full business day after major central banks intervened in the currency markets to revive the downtrodden European common currency and threatened to do so again the markets barely reacted The euro the currency adopted by European nations nearly two years ago traded throughout the day around cents to the dollar and weakened to cents in late New York trading compared with late Friday At its high point after the intervention the euro sold for about cents Todays rate is only around cents above its low and well below what some European officials consider its true value Indeed as finance ministers and central bankers from around the world attended annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank here today there were new signs that the American leaders are less worried than Europeans about reversing the euros decline The unexpected decision by the United States to join the rescue attempt on Friday surprised investors and lent further credibility to the European Central Banks move Japan and Canada intervened too But the tone of American statements was more ambivalent than that of European bankers Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence H Summers insisted over the weekend that the United States had not changed its view that a strong dollar was in the interests of the United States Ernst Welteke president of Germanys central bank let it be known today that he and other German officials were frustrated by Mr Summerss remarks as they seemed to undermine the use of future interventions They thought the remarks of Larry Summers had not been very helpful said RolfErnst Breuer chief executive of Deutsche Bank who met with Mr Welteke and other senior German officials here this morning European leaders made clear that they wanted to do more than simply stop the decline of the euro which has lost about percent of its value against the dollar since its introduction in January Over the weekend Finance Minister Laurent Fabius of France emphasized the need to achieve a higher rate Wim Duisenberg the European Central Bank president talked about achieving an orderly reversal in the euros decline Because a failed intervention would do greater damage to the euros credibility than no intervention at all it is hard to imagine that the European Central Bank will not act again European officials meeting here in Prague said repeatedly in the last couple of days that they would intervene again if appropriate and made clear that the euros current value is nowhere near the level they want But there was no hint of a followup campaign today nor was there any anxious repositioning of portfolios by currency traders in anticipation of one Adding to the pressure European officials are preparing for the possibility of more bad publicity on Thursday when Denmark votes on whether to adopt the euro Polls have shown the Danes almost evenly divided but the euros decline in the last few weeks appears to have strengthened the opponents While a Danish rejection of the euro might have little immediate impact on its trading value it could increase resistance in the two bigger countries that have stayed out of the monetary union Britain and Sweden Of course it would be bad news for the euro said Klaus Friedrich chief economist at Dresdner Bank Right now all news about the euro is bad news The more fundamental problem analysts say is that the euros weakness does not lend itself to a quick fix through central bank intervention Intervening on behalf of a currency generally works best if a large number of speculators have already been betting heavily in one direction because central banks can often squeeze out traders with a short but intense bout of buying in the other direction But the euros core troubles are reflected in longterm investment flows and may stem from the effects of corporate mergers and acquisitions as well as portfolio investments In general those investments have been pouring out of Europe and into the United States reflecting higher American growth It is the longterm flows that are leaving the country said Tony Norfield chief currency analyst at ABN Amro not the mad speculators There are very few positions out there to squeeze Indeed analysts say that money managers particularly in Asia bet too heavily in favor of the euro Many did so initially because they liked the idea of having an alternative to the dollar but then funds invested heavily on the mistaken conviction that the euro was overdue for a rebound after its early declines Those expectations were kindled by almost all major bank and investment banks which were overly optimistic about the euros prospects Axel Siedenberg head of economic research at Deutsche Bank said the goal of intervention is not so much to strengthen the euro as to keep it from sinking further And that he said is an attainable goal The intervention was not intended to start a new trend toward a strong euro Mr Siedenberg said The message to the market is that this is the bottom Financial Products Basel Issues New Credit Risk Guidance By Emma Davey The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision part of the Bank for International Settlement has issued revised guidance on credit risk management and disclosure intended to be applicable in a wide range of jurisdictions and for banks of varying degrees of sophistication The paper titled Principles for the Management of Credit Risk specifically addresses the following areas Establishing an appropriate credit risk environment Operating under a sound credit granting process Maintaining an appropriate credit administration measurement and monitoring process Ensuring adequate controls over credit risk The paper titled Best Practices for Credit Risk Disclosure aims to promote adequate and effective transparency of banks credit risk profiles by providing guidance to banks on useful credit risk disclosures and discussing supervisory information needs with respect to credit risk in banks The guidance covers credit risk in all types of banking activities including lending trading investments liquidityfunding management and asset management The Basel Committee said the revised guidance had taken into account the consultative drafts issued in July last year While these comments did not suggest fundamental changes to the papers but rather enhancements to what was there the treatment of proprietary information for example has been addressed in the disclosure paper Roger Cole chairman of the committees risk management group said that banks would differ in their specific credit risk management practices but the principles were described in the paper These principles should be applied in conjunction with sound practices related to the assessment of asset quality and adequacy of provisions and reserves which have been addressed in other recent Basel Committee documents along with the paper on disclosure of credit risk Chairman of the Transparency Group Jan Brockmeijer added that the objective of the disclosure paper was to encourage banks to provide market participants and the public with the information they need to make meaningful assessments of a banks credit risk profile Transparency in this area is particularly important BNA Community Bankers Debate FASB on Loan Loss Reserves Fair Value Excerpted By Steve Burkholder NORWALK ConnA discussion on bad debt reserves by a leading group of community bankers and the Financial Accounting Standards Board turned into sharp debate Sept as the bankers and FASB members spoke of the clash of bank regulators concerns with the basic motive of accounting rulemakers to ensure that reporting rules are followed properly For more than a year accounting for loan loss allowances has been a hot topic among banks their federal regulators standardsetters at the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants accountants at the Securities and Exchange Commission andso far peripherally but significantlyFASB The SEC was not mentioned in the verbal sparring between FASB members and delegates from the Independent Community Bankers of America ICBA However it was SEC Chairman Arthur Levitts comments in late about loan loss allowances that sparked the wider debate in industry public accounting and among regulators Levitt cited loan loss accounting as one way by which corporate earnings reportsin this case those of bankscan be manipulated through use of socalled cookie jar reserves That view led in large part to a public debate between the commission and the banking agencies including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve Board and carefully crafted interagency statements offered from Washington to calm bankers Doubts About Utility of Fair Value Accounting Separately at the meeting with FASB representatives of the community bankers group voiced doubts about the utility of moving to fair valuebased accounting for all financial assets and financial liabilities and more debate ensued The accounting board has embarked on a rulemaking project that would lead to a goal of full fair value accounting for financial instruments provided difficult measurement questions can be answered That effort is expected to last years As a user of financial statements Id rather have costbased amounts in financial statements said Kurt Henstorf of First National Bank headquartered south of Omaha Neb I totally disagree said FASBs Foster His view was buttressed by comments from Lucas who said as an auditor he would rather seek to check fair valuebased amounts for banks loans that depend on current accounting for bad debt reserves Henstorf disputed that The boards staff project manager of the fair value effort Ronald Lott offered an anecdote that counters a refrain sounded by the banking communitythat security analysts are not clamoring for fair values in financial statements Lott said he took part in a recent panel discussion in which analysts appeared to voice a desire for more fair valuebased information They seem very interested in fair value said Lott They just didnt trust whats in the financial statements Near the end of the discussion on fair value Foster offered a prediction about the length of FASBs rulemaking project He ventured that his colleagues would not disagree Looking at the gathered bankers Foster said All of you will be retired by the time this goes through American Banker Armey Pushes for Compromise on Swaps By Rob Garver WASHINGTON In a sign that Republicans are serious about passing a bill to revise the laws governing derivatives transactions Majority Leader Richard K Armey met Tuesday with representatives of three House committees each pushing different versions of the same bill and urged them to hammer out a deal A spokeswoman for Rep Armey said He pulled them together to say Look we need to get this done this year so lets wrap it up She added that Rep Armey believes that the differences between the competing bills can be resolved by Thursday in time to schedule a vote on the House floor next week The House Agriculture Banking and Commerce committees have passed versions of a bill that would modernize the Commodity Exchange Act Of the three the Banking Committee version sponsored by Chairman Jim Leach is most popular with the financial services industry because it would provide socalled legal certainty for swaps transactions Swaps and other overthecounter derivatives are private agreements under which two parties agree to exchange the risk on certain assets as a hedge against loss Bankers have expressed concern that because swaps bear a strong resemblance to futures the Commodity Futures Trading Commission might assert regulatory authority over them This would create a huge problem for US banks which held swaps with more than trillion in notional value at the end of June because futures are legal only if they are traded on an exchange If the CFTC were to successfully argue that swaps are futures the legal enforceability of swaps could be in jeopardy because they are not traded on an exchange but are negotiated on an individual basis The House Banking bill would explicitly bar the CFTC from regulating swaps Rep Leach said in an interview with American Banker last month that passing a bill that would provide legal certainty for swaps was his top priority during his final month as committee chairman Rep Leachs bill is also the most likely to satisfy several requirements laid out by Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm The Texas Republican told reporters last week at the American Bankers Associations annual convention that legal certainty for swaps is one of his central concerns and added that a bill that protects swaps only from regulation by the CFTC would not go far enough He wants the Securities and Exchange Commission to explicitly be barred from regulating swaps as well Right now the uncertainty is about the CFTC exerting some supposed authority over swaps and casting doubt on their validity But if the CFTC is banned regulation doth abhor a vacuum what is to keep the SEC from coming in and doing exactly the same thing Once that is fixed then we are really going to begin in earnest to try to pass this bill But Im not getting on board until thats done Sen Gramm said that he would prefer a bill in which the SEC and the CFTC have no jurisdiction at all over swaps but he has suggested a compromise under which the SEC would have the authority to intervene to protect consumers from price manipulation or fraud Thats a good compromise I think they ought to take it Sen Gramm said Swaps are not the only contentious issue raised by the competing bills Also being debated is the repeal of the ShadJohnson accord which for years has barred the trading of futures contracts based on single stocks The issue had been holding up all three versions of the bill as the CFTC and the SEC debated how to regulate them A deal between the agencies announced Sept apparently cleared the way for the ShadJohnson repeal although it raised loud objections from stock and futures exchanges Administration officials have shown a high degree of support for updating derivatives rules The CFTCSEC deal was brokered by Treasury Secretary Lawrence H Summers and in a meeting with lobbyists last week other Treasury officials said the administration was committed to lobbying lawmakers to pass a bill this session modernizing swaps and other derivatives trading Treasury Assistant Secretary Lewis A Sachs reiterated the administrations position on Tuesday It would be unfortunate if we were to miss this historic opportunity to modernize the regulatory structure of our derivatives markets he said during a speech in New York Dow Jones News Service Deals Close But Obstacles Remain for US Commodities Bill By Dawn Kopecki WASHINGTON Dow Jones Lawmakers working on drafting new commodities laws have several key agreements in the works but arent likely to have legislation ready to go by Monday as some lawmakers predicted House Majority Leader Dick Armey RTexas told reporters Tuesday that GOP leaders expected to officially file a bill that rewrites US commodities laws Thursday and vote on the legislation Monday But interviews with lawmakers regulators committee staff and lobbyists indicate that they still have a lot of work left to do on a complicated bill with a limited amount of time left in this congressional session Lawmakers have less than a month left to finish their work for the year with only two of mustpass federal spending bills have been signed into law The Senate and House are engaged Theyre engaged at the leadership level the various exchanges are engaged the regulators are engaged The greatest challenge is the clock one Treasury Department official told Dow Jones Newswires All parties are in the process of open and constructive dialogue Lawmakers are rushing to finish legislation that would free overthecounter derivatives transactions from federal oversight ease regulations of futures exchanges and lift the year ban on trading singlestock futures GOP leaders have put the legislation on the fast track in Congress amid fears that US markets are rapidly losing out to foreign rivals that operate under less stringent laws That anxiety was intensified last week after the London International Financial Futures Options Exchange announced that it will begin trading futures on individual US and European stocks Jan Lawmakers and regulators are just about finished with a deal that would repeal the socalled ShadJohnson accord responsible for banning singlestock futures in the US nearly two decades ago While the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission reached their own agreement on the issue about two weeks ago the deal prompted securities exchanges to pull their support from the bill Equities markets felt the deal gave singlestock futures an unfair competitive advantage over stock options with regards to margin requirements transaction fees and tax treatment The new deal worked out over the last week or so is said to even margin requirements and tax treatment for the two products and set a twocent transaction fee on singlestock futures The details for margin requirements were not immediately available and House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer RTexas is said to still be drafting the legislation that would guarantee equal tax treatment for the two products The tax issue is said to still be open A number of other issues similarly remain unresolved Lawmakers and regulators have yet to solve differences of opinion over how to regulate energy and metal swaps And Senate Banking Chairman Phil Gramm RTexas said he still isnt satisfied with how the legislation treats other swaps agreements It is not clear that most swaps contracts used by institutional investors to hedge interest rate currency or other types of risk are legally enforceable if challenged in court Sen Gramm told reporters last week that he wants legislation that would essentially bar the SEC and CFTC from regulating swaps transactions except in cases of fraud or price manipulation But regulators are trying to strike a balance that doesnt diminish the authority of the CFTC and SEC to regulate other products or markets There are also still disagreements over whether or not swaps agreements based on bank products should be overseen by bank regulators Some concerns have been raised about the language which the banking committee approved said David Runkel spokesman for the House Banking Committee referring to a provision that requires bank regulators to oversee those products No one wants to talk about specifics when theyre still trying to work out an agreement on the bill Runkel added eluding to give any other details The CFTC and Treasury are said to have problems with that aspect of the bill While regulators and lawmakers agree its important to limit onerous regulations of swaps for large institutional investors no one can agree on what to do with the possibility of selling swaps to small retail investors The House Banking Committee added a provision to their version of the bill that opens the door to that new market The product doesnt currently exist And the prospect of allowing institutions to sell derivatives products to the general public makes many in Washington a little queasy Wed love to have it But weve told everyone that we dont want it if it blows up the bill one derivatives industry source said in an interview It doesnt do anyone any good if we dont get a bill Still lawmakers and regulators are working day and night to try to beat the clock and get a bill passed before lawmakers dash out of town to campaign for Novembers federal elections The dilemma lawmakers face in getting the bill passed this year is the many constituencies that have a stake in the issue Because Congress has so little time left the bill has to garner nearly unanimous approval from the House agriculture banking commerce and ways and means committees as well as the Senate agriculture and banking committees the securities and futures exchanges brokerage firms banks and the rest of Wall Street Then there are the securities bank and futures regulators who all have to sign off on the bill to give it even the slimmest chance of passing before the end of this year But everyone is remaining optimistic Theres a genuine effort from all sides to get together and work this thing out said a spokesman for House Commerce Chairman Tom Bliley RVa Bliley had previously promised to block the bill
