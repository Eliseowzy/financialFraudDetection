volumes in order to attract more investors to ensure that it could repay loans to the bank according to court papers JP Morgan has filed suit against insurers to collect million in surety bonds guaranteeing natural gas and crude oil contracts between Enron and Mahonia Ltd a subsidiary of JP Morgan Enron filed for bankruptcy in December and defaulted on the contracts The insurers claim the trades were actually disguised loans to Enron by JP Morgan and that they would not have guaranteed the transactions if their real intent had been revealed JP Morgan used Mahonia to buy natural gas from Enron which it then resold back to the company at a somewhat higher price the difference essentially being interest on a secret loan by the bank according to the insurers JP Morgan strongly refutes the allegations saying they are an attempt to get out of paying a straightforward claim The bank pointed out that the contracts contain language stating The obligations of each Surety hereunder are absolute and unconditional irrespective of any circumstance whatsoever Apart from the energy contracts in question Enron owes JP Morgan billion in secured and unsecured loans letters of credit and other financial obligations It is one of banks being sued by Enron shareholders who claim the banks intentionally inflated Enrons stock prices to reap billions in profits for themselves

the early part of may be a major turning point in the direction of prices Our data shows the time cycles pointing lower into the first quarter of says Walter Zimmerman Vice President with United Energy New York Zimmerman is an advocate of combining the intricacies of Elliott Wave analysis with the seasonal and cyclic characteristics of natural gas prices to make both short and long term forecasts One of the most intense and often difficult to understand analytical approaches is the us of matching preconceived price patterns to that of current price behavior to see when trends in prices may begin or end Elliott Wave analysis is just such a technique The general rule is that an Elliott pattern requires five waves to be completed three in the primary direction and two counter to the main trend Thus if natural gas prices have completed a five wave pattern then the current trend either up or down should be over Typically prices are never exactly at the precise beginning or end of a five wave pattern and analysts often refer to price moves as being one of the five waves We think there has been an initial leg down from to and now the market is correcting that move higher says Zimmerman Seasonality is also important and is often more easily understood that the vagaries of Elliott Wave analysis The seasonality of this market is that prices typically peak in May and bottom in January There tends to be a correction in between those two points where there is a bottom in September and a rally into November Longer term we are very very bullish We think that the is a major multi year low September and all my longer term time cycle analyses point up to to A hedger would want to hedge out to the end of the year but thats about it In January all the cycles turn up at the

Natural Gas Contracts Companies looking to enter Mexicos closed energy industry are cautiously optimistic about the controversial politically contested multiple service contracts to produce natural gas in the Burgos basin on the Texas border Pemex plans to open a data room in November and says the contracts would be finalized and the development blocks defined in October Pemex will offer the controversial multiple service contracts individually in quick succession in November The contracts would then be evaluated by February and signed in March of However the question for the companies is whether the incentive of the deals compared to other options around the world are great enough to warrant the investment Under the Mexican constitution Pemex is not allowed to offer a percentage of the commodity produced as payment to companies because all natural resources must remain in the hands of a government agency In lieu of a percentage Pemex proposes payment for services according to a menu of prices but payment will depend on Mexico receiving income from natural gas produced Some big oil companies contend that scenario puts the burden of risk on them especially if natural gas prices plunge The new contracts will be renewable for up to years instead of only or years Opponents say they are a means of privatizing the countrys oil and natural gas industry which was nationalized in and is widely regarded as a symbol of Mexican sovereignty and economic independence However a number of companies are interested in the contracts some just to get a foothold in Mexicos energy sector But there are also concerns about the short amount of time allowed by Pemex between the opening of the data room in November for seismic information and the award of bids in February because it forces companies into offering conservative bids Pemex indicated it might be open to extending the time frame Tomorrows Market Opportunities Today ENDUR Never again be outpaced by changing

Credit Concerns Erode Energy Trading Business The shrinking natural gas trading industry in the US and Canada amid concerns over credit ratings and investor confidence has made it increasingly difficult to find buyers After Aquila and Engage Energy recently announced that they were closing their Canadian operations the gap in trading partners grew significantly Some of Engages operations will be taken over by Dukes Canadian natural gas trading operation Duke acquired Engage as part of its billion takeover of Westcoast Energy Traders say they are buying natural gas but are having a hard time turning it around because credit concerns have eroded the number of companies they are currently allowed to deal with Credit rating agencies have indicated that energy trading companies may not qualify for an investment grade rating due to the volatility of the sector Last week Aquila said it was pulling back from the energy trading after cutting its earnings forecast and dividend Industry insiders say that Aquila was told if they had a trading company their credit would be downgraded and if they didnt their investment grade rating would be maintained However the shift away from energy trading could prove beneficial to electronic trading platforms in which participants have to clear credit requirements before they can post any bids or offers Also the downturn in energy

interested in up to politically contested multiple service contracts to produce natural gas in the Burgos basin along the Texas border Pemex says the contracts would be finalized and the development blocks defined in October Pemex will offer the much debated multiple service contracts individually in quick succession in November The contracts would then be evaluated by February and signed in March of The data room will provide detailed seismic information about the blocks of land to be developed each of which is square miles Pemex and the government are inviting private participation in order to double nonassociated natural gas production at Burgos to about Bcf per day in order to meet growing demand by The contracts have garnered more interest than expected with about companies from around the world seeking more information Under the Mexican constitution Pemex is not allowed to offer a percentage of the commodity produced as payment to companies because all natural resources must remain in the hands of a government agency The contracts are seen as a chance to gain a foothold in Mexicos closed hydrocarbon industry The new contracts will be renewable for up to years instead of only or years Opponents say they are a means of privatizing the countrys oil and natural gas industry which was nationalized in and is widely regarded by citizens as a symbol of Mexican sovereignty and economic independence Pemex will be examining the companies solvency experience and execution capacity before awarding the contracts Tomorrows Market Opportunities Today ENDUR Never again be

of PJM Capacity Market Manipulation PPL Corp has issued a rebuttal to allegations made by Pennsylvania PUC that it unfairly manipulated power prices After reviewing PPLs actions in the PJM capacity market the PUC released a report last week accusing the companys subsidiary PPL EnergyPlus of manipulating wholesale power markets when prices suddenly jumped from per MWh to per MWh in January of PPL says that there was no independent factfinding no interviews of witnesses and no review of documents and records other than various filings and materials provided by PJM before the commission released its report The PUC report accused PPL of deliberately withholding power from the capacity market on the PJM grid in order to create an artificial shortage and drive prices up PPL contends that all of its transactions in the capacity market were legal and ethical and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations PPL argues that PJMs market rules did not prohibit its actions at the time But by April when PJM changed its rules with FERC capacity prices fell sharply and returned to normal price patterns the PUC said PPL also pointed out that the FERC had approved the design and operation of the PJM capacity market and after investigations did not take any action against the company Separately PPL has said it would eliminate jobs or of its work force to cut costs In addition it will

TXU Electric has filed a plan with the Texas PUC to settle charges that it erroneously collected stranded payment costs before the state opens its power market next week The costs are aimed at offsetting expenses for building generating plants and related regulatory financing plans prior to deregulation As natural gas prices soared a year ago the PUC alleged that TXU and other Texas utilities had no stranded costs related to generating assets because of the large amount of natural gas fired generation in the state Climbing prices made natural gas fired plants almost as costly to operate as nuclear plants If the settlement is approved by the PUC TXU will return million to retail electric suppliers over years by providing credits on transmission and distribution rates TXU said it may take a charge of less than million in the th quarter because of the settlement TXU also said it would eliminate any remaining stranded costs related to its Comanche Peak nuclear station TXU also proposes that the PUC authorize it to issue million in bonds in early and million after related to the utilitys regulatory assets or previous financing agreements approved by the PUC The

December th decision that the Midwest ISO be the vehicle for a single regional transmission organization in the Midwest is an important decision It will spark the development of a competitive regional power market in the Midwest of particular importance to energyintensive Midwestern states according to a customer coalition active in the federal arena The Coalition of Midwest Transmission Customers and the Industrial Energy UsersOhio stated that FERCs decision paves the way for actual implementation of plans to get a truly independent entity for the Midwest transmission grid that encompasses twenty states and Manitoba Canada up and running The coordination so critical to system reliability and Ohios business and industry can now proceed on a timeline that should allow the Midwest to avoid a repetition of problems we saw a couple of summers ago Because the Midwest economy is so energyintensive the Coalition hopes to see the ISO continue with development at a challenging pace since an effective regional marketplace will benefit not only residential users but also Midwestern businesses in their efforts to thrive in the worldwide marketplace The FERC Order also found that creation of the Alliance RTO does not satisfy scope and configuration requirements spelled out in FERCs Order The Commission made plain that the Alliance companies could continue with the formation of the forprofit Transco but under the Midwest ISO umbrella The significance of this is that the FERC is focusing on the importance of a single organization as opposed to its form From the perspective of market participants both buyers and sellers this and other recent FERC decisions are strong indications that a highly coordinated and competitive marketplace is the goal for the industry FERCs

Greg Whalley president and COO will join Swiss bank UBS which has acquired Enrons trading unit Former CEO Jeffrey Skilling and former Vice Chairman Clifford Baxter left the company last year and

trustee appointed creditors must prove managements actions have been inept or fraudulent Document shredding and a suspected cover up of the companys true financial liabilities could be adequate

saying the projections were speculative especially since Enrons trading business is not currently in operation About small energy and exploration companies that traded with Enron called the Dunhill Group say that the creditors will bear a higher percentage of the cost and risk of the new business with UBS The deal would hasten the depletion of Enrons estate the creditors allege Under the terms

does not include any pending commodity trades and derivative contracts entered into by Enron prior to its filing for bankruptcy The outstanding deals are worth more than billion Enron is attempting to

of of pretax profit from the trading business to Enron UBS would also pay million of the million in incentive bonuses promised to Enrons natural gas and power employees after the st year Then UBS

Procedure Responding to severe market criticism Moodys Investors Service is considering making changes in how it rates companies The changes which should be ready for discussion in a few weeks could cause ratings to rise or fall faster affecting companies ability to raise money The review follows criticism of the agencies perceived lack of speed in downgrading Enrons ratings to junk status in November Moodys is preparing a special comment on the matter that should be issued in a few weeks The changes could include more multinotch upgrades or downgrades of company ratings a speeding up of rating reviews into a matter of weeks rather than a few months and perhaps the elimination of rating outlooks Some feel within Moodys that the ratings are too sticky or move too slowly Some argue that Moodys should accept greater volatility in order to improve the predictive power of ratings A rise in negative rating actions would depress bond prices and leave many companies facing higher funding costs or more difficulty in raising money SP and Fitch have begun focusing more on liquidity or the ability of companies to access the cash they need to run their businesses since the Enron debacle A policy shift could have the effect of making it more difficult for borderline credits to survive an economic downturn If Moodys moves ahead with the changes it could mark a major structural change in

City and southern parts of the state The county alleges that the FERC prematurely granted Columbias request to build the pipeline They say that Columbia does not have the needed state approvals to proceed with construction and that the company did not provide crucial information about using dynamite to blast in environmentally sensitive areas in the Hudson River A FERC study found that the pipeline would have limited adverse environmental impact and was the preferred alternative to deliver natural gas to New York The commission has days to respond to the countys petition If denied Westchester can then seek a court order to block construction The county has asked several state regulatory departments to deny future approvals and cancel existing permits already granted Westchester will also refuse to grant Columbia permits for construction on county land Additionally the county is questioning whether the pipeline violates a state plan to protect coastal areas from environmental damage Federal law prohibits a federal agency from granting approval for projects that affect the coastline if a state finds it violates its own coastal plan In addition county officials have asked the governor to intervene when he attends a FERC conference later this month ENERGY ENERGYr FEAs Complete Suite of Energy Products BUILT FOR THE FUTURE Manage all your energy risks Build and Price

Andersen said the meeting was just a standard annual review of Enron The executives discussed whether Anderson should drop Enron as a client and also talked about how key the off balance sheet transactions were to understanding the energy firms finances It has also been revealed that Andersen was warned of trouble at Enron last summer by the same executive who sent Kenneth Lay a memo detailing her concerns over the companys financial practices The Enron executive then raised those same concerns in a conversation with an unidentified Andersen partner Andersen was assured by Enron that an outside law firm had been hired to look into the allegations The memo is likely to lead to questions about the role of accountants and the steps they take before signing sign off on a companys

About a year ago consulting firm Accenture was called Andersen Consulting but lost a bitter fight with its sister firm Arthur Andersen to retain the brand name of Andersen Now the name loss looks like manna from Heaven as the once fabled Andersen name sinks in the Enron quagmire Once one of the pillars of accounting the Andersen name is now only associated with the Enron debacle That is very different from the scenario that prevailed during the bitter battle between the accounting firm and its consulting arm A Paris mediator ruled in Andersens favor in August That was a seen as a huge victory for the accounting firm The dispute began when Andersen Consulting which had seen its profits soar with the booming economy felt it was not being paid enough for its work Ultimately Andersen

Apparent Control of Enrons Trading Operations Swiss bank UBS Warburg is the apparent winner of an auction for control of Enrons energy trading unit If the bankruptcy judge accepts UBS bid it would mean a venture into a new area of business for UBS the investment banking arm of the Swiss bank trades in commodities derivatives and other instruments but not oil and natural gas The value of the winning bid or other details were not disclosed As part of the deal Enron would retain a residual interest in the income of the business but UBS would assume none of Enrons past present or future liabilities or trading positions The company says that with UBS AA credit rating and Enrons proven industry expertise the shift in control will maximize the value of the trading operations The operations which have been idle since early December generated most of the energy traders billion in profits for After all night negotiations in New York the bid was approved by Enrons member unsecured creditors committee a court appointed group representing some of those that Enron owes Members of the committee said that they would have been comfortable with either UBS or Citibank the other bidder for the trading operations but that the UBS bid was a little more lucrative However Citigroup could still come back with a sweetened offer and present it to the judge next week Citigroup

prices after its power industry is opened to competition in May according to some experts Ontario plans to introduce competition into an industry that has MWof generating capacity and serves almost million people The deregulation process was originally scheduled for November Price and supply problems accompanied deregulation in Alberta and California over the past two years including and some expect the same for Ontario Alberta spent billions of dollars on rebates to cushion the impact on consumers of its difficult transition But Albertas power charges after rising sharply in the runup to its market opening in have declined to about C per MWh from C per MWh in The economic slowdown additional generating capacity and lower natural gas prices have pushed down prices across North America But the spot market remains volatile with Albertas wholesale prices ranging from C per MWh at offpeak times to C per MWh at the highest peak last year So Ontario power prices under the new market are likely to be more volatile than they were before for the foreseeable future But while there will be more price swings Ontarios power prices will be lower over the longer term because of increased competition And a large reserve of generating capacity should shelter Ontario residents from skyhigh peaking prices boyh California and Alberta suffered through But Ontario will pay a price for its slow movement toward competition The weak economy and reduced capital available to potential buyers are reducing bids for publicly owned power plants by up to Ontario Power Generation must sell MW of capacity within years to encourage competition and within ten years reduce its share of the market to under FINANCIAL SUMMARY The TSE dipped points to The CRB Index slid points to The US Dollar

Abilene TX Ph Fx Dynedy Says FERCs New Market Power Proposal Too Risky All wholesale power transactions would be vulnerable to default if the FERC adopts a strict new test for granting wholesale trading rights to utilities according to Dynegy Last Novermber the FERC introduced a new standard for sizing up market power for utilities big enough to influence energy prices in their areas The plan has raised a storm of protest from many utilities The proposed new market power test is based on the peak power demand in any given area If a company controls generation in any area greater than its peak demand FERC would require it to base rates on perunit production costs not marketbased rates The previous marketpower test was any firm controlling more than of supplies could be subject to penalties The new rules would call to question the finality of all power market transactions and invite buyers to walk away from purchase obligations Dynegy says About billion in merchant generation investment could be shelved if the FERC proceeds with a proposed new rule Dynegy warned saying all generation investment would be exposed to a regulatory risk that did not exist before In December the FERC delayed implementation of the new rules for several months until a technical conference to give companies a chance to offer suggestions Dynegy says id the proposed new rules could also stunt the development of renewable resources like wind hydro and solar supplies by requiring them to sell their power at no incremental cost Entergy has also complained that the FERCs sweeping changes are not justified by current laws The FERC is working to design RTOs nationwide with builtin marketmonitoring capabilities which would negate the need for the new market power rules RTOs with approved monitoring systems will be exempt from the new agency order ALL BAD NEWS SEEN IN THE MARKET According to a top industry analyst traders are going to have to bide their time if they expect natural gas

showed little interest Industrial demand could be improving slowly but what is going on out there is overshadowed this time of year by weather developments says Jim Ritterbusch of Ritterbusch and Associates There should be some indication of growing industrial demand The stock market is a leading indicator of industrial activity and those markets are looking strong and some of the other indices are looking OK but for the time being industrial activity is being buried by other overwhelmingly bearish factors The forecasts for industrial activity and what goes on in the natural gas market seem to be a bit tenuous at best for the next couple of months the focus is going to be on the weather and once we get to tne end of February then the industry will focus on industrial demand I

fraudulently manipulating those profits Enron reaped huge profits from derivatives But it lost billions on most everything else it did including projects in fiberoptic bandwidth retail natural gas and power water systems and technology stocks but used its expertise in derivatives to hide these losses Derivatives are complex financial contracts whose values are linked to underlying variables such as the prices of commodities stocks or bonds They are used by sophisticated investors to manage risk Enrons use of derivatives both outside and inside the company can likely be directly linked to its collapse On the outside they were used to create the companys web of offbalance sheet deals with complex financial partnerships known as specialpurpose vehicles After some of those deals went sour Enron in October took a billion charge against earnings and a billion writedown in shareholder equity triggering its nosedive into bankruptcy But Enrons derivatives problems ran far deeper than the

senator also demanded that the FERC provide a list of meetings and telephone calls between the commission and Enron executives from August through June Enron has denied any wrongdoing The Democratic senator pointed to news reports that former Enron chairman Ken Lay met with Vice President Cheney in April and discussed the California power crisis The next day Cheney said he opposed price caps the

the administration has always opposed price caps But the FERC chairman said that his staff has already started to look into the allegations The probe will involve FERCs office of general counsel and

advance worked well noted Dean Hazelcorn trader with Coquest Dallas Today looks like a sell signal The high of the March contract did not exceed Fridays high and todays low was lower That sets up a trade down to I look for a slow deteriorating front end of the board he noted Im back in a bearish mode and I think were headed below I believe that there is a probability the market will work lower but it may take months to do it he cautioned Other traders are more optimistic Longer term Im bullish says John Beaver President Private Futures Group Oklahoma City Its more difficult to be bullish on the front of the board but looking at the charts it suggests that prices may be set to rise Theres a gap on the weekly chart between and on the weekly chart week ending January and January and if prices could fill that gap it would be a positive sign that prices were set to move higher he said A gap is a pattern on the price charts followed by market technicians The idea is that the gap may act as a barrier to in this case further price advances Once the gap is filled however a potential limitation to price advances has been removed and prices would be empowered to move higher I dont have any interest in being short the market at the level I dont want to be in a trade that may only make or cents and have to worry about it he said If you are a commercial trader are you going to get

saying the projections were speculative especially since Enrons trading business is not currently in operation About small energy and exploration companies that traded with Enron called the Dunhill

does not include any pending commodity trades and derivative contracts entered into by Enron prior to its filing for bankruptcy The outstanding deals are worth more than billion Enron is attempting to settle the commodity and derivative contracts to help pay off debts The agreement would give UBS the sole rights to Enrons trading software for the next decade Initially the bank would pay royalties of of pretax profit from the trading business to Enron UBS would also pay million of the million in incentive bonuses promised to Enrons natural gas and power employees after the st year Then UBS would have the option to buy out Enrons royalty interest in the rd year Early payment by UBS could trim the royalties to of the operations pretax earnings then down to and then eventually obliterate

Procedure Responding to severe market criticism Moodys Investors Service is considering making changes in how it rates companies The changes which should be ready for discussion in a few weeks could cause ratings to rise or fall faster affecting companies ability to raise money The review follows criticism of the agencies perceived lack of speed in downgrading Enrons ratings to junk status in November Moodys is preparing a special comment on the matter that should be issued in a few weeks The changes could include more multinotch upgrades or downgrades of company ratings a speeding up of rating reviews into a matter of weeks rather than a few months and perhaps the elimination of rating outlooks Some feel within Moodys that the ratings are too sticky or move too slowly Some argue that Moodys should accept greater volatility in order to improve the predictive power of ratings A rise in negative rating actions would depress bond prices and leave many companies facing higher funding costs or more difficulty in raising money SP and Fitch have begun focusing more on liquidity or the ability of companies to access the cash they need to run their businesses since the Enron debacle A policy shift could have the effect of making it more difficult for borderline credits to survive an economic downturn If Moodys moves ahead with the changes it could mark a major structural change in

proceed with construction and that the company did not provide crucial information about using dynamite to blast in environmentally sensitive areas in the Hudson River A FERC study found that the pipeline would have limited adverse environmental impact and was the preferred alternative to deliver natural gas to New York The commission has days to respond to the countys petition If denied Westchester can then seek a court order to block construction The county has asked several state regulatory departments to deny future approvals and cancel existing permits already granted Westchester will also refuse to grant Columbia permits for construction on county land Additionally the county is questioning whether the pipeline violates a state plan to protect coastal areas from environmental

About a year ago consulting firm Accenture was called Andersen Consulting but lost a bitter fight with its sister firm Arthur Andersen to retain the brand name of Andersen Now the name loss looks like manna from Heaven as the once fabled Andersen name sinks in the Enron quagmire Once one of the pillars of accounting the Andersen name is now only associated with the Enron debacle That is very different from the scenario that prevailed during the bitter battle between the accounting firm and its consulting arm A Paris mediator ruled in Andersens favor in August That was a seen as a huge victory for the accounting firm The dispute began when Andersen Consulting which had seen its profits soar with the booming economy felt it was not being paid enough for its work Ultimately Andersen

prices after its power industry is opened to competition in May according to some experts Ontario plans to introduce competition into an industry that has MWof generating capacity and serves almost million people The deregulation process was originally scheduled for November Price and supply problems accompanied deregulation in Alberta and California over the past two years including and some expect the same for Ontario Alberta spent billions of dollars on rebates to cushion the impact on consumers of its difficult transition But Albertas power charges after rising sharply in the runup to its market opening in have declined to about C per MWh from C per MWh in The economic slowdown additional generating capacity and lower natural gas prices have pushed down prices across North America But the spot market remains volatile with Albertas wholesale prices ranging from C per MWh at offpeak times to C per MWh at the highest peak last year So Ontario power prices under the new market are likely to be more volatile than they were before for the foreseeable future But while there will be more price swings Ontarios power prices will be lower over the longer term because of increased competition And a large reserve of generating capacity should shelter Ontario residents from skyhigh peaking prices boyh California and Alberta suffered through But Ontario will pay a price for its slow movement toward competition The weak economy and reduced capital available to potential buyers are reducing bids for publicly owned power plants by up to Ontario Power Generation must sell MW of capacity within years to encourage competition and within ten years reduce its share of the market to under FINANCIAL SUMMARY The TSE dipped points to The CRB Index slid points to The US Dollar

Department and congressional committees and other agencies investigating Enrons collapse In recent months individuals in the accounting firm involved with the Enron engagement disposed of a

against PGE the parent company of the states Pacific Gas and Electric utility alleging its fraudulent business practices drove the utility into bankruptcy The lawsuit asks for damages of million to billion and any other penalties that might be awarded The states attorney general contends that PGE drained the assets of its California utility saying that money went from the utility to the parent company and then to unregulated PGE units PGE said that the lawsuit was unwarranted discriminatory and potentially harmful to the California economy The company pointed out that the PUC and state lawmakers have reviewed its transactions with affiliates and found no illegalities The attorney general charges that PGE violated conditions set by the PUC to protect customers from the potential risks and abuses of a holding company structure According to the conditions PGE was prohibited from using money from the utility to fund its unregulated businesses and was directed to give first priority to the utilitys need for capital in the event it experienced financial difficulties The AG claims that during a year period the utility gave more than billion in cash to PGE billion in

connected to the case that led to the movie Erin Brockovich That case involved people who were paid million by PGE to settle claims they drank water containing chromium six a potential cause of cancer near a Hinkley CA natural gas pipeline station owned by PGE The new claims involve people seeking million for alleged personal injuries that are pending in lawsuits involving chromium at PGEs Kettleman Topock and Hinkley pipeline stations PGE has said its potential liability is million Chromium six was used at the pipeline stations in the s and s to prevent the pumps cooling systems from rusting then dumped in unlined ponds near the stations Attorneys for the plaintiffs say the chromium seeped into underground water supplies and caused a number of illnesses including cancer Although PGE has said it used the chemical it denies that chromium has caused the illnesses PGE attorneys have said that bankruptcy law mandates that personal injury and wrongful death claims be moved to a US district court to ensure that the claims are handled as quickly and fairly as possible Plaintiffs attorneys contend that the suits were filed long before the utility filed for bankruptcy and that

companies have moved closer to developing almost Tcf of natural gas in the Mackenzie Delta region on the coast of the Beaufort Sea The group has begun the lengthy process of applying for regulatory approval which could take up to years Led by Imperial Oil the group consists of Conoco Shell Canada Exxon Mobil and now includes a company controlled by Northwest Territories native people The partners known as the Mackenzie Valley Producers Group could spend up to C million before they decide whether to proceed with the project The natural gas reserves would be produced from Imperials Tcf Taglu field the Tcf Parsons Lake field owned by Conoco and Exxon Mobil and Shells Tcf Niglintgak field The project would include a pipeline to carry up to Bcf per day of natural gas to Alberta along the Mackenzie River valley at a estimated cost of C billion The natural gas would then be transported to Canada and the US Last year the group signed an agreement with Northwest Territories native leaders that would give the regions people a share in the pipeline and provide other economic benefits Even if the Mackenzie Delta project did not start pumping for or years it likely will still be

reached a high of per MMBtu in January the average monthly spot price for January climbed to per MMBtu up from per MMBtu in December The January average is below the January level Monthly spot prices for January climbed higher because weather was cold across most of the nation at the close of December when most of the January deal making was happening and because forecasts for the first part of

Abilene TX Ph Fx Dynedy Says FERCs New Market Power Proposal Too Risky All wholesale power transactions would be vulnerable to default if the FERC adopts a strict new test for granting wholesale trading rights to utilities according to Dynegy Last Novermber the FERC introduced a new standard for sizing up market power for utilities big enough to influence energy prices in their areas The plan has raised a storm of protest from many utilities The proposed new market power test is based on the peak power demand in any given area If a company controls generation in any area greater than its peak demand FERC would require it to base rates on perunit production costs not marketbased rates The previous marketpower test was any firm controlling more than of supplies could be subject to penalties The new rules would call to question the finality of all power market transactions and invite buyers to walk away from purchase obligations Dynegy says About billion in merchant generation investment could be shelved if the FERC proceeds with a proposed new rule Dynegy warned saying all generation investment would be exposed to a regulatory risk that did not exist before In December the FERC delayed implementation of the new rules for several months until a technical conference to give companies a chance to offer suggestions Dynegy says id the proposed new rules could also stunt the development of renewable resources like wind hydro and solar supplies by requiring them to sell their power at no incremental cost Entergy has also complained that the FERCs sweeping changes are not justified by current laws The FERC is working to design RTOs nationwide with builtin marketmonitoring capabilities which would negate the need for the new market power rules RTOs with approved monitoring systems will be exempt from the new agency order ALL BAD NEWS SEEN IN THE MARKET According to a top industry analyst traders are going to have to bide their time if they expect natural gas prices to get much help from recovering industrial demand Last week the NAPM National Association of Purchasing Managers issued a positive report concerning industrial activity but natural gas traders showed little interest Industrial demand could be improving slowly but what is going on out there is overshadowed this time of year by weather developments says Jim Ritterbusch of Ritterbusch and Associates There should be some indication of growing industrial demand The stock market is a leading indicator of industrial activity and those markets are looking strong and some of the other indices are looking OK but for the time being industrial activity is being buried by other overwhelmingly bearish factors The forecasts for industrial activity and what goes on in the natural gas market seem to be a bit tenuous at best for the next couple of months the focus is going to be on the weather and once we get to tne end of February then the industry will focus on industrial demand I do think that all the bad news may be presently factored into the market Even though there were new lows made early this week I think any low prices much below those levels are going to be difficult

financial statements have generally cast doubt on corporate accounting practices Some say that the stock market now carries a higher equity risk premium because of Enrons collapse In some cases investors who lose money in one market unwound their exposure in others leading to a spiral of forced selling Even companies with no Enron exposure are experiencing investor risk aversion equal to those that had direct financial dealings with the company For example Kmart would likely not have been vulnerable to energy sector risks in the past But Kmart claimed that insurers had raised premiums for surety bonds which Kmart needed to cover certain contingent liabilities Enrons collapse also worried investors about other energy companies like Calpine El Paso and Mirant forcing them to adjust

stay short although no new trades are recommended Prices continue in a pervasive downtrend yet stop loss provisions are in place to guard against any unexpected price rallies The massive short interest held by non commercial accounts is of concern but the stop loss provisions of the model are designed to cope with what economists call exogenous variables Weather storage and the economy are all negative and combined with the unfavorable technical environment suggest that prices could work still lower GasTrader Consultant is a natural gas futures trading program designed to minimize the opportunity costs losses that often result under the best intentioned but often misguided hedging programs Specific trading parameters are in place daily and trades are executed on the close or at predetermined trading points Results assume positions are maintained in the spot most liquid futures contract and are rolled over on the th of the month prior to contract expiration If the program is in a long mode producers and physical market longs would lift all hedges Conversely if the program is in a short mode end users would lift their hedges If the model is flat or neutral a conservative strategy requires hedging by both long and short market participants It is believed that by combining natural gas price trends with hedging requirements opportunity costs can be minimized and greater participation in market moves can be realized Hedging costs are synchronized with the market Check out the FREE TRIAL subscription Go to SubscribetoGasTradernet Energy Seminars Inc Announces Key

TXU Electric has filed a plan with the Texas PUC to settle charges that it erroneously collected stranded payment costs before the state opens its power market next week The costs are aimed at offsetting expenses for building generating plants and related regulatory financing plans prior to deregulation As natural gas prices soared a year ago the PUC alleged that TXU and other Texas utilities had no stranded costs related to generating assets because of the large amount of natural gas fired generation in the state Climbing prices made natural gas fired plants almost as costly to operate as nuclear plants If the settlement is approved by the PUC TXU will return million to retail electric suppliers over years by providing credits on transmission and distribution rates TXU said it may take a charge of less than million in the th quarter because of the settlement TXU also said it would eliminate any remaining stranded costs related to its Comanche Peak nuclear station TXU also proposes that the PUC authorize it to issue million in bonds in early and million after related to the utilitys regulatory assets or previous financing agreements approved by the PUC The settlement also cuts a possible penalty to per customer from in the event TXUs retail affiliate retains more than of its customers after the first years of competition GET REAL about energy risk

December th decision that the Midwest ISO be the vehicle for a single regional transmission organization in the Midwest is an important decision It will spark the development of a competitive regional power market in the Midwest of particular importance to energyintensive Midwestern states according to a customer coalition active in the federal arena The Coalition of Midwest Transmission Customers and the Industrial Energy UsersOhio stated that FERCs decision paves the way for actual implementation of plans to get a truly independent entity for the Midwest transmission grid that encompasses twenty states and Manitoba Canada up and running The coordination so critical to system reliability and Ohios business and industry can now proceed on a timeline that should allow the Midwest to avoid a repetition of problems we saw a couple of summers ago Because the Midwest economy is so energyintensive the Coalition hopes to see the ISO continue with development at a challenging pace since an effective regional marketplace will benefit not only residential users but also Midwestern businesses in their efforts to thrive in the worldwide marketplace The FERC Order also found that creation of the Alliance RTO does not satisfy scope and configuration requirements spelled out in FERCs Order The Commission made plain that the Alliance companies could continue with the formation of the forprofit Transco but under the Midwest ISO umbrella The significance of this is that the FERC is focusing on the importance of a single organization as opposed to its form From the perspective of market participants both buyers and sellers this and other recent FERC decisions are strong indications that a highly coordinated and competitive marketplace is the goal for the industry FERCs

yesterday on shortterm cold weather at some pipelines maintaining about a premium over the NYMEX But cash traders expect the demand to ease quickly as temperatures moderate by this weekend As usual
