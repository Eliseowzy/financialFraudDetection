s pursuant to Section etc Any and all Act filings by Enron Corp are available at the SECs websitethat is the fastest and most efficient way to access them SEC file number Enron Corp Total assets and liabilities I would use our latest Q filed last week however as we all know these are not only unaudited we do not have the AA SAS letter limited review letter required for quarterly financials Perhaps we should consult Causey as to the answer to this question although my best guess would be the third quarter financial statements just filed with the SEC Debt securities and number of holdersI would have no way of knowing thisI would check with corporate treasury Tim DeSpain Clint Freeland and the folks in their group The group responsible for paying the interest on our debt securities would know the answer to this and that would be corporate treasury As to number of holders they may have to contact the trustee of the debt securities for most of the public debt securities I believe that would be Bank of New York as successor trustee to Harris Trust Enrons longtime trustee Number of shares of Preferred Stock I thought this list was included in the schedules to the Merger Agreement but I cant seem to put my hands on the schedules I will try to get this list to you today or early in the morning Sunday Brenda Funk may also have an uptodate list the recent preferred stock issuances relate to structured financings which are deals I dont work onthats the reason I dont have this info at my fingertipsbut I think I can get it for you tomorrow morning if not today As of October according to Q filed last week shares of common stock issued and outstanding this does not include treasury sharesif we need that number we will have to get from the corporate secretarys office Desciption of Enrons business I agree with you we can lift this from the current Q filed last week anything before that may be out of date Look at the draft of the Proxy Statement that I sent to you yesterday the reference to Janus is as of February of this yearas you know institutional holders of or more only have to file an annual Schedule G on on before Feb of each year Of course other or greater owners must file a D shortly after acquiring their holdings and I am not aware that we have received a Schedule D lately the issuer is supposed to receive a copy as well as the SEC Mark Koenig in Investor Relations might have a handle on who Enrons current owners are without a Schedule D we can assume that no one else owns in excess of With respect to Enron Corp common and second preferred convertible stock there are literally thousands of holders I assume the only way to get this information is the shareholder lists from the Transfer Agent or possibly the corporate secretarys office would have this infoif not they would be the group that knows how to get it See No above Jordan and Julia The information that we would need to get from Enrons transfer agent or Enrons trustees for its debt securities would not be available from those entities until Monday if we needed it before then as noted above the best sources of information would be the Enron Treasury group with respect to debt securities outstanding and the corporate secretarys office Paula Rieker and Elaine Overturf with respect to shareholder lists I apologize in advance that I will be necessarily out of pocket Saturday afternoon but plan to be in the office all day Sunday if I can help with this Thanks Rex Original Message From Mintz Jordan Sent Friday November PM To Rogers Rex Cc Schuler Lance Legal Subject Information Confidential Rex As I mentioned in my voicemail earlier today we need the following information this weekend for the legal entities Enron Corpsome of which I think we already have and I have noted in parenthetical below Whether we file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to Section or d of the Act Yeswhich What is the SEC file number Total assets and total liabilities as of a specified date Should we use our QQ filing of last week Debt securities held by more than holders indicate whether secured unsecured or subordinated amount of debt and approximate number of holders Number of shares of preferred stock and approximate number of holders Number of shares of common and approximate number of holders I believe that both s and relate to issued rather than authorized but Ill get clarification Brief description of Enrons business Q Names of any person who directly or indirectly owns controls or holds with power to vote or more of the voting securities of Enron List of all equity security holders of each class of security including showing the number and kind of interests in the name of each holder and the last known addres or place of business of each holder The list noted in should reflect equity security holders as of day of filing accordingly transfer agent should be notified that a list will be required to enable them to prepare an accurate list I may be reached in the office at home or on my cell at It may be helpful to get Eickenroht or Clem to assist us on this Thanks Jordan
