environment of virtual deception Send it to everyone you know and you too can have a whole new wardrobe courtesy of THE GAP Isnt it grand Hi My name is Janelle McCan Founder of the Gap You have probably heard about the email from Abercrombie and Fitch offering twenty five dollar gift certificates to every five people you sent that letter to My question is DID IT WORK Most of you who tried it

Others see you as someone they should handle with care Youre seen as vain selfcentered and who is extremely dominant Others may admire you wishing they could be more like you but dont always trust you hesitating to become too deeply involved with you TO POINTS Others see you as an exciting highly volatile rather impulsive personality a natural leader whos quick to make decisions though not always the right onesThey see you as bold and adventuresome someone who will try anything once someone who takes chances and enjoys an adventure They enjoy being in your company because of the excitement you radiate TO POINTS Others see you as fresh lively charming amusing practical and always interesting someone whos constantly in the center of attention but sufficiently wellbalanced not to let it go to their head They also see you as kind considerate and understanding someone wholl always cheer them up and help them out TO POINTS Others see you as sensible cautious careful practical They see you as clever gifted or talented but modest Not a person who makes friends too quickly or easily but someone whos extremely loyal to friends you do make and who expect the same loyalty in return Those who

as painstaking and fussy They see you as very cautious extremely careful a slow and steady plodder Itd really surprise them if you ever did something impulsively or on the spur of the moment expecting you to examine everything carefully from every angle and then usually decide against it They think this reaction is caused partly by your careful nature UNDER POINTS People think you are shy nervous

already I sent enough emails to get over two hundred dollars worth of clothes from the GAP You know with all the crap sent over the mail it is good to know that something finally rings true in this environment of virtual deception Send it to everyone you know and you too can have a whole new wardrobe courtesy of THE GAP Isnt it grand Hi My name is Janelle McCan Founder of the Gap You have probably heard about the email from Abercrombie and Fitch offering twenty five dollar gift certificates to every five people you sent that letter to My question is DID IT WORK Most of you who tried it will probably say NO But this letter is NOT prank like others you have experienced I am offering thirty five dollar gift certificates to every seven people you send this to When you have finished sending this letter to as many people as you wish a screen will come up It will tell you how much you have earned in Gap gift certificates Print that screen out and bring it to your local Gap store The sales clerk will give you your certificates and you can SHOP BABY This is a sales promotion to get our name out to young people around the world We believe this project can be a success but only with your help Thank you for your support Sincerely Janelle McCan Founder of Gap Get FREE Internet Access powered by Excite Visit atthtm
