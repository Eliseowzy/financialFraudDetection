transactions from November to November du e to the highly successful Enron OnLine distribution channel and g ENA reaching its ROCE target These are truly outstanding accomplishments and our expectations for growth and opportunity in Enron North America for are consistent with that success In order to reach these goals we felt it necessary to realign a number of our organizations A number of these changes are completed The goals of such realignment include a increase overall productivity with the goal to ensure that every employe e is in a position to contribute regardless of skill set b increase overall market coverage deal flow and information generation with the goal to increase bidoffer income increase the velocity of deal flow improve customer coverage and promote quality information transfer to our trading organization c increase deal quality and earnings quality with the goal to i allocate our resources towards the best transactions and ii significantly increase our

align those functions to reduce the amount of unproductive internal focus e increase the overall velocity of the capital being utilized consistent with our goal of a plus return on capital employed and f identify and recognize a host of new leaders in the organization that ar e critical to meeting our goals next year With these objectives in mind patterned after the successful business mode ls in Calgary and Portland effective immediately the following changes are being implemented a East Power a single East Power Team incorporating trading midmark et and origination will be formed under

If you are currently a commercial employee of ENA or ESA you will continue to conduct business in that company We look forward to another exciting year in the North American energy market This is certainly a company unrivaled in the marketplace with the most talented employees The opportunities are endless We wish you and your family a very happy and safe holiday season
