chilling account of one persons experience yesterday I hope this finds you all safe and well Adrienne Greenheart Writer I was one who wanted a better look I wanted to get closer And the price I paid was leaving my shoes in the middle of a pile of suffocating bodies At the Wall St train stop people were covered with papers A plane crash Thats what everyone said Then a boom Everyone ran I ran to my office on Wall and Pearl and called my brother in Illinois I wanted to be closer At the corner of Church and Broadway I angled my way through a large packed crowd to get the best view We talked about people jumping The police stood behind the yellow tape Minutes later there was a boom I thought it was a bomb so I crouched but people ran so I ran I couldnt see anything I dont know how far I ran Couldnt see where I was running Didnt know if I was in a street or next to a building Didnt know what street I was on No one could talk because the dust filled our throats After about ten steps I tripped over a pile of people and then people tripped on me I laid there The only sound was the falling of dust and debris No one moved under me The weight of people on top of me got heavier I couldnt breathe I knew we were all going to die in that pile I pulled myself out of the pile My slipons slipped off I stood up and saw nothing Not even and inch in front of me I put my hands out and felt for something I bumped into the brick side of a building I bumped into milk crates I stopped I had no idea what to do and I knew everyone around me was suffocating I thought about my Mom and dad they would be so sad to hear that I died I thought about my husband Just married and I will not get to live my life with him I thought about my brothers They would cry I told myself to just keep trying to find away to air but I didnt believe I would live I bumped into something that I could feel the top of so I lifted myself up I worried I was going into the back of a dump truck and I was scared Id be trapped I didnt know if there was fire or a bomb I didnt know how to protect myself find air Go up so I didnt know for sure that a dump truck would be bad I think it was scaffolding I think I jumped over piles of bodies by climbing scaffolding I pulled myself into a building What building I dont know And I took a breath I took two breaths I was sure the building would be bombed I looked for stairs I kept thinking I needed clean air I found a bathroom I didnt realize I wanted water until it was there Four men inside Two fighting faucet I shared the toilet with another man We drank almost the whole bowl Once the four of us were calmed by water and air we ventured outside the bathroom We walked up stairs S lowly We checked doors behind us left them all open We got up only one floor We waited I cried They shared one can of apple juice The intercom in the building announced stay where you are I was so relieved to know people knew we were there The intercom announced again and I thought another bomb would go off and Id die I cried The guy with the apple juice put his arm around me I wondered why no one else cried The intercom announced to go down the stairs I picked up a wastebasket I planned to fill it with water Planned to use it to shelter myself from the next bomb I still had no idea the building collapsed In the lobby of the building someone gave me a Nantucket Nectar and told me to vomit I walked outside the building with the drink in my wastebasket There was no one around White everywhere The four of us had nowhere to go I couldnt remember where I was I walked toward the water Police directed very one north I asked a woman next to me Where are we going She said I dont know She had no dust She looked so steady I followed her This was the beginning of her long protection She said You can walk home with me You need a shower I coughed She asked why I was carrying a wastebasket I said In case theres another bomb She held on to my arm as we made our way next to the river In Chinatown she bought me shoes At the Bowery we finally found a pay phone that didnt have a line of people So she called her husband and I sat down next to my wastebasket It was the first time I sat down and I started crying We resumed walking Sometimes we ran I made sure to keep up and I didnt tell Teresa that I was worried that I would faint I drank Nantucket Nectar every time I got dizzy At th St a plane went overhead and I screamed In front of Bloomingdales There was no one there from Wall St I knew I looked crazy I screamed anyway I reminded everyone there were no planes allowed to fly Someone said Its the army I came out from under my wastebasket and kept walking Theresas apartment was st on the Upper West Side Where everyone looked fine In the shower dripping debris down my body I remembered one more moment under the rubble When I couldnt breathe When I couldnt see In the middle of the dead quiet was a voice He said Is there anyone here Can someone hold my hand I reached out to the voice and held his hand It was shaking and the skin was old I squeezed and then I let go Betty Sweeny Business Development Associates Inc Tele Fax Email A

chilling account of one persons experience yesterday I hope this finds you all safe and well Adrienne Greenheart Writer I was one who wanted a better look I wanted to get closer And the price I paid was leaving my shoes in the middle of a pile of suffocating bodies At the Wall St train stop people were covered with papers A plane crash Thats what everyone said Then a boom Everyone ran I ran to my office on Wall and Pearl and called my brother in Illinois I wanted to be closer At the corner of Church and Broadway I angled my way through a large packed crowd to get the best view We talked about people jumping The police stood behind the yellow tape Minutes later there was a boom I thought it was a bomb so I crouched but people ran so I ran I couldnt see anything I dont know how far I ran Couldnt see where I was running Didnt know if I was in a street or next to a building Didnt know what street I was on No one could talk because the dust filled our throats After about ten steps I tripped over a pile of people and then people tripped on me I laid there The only sound was the falling of dust and debris No one moved under me The weight of people on top of me got heavier I couldnt breathe I knew we were all going to die in that pile I pulled myself out of the pile My slipons slipped off I stood up and saw nothing Not even and inch in front of me I put my hands out and felt for something I bumped into the brick side of a building I bumped into milk crates I stopped I had no idea what to do and I knew everyone around me was suffocating I thought about my Mom and dad they would be so sad to hear that I died I thought about my husband Just married and I will not get to live my life with him I thought about my brothers They would cry I told myself to just keep trying to find away to air but I didnt believe I would live I bumped into something that I could feel the top of so I lifted myself up I worried I was going into the back of a dump truck and I was scared Id be trapped I didnt know if there was fire or a bomb I didnt know how to protect myself find air Go up so I didnt know for sure that a dump truck would be bad I think it was scaffolding I think I jumped over piles of bodies by climbing scaffolding I pulled myself into a building What building I dont know And I took a breath I took two breaths I was sure the building would be bombed I looked for stairs I kept thinking I needed clean air I found a bathroom I didnt realize I wanted water until it was there Four men inside Two fighting faucet I shared the toilet with another man We drank almost the whole bowl Once the four of us were calmed by water and air we ventured outside the bathroom We walked up stairs S lowly We checked doors behind us left them all open We got up only one floor We waited I cried They shared one can of apple juice The intercom in the building announced stay where you are I was so relieved to know people knew we were there The intercom announced again and I thought another bomb would go off and Id die I cried The guy with the apple juice put his arm around me I wondered why no one else cried The intercom announced to go down the stairs I picked up a wastebasket I planned to fill it with water Planned to use it to shelter myself from the next bomb I still had no idea the building collapsed In the lobby of the building someone gave me a Nantucket Nectar and told me to vomit I walked outside the building with the drink in my wastebasket There was no one around White everywhere The four of us had nowhere to go I couldnt remember where I was I walked toward the water Police directed very one north I asked a woman next to me Where are we going She said I dont know She had no dust She looked so steady I followed her This was the beginning of her long protection She said You can walk home with me You need a shower I coughed She asked why I was carrying a wastebasket I said In case theres another bomb She held on to my arm as we made our way next to the river In Chinatown she bought me shoes At the Bowery we finally found a pay phone that didnt have a line of people So she called her husband and I sat down next to my wastebasket It was the first time I sat down and I started crying We resumed walking Sometimes we ran I made sure to keep up and I didnt tell Teresa that I was worried that I would faint I drank Nantucket Nectar every time I got dizzy At th St a plane went overhead and I screamed In front of Bloomingdales There was no one there from Wall St I knew I looked crazy I screamed anyway I reminded everyone there were no planes allowed to fly Someone said Its the army I came out from under my wastebasket and kept walking Theresas apartment was st on the Upper West Side Where everyone looked fine In the shower dripping debris down my body I remembered one more moment under the rubble When I couldnt breathe When I couldnt see In the middle of the dead quiet was a voice He said Is there anyone here Can someone hold my hand I reached out to the voice and held his hand It was shaking and the skin was old I squeezed and then I let go Betty Sweeny Business Development Associates Inc Tele Fax Email A
