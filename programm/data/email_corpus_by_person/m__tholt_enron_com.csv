rather than taking extra time to reorganize them by subject Enrons business has been grouped into three buckets Core Noncore and Under Review Core Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe retail energy pipelines Noncore Broadband water and international assets ie EGAS Enron has approx Bn in investments in these assets and they have produced dismal returns Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets Under Review EGM EIM These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of longterm viability Required resource levels are being carefully studied Following review Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or noncore as the analysis dictates Approximately MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter These include a gas LDC in Brazil EcoElectrica and our Indian EP assets Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of MMBn Given the current environment raising equity in the public markets would be inefficient McMahon says Shortterm liquidity is provided by the Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago the Bn of new debt and the Bn equity infusion from Dynegy Longerterm the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt McMahon described the major offbalancesheet vehicles Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets It was initially capitalized with MM of a debt and MM of equity raised from Enron and institutional investors The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix assets Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on the Enron topup obligation The date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated belowinvestmentgrade by any one of the three major agencies The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water As long as Wessex is worth at least Bn there will be no Enron topup required If we take a haircut to present book value Enron will have to provide MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt This MM would hit Enron cash income and equity balances Osprey contains energyrelated assets and other assets It was initially capitalized with Bn of a debt and MM in equity ENE and institutionals As with

additional ENE common as needed for topup Assuming the same hypothetical haircut to current book value Enron would have to deliver approx MM of topup fundswhich would hit ENE cash income and equity The debt must be retired by with the same cuttojunk early trigger provision as Marlin Yosemite and the CreditLinked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with large financial institutions The underlying transactions are already on Enrons balance sheet McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles McMahon says Our Q will be filed five days late The Q will include all of this detail regarding the offbalancesheet vehicles The special committee investigation is still ongoing The committee meets timesweek sometimes more often The outside auditors DT and external counsel hired by the committee are working virtually days a week Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation McMahon says its way too early to tell if any asset writedowns are called for That analysis is underway but it will not be complete for some time Osprey contains the European power projects Trakya and Saarlux some North American merchant investments and some Brazilian assets Under the merger agreement Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval However an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval Broadband is expected to be fully wound up sometime over the course of the next year Did not catch this part clearly The ENE topup obligation for Marlin represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level Current book value of the Osprey assets is Bn No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the Bn legal liability clause Yosemite and the CreditLinked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt this section somewhat unclear The underlying transactions represented volumes of crude oil and gas The transactions relate to the physical movement of these commodities The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longerterm products Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put longterm deals on hold last week Says that our first focus is on getting our shortterm business back up to normal levels It will be a couple of weeks before were able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding longterm deals with us McMahon There hasnt been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customerscredit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers But we have seen a return of some of the transactions some of the flows Whalley says that were hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure he says The cuts will certainly be deeper in our noncore businesses Whalley then quickly interjects some might say interrrupts with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business We will be looking at perhaps streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments but there are no plans to

for maintenance SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast They use Weather Bank as one of their tools OFO Declaration Name changes from overnomination Can declare before any Cycle Provide hour notice Post on Gas Select Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select Windows Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system Calculation based on noms which does not work well Lots of complaints People were complaining that it restricted access to the system Eliminating point specific calculation Open system to Max Oper Limits or Contractual Limits Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug procedures No changes to Wheeler Ridge Due to the need to maintain operational control an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle Replace windows with operational maximum volumes If CPUC

regulatory change to make free OFOs are going to be system wide and not customer specific OFOs can be declared intraday Once OFO declared it will be kept for entire day Concerned that if call off will

injections allowed during OFO Use Elapsed ProRata Rules Expected Usagecut nominations to of expected usage so will use same day of the prior week as proxy Generators need to revise expected usage Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal Flow Day Diversions dont go into effect until after Cycle Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed If call OFO after cycle or and have interruptible storage injections such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised If OFO called Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows Cycle Nom cut Cycle Nom cut Cylce Nom cut Windows will only be implemented during cycle if OFO callled after cycle and no improvement is realized Will allocate prorata Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point In other words if OFO declared during Cycle and no relief after cycles Socal will window Cycle and prorata cut Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles For penalty purposes actual burn from oclock to oclock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ

December By JOE DRAPE The Bowl Championship Series ranking formula was designed to give something to everybody The human polls are counted along with computer rankings the strength of schedule is factored in and teams are penalized for losses and credited for victories over better teams As it has the past three years the system worked Can anyone honestly say undefeated Miami versus Nebraska is not the best matchup for the national title game Now Colorado Coach Gary Barnett and the Buffaloes faithful are trying to say it is not Yes Colorado beat the Cornhuskers handily and went on to win the Big championship The Buffaloes also lost two games one to Fresno State a fine team with a future pro quarterback in David Carr But Fresno State did not even win the Western Athletic Conference title Louisiana Tech did The Bulldogs posted an record by beating league teams like Tulsa Southern Methodist Nevada and San Jose State a group that finished with a combined record The Buffaloes are beating their chests about holding off Texas in the conference championship game but the Longhorns rolled over Colorado by earlier in the season One loss in a season when there are not two undefeated teams is understandable rewarding two losses would be absurd Colorado did not earn a trip to the Rose Bowl If the Buffaloes beat Oregon in the Fiesta Bowl and Nebraska upends topranked Miami in the title game shame on any voter in the Associated Press news media poll who decides that Colorado is more deserving of the No ranking than Nebraska Oregon on the other hand has a right to feel slighted The Ducks can also be heartened that a Miamilose Oregonwin scenario might earn them the APs top ranking The Ducks who only lost to a very good Stanford team are ranked No in both the AP and USA TodayESPN coaches polls The strengthofschedule and computer component of the BCS formula did Oregon in The wonlost records of opponents and opponents opponents dont lie For Oregon those numbers add up to the nations sttoughest schedule compared to Nebraskas thranked schedule Even if you dislike or dont understand the computer rankings they account for only percent of the BCS formula Oregon was ranked as high as No by one computer and as low as No by another Both were thrown out as the formula requires and the remaining six computer service rankings were averaged Oregons averagepoint total was which means the computers rated it as the fourth or fifthbest team in the nation The math is essentially the short way of telling you what an hour of reviewing Oregons season game recaps spell out the Ducks struggled to beat decent but hardly great opponents Six of their games were decided by points or fewer In four games the margin was or fewer The Ducks had to persevere against Wisconsin Southern California UCLA and Oregon State Without the moral authority of the No ranking in the human polls Oregon Coach Mike Bellotti and the Ducks fans would assume the same gracious and silent posture as the coaches and partisans at Illinois and Maryland both also They would celebrate their fine season at a highprofile bowl game regret their single loss and admit that a down year in their respective conferences cost them a trip to the big game And how about that moral authority After Tennessee lost to Louisiana State last Saturday the coaching colleagues of Nebraskas Frank Solich changed their votes in favor of Barnett and Colorado to try to keep the Cornhuskers out of the title game Say what you want about computers and formulas but doesnt it bother you that the human component of the BCS formula is the only one that can willfully corrupt the integrity of the standing Beyond Colorado and Oregon the loudest whining is coming from the college playoff proponents many of whom are AP poll voters Fortunately they too account for percent of the BCS standing So far university presidents have emphatically shot down any playoff structure Wisely in my opinion Would the last three weeks with losses by Nebraska to Colorado Oklahoma to Oklahoma State Texas to Colorado Florida to Tennessee and Tennessee to LSU have been as urgent or dramatic if you knew many of these teams were going to tee it up again in a week or two and commence a roundrobin Of all the major sports only college football offers a regular season that matters Expanded playoffs in the pro sports and even the NCAA mens basketball tournament give fans cues when to pay attention In college football you pay attention from August on because the playoff is under way The BCS standing was created to ensure that the best two teams met in a title game which wasnt always guaranteed TennesseeFlorida State Virginia TechFlorida State OklahomaFlorida State The past three BCS title games resulted in an undisputed national champion Cut through all the noise and in Nebraska youll find a team that won straight by points or more Yes Nebraskas loss was ugly and it came in the season finale which pollsters for some reason have historically found abhorrent Yet Nebraska has one fewer loss than Colorado and has faced better competition than Oregon You may not like the BCS formula but it is fair Whether you calculate by abacus or algorithms Whether you argue it with barroom gusto or classroom decorum the BCS made the right game sportsncaafootballCOLLhtmlex eienaddadadd HOW TO ADVERTISE For information on advertising

Rebecca W Subject RE Western Frontier Project Please provide us with a copy of the filing and maps Neutral intervention will be fine Original Message From Cantrell Rebecca W Sent Thursday November PM To Miller Stephanie Tholt Jane M Shively Hunter S Lucci Paul T Subject Western Frontier Project The FERC notice on this project has been issued and comments are due by November Do we have any interests that would warrant more than a plain intervention Let me know if you want a copy of the original filing with maps etc INSIDE FERCOctober WILLIAMS PUTS MEAT ON THE BONES OF WESTERN FRONTIER PROJECT DESIGN Touting a need for more pipeline capacity linking the prolific supply basins of the central Rockies and increasingly hungry MidContinent markets The Williams Cos Inc last week took the next step by filing for authorization to build and operate the Western Frontier project The sponsor has in hand four negotiatedrate deals for longterm service covering roughly twothirds of the Dtday of project design capacity it told FERC in an Oct certificate application CP Williams wants to have the million project up and running by Nov it asked the commission to issue a final certificate by Dec so that it can commence construction by the following April Williams unveiled initial plans for Western Frontier early last summer IF July and held an open season in June and July To carry gas from the Power River Big Horn Wind River and Green River basins estimated to hold Tcf of potential and recoverable reserves the new inchdiameter mainline would run miles starting at the Cheyenne Hub and ending at an interconnection with the system of affiliate Williams Gas Pipelines Central Inc in Beaver County Okla Characterizing the Cheyenne Hub as a liquid point of supply Williams asserted that presently supply capability to the hub has outpaced transportation capacity away from the hub to market areas due to insufficient pipeline infrastructure Along the way the Western Frontier mainline would make another interconnection with Williams Central as well as with Northern Natural Gas Co ANR Pipeline Co Natural Gas Pipeline Co of America and Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co thus providing multiple avenues for gas produced in the central Rockies to be transported throughout the MidContinent using the existing pipeline grid To further enhance its supply options the sponsor wants to build a mile lateral from the mainline to the Wattenberg gas processing plant east of Denver to tap the DenverJulesberg basin Rounding out the project design are two new compressor stations the horsepower Chalk Bluff station to be constructed at the Cheyenne Hub and the hp Denver station to be built in Adams County Colo Following the open season Williams hammered out precedent agreements with Marathon Oil Co Dtday Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co Dtday Utilicorp United Inc Dtday and Entergy Power Generation Corp Dtday The initial term for the deals is years except for Marathon which committed to a fiveyear term with an option to extend it an additional two years said the application Other shippers have expressed serious interest for the remaining capacity on Western Frontier and active negotiations are moving forward with these potential shippers said the application adding that Williams was confident that the remaining capacity will be committed in the upcoming months With the addition of compression the project could facilitate relatively inexpensive expansions to accommodate future market growth the sponsor told FERC And that may well be necessary it continued pointing to stagnant to declining supply in the MidContinent basins coupled with projected demand increases As in many areas of the country much of the anticipated demand increase is attributed to installation and operation of gasfired electrical generation it said The Mw of active winter generating capacity in the combined service areas of Western Frontier and Williams Central is expected to more than double by said Williams The application seeks negotiated rate authority for the project operator Western Frontier Pipeline Co LLC and approval of initial recourse rates The maximum daily reservation rate under schedule FTS would be Dt for contract demand in Zone and Dt in Zone Under the negotiated deals reached with the four anchor shippers Utilicorp and Entergy would pay a combined reservation and commodity rate of Dt at a load factor for Zone service to the Williams Central Hugoton station in Kansas while WEMT would pay a combined rate of Dt for Zone transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay Dt under the shorter contract for Zone service to interconnects with ANR Panhandle and Williams Central in Oklahoma All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub

Kinsey Lisa Brady Kevin Pendergrass Cora Subject Highlights from ENE Analyst Conference Call Here are my notes from todays call As with Monday Ive focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to reorganize them by subject Enrons business has been grouped into three buckets Core Noncore and Under Review Core Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe retail energy pipelines Noncore Broadband water and international assets ie EGAS Enron has approx Bn in investments in these assets and they have produced dismal returns Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets Under Review EGM EIM These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of longterm viability Required resource levels are being carefully studied Following review Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or noncore as the analysis dictates Approximately MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter These include a gas LDC in Brazil EcoElectrica and our Indian EP assets Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of MMBn Given the current environment raising equity in the public markets would be inefficient McMahon says Shortterm liquidity is provided by the Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago the Bn of new debt and the Bn equity infusion from Dynegy Longerterm the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt McMahon described the major offbalancesheet vehicles Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets It was initially capitalized with MM of a debt and MM of equity raised from Enron and institutional investors The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix assets Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on the Enron topup obligation The date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated belowinvestmentgrade by any one of the three major agencies The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water As long as Wessex is worth at least Bn there will be no Enron topup required If we take a haircut to present book value Enron will have to provide MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt This MM would hit Enron cash income and equity balances Osprey contains energyrelated assets and other assets It was initially capitalized with Bn of a debt and MM in equity ENE and institutionals As with Marlin the entity is an assetbacked structure with an Enron topup guarantee The debt is supported by a the assets b Bn of convertible preferred ENE convertible into MM shares of ENE common and c additional ENE common as needed for topup Assuming the same hypothetical haircut to current book value Enron would have to deliver approx MM of topup fundswhich would hit ENE cash income and equity The debt must be retired by with the same cuttojunk early trigger provision as Marlin Yosemite and the CreditLinked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with large financial institutions The underlying transactions are already on Enrons balance sheet McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles McMahon says Our Q will be filed five days late The Q will include all of this detail regarding the offbalancesheet vehicles The special committee investigation is still ongoing The committee meets timesweek sometimes more often The outside auditors DT and external counsel hired by the committee are working virtually days a week Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation McMahon says its way too early to tell if any asset writedowns are called for That analysis is underway but it will not be complete for some time Osprey contains the European power projects Trakya and Saarlux some North American merchant investments and some Brazilian assets Under the merger agreement Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval However an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval Broadband is expected to be fully wound up sometime over the course of the next year Did not catch this part clearly The ENE topup obligation for Marlin represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level Current book value of the Osprey assets is Bn No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the Bn legal liability clause Yosemite and the CreditLinked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt this section somewhat unclear The underlying transactions represented volumes of crude oil and gas The transactions relate to the physical movement of these commodities The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longerterm products Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put longterm deals on hold last week Says that our first focus is on getting our shortterm business back up to normal levels It will be a couple of weeks before were able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding longterm deals with us McMahon There hasnt been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customerscredit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers But we have seen a return of some of the transactions some of the flows Whalley says that were hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure he says The cuts will certainly be deeper in our noncore businesses Whalley then quickly interjects some might say interrrupts with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business We will be looking at perhaps streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business McMahon The company is overlevered thats a facthence our pursuit of additional equity McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week ENE had approx Bn in cash as of which McMahon points out would be unusual for us As before give me a call at if youd like more color Patrick Tucker

Times article on SoCal GCIM reward In case you mised this Gas Co Asks to Recover Savings From Customers Rates Twopronged request seeks to add more than million to bills but offers to reduce that with PUC concessions like those that helped utility thrive By TIM REITERMAN Times Staff Writer Rates for Southern California Gas Co customers have fallen in recent months but they will rise again under an unusual twopronged request submitted to state regulators Friday The Gas Co asked that its million customers repay about half of a record million in natural gas cost savings the utility achieved for them in the volatile market of the last year The average increase would amount to per month or about on a typical monthly bill of But the Gas Co said it would reduce its request to about million if the state Public Utilities Commission agrees to continue an incentive program that has brought the utility millions of dollars and to change the rules for how much of the windfall goes to the company and how much to consumers That would drop the monthly increase to about cents on a typical bill Although such rate increases may seem relatively modest they follow a winter season in which bills rose sharplyand that made it admittedly awkward for the Gas Co to seek tens of millions of dollars more from its own ratepayers To claim a huge reward for good performance in a year when ratepayers are paying at record levels did not look good said Mike Florio of the Utility Reform Network or TURN a consumer watchdog group I think it speaks to the companys sense of reality that they did not try to squeeze every last nickel out of ratepayers It could have been a big ugly fight While other gas and electric utilities have been battered by the natural gas market the Gas Co has thrived under a state incentive program that rewards utilities whenever they can purchase gas for less than market rates By aggressively buying and selling the Gas Co managed savings in the last year that were almost times the highest previous totals However PUC officials raised questions about whether the Gas Co should be entitled to its roughly split with customers which would amount to million for the year ended in March During recent negotiations the company agreed to a compromise with the PUCs consumer protection arm and TURN In for the Long Haul Not the Quick Buck The Gas Co now is willing to accept a smaller share of the savings for the last yearabout and for future years Were in this for the long haul and not the quick buck said Jim Harrigan the companys director of gas acquisition We want to see the incentive program continue in the future so it can benefit ratepayers and the company alike During a push for deregulation in the mids the PUC created a program for the states three major gas utilitiesSouthern California Gas San Diego Gas Electric and Pacific Gas Electricthat was designed to give them added motivation to obtain the fuel at the best price for customers The program replaced contentious PUC reviews that determined whether the utilities bought gas at reasonable prices and sometimes resulted in the companies having to pay back millions of dollars to customers By most accounts the program achieved its goals at the Gas Co During the first six years the savings amounted to million million of which went to the utility and the rest to benefit customers But no one envisioned what would happen in the natural gas market over the last year when prices along the California border skyrocketed The Gas Co used its purchasing power and storage and pipeline capacity to become a big player in the regional market In a trading room at its Los Angeles headquarters the company conducts about transactions a year buying selling lending and trading gas Last winter when prices rocketed one deal alone achieved savings of million Harrigan said the company bought gas options in October and November We looked at it as an insurance policy he said Those were bought at between per million British thermal units and and the price ran to Those prices allowed the Gas Co to essentially apply the difference to the PUCs incentive program The PUC rules allow the Gas Co to hedge to protect customers from price volatility but they prohibit speculation in the marketplace Harrigan said it is difficult to draw the distinction but he added We recognize when we are incurring risk and have tight controls over it The option purchases he noted were initiated by company Chairman Edwin A Guiles and done in consultation with PUC officials The options he said protected customers from December through March when the Gas Co achieved the lions share of its million in savings I dont think anyone anticipated savings this large said Richard Myers program supervisor at the PUCs Energy Division As the savings mounted through the winter and beyond PUC officials reassessed the incentive program and questioned whether ratepayers should receive a larger share of the rewards It was only fair they reasoned since customers pay for the pipeline capacity and other assets that allow the utility to beat the market On Friday the Gas Co filed a request with the PUC for its full share of the savings along with its proposed settlement with the agencys Office of Ratepayer Advocates and TURN The agreement which requires approval from the full commission would divert more of the savings to customers Rather than the current split the proposed system would give the utility a maximum of the savings The sharing is not nearly as beneficial to the shareholders said Anne Smith the Gas Cos vice president for customer services and marketing We would have loved to preserve the current split but in the interest of ratepayers we think this is a good deal Although the typical monthly winter bill for Gas Co customers rose to from a year ago the price has been dropping in recent months Junes gas cost of cents per therm is about over that of June But that is far lower than at San Diego Gas Electric which saw gas costs rise to from cents a year ago Executives of SDGE which like the Gas Co is a unit of Sempra Energy said they have no figures for their incentive program which runs until July Pacific Gas Electric had no gas cost incentive savings this past year The Gas Cos large savings and aggressive trading have raised concerns that its activities may have driven market prices higher Although Florio of TURN praised the company for a job well done he said I think one of the reasons they settled is to avoid a big fight over whether its actions affected the market to the detriment of others We could have spent three months and not come to a conclusion he added Brian Cherry PGEs director of regulatory relations said Until we can see the details behind the transactions we are not certain as to what impact if any they had on prices at the California border Said Smith of the Gas Co We do firmly believe our actions did not cause prices to go up for other customers The market she said is almost like a race Some came out better than others

reveal details of the contracts Bernadette Tansey Lynda Gledhill Chronicle Staff Writers Thursday August San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifcaMNDTL California has quietly started buying natural gas in response to the energy crisis forming a gas supply operation that could become one of the largest in the state But in a repeat of the states tactics when it lined up billion in electricity contracts officials wont say how much they have spent so far or how much they plan to buy in the future The state is already supplying gas for one power plant this month in an attempt to keep generating costs in check and it has signed a small contract for gas storage space state officials said But they refused to provide The Chronicle with records of any of the purchases Releasing additional details such as the price officials paid would jeopardize the states goal of keeping electricity costs down by delivering cheaper fuel to natural gasfueled power plants that serve California said Ray Hart deputy director of the state Department of Water Resources If private energy traders knew what the state planned to buy Hart said they could rush in scoop up the supplies and demand substantially higher prices to resell them to the state he said Details of the states gas deals will be made public as much as six months after theyre signed when they no longer give traders any advantage he said That stance has raised an outcry among Republicans and consumer advocates who criticized the Davis administration earlier this year for delaying disclosure of state power contracts that locked in a huge percentage of Californias power needs for more than a decade If there were a competitive bidding process then yes the price should be secret while its pending said Marcel Hawiger a natural gas analyst for the consumer group The Utility Reform Network But in a situation like it is now where theyre just negotiating backroom deals we think they should be disclosing everything right away Critics of the Davis administration who think the state already got rooked on the power contracts are equally leery about the states foray into the natural gas market A DISASTER The governors secrecy and lack of oversight has been a disaster for the people of California over the last six months said Republican gubernatorial candidate and current Secretary of State Bill Jones These are the same novices who signed those energy contracts Hart said the gas operation would reinforce the states longterm power buying effort that he credits with taming the outofcontrol electricity market in California His department was pressed into service as an emergency electricity buyer in January after skyrocketing power prices drove state utilities deeply into debt The states new natural gas endeavor is intended as an insurance policy to make sure power plants under longterm contracts with the state dont hike their prices by claiming steep costs for fuel a justification used by many generators during the height of the energy crisis last winter Under terms of some of the state electricity contracts if the power plants dont make lowcost deals for gas the state can step in and deliver the fuel itself The plan is to stand ready to provide fuel to generators throughout the state by lining up natural gas supplies setting up to ship gas through pipelines within the state and arranging for temporary storage space so any state gas surplus can be saved instead of being sold at a loss Hart said If the state were to step in as supplier for all the contracts that give it that option the government would become one of the largest gas purchasers in the state he said Harts agency signed a fouryear million contract in May with a Livermore gas consulting firm Interstate Gas Services The firm was authorized in July to make shortterm gas deals with four suppliers in Texas and one in California STRATEGY QUESTIONED Whether the state will be a successful player in the natural gas market is already being questioned by TURN and Pacific Gas and Electric Co They say the state is reading the future gas market incorrectly by predicting prices close to double what experienced utility gas managers say the state will see by late Bill Marcus a TURN energy consultant said the states high forecasts alone could lead to unnecessary rate increases Ron Low a PGE spokesman said state gas cost overestimates would add million to consumers bills statewide through about million would be paid by PGE customers Hart scoffed at PGEs claims For them to say the price of gas is going to stay the same is ridiculous Hart said Gas prices have dropped this summer because of the cool weather and conservation efforts he said But things could change rapidly when demand peaks in the future Youre going to see prices go up again Mark Allen Bernstein an analyst with RAND said the state might be doing the right thing if it buys natural gas when prices are low in the spring and fall and socks it away in storage basins to release when demand spikes in the summer and winter We need to make sure there is sufficient storage to weather demand and price fluctuations he said The state has lined up a small contract with the Wild Goose storage basin in Butte County and is supplying gas to an Alliance power plant as it starts operations this month water department officials said It has also locked in gas supplies at a set price for Dynegy plants in Southern California The state has still not decided whether to contract for space on the interstate pipelines that bring gas to California from outofstate producing basins Hart said Hart said critics of the states electricity contracts who said the deals all should have locked in a fixed price had already been proved wrong By allowing some of the contract prices to float up or down with the price of gas Hart said the state has been able to take advantage of a steep drop in gas prices this spring We got totally hammered by the media for those variable contracts Hart said My God were saving billions of dollars Email the reporters at mailto and mailto San Francisco Chronicle Page A

No handouts were provided Calculation of Receipt Point Capacity Topock mmcfd Ehrenberg mmcfd Needles mmcfd Wheeler mmcfd New Receipt Points Kramer Junction mmcfd Hector Rd mmcfd Both will be available around Feb Basis of ProRationCurrent Windows Calculation Currently Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system Gas Select prorates interstates receipt capacity based on prior days nominations New Calculation Changes and Display Based on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast They use Weather Bank as one of their tools OFO Declaration Name changes from overnomination Can declare before any Cycle Provide hour notice Post on Gas Select Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select Windows Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system Calculation based on noms which does not work well Lots of complaints People were complaining that it restricted access to the system Eliminating point specific calculation Open system to Max Oper Limits or Contractual Limits Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug procedures No changes to Wheeler Ridge Due to the need to maintain operational control an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle Replace windows with operational maximum volumes If CPUC approves comprehensive settlement will post days of information to anticipate OFOs Now customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows Scheduling ChangesNov Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid No direct dialup Rollover nomsnoms will be copied from cycle to cycle Copy confirmed noms All noms will be rolled overwill not be at discretion of rd party However can still make changes Can still upload new files Hour Notice Socal will provide hour notice on Gas Select of OFO Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline and list of email messages that can go directly to pagers Gas Select is official notification Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail Gas Select is a subscriber based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free OFOs are going to be system wide and not customer specific OFOs can be declared intraday Once OFO declared it will be kept for entire day Concerned that if call off will have to put back on Dont want to go back and forth This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works Many times Socal see an increase of mmcfday between Cycle and so they are concerned Scheduled vs CapacityDeclare OFO Nominations may not exceed of expected usage Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week Can revise expected usage No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO Use Elapsed ProRata Rules Expected Usagecut nominations to of expected usage so will use same day of the prior week as proxy Generators need to revise expected usage Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal Flow Day Diversions dont go into effect until after Cycle Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed If call OFO after cycle or and have interruptible storage injections such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised If OFO called Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows Cycle Nom cut Cycle Nom cut Cylce Nom cut Windows will only be implemented during cycle if OFO callled after cycle and no improvement is realized Will allocate prorata Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point In other words if OFO declared during Cycle and no relief after cycles Socal will window Cycle and prorata cut Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles For penalty purposes actual burn from oclock to oclock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered For OFO assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week Declare OFO on prior days scheduled volume For an evening declarationwill use most recent available scheduled volumes For example Flow Day Scheduled Volumes Cycle Cycle Cycle Intraday Cycle evening cyle on Cycle Intraday on In other words will look at evening cycle scheduled volumes on the

window procedures No handouts were provided Calculation of Receipt Point Capacity Topock mmcfd Ehrenberg mmcfd Needles mmcfd Wheeler mmcfd New Receipt Points Kramer Junction mmcfd Hector Rd mmcfd Both will be available around Feb Basis of ProRationCurrent Windows Calculation Currently Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system Gas Select prorates interstates receipt capacity based on prior days nominations New Calculation Changes and Display Based on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast They use Weather Bank as one of their tools OFO Declaration Name changes from overnomination Can declare before any Cycle Provide hour notice Post on Gas Select Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select Windows Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system Calculation based on noms which does not work well Lots of complaints People were complaining that it restricted access to the system Eliminating point specific calculation Open system to Max Oper Limits or Contractual Limits Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug procedures No changes to Wheeler Ridge Due to the need to maintain operational control an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle Replace windows with operational maximum volumes If CPUC approves comprehensive settlement will post days of information to anticipate OFOs Now customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows Scheduling ChangesNov Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid No direct dialup Rollover nomsnoms will be copied from cycle to cycle Copy confirmed noms All noms will be rolled overwill not be at discretion of rd party However can still make changes Can still upload new files Hour Notice Socal will provide hour notice on Gas Select of OFO Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline and list of email messages that can go directly to pagers Gas Select is official notification Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail Gas Select is a subscriber based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free OFOs are going to be system wide and not customer specific OFOs can be declared intraday Once OFO declared it will be kept for entire day Concerned that if call off will have to put back on Dont want to go back and forth This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works Many times Socal see an increase of mmcfday between Cycle and so they are concerned Scheduled vs CapacityDeclare OFO Nominations may not exceed of expected usage Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week Can revise expected usage No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO Use Elapsed ProRata Rules Expected Usagecut nominations to of expected usage so will use same day of the prior week as proxy Generators need to revise expected usage Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal Flow Day Diversions dont go into effect until after Cycle Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed If call OFO after cycle or and have interruptible storage injections such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised If OFO called Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows Cycle Nom cut Cycle Nom cut Cylce Nom cut Windows will only be implemented during cycle if OFO callled after cycle and no improvement is realized Will allocate prorata Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point In other words if OFO declared during Cycle and no relief after cycles Socal will window Cycle and prorata cut Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles For penalty purposes actual burn from oclock to oclock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered For OFO assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week Declare OFO on prior days scheduled volume For an evening declarationwill use most recent available scheduled volumes For example Flow Day Scheduled Volumes Cycle Cycle Cycle Intraday Cycle evening cyle on Cycle Intraday on In other words will look at evening cycle scheduled volumes on the rd for declaring OFO on cycle for the th look at intra day for the rd in declaring OFO for cycle on the th look at evening cycle on in declaraing OFO for

when storage levels equal bcf plus peak day min Look at storage graph on Gas Select Posted hours in advance if the minimum daily is changed If go to current day cycle must end completely before new

declared during undernom season winter season
