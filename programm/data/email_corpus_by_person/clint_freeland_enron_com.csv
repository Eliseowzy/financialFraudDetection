will always be directed to the right person regardless of what employee reassignments may occur between now and then Jim what do you think of this Christine since Sara is out would you please include Jim Armogida on the distribution list Thanks CF Original Message From mailto Sent Thursday September AM To Shackleton Sara Cc Freeland Clint Nogid Jeff Subject Equity Forward Contract Sara Thank you for reviewing and returning the equity forward confirmations so promptly We have reviewed the handwritten comment on page of the contract and unfortunately cannot accept the language as presented Our concern is that if we are unable to get through to Clint for any reason either speaking to him directly or getting voice mail the termination notice would not be effective We propose to insert the following language instead Such NonAffected Party will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly confirm the transmission of such facsimile notice by telephone telephone number to the Affected Party provided however that failure to so confirm will not in anyway invalidate the effectiveness of a notice by facsimile transmission insert as the last sentence of the third paragraph under Additional Termination Event Please let me know if this works for you If so we will produce new contracts with the language and send it back to you for another round of signatures Please call me if
