Julian Bill From Mike Florio Subject Fwd Re Wohin gehen wir I forgot to hit the reply to all button when I responded to Rich Date Fri Nov To Rich Ferguson leanpowerorg From Mike Florio Subject Re Wohin gehen wir Cc ETeam Rich I like the idea but Im not sure Im a very good test case After all I have been branded as the last living defender of command and control regulation socialist central planning and everything else bad that youve ever thought of Could the role of CalPower be better filled by an existing forprofit company eg Enron NO WAY Any private seller would have all the same conflicts as the utilities and then some But Michael Shames is interested in the idea of auctioning off all or parts of the retail franchise in San Diego since SDGE doesnt seem to want to be in the business anymore I have been pushing a corenoncore distinction such as you suggest although I havent been bold enough to suggest a nonprofit procurement entity I did push this idea for PGEs gas procurement back in the bad old Gas Accord days but the idea got nowhere then What Ive talked about is including the retained at least for now generation in the core portfolio along with some contracts and some spot Havent developed any numbers yet I would certainly encourage shopping the idea Sellers will probably hate it because this entity would have more market buying power than even the current UDCs But so what thats what we want right Id suggest running it by Bill Julian for a political straight face test but I would guess hed like it And it would be a perfect vehicle for RPS which we would certainly like to revive Lets keep exploring this MIKE At PM you wrote Folks I am growing increasingly worried about future public policy oversight of utility power purchases given the current conventional wisdom that more long term purchases should be made I have been promoting the notion that the default power portfolio should be maintained by a new nonprofit quasipublic entity with revenues guaranteed by the PUC rather than by three separate IOUs subject or not to reasonableness reviews Your comments on this notion are eagerly sought Purchasing power for default customers The recently proposed FERC decision essentially puts California back where it was in There appears to be near universal agreement that the IOUs should enter into long term power purchase agreements and limit exposure to the spot market As you recall the BRPU reached the same conclusion decided how much should be purchased held the auction etc And then FERC blew it up after deciding that the states avoided cost estimates were wrong FERC appears now to agree it made a mistake and essentially orders us to start the process all over again However the proposed order makes no mention of state oversight of utility purchases But at the briefing held last Wednesday for Bowen and legislative staff FERC staff made it clear that they were not mandating any alternative to replace the must sellbuy requirement that they were eliminating Presumably the state could still mandate the IOUs buy in the PX or whatever and still comply with the FERC order As long as the utilities remain regulated by the PUC the state can control their power purchases The problem is that after screwing around for ten years there is now enormous pressure to let the utilities do what they will a result that I fear would be bad for consumers and bad for the environment On the other hand there no time nor stomach for repeating the BRPU process My preferred solution is the establishment of a new not for profit utility that would make power portfolio decisions for default customers lets call it CalPower The three existing regulated utilities would no longer sell energy at retail CalPower decisions would be subject to whatever public policy conditions the legislature andor the PUC chose to impose However some kind expedited review process would allow CalPower to be very nimble in the power market and recovery of their revenue requirement would be guaranteed Direction of CalPower could be by political appointees elected representatives or some combination My fantasy is a governance structure similar to CalPERS in which broad legislative guidelines are interpreted by a board of directors and implemented by experienced traders Compared to the present structure in which default portfolios are designed by three different forprofit utilities CalPower appears to have the following advantages The nonprofit structure eliminates all financial conflicts of interest in portfolio design and ensures optimum implementation of public policy goals It ensures equitable treatment of all customers statewide with price differences reflecting market realities rather than differing purchase criteria by each utility It allows CalPower to be as nimble in the market as any other commercial trader by allowing the PUC or other state agencies to participate in portfolio design issues upfront rather than requiring lengthy after the fact review CalPowers disadvantage appears to be that it requires yet another new statechartered nonprofit organization Politicians appear intent on blaming the two they have already and returning to the old utilitycentric system rather than risk their necks by proposing solutions that they then would be responsible for Obviously there are many questions and details to be worked out Which customers would be default customers My option would be to declare all customers under KW permanent default customers green or other marketers could participate through contracts for differences but physical power would be acquired for all these customers by CalPower Customers KW would be on their own What is the relationship with the PUC With the legislature Could the role of CalPower be better filled by an existing forprofit company eg Enron How are the benefitscosts of existing utility generation assets and PP contracts shared Etc Is this concept attractive enough to be worth pursuing The next step would be to get a group of interested parties together to put some meat on these bones and float the idea seriously perhaps even get some draft legislation on paper to shop around Interested Let me know Regards Rich

listing holdings of between and in stock in ScottishPower SPI whose subsidiary PacifiCorp Power Marketing signed a billion year power contract with the state Department of Water Resources on July Budraja failed to disclose the information in a form he filed in July after energy consultants hired by Gov Gray Davis came under fire for failing to file routine financial disclosure forms Budrajas August economic disclosure form states that he sold his ScottishPower shares July on the advice of his lawyer He purchased the shares pre according to the form Daviss office has sent a copy of Budrajas amended filing to the states Fair Political Practices Committee for review said Bill Kissinger Deputy Legal Affairs adviser for Davis The FPPC is conducting an investigation into a handful of

lieu of Californias insolvent utilities said Budraja didnt negotiate the contract with PacifiCorp The department disclosed the contract on Aug Stephen Kaufman a lawyer representing the Electric Power Group and Budraja also said Budraja didnt help negotiate the contract Kaufman added that Budrajas ScottishPower holdings were tied up in an IRA and that Budraja hadnt even realized he held stock in the company until a review of his financial records was undertaken recently A decision was made upon reviewing all of Mr Budrajas assets to disclose this to the public given all the activities going

Julian Bill From Mike Florio Subject Fwd Re Wohin gehen wir I forgot to hit the reply to all button when I responded to Rich Date Fri Nov To Rich Ferguson leanpowerorg From Mike Florio Subject Re Wohin gehen wir Cc ETeam Rich I like the idea but Im not sure Im a very good test case After all I have been branded as the last living defender of command and control regulation socialist central planning and everything else bad that youve ever thought of Could the role of CalPower be better filled by an existing forprofit company eg Enron NO WAY Any private seller would have all the same conflicts as the utilities and then some But Michael Shames is interested in the idea of auctioning off all or parts of the retail franchise in San Diego since SDGE doesnt seem to want to be in the business anymore I have been pushing a corenoncore distinction such as you suggest although I havent been bold enough to suggest a nonprofit procurement entity I did push this idea for PGEs gas procurement back in the bad old Gas Accord days but the idea got nowhere then What Ive talked about is including the retained at least for now generation in the core portfolio along with some contracts and some spot Havent developed any numbers yet I would certainly encourage shopping the idea Sellers will probably hate it because this entity would have more market buying power than even the current UDCs But so what thats what we want right Id suggest running it by Bill Julian for a political straight face test but I would guess hed like it And it would be a perfect vehicle for RPS which we would certainly like to revive Lets keep exploring this MIKE At PM you wrote Folks I am growing increasingly worried about future public policy oversight of utility power purchases given the current conventional wisdom that more long term purchases should be made I have been promoting the notion that the default power portfolio should be maintained by a new nonprofit quasipublic entity with revenues guaranteed by the PUC rather than by three separate IOUs subject or not to reasonableness reviews Your comments on this notion are eagerly sought Purchasing power for default customers The recently proposed FERC decision essentially puts California back where it was in There appears to be near universal agreement that the IOUs should enter into long term power purchase agreements and limit exposure to the spot market As you recall the BRPU reached the same conclusion decided how much should be purchased held the auction etc And then FERC blew it up after deciding that the states avoided cost estimates were wrong FERC appears now to agree it made a mistake and essentially orders us to start the process all over again However the proposed order makes no mention of state oversight of utility purchases But at the briefing held last Wednesday for Bowen and legislative staff FERC staff made it clear that they were not mandating any alternative to replace the must sellbuy requirement that they were eliminating Presumably the state could still mandate the IOUs buy in the PX or whatever and still comply with the FERC order As long as the utilities remain regulated by the PUC the state can control their power purchases The problem is that after screwing around for ten years there is now enormous pressure to let the utilities do what they will a result that I fear would be bad for consumers and bad for the environment On the other hand there no time nor stomach for repeating the BRPU process My preferred solution is the establishment of a new not for profit utility that would make power portfolio decisions for default customers lets call it CalPower The three existing regulated utilities would no longer sell energy at retail CalPower decisions would be subject to whatever public policy conditions the legislature andor the PUC chose to impose However some kind expedited review process would allow CalPower to be very nimble in the power market and recovery of their revenue requirement would be guaranteed Direction of CalPower could be by political appointees elected representatives or some combination My fantasy is a governance structure similar to CalPERS in which broad legislative guidelines are interpreted by a board of directors and implemented by experienced traders Compared to the present structure in which default portfolios are designed by three different forprofit utilities CalPower appears to have the following advantages The nonprofit structure eliminates all financial conflicts of interest in portfolio design and ensures optimum implementation of public policy goals It ensures equitable treatment of all customers statewide with price differences reflecting market realities rather than differing purchase criteria by each utility It allows CalPower to be as nimble in the market as any other commercial trader by allowing the PUC or other state agencies to participate in portfolio design issues upfront rather than requiring lengthy after the fact review CalPowers disadvantage appears to be that it requires yet another new statechartered nonprofit organization Politicians appear intent on blaming the two they have already and returning to the old utilitycentric system rather than risk their necks by proposing solutions that they then would be responsible for Obviously there are many questions and details to be worked out Which customers would be default customers My option would be to declare all customers under KW permanent default customers green or other marketers could participate through contracts for differences but physical power would be acquired for all these customers by CalPower Customers KW would be on their own What is the relationship with the PUC With the legislature Could the role of CalPower be better filled by an existing forprofit company eg Enron How are the benefitscosts of existing utility generation assets and PP contracts shared Etc Is this concept attractive enough to be worth pursuing The next step would be to get a group of interested parties together to put some meat on these bones and float the idea seriously perhaps even get some draft legislation on paper to shop around Interested Let me know Regards Rich
