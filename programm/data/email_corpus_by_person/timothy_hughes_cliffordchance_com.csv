confusion regarding this process At the end of the email you ask for our comments on the ROETA execution process We would prefer that the ROETA be executed offline It is on that basis that we have sought the opinion of overseas counsel That said you may form the view that online execution of the ROETA is no different to the operation of a website with a hotlinked disclaimer On that basis you may decide to execute the ROETA online We have some concerns regarding security issues because of the distribution of a password without a supporting agreement however you may form the view that this

Customers We are going to preregister a large number of customers prior to the launch These customers will not receive any documentation from us apart from the one page application form Password

a marketing brochure this will be very glossy with only high level details nothing specific to the customer but will outline the registration process to include whether to send to UK os US office The

on enter This ETA must be printable The customer then enters the site and transacts If the customer is transacting under a master then the GTC for a particular product will not need to be accepted if the customer is dealing without a master then any person using the administrator password or any of its subsidiary passwords can accept the GTC it only needs to be accepted once by any one person

printable in the Garden CC prefers them to be availableYES Read Only Customers If a customer counterparty does not respond by signing our PA and therefore has not access to the site and we are very keen for them to be a trading counterparty over the Internet we want a way of showing them what they are missing So we will be sending them a password and login for read only access We could also send out to bodies like regulators or brokers etc but that will be up to the traders any counterparties wanting access like this would apply through th eroute outlined above for new counterparties and we would authorise readonly access We will no be advertising read only access as available They will be able to enter the site for a period for time Enron needs to be capable of setting system limits to the amount of time a customercounterparty is given readonly access for unable to transact but view only Procedure Either Enron monitors the list of counterparties having registered against the full counterparty list and notes that specific counterparty has not registered The trading desk with primary trading contact with such counterparty is contacted and asked if they would like to offer read only access for a period of time or a trader applies to the Online Product Control group for read only access for one of his customers The Product Control Group will issue a passwordlogin which will be time dated only valid for a certain period The counterparty will login and immediately greeted by a Read Only ETA these are to be country specific The counterparty must accept the Read Only ETA

capability of creating further passwords but the period of time they are allowed access will depend on each trader Some customers may be allowed in for one day others for one month In the Garden there must be a sentence to be drafted by CC to inform potential Guest User that his request for Read Only access may not be granted We will not be advertising this facility and it will therefore not be mentioned in the garden The only phrase in the garden refers to customers who apply for a password may not get access see above Is Read Only ETA accepted online or it should be signed and mailed back

the ETAs Marks comments System administrator will not be a trader as far as the system is concerned If they are in reality that is none of our concern Agreed we need to change the name of System

email regards Tim Timothy Hughes Clifford Chance Aldersgate St ECA JJ London UK direct switch fax Original Message From Hughes Timothy MCC Sent Tuesday July AM To Justin Boyd Cc Scott Sefton Edmund Cooper Elena Kapralova Wilkinson Andrew JY MCC Huggard Patrick MCC Millard Christopher MCC Louise Kitchen Subject Internet Trading Dear Justin We refer to our meeting with you and the rest of the project team of July and our subsequent phone call of July We thought it may be useful for us to set out in writing our advice in relation to a number of the issues that we discussed at the above meeting and conference call On that basis please find below the following advice on the following issues Legal and Privacy Statement We believe that the Legal and Privacy statement should be available on the first entry page for the Enron website and on each of the main trading pages in the same form and style as the other navigational links The Legal and Privacy statement contains important legal protections for Enron that we think should be displayed at the earliest opportunity and in a prominent fashion The more prominent the display the easier it will be for Enron to argue that a user of the website was aware of this statement and therefore that it is binding on them Bid Box When a trader clicks on a bid or offer price in the trading section of the website a bid box appears It is important that this box contains wording that indicates that at the underlying legal level the trader is making an offer that Enron is free to accept or reject On that basis we recommend that the main wording in the bid box be I want to buy quantity or I want to sell quantity Availability of PA and ETA There is little case law to guide us as to the best approach for ensuring that agreements formed online are sufficiently executed to be enforced by courts in England To improve Enrons argument that the ETA has been sufficiently executed and agreed to by the counterparty we advise that the ETA be available for viewing and printing at all times through a hotlink in the trading section of the website This will assist our argument that the ETA is incorporated by reference when a counterparty signs the PA If for some reason for example the ETA is not available at the time of signing the PA the direct incorporation of the ETA argument fails the hotlink to the ETA may help to establish a course of dealing argument That is an argument that over time the counterparty has been trading on the same terms and conditions for each trade and has therefore affirmed its initial acceptance of those terms and conditions Registration Forms We look forward to an opportunity to review the online registration form for new customers We also look forward to reviewing the online registration form for view only users of the website Prior to our review of the view only registration form can you please confirm whether or not Enron will be vetting view only applications If view only users are issued passwords automatically without a confirmation of identity or other verification or clearance by Enron then we should discuss the possible risks and legal issues that may arise Master Agreements We understand that Enron is internally discussing the relationship between Master Agreement NBP terms and NBP side letters The conclusion of these discussion may require an amendment to the ETA in particular clause a Changes to the GTCs and ETA It is clear from an English law perspective and the bulk of overseas jurisdictions consulted by us that an change to the GTCs or ETA will require the counterparty to accept the change by executing a new version of the agreement Three issues have arisen in implementing this process a Marking up Changes From a legal as well as a public relations perspective it is preferable that amended agreements contain a process for indicating what changes have been made This process could take the form of a list of changes or double underline or other markup procedure Changes should be indicated against the previous version All versions should be dated Similarly the ticker tape screen should indicate that there is a new version until that new version is accepted That said this position is advisable only if Enron can be certain that all changes to amended agreements are identified If amended agreements are presented for execution that are improperly markedup or do not markup certain changes then Enron would have a lesser chance of enforcing these unmarked changes than if no markingup was shown Therefore this process is advisable only if Enron can ensure that all changes are identified b Notice of changes We have previously discussed with you what procedure should be adopted by Enron to notify counterparties of the change in the ETA or GTCs To improve any argument that a counterparty has freely consented to an amended agreement we would advise that Enron adopt a procedure for notifying counterparties of the altered agreements in advance of them taking effect This notice should not be a contractual obligation rather an internal Enron procedure That said we understand from our meeting that there may be emergency situations requiring an immediate change to an agreement with the result that trading is suspended under the old agreement If those circumstances are likely to be the bulk of cases when amendments are to be made then the notice process may not necessarily be appropriate If notice is not given then Enron would be relying on the following elements as asserting that a counterparty freely accepted the amended agreement i that the counterparty was prompted that the agreement had been amended and if markups are provided that the changes were indicated and ii that the counterparty is a professional organisation with experience in the speed and pace of the commodities trading industry These elements are not conclusive but would give Enron an argument that the counterparty is bound to any accepted amended agreement c Overseas Counsel Advice from overseas counsel on amendment of the ETA and GTCs did not specify that Enron would not be giving the counterparty a period of notice of changes to the agreements during which the counterparty could continue to trade Therefore if it is ultimately decided that no notice period will be used then we may need to seek further advice from overseas counsel ETA Termination Under your recent instructions we have amended the ETA so that it can only be terminated for convenience by Enron That is there is no express termination for convenience right for a counterparty We have previously noted that this means that an ETA may continue to be in force with a counterparty that has ceased to trade or wishes to cease trading with Enron Advice from overseas counsel on the drafting of the ETA and GTCs was sought based on a reciprocal right to terminate with notice We will seek further advice from overseas counsel on this issue Website Text Review We look forward to an opportunity to review the text and layout of the website to assess the final impact of the layout and text on the contractual obligations formed using the website Data Protection Since our meetings and conference call we have discussed further our recent advice to you on data protection We are currently seeking the further advice of overseas counsel of this issue and will provide further advice to you shortly German digital signatures Further advice is being sought from German counsel We will provide you with a response on this issue shortly We hope the above provides a useful summary of our advice on a number of issues Please do not hesitate to contact us to discuss any aspect of this matter Regards Timothy HughesAndrew Wilkinson The information in this email and in any

agreements during which the counterparty could continue to trade Therefore if it is ultimately decided that no notice period will be used then we may need to seek further advice from overseas counsel ETA Termination Under your recent instructions we have amended the ETA so that it can only be terminated for convenience by Enron That is there is no express termination for convenience right for a counterparty We have previously noted that this means that an ETA may continue to be in force with a counterparty that has ceased to trade or wishes to cease trading with Enron Advice from overseas
