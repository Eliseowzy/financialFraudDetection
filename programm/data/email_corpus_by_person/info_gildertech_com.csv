BIOTECH WATCH Old Stem Cells Do It Better All systems were go for federally funded embryo stemcell research at the National Institutes of Health New guidelines bequeathed by the Clinton administration for skirting a congressional ban were in place A meeting to review the first applications for grants was set for midApril when NIHs acting director Ruth Kirschstein suddenly received the word from on

a mother lode of possible new treatments for diabetes heart disease Parkinsons Alzheimers and more Capable of differentiating into the full spectrum of other cell typesfrom a new liver cell to a new neuronthey could be ideal for repairing or replacing diseased organs The furor is not over their usefulness but their source Should researchers use aborted or discarded human embryos Or should they be restricted to adult stemcells found in fat bone and the brain Those ethical questions are riveting but they are being trumped by the market specifically the venture investment market which is voting with its dollars for adult stemcell research The universe of established companies doing stemcell research encompasses about public and private biotechnology firms Of these fewer than half are involved primarily in developing treatments from stem cells And only two of those pureplay companies do significant work with embryonic cells Dr Scott Gottlieb Gilders newest analyst dives into the

Letter BonusRay Kurzweils Trillion Bet Readings Conference Calendar THE WEEKGeorge Bushs Emergency from The American Spectator Stock market crashes predict recessions rather than cause them But when the driving force of the economy is exceptionally rapid innovation powered by risk capital the disappearance in less than a year of trillion worth of such capital largely as a result of a Federal Reserve sucker punch must be treated by the government as an emergency Even in much of the financial press the most common reaction to the Nasdaq collapse has been sniggering selfsatisfaction that gogo investors have finally gotten theirs All one needed to do to avoid disaster highrisk investors are condescendingly told was to be a sensible fellow and invest in the Real Economy where they make important things like Coke or perhaps aluminumfor the cans But the value investor snuggled safely on the sidelines is comparatively useless to economic growth Growth is primarily a function of innovation and thus of risk Investors in innovation against all conventional wisdom bet that they can beat the market defying its relentless efficiency to seek out as yet unrecognized and undiscounted advance This is at the best of times a hazardous undertaking In the early s risk capital essentially disappeared intimidated by a combination of inflation high taxes and government hostility The year boom has largely been driven by the restoration of risk capitals rewards The Feds whipsawing of investors over the past months shattered those rewards discouraging and defunding the nations most useful investors The administration could hardly do anything more useful than create incentives to get them back in the game It was the capital gains tax cuts of and that most powerfully drove the boom For those obsessed with surpluses capital gains cuts always pay for themselves Cutting the current percent rate by five points and narrowing or ending the distinction between long and shortterm gains would do more to resurrect the Nasdaq than the Feds ratecut water torture And it would do more than all the onesided bipartisanship and compassionate conservatism in the world to secure the

Spur Entrepreneurs MITs Nobel Prize winning economist Robert Solow likes to crack apparently unironically that economic theory advances one academic funeral at a time That goes triply for anything that smacks of dare we say itthe supply side But hope like growth springs eternal In a new monograph titled Personal Income Taxes and the Growth of Small Firms a team of unimpeachably mainstream economists headed by Princetons Harvey Rosen used tax return data to determine how reductions in marginal tax rates in this case the Tax Reform Act affect small businesses No prize for guessing what they found The greater the decrease in the sole proprietors marginal tax rates the report concludes the greater the increase in the size of his or her business Note that were talking revenue growth here not just a posttax earnings boost And the results are startling even after controlling for everything from the entrepreneurs personal profiles to the industries in which they operate cutting the top marginal rate from percent to percent increased the size of the average business by percent Thats not trivial in macro terms either In nonfarm sole proprietors accounted for roughly percent of the trillion in US domestic business income Now maybe the same team can go back to the same data and look at the effects on tax receipts A PDF version of the full paper is available for a charge from the

Stephenson Letters to the Friday Letter Readings Conference Calendar THE WEEKToo Much of a Good Thing The specter of overinvestment is haunting Wall Street like a bad hangover on the morning after A recent Business Week special report entitled Telecom Meltdown describes the likely ripple effectsnone of them goodfrom too much capital chasing too few opportunities A Barrons piece on analyst Susan Kalla the Dr Doom of telecommunications warns investors away from the industry because of too much capacity and collapsing prices And then theres any number of financialpage feature articles in newspapers running the gamut from the Sunday New York Times to USA Today with headlines borrowed from the obituary section The telecom overinvestment thesis implies that the capital markets badly misjudged the size of the opportunity and supplied crazed technologists were being charitable with too much money The underlying premise is that growth in demand for telecom services which is driven by the growth in network data traffic will be much smaller than the companies their financiers and their investors had originally anticipated Kalla for example expects annual growth in data traffic of to over the next few years industry bullsus decidedly among themsee traffic doubling every three to four months The bears projections are based on historic growth ratesthe preInternet preoptical world But the pace of technological change has been staggering both costs and prices are dropping precipitously and extrapolations based on previouslyexperienced patterns of demand will prove well off the mark As more and more enterprises adopt Internetbased technologies that significantly lower the cost of moving data the growth in network trafficand the demand for supporting serviceswill as Epoch Partners puts it spur previously undetectable demand and unleash massive amounts of data On Wall Street though the pessimists are winning Spurred on by the wellpublicized failures of Northpoint and Winstar two widelyfollowedand hugely leveragednewera telecom providers investors have fled the whole new telecom sector Prices stocks and bonds alike are stuck in distressed territory Consider that an opportunity Because at crunch times like now market dynamics cause the good to be lumped indiscriminately with the bad and the ugly When bond and stock mutual funds are hit with panicmode

New New Chip Despite fortyplus years of posttransistor history new semiconductors and new applications for quantum technologies are often greeted with deep skepticism by engineers and companies rooted in more traditional materials and devices There were gallium arsenide skeptics in the s toothe material seemed exotic difficult and daring and it was But today GaAs is ubiquitous In the early stages every new semiconductor always seems too difficult to work with impossible to grow into defectfree crystals just not worth all the trouble Then its not quite impossible but too expensive And then it

capital was chasing too few investment opportunities supply and demandEconomics remember The Feds actions allowed us to descend in reasonably orderly fashion it didnt happen in days giving markets

Second Coming Poll QuestionBreak Up Microsoft Readings Conference Calendar IN THE GTR MAY The Great Divide Today Wall Street is telling the world that all information technology companies are essentially the same They may produce Internet infrastructure terabit routers Ethernet hubs or SONET telcostandard optoelectronic switches They may manufacture cell phones or personal computers or net appliances But whatever they do they sell technology and they all face a recession a collapse of orders and a capital dearth This conventional wisdom is as wrong today as the similar view in the mids that all the companies in the semiconductor and computer industries were the same that it didnt matter whether you invested in Intel or Monolithic Memories in Applied Materials or Applied Microsystems in Microsoft or Digital Equipment A profound recession and a stock market crash were said to be pushing the entire industry massively to capital rich Japan and other Asian countries To many observers the most glamorous remaining US projects were supercomputer ventures such as Cray Computer Control Data or Thinking Machines Corporation that were multiplying computepower in a single box to billion operations per second and above What in fact was going on in was the opening of a Great Divide in the computer industry On one side were the companies achieving billions of operations per second in a single computer on the other side were companies enabling production of hundreds of millions of computers The companies such as Control Data Cray and even IBM that focused on performing billions of operations per second in a single costly box lost to the companies that focused on enabling millions of people to use computers Intel Microsoft and Dell Today a similar Great Divide is opening up in networks It also revolves around the key abundances and scarcities of an industry This Great Divide separates the companies performing the mostly empty stunt of multiplying the number of inaccessible bits per second on a backbone fiber from the companies multiplying the number of customers who can access the network It separates the companies focused on big costly bandwidth from the companies

prophet Arthur Laffer charts smooth sailing ahead Too often economists defer judgment on issues like the stock market because the depth and breadth of the uncertainties are enormous Unfortunately when economists do step aside they not only avoid making mistakes but they also deprive others of their insights Economists do have a lot about which to be modest but they also have a great deal to add

costs and releasing Like a giant river reaching a falls the key resource releases a surge of kinetic energy into the economy as the price drops From horsepower to kilowatt hours the countries companies and individuals that exploit the evercheaper resource gain market share against all others and end up casting the character of the age Over the last forty years the key resource has been transistors and bits of memory The new era however will ride a new factor of production over a new paradigm cliff the price of communications bandwidth falling between two and ten times as fast as the fall in the price of transistors The plummeting price of a key resource creates what my friend Andy Kessler calls a lowpressure area in the economy Lowpressure systems pull in weather from

spread of the Internet and its transformation through the power of fiber optics The Internet lowers the cost of transactions of price information and of search and facilitates the setting of prices The Internet saves the key scarcity of the new economy of abundancetime Extending markets and proliferating new products it lowers the cost of capitalism and raises the comparative price of socialist policy The lowpressure economy drives prices down most dramatically in the highest growth sectors such as technologyand these low prices reverberate throughout the economy Pondering the numbers many economists will continue to warn against inflation and call for tighter money as they did throughout much of the Great Depression They will oppose tax rate reductions in order to pay back debt or balance the budget as Americans did in the s and the Japanese did during the s If the current administration and Federal Reserve follow those welltrodden paths of failure they will delay the tidal wave of new growth But they cannot stop it The world economy is increasingly unified and if the US gives up leadership other countries will move into the lowpressure breach Bad policy can drive American venture capital overseas just as bad policy in Japan and Europe shifted capital to the US over the last two decades But the Telecosm will still prevail and investors who understand its dimensions will be able to spurn the catastrophists and prosper from the largest opportunity in the history of the world economy George Gilder Excerpted from The Coming Boom in The American Spectator

amplifiersall have been portentously declared disruptive at one time or another And then heads turn Wallets open Its the flavor of the month Then again the true disrupters may already have surfacedand

down and you dont want to be anywhere near the neighborhood Telecom Debt Debacle Could Lead To Losses Of Historic Proportions shouted page C of the May Wall Street Journal capping a wild month of Can You Top This financial headlines The Journal story followed close on the heels of Telecom Meltdown an April Business Week Special Report a pair of Barrons pieces featuring or highlighting Susan Kalla the Dr Doom Of Telecommunications and a widely read TheStreetcom interview with former Lehman Brothers bond analyst Ravi Suria who boldly predicted that of the New Economy telcos will have to restructure Kalla and Suria not surprisingly recommend that investors steer well clear of both the stocks and the bonds of telecommunications companies The Journal says that the telecom shakeout is shaping up to be one of the biggest financial fiascoes ever citing billion in debt financing over the past few years Barrons counts billion in such financing over the past three years and Business Week billion suggests ominously that the end of the dark days of telecomare still a long way off If those big numbers arent scary enough the Journal is there to remind us that in the past six months about ten telecom providers have filed for bankruptcy The implication is that dozens more are set up to follow in their footsteps If you want to hear their names repeated over and over again in that context just turn on the television Take a few spectacular corporate flameouts add a relentless flow of reportorial negativity throw in some fireandbrimstone preachinessfrom Wall Street of all

most bitmoving thinkandsee applications just fine Indeed too much power becomes a problem when the objective is to send a beam through the very narrow core of a strand of glass or down to the micronsized pits on a compact disk But our economy moves atoms too and atoms are a lot heavier than bits If its powerful enough highly ordered light lets us move atomsstuffa million times better than the old tools of the thermal and mechanical world It permits ultrafine heating soldering drilling cutting and materials processing with fantastic improvements in speed precision and efficiency Nothing can move atoms more finely than photons can Highly ordered light has already transformed the thinksee telecommunications legacy of Alexander Graham Bell The industrial legacies of Thomas Edison George

WATCHOpportunity Knocks It took Microsofts antitrust trial to convince Silicon Valley that Washington DC had not already lapsed into the irrelevance it may well someday achieve Thats clearly not the case at Enron where CEO Ken Lay a former official of the old Federal Power Commission its worth noting isnt given to underestimating either the sharpness of political teeth or more importantly the potential gold mines in deregulation Lay was the Bush campaigns largest single contributor which undoubtedly had nothing whatsoever to do with the halfhour chat he got with Dick Cheney just as the Vice President was putting together the White Houses new energy initiative Top of Lays agenda creation of an open national electricity grid where a marketsbased innovator like Enron can skate rings around entrenched local and regional utilities No prizes for guessing whats front and center in the Bush administrations energy plans But all that said ENEs rollercoaster performance over the past six months shows the kinds of curve balls that regulation or in this case the mere threat of it from California can throw And the energy circus for that matter is a walk in the park compared with the
