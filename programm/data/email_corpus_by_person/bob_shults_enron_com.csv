this as Mark is the EnronOnline expert Forwarded by Bob ShultsHOUECT on PM From Mark Taylor on PM To Bob CT cc Andy nron Subject Re Hedge Fund and CTA list Bob Our issues with hedge funds are somewhat complicated The threshold issue is that they are severely limited by their fundamental documents the prospectus will spell out what they can invest in so we have to review those documents before trading That is more than we do for runofthemill domestic corporates and takes a lot of legal resources that so far have been spent elsewhere The other issue is more difficult because it is hard to peg down and relates to regulatory uncertainty About a year ago a major hedge fund Long Term Capital got into serious trouble and the regulators stepped in orchestrating a bailout There was much wringing of hands and gnashing of teeth in Washington afterwards and since then there have been a variety of messages coming out of Washington relating to derivatives trading with hedge funds none of them good Our view is that the regulators will be paying much closer attention to hedge fund trading of derivatives than in the past and we dont want that spotlight shining on us In case youre interested notwithstanding their name hedge funds are speculators Much of the federal regulation of derivatives has assumed that hedging as opposed to speculation was safer and therefore more palatable The failure of a large hedge fund might result in damaging ripple effects throughout the financial markets Hence the regulators heightened scrutiny For both of these reasons when EnronOnline was launched it was with the internally stated policy that we would not give access to hedge funds or individuals for similar reasons Commodity Trading Advisors can not trade on EnronOnline on behalf of their customers just as Brokers cannot Mark Bob Shults AM To Andy nron Mark CT cc Subject Hedge Fund and CTA list Andy as we discussed Harry will begin contacting the Hedge Funds Caroline Abramo is starting to push the CTAs for LME metals and hedge funds metals energy etc through the credit hurdles and legal Mark you have visited this one before any comments Forwarded by Bob ShultsHOUECT on AM From Harry Bucalo AM To Bob CT Daniel CT cc Subject Hedge Fund and CTA list Forwarded by Harry BucaloHOUECT on AM Cai GUSA AM To Harry CT Craig CT cc Daniel CT Per CT TJ GUSA Paul NRON William S CT Trena nron Vikas nron Fred CT Caroline nron Subject Harry Further to our conversation last week I have listed below in two segments the top CTAs who presently manage more than mill each and the top Hedge Funds based upon their likelihood to manage assets in diversified markets that may include tangible commodities My understanding of EOL is that it presently caters primarily to this latter group and offers only tangible commodity trading instruments As I explained the principle difference between a Hedge Fund and a CTA Commodity Trading Advisor is the manner in which they control the assets that they are contracted to manage In the case of a CTA the money can not be held by the CTA itself The underlying investor will open a clearing account with a respective Clearing House the assets will remain in this account and the CTA will trade based on the full monetary value of that account in many cases an investor may well fund this account with Notional Funding NF are abstract funds not actually deposited at the Clearing House but acknowledged as being available should variation or original margin be required The CTA has no control over these funds All monetary transactions must be executed by the Clearing House and must be authorized by the investor The CTA does have the ability to execute trades at an other trading house such as Enron through a contractual document called an International Uniform GiveUp Agreement We have quite a few hundred of these agreements in NY Essentially all parties involved in the execution of a trade the CTA the Investor the Executing Broker and the Clearing House agree to allow the CTA to trade wherever heshe wishes and GiveUp that trade to the Investors Clearing House Since every regulated trade must ultimately clear the respective exchange for a CTA to trade OTC and Swap agreements would require prior notification to an investor that hisher money may be required as collateral against such a trade and would be required to be deposited at Enron A Hedge Fund has greater flexibility to trade such instruments since in the majority of instances a Hedge Fund does exert control over the funds it manages A Hedge Fund typically structures its investment vehicles as OffShore limited partnership funds As such the Hedge fund has direct control over the underlying assets and can move those assets to wherever they may be required if investing via Enron OnLine it would move the assets to Enron for example This first list below is comprised of the top flight CTAs The following list is of Hedge Funds that I believe are trading Commodities and other nonsecurity investments It is by no means complete I would be happy to make any introductions that I can to any of the above names Some we know well others we may have to network ourselves into

this as Mark is the EnronOnline expert Forwarded by Bob ShultsHOUECT on PM From Mark Taylor on PM To Bob CT cc Andy nron Subject Re Hedge Fund and CTA list Bob Our issues with hedge funds are somewhat complicated The threshold issue is that they are severely limited by their fundamental documents the prospectus will spell out what they can invest in so we have to review those documents before trading That is more than we do for runofthemill domestic corporates and takes a lot of legal resources that so far have been spent elsewhere The other issue is more difficult because it is hard to peg down and relates to regulatory uncertainty About a year ago a major hedge fund Long Term Capital got into serious trouble and the regulators stepped in orchestrating a bailout There was much wringing of hands and gnashing of teeth in Washington afterwards and since then there have been a variety of messages coming out of Washington relating to derivatives trading with hedge funds none of them good Our view is that the regulators will be paying much closer attention to hedge fund trading of derivatives than in the past and we dont want that spotlight shining on us In case youre interested notwithstanding their name hedge funds are speculators Much of the federal regulation of derivatives has assumed that hedging as opposed to speculation was safer and therefore more palatable The failure of a large hedge fund might result in damaging ripple effects throughout the financial markets Hence the regulators heightened scrutiny For both of these reasons when EnronOnline was launched it was with the internally stated policy that we would not give access to hedge funds or individuals for similar reasons Commodity Trading Advisors can not trade on EnronOnline on behalf of their customers just as Brokers cannot Mark Bob Shults AM To Andy nron Mark CT cc Subject Hedge Fund and CTA list Andy as we discussed Harry will begin contacting the Hedge Funds Caroline Abramo is starting to push the CTAs for LME metals and hedge funds metals energy etc through the credit hurdles and legal Mark you have visited this one before any comments Forwarded by Bob ShultsHOUECT on AM From Harry Bucalo AM To Bob CT Daniel CT cc Subject Hedge Fund and CTA list Forwarded by Harry BucaloHOUECT on AM Cai GUSA AM To Harry CT Craig CT cc Daniel CT Per CT TJ GUSA Paul NRON William S CT Trena nron Vikas nron Fred CT Caroline nron Subject Harry Further to our conversation last week I have listed below in two segments the top CTAs who presently manage more than mill each and the top Hedge Funds based upon their likelihood to manage assets in diversified markets that may include tangible commodities My understanding of EOL is that it presently caters primarily to this latter group and offers only tangible commodity trading instruments As I explained the principle difference between a Hedge Fund and a CTA Commodity Trading Advisor is the manner in which they control the assets that they are contracted to manage In the case of a CTA the money can not be held by the CTA itself The underlying investor will open a clearing account with a respective Clearing House the assets will remain in this account and the CTA will trade based on the full monetary value of that account in many cases an investor may well fund this account with Notional Funding NF are abstract funds not actually deposited at the Clearing House but acknowledged as being available should variation or original margin be required The CTA has no control over these funds All monetary transactions must be executed by the Clearing House and must be authorized by the investor The CTA does have the ability to execute trades at an other trading house such as Enron through a contractual document called an International Uniform GiveUp Agreement We have quite a few hundred of these agreements in NY Essentially all parties involved in the execution of a trade the CTA the Investor the Executing Broker and the Clearing House agree to allow the CTA to trade wherever heshe wishes and GiveUp that trade to the Investors Clearing House Since every regulated trade must ultimately clear the respective exchange for a CTA to trade OTC and Swap agreements would require prior notification to an investor that hisher money may be required as collateral against such a trade and would be required to be deposited at Enron A Hedge Fund has greater flexibility to trade such instruments since in the majority of instances a Hedge Fund does exert control over the funds it manages A Hedge Fund typically structures its investment vehicles as OffShore limited partnership funds As such the Hedge fund has direct control over the underlying assets and can move those assets to wherever they may be required if investing via Enron OnLine it would move the assets to Enron for example This first list below is comprised of the top flight CTAs The following list is of Hedge Funds that I believe are trading Commodities and other nonsecurity investments It is by no means complete I would be happy to make any introductions that I can to any of the above names Some we know well others we may have to network ourselves into
