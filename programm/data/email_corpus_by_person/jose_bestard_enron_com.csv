maybe we can have an extended meting Tuesday to get everyone up to speed At the NERC meeting today the Independent Board of Trustees asserted their independence by agreeing to the inputs of the

standards and practices They know that NERC has to compe te for a role in a future model for the industry and would like to organ ization to have a future On a parallel track we hear that there is lots of interest in reliability legislation We need to keep track of what is happening there From EPSA I heard that EEI has had members discussions about what to suppor t in the future The EEI

stakeholders c ommittee That was very positive The agenda order was changed to allow ample time to discuss the issues Time and time again it was stated that NERC was running out of time to m ake the required transition If not alternatives would be pursued example EISB Time and time it was stated that the Goulding task force Recommendations should be taken as a package as a necessary first step These include Committee Representation The Task Force recommends that the NERC Board direct the standing committees to modify the standing committees represent ation and voting to reflect the Task Forces attached Initial Sectors and Criteria Model This Model is based on the Task Forces preference for rep resentation by sector and incorporates the Task Forces general recognit ion that an RTO sector should be included The Task Force recognizes that s ome work remains to be done to refine the definitions of each sector and th e criteria for belonging but believes that the Initial Sectors and Criteri a Model is an appropriate next step and should be taken immediately Assumi ng that it may take some months to put in place the details of the new Mode l including the new weighted voting procedures the Task Force recommends that two ISORTO representatives be added immediately to each of the existi ng standing committees to provide formal representation and a voting role f or ISOsRTOs until the Initial Sectors and Criteria Model has been implemen ted Committee Participation and Voting The Task Force recommends open part icipation in each sector subject to certain criteria and qualifications T he Task Force has evaluated the qualification criteria and voting procedure s used in several Regions ERCOT and MAAC and has incorporated features o f those procedures into the recommended participation and voting procedures Specifically the Task Force recommends weighted voting by and within eac h sector similar to what is done in MAAC Due Process The new Organization Standards Process which will be pres ented to the Board in October addresses most due process issues and concer ns The Task Force recommends implementing this new process immediately OneStop Shop The Task Force favors having a single organization for d eveloping Reliability Standards Market Interface Practices and Commercial Practices The Task Force believes that NERC has an opportunity to reinven t itself to become this organization and should take definitive steps in t hat direction at its October Board and Stakeholders Committee meetings Funding The Task Force recommends that steps be taken immediately to d ecouple the funding of NERC from the Regional Reliability Councils The Fun ding Task Group recommendations adopted by the Board in February sho uld be pursued MIC Role in Standards Approval The Task Force recommends as an immedi ate step to address concerns with the current NERC Standards Approval Proce ss and to provide a bridge until the new Organization Standards process is implemented requiring the MIC to vote on all newproposed NERC Operatin g Policies and Planning Standards and report results to the Board includin g consideration of any minority positions Lots of

some bullet points of what transpired at the NERC meeting in Vanco uver this Monday The customers met for almost hours before the start of the SHC meeting Reps from Enron Mirant Dynegy DENA APPA and ELCON were present All agreed that a unified voice is needed to show strong direction from the customer side This may mean putting aside some internal positions Cust omers need to show support of the Goulding Task Force recommendations which offers a package deal to move NERC forward as a single standards setting o rganization for both reliability and commercial issues The Goulding Task F orce recommendations do fall short of asking for NERC action Agenda Item Scope of NERC over Commercial Issues To ensure unity in appearance customers agreed to maintain discussions in front of the Independents at a higher policy level Many details are need ed to get individual entities on board however such details should not i mpede on the ability for customers to show strong support on principles i eonestopshop balance of membership etc Therefore all agreed to kee p details out of the discussion iefunding seats charter etc The actual SHC discussion was constructive and persons articulated the nee d for a package deal to the room The debate brough the expected concerns o f the transmission providers to the surface TVA Terry Boston was most v ocal about keeping NERC out of the commercial side Dominion Resources G lenn Ross supported the customers position PJM Phil Harris was also su pportive Agenda Item Independence of Security Coordinators Comments made that this is a long standing stalemate at NERC and that NERC does not have the authourity to require corporate independence Suggestions made to perform better and more audits Dave Penn brought up the memo fro m Roy Thilly Need to ask the Board to bring this issue to FERC for resolu tion Good arguments made by customers on need for independence in a new c ompetitive market structure FRCC Wiley made arguments that the NERC sho uld not revamp policies to police the few bad apples Should deal directly and specifically with the problem A straw poll was taken of the persons in the room over recommending actions NERC should require corporate indepdence and ask FERC to address it NERC should focus in on the problem Security Coordinators and take speci fic actions to safeguard independent judgement audits The vote was There were strong comments that this vote was not inte nded to be an industry representative vote only to show how split the indu stry is over this issue The meeting adjourned for lunch and the Independents left after the meeting reconvened The SHC agreed to ask the BOT the following Establish a goalvision to become the one stop shop for development of wholesale electric industry standards Add words that we need to go forward from where we are Take immediate action to adopt the initial recommendations contained in new Board agenda item Actively solicit cooperation

rest of the ESC group so I cannot gage the effect of your proposed email to him This is what I know The BOT wanted some immediate action the NERC staff was under pressure criticism at the meeting The inclusion of the ESC mention was an attempt to latchon to some positive development NERC wanted to be linked with it and not be left out where this effort may be redirected to EISB for continuation Some stakeholders smelled a rat and wanted to link NERCs link to this effort to a new committee voting structure therefore items and were modified to reflect these comments and this is how the resolution came out below see below The next step will be at FERC to decide how the OASIS work is to continue and under whose leadership It may not be under the existing ESC group or a reformulation of it Next week Tuesday I would like to review all the interconnected issues so that we provide guidance to ESPA Jose Resolution on the Role of NERC in Developing Market Interface or Commercial Practice Standards Board Agenda Item WHEREAS Reliability standards developed by NERC relying on the expertise of industry experts have been the basis for the reliable operation of the bulk electric systems in North America for over years and WHEREAS With the opening of the transmission systems the vertical disaggregating of the former monopoly utilities and the introduction of marketers and independent power producers NERC has moved proactively to make its standards process more fair open balanced and inclusive and WHEREAS To support the evolution of competitive electricity markets the formation of large RTOs and continued reliability and security of interconnected transmission grids it is vitally important to standardize and make mandatory both reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards and WHEREAS NERC has taken a number of proactive steps to deal with the linkages between reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards including spearheading the OASIS What and How working groups that developed the Standards and Communications Protocols followed by all transmission providers formed a Market Interface Committee as a new standing committee of NERC to address the impact of reliability standards on markets and the impact of market practices on reliability and initiated the formation of and facilitates the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative ESC which recently filed with FERC a report on their efforts to develop common business practice standards for electronic scheduling OASIS Phase and WHEREAS the electric business practice standards being developed by the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative ESC are a complement to the new NERC Reliability Model on which NERCs future Organization Standards will be based and WHEREAS NERC is recognized and respected as the industrys developer of standards for the reliable planning and operation of interconnected transmission grids throughout North America and WHEREAS the Board of Trustees recognizes the urgent need for uniform wholesale electric business practice standards that are well coordinated with reliability standards and WHEREAS the NERC Stakeholders Committee has expressed a strong preference for a single organization to develop both reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED that NERC Take all necessary steps to become the single organization in North America to develop both reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards through a fair open balanced and inclusive process and to file such standards with FERC and appropriate government agencies in Canada Actively solicit cooperation collaboration and support from Canadian and US government entities to establish NERC as the single organization in North America for the development of reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards Take immediate action to adopt and implement the six Initial Recommendations of the Standing Committee Representation Task Force contained in Board Agenda Item Facilitate jointly with interested trade associations federal state and provincial regulators and other stakeholder organizations an open and inclusive process to achieve consensus on the definitions and attributes of the functions necessary for the development of wholesale electric industry standards and practices and on a course of action to institute such capabilities Interface with state and provincial regulators to address retail operational issues that may affect wholesale electric operations Build on the results of activities to date regarding the new Reliability Model and new Organization Standards Development Process Recommend that FERC use the ESC report which has already been submitted to FERC as the basis for a notice of proposed rulemaking on electric business practice standards Urge FERC to make use of the ESC which will use the new sector weighted voting model approved by the NERC Board for further development of wholesale electric business practice standards including standards necessary for certain aspects of RTO design such as congestion management and ancillary services Commit to continuing to support the work of the ESC until such time as an industry consensus is achieved on how to develop wholesale electric business practice standards within the NERC framework From Andy nronXgate on PM To Charles nronXgate Jose BestardENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Darla nronXgate Richard nronXgate cc Subject RE BOT Support for the ESC and Sector Voting Charles Jose Jim and Rick I would like to send the letter below out to the ESC Before I do so do you have any objections I would like to put some fire under this issue as the new sector weighted voting model seems to be yet another way to preserve the power of the traditional utility However I dont know if we will compromise any of our other positions by stirring this particular pot Thoughts Andy Gordon When did the ESC vote to adopt the new sector weighted voting model Has the ESC been absorbed into NERC and is the NERC Board ordering them to use this new model If so is the ESC a new standing committee Do they report directly to the board Just where would the ESC fit in NERC Unless the ESC votes to change their charter to say they are a group under NERCs control I dont see how this can move forward as written The ESC has never been a NERC group but instead a industry collaborative which NERC has assisted with administrative matters facilitation meeting schedules etc If I recall correctly there was a significant number of people that specifically did not want the ESC to be a NERC group APPA ELCON EPSA and a few others if I remember correctly This was why the NERC ESTF became the nonNERC ESC I expect several entities will have comments to make before just handing the keys to NERC Of course those comments may have already been made at the Board and may have been addressed there But I seriously dont think NERC can just annex the ESC without the ESC voting to be annexed Other members of the ESC do you share this concern Andy Rodriquez Regulatory Affairs Enron Corp

the stakeholders c ommittee That was very positive The agenda order was changed to allow ample time to discuss the issues Time and time again it was stated that NERC was running out of time to m ake the required transition If not alternatives would be pursued example EISB Time and time it was stated that the Goulding task force Recommendations should be taken as a package as a necessary first step These include Committee Representation The Task Force recommends that the NERC Board direct the standing committees to modify the standing committees represent ation and voting to reflect the Task Forces attached Initial Sectors and Criteria Model This Model is based on the Task Forces preference for rep resentation by sector and incorporates the Task Forces general recognit ion that an RTO sector should be included The Task Force recognizes that s ome work remains to be done to refine the definitions of each sector and th e criteria for belonging but believes that the Initial Sectors and Criteri a Model is an appropriate next step and should be taken immediately Assumi ng that it may take some months to put in place the details of the new Mode l including the new weighted voting procedures the Task Force recommends that two ISORTO representatives be added immediately to each of the existi ng standing committees to provide formal representation and a voting role f or ISOsRTOs until the Initial Sectors and Criteria Model has been implemen ted Committee Participation and Voting The Task Force recommends open part icipation in each sector subject to certain criteria and qualifications T he Task Force has evaluated the qualification criteria and voting procedure s used in several Regions ERCOT and MAAC and has incorporated features o f those procedures into the recommended participation and voting procedures Specifically the Task Force recommends weighted voting by and within eac h sector similar to what is done in MAAC Due Process The new Organization Standards Process which will be pres ented to the Board in October addresses most due process issues and concer ns The Task Force recommends implementing this new process immediately OneStop Shop The Task Force favors having a single organization for d eveloping Reliability Standards Market Interface Practices and Commercial Practices The Task Force believes that NERC has an opportunity to reinven t itself to become this organization and should take definitive steps in t hat direction at its October Board and Stakeholders Committee meetings Funding The Task Force recommends that steps be taken immediately to d ecouple the funding of NERC from the Regional Reliability Councils The Fun ding Task Group recommendations adopted by the Board in February sho uld be pursued MIC Role in Standards Approval The Task Force recommends as an immedi ate step to address concerns with the current NERC Standards Approval Proce ss and to provide a bridge until the new Organization Standards process is implemented requiring the MIC to vote on all newproposed NERC Operatin g Policies and Planning Standards and report results to the Board includin g consideration of any minority positions Lots of

some bullet points of what transpired at the NERC meeting in Vanco uver this Monday The customers met for almost hours before the start of the SHC meeting Reps from Enron Mirant Dynegy DENA APPA and ELCON were present All agreed that a unified voice is needed to show strong direction from the customer side This may mean putting aside some internal positions Cust omers need to show support of the Goulding Task Force recommendations which offers a package deal to move NERC forward as a single standards setting o rganization for both reliability and commercial issues The Goulding Task F orce recommendations do fall short of asking for NERC action Agenda Item Scope of NERC over Commercial Issues To ensure unity in appearance customers agreed to maintain discussions in front of the Independents at a higher policy level Many details are need ed to get individual entities on board however such details should not i mpede on the ability for customers to show strong support on principles i eonestopshop balance of membership etc Therefore all agreed to kee p details out of the discussion iefunding seats charter etc The actual SHC discussion was constructive and persons articulated the nee d for a package deal to the room The debate brough the expected concerns o f the transmission providers to the surface TVA Terry Boston was most v ocal about keeping NERC out of the commercial side Dominion Resources G lenn Ross supported the customers position PJM Phil Harris was also su pportive Agenda Item Independence of Security Coordinators Comments made that this is a long standing stalemate at NERC and that NERC does not have the authourity to require corporate independence Suggestions made to perform better and more audits Dave Penn brought up the memo fro m Roy Thilly Need to ask the Board to bring this issue to FERC for resolu tion Good arguments made by customers on need for independence in a new c ompetitive market structure FRCC Wiley made arguments that the NERC sho uld not revamp policies to police the few bad apples Should deal directly and specifically with the problem A straw poll was taken of the persons in the room over recommending actions NERC should require corporate indepdence and ask FERC to address it NERC should focus in on the problem Security Coordinators and take speci fic actions to safeguard independent judgement audits The vote was There were strong comments that this vote was not inte nded to be an industry representative vote only to show how split the indu stry is over this issue The meeting adjourned for lunch and the Independents left after the meeting reconvened The SHC agreed to ask the BOT the following Establish a goalvision to become the one stop shop for development of wholesale electric industry

rest of the ESC group so I cannot gage the effect of your proposed email to him This is what I know The BOT wanted some immediate action the NERC staff was under pressure criticism at the meeting The inclusion of the ESC mention was an attempt to latchon to some positive development NERC wanted to be linked with it and not be left out where this effort may be redirected to EISB for continuation Some stakeholders smelled a rat and wanted to link NERCs link to this effort to a new committee voting structure therefore items and were modified to reflect these comments and this is how the resolution came out below see below The next step will be at FERC to decide how the OASIS work is to continue and under whose leadership It may not be under the existing ESC group or a reformulation of it Next week Tuesday I would like to review all the interconnected issues so that we provide guidance to ESPA Jose Resolution on the Role of NERC in Developing Market Interface or Commercial Practice Standards Board Agenda Item WHEREAS Reliability standards developed by NERC relying on the expertise of industry experts have been the basis for the reliable operation of the bulk electric systems in North America for over years and WHEREAS With the opening of the transmission systems the vertical disaggregating of the former monopoly utilities and the introduction of marketers and independent power producers NERC has moved proactively to make its standards process more fair open balanced and inclusive and WHEREAS To support the evolution of competitive electricity markets the formation of large RTOs and continued reliability and security of interconnected transmission grids it is vitally important to standardize and make mandatory both reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards and WHEREAS NERC has taken a number of proactive steps to deal with the linkages between reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards including spearheading the OASIS What and How working groups that developed the Standards and Communications Protocols followed by all transmission providers formed a Market Interface Committee as a new standing committee of NERC to address the impact of reliability standards on markets and the impact of market practices on reliability and initiated the formation of and facilitates the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative ESC which recently filed with FERC a report on their efforts to develop common business practice standards for electronic scheduling OASIS Phase and WHEREAS the electric business practice standards being developed by the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative ESC are a complement to the new NERC Reliability Model on which NERCs future Organization Standards will be based and WHEREAS NERC is recognized and respected as the industrys developer of standards for the reliable planning and operation of interconnected transmission grids throughout North America and WHEREAS the Board of Trustees recognizes the urgent need for uniform wholesale electric business practice standards that are well coordinated with reliability standards and WHEREAS the NERC Stakeholders Committee has expressed a strong preference for a single organization to develop both reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED that NERC Take

electric operations Build on the results of activities to date regarding the new Reliability Model and new Organization Standards Development Process Recommend that FERC use the ESC report which has already been submitted to FERC as the basis for a notice of proposed rulemaking on electric business practice standards Urge FERC to make use of the ESC which will use the new sector weighted voting model approved by the NERC Board for further development of wholesale electric business practice standards including standards necessary for certain aspects of RTO design such as congestion management and ancillary services Commit to continuing to support the work of the ESC until such time as an industry consensus is achieved on how to develop wholesale electric business practice standards within the NERC framework From Andy nronXgate on PM To Charles nronXgate Jose BestardENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Darla nronXgate Richard nronXgate cc Subject RE BOT Support for the ESC and Sector Voting Charles Jose Jim and Rick I would like to send the letter below out to the ESC Before I do so do you have any objections I would like to put some fire under this issue as the new sector weighted voting model seems to be yet another way to preserve the power of the traditional utility However I dont know if we will compromise any of our other positions by stirring this particular pot Thoughts Andy Gordon When did the ESC vote to adopt the new sector weighted voting model Has the ESC been absorbed into NERC and is the NERC Board ordering them to use this new model If so is the ESC a new standing committee Do they report directly to the board Just where would the ESC fit in NERC Unless the ESC votes to change their charter to say they are a group under NERCs control I dont see how this can move forward as written The ESC has never been a NERC group but instead a industry collaborative which NERC has assisted with administrative matters facilitation meeting schedules etc If I recall correctly there was a significant number of people that specifically did not want the ESC to be a NERC group APPA ELCON EPSA and a few others if I remember correctly This was why the NERC ESTF became the nonNERC ESC I expect several entities will have comments to make before just handing the keys to NERC Of course those comments may have already been made at the Board and may have been addressed there But I seriously dont think NERC can just annex the ESC without the ESC voting to be annexed Other members of the ESC do you share this concern Andy Rodriquez Regulatory Affairs Enron Corp
