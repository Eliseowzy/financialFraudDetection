end of the year Allegations Said Unsubstantiated There isnt a shred of evidence to support allegations said Severing Borenstein director of the University of California Berkleys Energy Institute There are no antitrust laws that state you cant charge a premium price for power Borenstein said Manipulation is a bad word Thats used in the commodities market to find a loophole and take advantage of the rules I would say this is exercising market power If you want to charge high prices you can These are guys who play against each other every day There is no sort of collusion that would interest the justice department The reason for the inquiry ordered By Gov Gray Davis he said is as a consequence of San Diego consumers being the first in the nation to pay marketbased rates for electricity The high wholesale costs paid by utility San Diego Gas Electric a unit of Sempra Energy SRE were passed on to ratepayers and resulted in utility bills more than doubling Gov Davis ordered the inquiry and asked federal regulators to conduct their own investigation as well Dynegy DYN President Steve Bergstrom also says that an investigation will turn up nothing So why conduct one This is a very politically charged issue Bergstrom said When something goes wrong you have to find someone to point the finger at A source in the governors office said Davis is aware that Attorney General Lockyers investigation may turn up nothing but Gov Davis has a responsibility to his constituents Supply vs Demand What the investigation will turn up is evidence that there is a shortage of power in the state and not enough power plants being built to meet increasing demand said Terry Winter chairman and chief executive officer of the California Independent System Operator Winter said he doesnt believe that there is anything wrong with the way generators sell their power and of the time the market works well Is it market abuse to bid at the price cap per megawatthour knowing that youre MW short I have trouble identifying that as market power abuse Winter said Despite some proposed regulatory changes such as bid caps on wholesale energy prices and a rate freeze for SDGE customers Duke Energy Dynegy Southern Co SO and Reliant RLI all still plan to invest in generation in the state Thats a different stance than the companies took a month ago when the ISO reduced the wholesale price cap in the realtime market to MWh At the end of the day the market is short power and you got to get people to build new generation said Dynegys Bergstrom We got a big investment in California Were not walking away from that By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc GMT August DJ Calif ISO Urges FERC To Reject Pwr Producers Complaint This article was originally published Tuesday WASHINGTON Dow JonesCalifornias power grid administrator Monday urged federal regulators to reject a complaint from power producers seeking compensation in the event outofstate power transactions are curtailed during an extreme power grid emergency The independent system operator told the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that the power producers seek compensation in the event of a situation that never has occurred any time since the ISO began operations and if it were to occur in the future would do so rarely The ISO noted that its tariff governing access to the states grid already allows for compensation in the event of curtailed exports and decried the power producers complaint as a collateral attack on a previous FERC order rejecting claims that the tariff failed to provide adequate compensation Curtailing scheduled power transactions and exports would be a last resort measure taken only after other options have been exhausted the ISO said The power producers should adjust their contracts to factor in the risk of interruption in the event of a statewide grid emergency the ISO said The ISOs objections were echoed by the states electricity distribution utilities and California regulators They complained that the power producers are merely trying to get out from under the price controls the ISO has imposed in an effort to rein in skyrocketing power prices this summer The generators knew when they purchased California power plants and when they entered into their export contracts that the ISO could alter their schedules in an emergency For them to ask the commission to make it even more expensive and hence more difficult for the ISO to maintain grid reliability in California is irresponsible said Southern California Edison a unit of Edison International EIX The complaint is a sham declared the California Public Utilities Commission The true intent of the complaint is to avoid the ISO price caps by making sales to affiliates or cooperating entities located out of state and sell the power back to the ISO at uncapped prices reflecting the generators market power the PUC said calling for FERC to summarily reject the complaint The complaint is factually unsupported legally unfounded complains of conduct consistent with the ISOs authority under pertinent FERC decisions and seeks to avoid the price cap the PUC said But power marketers and other power producers voiced support for the complaint filed Aug by Reliant Power Generation Inc REI Dynegy Power Marketing Inc DYN and Southern Energy California SO By subjecting curtailed energy transactions to its maximum purchase price of and simply ignoring the financial impact on sellers the Cal ISO would be overtly discriminating against export transactions and market participants who schedule energy for export said the Electric Power Supply Association the national trade group representing competitive power producers It is critical that power producers know with certainty that the curtailment of scheduled energy exports by Cal ISO will be compensated said Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc Now that the ISO Governing Board has lowered purchase price caps to it is significantly more likely that the curtailment of exports will occur more frequently Less energy will be imported into California and more energy will leave California in search of higher prices said Williams Energy Marketing Trading Co in support of the complaints call for actual damages and lost opportunity costs At least one power purchaser voiced support for the producers position as well It seems a very basic point that if the Cal ISO must divert the transactions of others to meet its own loads that is should pay the full costs of doing so said the Northern California Power Agency By

Probe Into Power Market This article was originally published Tuesday By Jason Leopold OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow JonesWhen California Attorney General Bill Lockyer completes his investigation into possible collusion in the wholesale electricity market by generators energy companies say he will probably find the same thing Geraldo Rivera found in Al Capones safe nothing Still those companies that own generation in the state say they welcome the probe into the power market by Attorney General Bill Lockyer We have done nothing wrong at all said Tom Williams spokesman for Duke Energy North America DUK Our plants have been running all summer long Prices are high throughout the west We wouldnt invest billion in new generation and then try and rig the market For the past two months utilities lawmakers and other market participants have made allegations that generators are manipulating the market and are largely responsible for the price spikes Lockers office said an investigation is still pending State regulators are also conducting their own investigation the findings of which will be submitted to the governor and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by the end of the year Allegations Said Unsubstantiated There isnt a shred of evidence to support allegations said Severing Borenstein director of the University of California Berkleys Energy Institute There are no antitrust laws that state you cant charge a premium price for power Borenstein said Manipulation is a bad word Thats used in the commodities market to find a loophole and take advantage of the rules I would say this is exercising market power If you want to charge high prices you can These are guys who play against each other every day There is no sort of collusion that would interest the justice department The reason for the inquiry ordered By Gov Gray Davis he said is as a consequence of San Diego consumers being the first in the nation to pay marketbased rates for electricity The high wholesale costs paid by utility San Diego Gas Electric a unit of Sempra Energy SRE were passed on to ratepayers and resulted in utility bills more than doubling Gov Davis ordered the inquiry and asked federal regulators to conduct their own investigation as well Dynegy DYN President Steve Bergstrom also says that an investigation will turn up nothing So why conduct one This is a very politically charged issue Bergstrom said When something goes wrong you have to find someone to point the finger at A source in the governors office said Davis is aware that Attorney General Lockyers investigation may turn up nothing but Gov Davis has a responsibility to his constituents Supply vs Demand What the investigation will turn up is evidence that there is a shortage of power in the state and not enough power plants being built to meet increasing demand said Terry Winter chairman and chief executive officer of the California Independent System Operator Winter said he doesnt believe that there is anything wrong with the way generators sell their power and of the time the market works well Is it market abuse to bid at the price cap per megawatthour knowing that youre MW short I have trouble identifying that as market power abuse Winter said Despite some proposed regulatory changes such as bid caps on wholesale energy prices and a rate freeze for SDGE customers Duke Energy Dynegy Southern Co SO and Reliant RLI all still plan to invest in generation in the state Thats a different stance than the companies took a month ago when the ISO reduced the wholesale price cap in the realtime market to MWh At the end of the day the market is short power and you got to get people to build new generation said Dynegys Bergstrom We got a big investment in California Were not walking away from that By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc GMT August DJ Calif ISO Urges FERC To Reject Pwr Producers Complaint This article was originally published Tuesday WASHINGTON Dow JonesCalifornias power grid administrator Monday urged federal regulators to reject a complaint from power producers seeking compensation in the event outofstate power transactions are curtailed during an extreme power grid emergency The independent system operator told the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that the power producers seek compensation in the event of a situation that never has occurred any time since the ISO began operations and if it were to occur in the future would do so rarely The ISO noted that its tariff governing access to the states grid already allows for compensation in the event of curtailed exports and decried the power producers complaint as a collateral attack on a previous FERC order rejecting claims that the tariff failed to provide adequate compensation Curtailing scheduled power transactions and exports would be a last resort measure taken only after other options have been exhausted the ISO said The power producers should adjust their contracts to factor in the risk of interruption in the event of a statewide grid emergency the ISO said The ISOs objections were echoed by the states electricity distribution utilities and California regulators They complained that the power producers are merely trying to get out from under the price controls the ISO has imposed in an effort to rein in skyrocketing power prices this summer The generators knew when they purchased California power plants and when they entered into their export contracts that the ISO could alter their schedules in an emergency For them to ask the commission to make it even more expensive and hence more difficult for the ISO to maintain grid reliability in California is irresponsible said Southern California Edison a unit of Edison International EIX The complaint is a sham declared the California Public Utilities Commission The true intent of the complaint is to avoid the ISO price caps by making sales to affiliates or cooperating entities located out of state and sell the power back to the ISO at uncapped prices reflecting the generators market power the PUC said calling for FERC to summarily reject the complaint The complaint is factually unsupported legally unfounded complains of conduct consistent with the ISOs authority under pertinent FERC decisions and seeks to avoid the price cap the PUC said But power marketers and other power producers voiced support for the complaint filed Aug by Reliant Power Generation Inc REI Dynegy Power Marketing Inc DYN and Southern Energy California SO By subjecting curtailed energy transactions to its maximum purchase price of and simply ignoring the financial impact on sellers the Cal ISO would be overtly discriminating against export transactions and market participants who schedule energy for export said the Electric Power Supply Association the national trade group representing competitive power producers It is critical that power producers know with certainty that the curtailment of scheduled energy exports by Cal ISO will be compensated said Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc Now that the ISO Governing Board has lowered purchase price caps to it is significantly more likely that the curtailment of exports will occur more frequently Less energy will be imported into California and more energy will leave California in search of higher prices said Williams Energy Marketing Trading Co in support of the complaints call for actual damages and lost opportunity costs At least one power purchaser voiced support for the producers position as well It seems a very basic point that if the Cal ISO must divert the transactions of others to meet its own loads that is should pay the full costs of doing so said the Northern California Power Agency By
