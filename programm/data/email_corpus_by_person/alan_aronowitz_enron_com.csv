on From John NRON on To Darren CT cc Gary CT JanErland CT Sheila CT Susan MuschENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re Enron Japan Trading and Enron Global Markets LLC Trading Darren Pursuant to your questions relating to interest rate and foreign exchange trading in Japan please review the advice below Interest Rates and Foreign Exchange Transactions Transactions with respect to interest rates and foreign exchange other than financial futures transactions are generally not subject to specific regulation in Japan Banks securities companies are permitted to enter into transactions of this type as part of their ancillary business but are not granted an exclusive mandate to conduct these transactions Accordingly it would be possible for Enron Japan Corp to conduct interest rate and foreign exchange transactions with ordinary Japanese corporations as well as financial institutions However in the event that Enron Japan does conduct interest rate or foreign exchange transactions with a corporation that is not a financial institution the risk that the transaction may be considered to be gambling increases The fact that one of the parties to a derivative transaction is authorized by statute to enter into the transaction will constitute a defense to an allegation that the transaction constitutes gambling If neither party to the transaction has the benefit of a specific authorization it will be necessary to rebut an allegation of gambling by arguing that the parties had a legitimate business reason for entering into the transaction Baker McKenzie has stated that this risk is relatively low and are not aware of any cases where such activity has been problematic In addition where the transaction constitutes an OTC financial futures transaction for example a swap where the price is based on an interest rate index quoted on a financial futures exchange in Japan the transaction will be regulated under the Financial Futures Trading Law see below Financial Futures Transactions In summary under the Financial Futures Trading Law if Enron Japan wishes to conduct financial futures brokerage business it must hold a license If Enron Japan does not hold such a license the counterparties with whom it may conduct financial futures transactions will be limited to banks securities companies and members of a Financial Futures Exchange who are licensed as financial futures brokers Financial futures transactions include the following a futures contracts in relation to currencies etc and listed options with respect to currencies etc and b OTC financial futures transactions With regard to the question as to whether the trades that you engage in have to be booked under Enron Japan Corp or whether you can execute for Enron Global Markets LLC this is really a tax question for Susan Musch who I have copied on this email My general understanding is that so as not to develop a permanent establishment for tax purposes which could create tax liabilities for an offshore entity conducting such activities the trades should be booked with Enron Japan Corp This is subject to Susans advice which will provide you further details and perhaps more sophisticated methods to approach this issue Looking forward to seeing you back in Japan Best regards John Darren CT PM To John nron Sheila Glover JanErland nron cc Gary CT Subject Enron Japan Trading

fixed income trades with another counterparty located in Tokyo whether it be another US bank or a Japanese bank Can you please generally confirm this Do the trades that I engage in have to be booked

Today we received IBJs responsive comments to the points that have been raised which are set forth below for your review IBJ has stated In terms of CSA as we are not ready for running collateral operations we still do not prefer to use the CSA During our recent meeting they did not deny that IBJ had entered into CSAs with financial institutions I note that IBJ also raised the point that Enron had a loan from IBJ of roughly US Jonathan Whitehead has raised this issue with John Suttle to receive his input IBJs specific responses are quoted below as follows Part a Agreed not include Affiliates of PartyA g We prefer to terminate the Transactions when as a result of merger as for a party a surviving party of such becomes materially weaker than befor e Part We usually accept to deliver a copy the list of authorized signatures only Part fEven though deleting the word not in this provision we can net the payments with respect to the same Transaction Due to our system incapability we are not able to net the payments with respect to two or mo re Transactions in the same currency h Agreed Part a If your suggested language is included a Nondefaulting Party has to continue to make payment to a Defaulting Party with no payment obligation which does not seem realistic We prefer to terminate Transactions when an Event of Default occurs We do not like to include the provision which releases a technical error c Agreed e We propose business days instead g We do not think the definition of the Affiliate includes a partys branch offices If our branch have a deal with Enron Japan we will amend this Master Agreement to include such branch as Multibranch Office We hea rd that in most jurisdictions of the world it is not effective to setoff th e obligations between a party and the other partys Affiliate i Agreed to include this provision j We do not prefer that a party could transfer its rights and obligation s without the other partys consent to even its Affiliates We might not get approval of the transfer from our Credit Department or such transfer might cause an additional payment of tax or other cost k We will revert to you later m Agreed n Agreed to include this provision Part We still prefer to include the provisions relating to the Commodity Transactions in the respective Confirmations I look forward to receiving your input I note that Jane McBride has start ed here at Enron Japan therefore I have copied her on this correspondence Looking forward to seeing you in Houston soon Best regards John Forwarded by John ViveritoCorpEnron on AM John Viverito AM To Mark CT cc Kevin CT Steve n CT Tom Bruce CT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT Mark Thanks for your input I agree with all of the comments you have raised As to Part n the use of the English language is not uncommon in Japan wit h regard to these types of arrangements and should be insisted upon for transactions under the ISDA documentation I think that it will be useful to better understand Japanese market practic e relating to the use of the Credit Support Annex Therefore I have asked Baker McKenzie to provide a clear picture as to the situation in Japan an d will provide this information upon receipt Following receipt of John Suttles comments I will prepare the response to IBJ based on the points that have been raised by both you and John Thanks John Mark CT PM To John NRON cc Kevin CT Steve n CT Tom Bruce CT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT I had a brief conversation this morning with John Suttle Credit and it looks like hes going to insist on the CSA We are going to talk tomorrow and go through the whole agreement to get the rest of his comments While we have documentation for transactions entered into prior to execution of a master agreement the extent of their revisions makes me very uneasy Many of these points are very serious and if they can not agree we will have trouble coming to agreement even on the short form documents It would be helpful if they could explain the changes rather than just sending us a markup Following are my points responsive to their revisions Part a The addition of our affiliates has the affect of expanding the possible defaults too broadly and we cannot agree to these changes for example this would mean that if any Enron affiliate went into bankruptcy this agreement would be in default g This provision provides additional flexibility without any credit risk to the other party It should remain in place unless IBJ can articulate a reason to remove it Part The language inserted is much to vague Our original version spells out exactly what is expected of the parties If the documents we listed ar e not acceptable IBJ should tell us now what would be acceptable and if we agree we will put it in the agreement Part f By deleting the word not in this provision IBJ is saying tha t payments due to each other with respect to the same transaction will not ne t ie if we are paying fixed and they are paying floating we each have to make the full payment to the other rather than netting the two amounts to o ne payment This is not acceptable h If IBJ will use their NY branch as agent we should use Enron Corp or E NA Part a Our suggested language allows the purchaser of an option to receive payments due even though technically in default under another provision of the agreement Our position is that if there are no other possible payment requirements due from the purchaser the option should be honored c The section we delete requires that the market makers be in the same city For many markets in which we participate it is very difficult if n ot impossible to find multiple market makers in the same city e The change to business days is much too long This means we can no t have certainty as to the terms of the transaction for two weeks We can go as high as three days if necessary but even that is beyond common market practice g Their changes remove the ability to set off against obligations owed t o multiple Enron companies if they default and only allows setoff with each IBJ branch as a separate entity This may not be an issue if we will never trade or otherwise transact with them in any other Enron company and if we will never do business with any other branch of IBJ We usually dont like to restrict ourselves that way i We absolutely insist on the confidentiality of our transactions If there is some revision to this section they would like we can discuss it bu t wholesale deletion is out of the question j As with Part g this section adds flexibility to both parties while maintaining flexibility within the corporate family Given the frequency with which Enron moves businesses around within the family this section is important to us k This section results from an experience we had with a counterparty tha t went into bankruptcy and therefore default while they were in the money We disputed the amount owed and under the terms of the agreement without o ur revision we would have owed them interest at their cost of funds a rathe r high rate given their status as a bankrupt We feel the nondefault rate i s more appropriate m I cant imagine why they wouldnt want this section included it protects us both n You know more about this than I Part These are all important issues for us and we can discuss them individually if they object for some articulated reason If these provisio ns are not included here they will need to be included in each confirmation a significant burden for our back office systems which are not set up for it and we need to know now if they object to any of them Other revisions that they have made are acceptable unless Credit objects I hope this is helpful and sorry to have run on so long Im happy to discus s any of these issues at greater length if you want It sounds to me like IBJs expectations regarding execution of documents are a bit high given th e volume and nature of

NRON JanErland nron Darren nron Subject Re ENA Darren Delage Jane Attached are series of emails regarding how the trades that Darren will be entering into should be structured Gary agreed while I was in New York that because of the Japanese tax concerns we need for Enron Japan eg Darren to enter into the trades as principal and then enter into mirrorish trades with ENA The one issue that Gary raised when we spoke was that he wants the management reporting of the income from those trades to go to his group I told him that my understanding is that that should not be a problem JanErland

structuring Darren I talked with Gary last week and explained that based on the Japanese tax advice that we have received from Baker McKenzieTokyo we cannot follow the same approach that we followed for the financial traders in the London and Sydney offices That is instead of having the trader as an employee of the local office provide services for ENA we need to have backtoback trades between Enron Japan EJ and Enron North America ENA Under this scenario you would be an Enron Japan EJ employee who would enter into the trades for EJ as principal Then EJ would enter into mirror trades with ENA Under this approach we have to figure out what margins should be retained by EJ These backtoback trades would need to be entered into at an arms length rate The amount of margin retained by EJ should be based on what risk it retains and the value it generatescosts it incurs in entering into those trades Do you Jane or JanErland have any thoughts on what margin should be retained by EJ Are there any third party comparables we can use to determine the margin Also Darren how long do you plan to be in the Tokyo office Best regards Susan From Darren NRON on PM ZE To Susan MuschENRON

In his June rd memo he advised Such a profit split would likely be along the lines of the various profit split methods that have been used to allocate profits among branches or local entities of banks and financial institutions that engage in global trading operations As we expect you are aware from experience in other jurisdictions there is no clearly agreed upon set of factors to use in profit splits for global trading operations but typical profit split factors employed have been trader compensation back office compensation a location or value factor and perhaps a risk or capital factor If our sense is correct that a profit split would ultimately be determined to be the appropriate price method this could entail a substantial effort to make the necessary functional analysis to develop the profit split These are initial impressions only and on your request we can evaluate the appropriate pricing method for the Japan financial trader operation in detail Basically under a profit split approach Enron Japan should earn a margin depending on what risks it retains and the costs it occurs with respect to these backtoback trades The amount of the margin is something that well have to develop based on how comparable unrelated trades would be priced Please let me know if you have any questions or need any additional information Best regards Susan Forwarded by Susan MuschENRONDEVELOPMENT on PM EdwinT AKERNETcom on PM To cc Jeremy AKERNETcom PaulTYO akerNetcom Yukinori AKERNETcom Subject Enron JapanBased TraderPE and TP Issues Dear Susan We confirm that we continue to recommend the basic approaches put forward in the June memo either use backtoback transactions if it is essential to have Japanbased personnel trading for ENA or other offshore affiliates or preferable purely from the tax standpoint if acceptable in light of operational considerations have personnel at Enron Australia or other affiliate in an appropriate time zone handle the Japan trading Your description of the backtoback trades as mirror transactions is correct in the sense that the trades would be symmetrical in order to transfer to ENA or other offshore affiliate the position it wants to take in the covered trade The terms might differ depending what decision is made about what mechanism to compensate Enron Japan for transfer pricing purposes ie if some margin were built into the backtoback trades to compensate Enron Japan As discussed in our June memo the transfer pricing issues are potentially difficult in view of the limited authority in this area but in our view such pricing issues would present less exposure than structuring the operation so that it would constitute a PE If you have any questions or if we can provide further assistance with this matter please let us know Best regards Y WatanabeE Whatley Phone Fax Registered in Japan as an Attorney at Foreign Law Jurisdiction of Primary QualificationCalifornia Designated LawWashington DC and

advice from last week attached below I think youre advising consistent with what Ed had advised back in June but Im not totally sure That is it would be best to have backtoback trades between Enron Japan EJ and Enron North America ENA Under this scenario DD would be an EJ employee who would enter into the trades for EJ as principal Then EJ would enter into mirror trades with ENA The issue as I understand it under this scenario is that the NTA could assert transfer pricing issues if the trades between EJ and ENA werent at arms length Would you please confirm that this is your conclusion on how the trades should be structured I am trying to get this structure resolved by Monday night Houston time so I would appreciate your thoughts in an email during your Monday Best regards Susan Jane

amount Jane If you have time in the morning Nov Tokyo I would like to discuss ENAs view of the CSASchedule relationship In a nutshell we provide that a ratings downgrade is an Additional Event of Default in the Schedule normally a MAC in the CSA Johns preferance of course would be a unilateral event triggering an IBJ default which I am sure would be difficult to negotiate I am not certain of the time difference but perhaps you could call me at the office after pm Nov in Houston and I could then conference in John Alternatively please feel free to contact me at home after pm Houston time on Nov at I look forward to hearing from you Regards Sara Jane NRON AM To John CT Alan CT cc John nron Jonathan nron Mark CT Sara CT Subject IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT Credit matrix and Threshold amount Dear John Jonathan and I met with IBJ today to try and push our negotiations through to the end They are still unwilling to do a CSA with us but very significantly their back mid office is currently looking at getting systems support in place which would permit them to do a CSA with us in due course They acknowledged to us of their own volition that the market trend is towards CSAs even in transactions where the counter party is not a bank They did say though that it would be a few months before they would be set up to do so Pls note that they did not agree to do a CSA with us as soon as they are set up to do so but they now know we will come knocking at some stage to ask them to do it so I think we have gone as far as we can on this for now We will therefore move forward on the credit matrix in the meantime if you are still willing to do so The bank has a credit rating of A so I guess this means US million credit limit On the assumption that it is possible to draft these terms into a contract without a full CSA I wonder who is best to do this drafting I should be able to do the negotiations but I am not sure that I am able to do the drafting Alan do you have any suggestions Most of the other issues are sorted now but they still want to change the Threshold Amount definition to US million Is there any flexibility on this Thanks Jane McBride John CT AM To Jonathan NRON cc Jane nron John nron Kevin CT Mark CT Morten E nron Steven CT Tom Bruce CT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT Jonathan One thing we might be able to propose is a Credit Matrix which prescribes a Credit Line under which each counterparty can transact with collateral rights and collateral thresholds tied to the credit rating of each counterparty We have used credit matrixes in several contracts here and they are appealing in that there are no Material Adverse Change MAC clauses This is appealing to the counterparty in that we cannot automatically drop their collateral threshold to zero when a MAC occurs We are comfortable because as the counterpartys credit quality deteriorates the amount of exposure to which we are subject decreases I would propose to IBJ something like the following in lieu of a full CSA Jane and John is it possible to draft these collateralcredit terms into the contract without using a full CSA I think every matrix I have used here has been part of a CSA Rating SP Credit Line AA or above MM BBB to AA MM BBB MM BBB MM BB to BB MM Below BB MM These terms are subject to negotiation Once again the matrix removes MAC clauses and the stress counterparties associate with such but effectively reduces the potential exposure we have or THEY have to a counterparty with diminishing credit quality What do you all think John Jonathan Whitehead ENRON PM To John CT cc Jane nron John nron Kevin CT Mark CT Morten E nron Steven CT Tom Bruce CT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT Sorry Pressed send too early John Have had a conversation with IBJ re the CSA and they have asked us to consider proposing a solution that does not involve a CSA I propose to meet with them again to try and explore why but I would like to be prepared to offer them a solution whereby we dont enter into a CSA and we would limit the types of trades that we could enter into with IBJ My feeling is that we would be unlikely to enter into any long term transactions over years at this stage anyway and would prefer to get the relationship going as I am not sure they are going to budge on this issue yet They appear to be quite willing to discuss all the other points We can always press for a renegotiation at a later stage if we do want to enter into longer term deals I also want to keep the loan facility completely separate What are your thoughts on this and what limitations would you want to put on trades if we do not have a CSA Thanks Jonathan John Viverito PM To John CT cc Jane CT John CT Kevin CT Mark CT Morten E CT Steven CT Tom Bruce CT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT John During our last meeting with IBJ we pushed hard for the implementation of the CSA I believe that they have the systems capability to handle the requisite activities relating to the CSA as we understand that they utilize same with certain financial institution counterparties We expressed our view on these matters and also raised other issues that we had discussed in our recent conference call IBJ informed us that they have never entered into a CSA with a nonfinancial institution counterparty and my response was that Enron can then be the first We requested that they raise this issue with their respective superiors As you know their response to our discussions relating to this issue was In terms of CSA as we are not ready for running collateral operations we still do not prefer to use the CSA The legitimacy of this statement is certainly debatable and the underlying reason may actually be something entirely different including the possibility that they merely do not want to enter into a CSA with a nonfinancial institution We will continue to attempt to persuade IBJ to enter into the CSA with Enron however it is uncertain if this is achievable

Glover AM To Susan MuschENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Darren CT Alan CT Clara CT Subject Re Enron Japan Trading and Enron Global Markets LLC Trading Susan I would appreciate your assistance in determining how the book needs to be organized In what legal entity it needs to be The PL for management purposes will roll up to Financial Trading in Global Markets Thanks Sheila Forwarded by Sheila GloverHOUECT on From John NRON on To Darren CT cc Gary CT JanErland CT Sheila CT Susan MuschENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re Enron Japan Trading and Enron Global Markets LLC Trading Darren Pursuant to your questions relating to interest rate and foreign exchange trading in Japan please review the advice below Interest Rates and Foreign Exchange Transactions Transactions with respect to interest rates and foreign exchange other than financial futures transactions are generally not subject to specific regulation in Japan Banks securities companies are permitted to enter into transactions of this type as part of their ancillary business but are not granted an exclusive mandate to conduct these transactions Accordingly it would be possible for Enron Japan Corp to conduct interest rate and foreign exchange transactions with ordinary Japanese corporations as well as financial institutions However in the event that Enron Japan does conduct interest rate or foreign exchange transactions with a corporation that is not a financial institution the risk that the transaction may be considered to be gambling increases The fact that one of the parties to a derivative transaction is authorized by statute to enter into the transaction will constitute a defense to an allegation that the transaction constitutes gambling If neither party to the transaction has the benefit of a specific authorization it will be necessary to rebut an allegation of gambling by arguing that the parties had a legitimate business reason for entering into the transaction Baker McKenzie has stated that this risk is relatively low and are not aware of any cases where such activity has been problematic In addition where the transaction constitutes an OTC financial futures transaction for example a swap where the price is based on an interest rate index quoted on a financial futures exchange in Japan the transaction will be regulated under the Financial Futures Trading Law see below Financial Futures Transactions In summary under the Financial Futures Trading Law if Enron Japan wishes to conduct financial futures brokerage business it must hold a license If Enron Japan does not hold such a license the counterparties with whom it may conduct financial futures transactions will be limited to banks securities companies and members of a Financial Futures Exchange who are licensed as financial futures brokers Financial futures transactions include the following a futures contracts in relation to currencies etc and listed options with respect to currencies etc and b OTC financial futures transactions With regard to the question as to whether the trades that you engage in have to be booked under Enron Japan Corp or whether you can execute for Enron Global Markets LLC this is really a tax question for Susan Musch who I have copied on this email My general understanding is that so as not to develop a permanent establishment for tax purposes which could create tax liabilities for an offshore entity conducting such activities the trades should be booked with Enron Japan Corp This is subject to Susans advice which will provide you further details and perhaps more sophisticated methods to approach this issue Looking forward to seeing you back in Japan Best regards John Darren CT PM To John nron Sheila Glover JanErland nron cc Gary CT Subject Enron Japan Trading and Enron Global Markets LLC Trading Hello John As you know I am looking at returning to Tokyo on temporary assignment effective September to support our efforts in Enron Japan as well as to leverage the locational advantage for Financial trading part of Enron Global Markets LLC From what I understood of our earlier conversations there is not a legal issue with entering into foreign exchange or fixed income trades with another counterparty located in Tokyo whether it be another US bank or a Japanese bank Can you please generally confirm this Do the trades that I engage in have to be booked under Enron Japan or can I execute for Enron Global Markets LLC Sheila If the trades that I do in Japan have to be booked under Enron Japan how does the accounting work to effectively transfer Pl back to Garys RC ie how are we accounting for proprietary trading pl in London office and are there any nuances that I need to be aware of in the bookingimplementation of these trades Jan what information are you going to need from Sheilas group in order to be comfortable with the transaction and accounting process either on proprietary andor on order flow originating either in Japan or abroad ie an

If you have time in the morning Nov Tokyo I would like to discuss ENAs view of the CSASchedule relationship In a nutshell we provide that a ratings downgrade is an Additional Event of Default in the Schedule normally a MAC in the CSA Johns preferance of course would be a unilateral event triggering an IBJ default which I am sure would be difficult to negotiate I am not certain of the time difference but perhaps you could call me at the office after pm Nov in Houston and I could then conference in John Alternatively please feel free to contact me at home after pm Houston time on Nov at I look forward to hearing from you Regards Sara Jane NRON AM To John CT Alan CT cc John nron Jonathan nron Mark CT Sara CT Subject IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT Credit matrix and Threshold amount Dear John Jonathan and I met with IBJ today to try and push our negotiations through to the end They are still unwilling to do a CSA with us but very significantly their back mid office is currently looking at getting systems support in place which would permit them to do a CSA with us in due course They acknowledged to us of their own volition that the market trend is towards CSAs even in transactions where the counter party is not a bank They did say though that it would be a few months before they would be set up to do so Pls note that they did not agree to do a CSA with us as soon as they are set up to do so but they now know we will come knocking at some stage to ask them to do it so I think we have gone as far as we can on this for now We will therefore move forward on the credit matrix in the meantime if you are still willing to do so The bank has a credit rating of A so I guess this means US million credit limit On the assumption that it is possible to draft these terms into a contract without a full CSA I wonder who is best to do this drafting I should be able to do the negotiations but I am not sure that I am able to do the drafting Alan do you have any suggestions Most of the other issues are sorted now but they still want to change the Threshold Amount definition to US million Is there any flexibility on this Thanks Jane McBride John CT AM To Jonathan NRON cc Jane nron John nron Kevin CT Mark CT Morten E nron Steven CT Tom Bruce CT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT Jonathan One thing we might be able to propose is a Credit Matrix which prescribes a Credit Line under which each counterparty can transact with collateral rights and collateral thresholds tied to the credit rating of each counterparty We have used credit matrixes in several contracts here and they are appealing in that there are no Material Adverse Change MAC clauses This is appealing to the counterparty in that we cannot automatically drop their collateral threshold to zero when a MAC occurs We are comfortable because as the counterpartys credit quality deteriorates the amount of exposure to which we are subject decreases I would propose to IBJ something like the following in lieu of a full CSA Jane and John is it possible to draft these collateralcredit terms into the contract without using a full CSA I think every matrix I have used here has been part of a CSA Rating SP Credit Line AA or above MM BBB to AA MM BBB MM BBB MM BB to BB MM Below BB MM These terms are subject to negotiation Once again the matrix removes MAC clauses and the stress counterparties associate with such but effectively reduces the potential exposure we have or THEY have to a counterparty with diminishing credit quality What do you all think John Jonathan Whitehead ENRON PM To John CT cc Jane nron John nron Kevin CT Mark CT Morten E nron Steven CT Tom Bruce CT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT Sorry Pressed send too early John Have had a conversation with IBJ re the CSA and they have asked us to consider proposing a solution that does not involve a CSA I propose to meet with them again to try and explore why but I would like to be prepared to offer them a solution whereby we dont enter into a CSA and we would limit the types of trades that we could enter into with IBJ My feeling is that we would be unlikely to enter into any long term transactions over years at this stage anyway and would prefer to get the relationship going as I am not sure they are going to budge on this issue yet They appear to be quite willing to discuss all the other points We can always press for a renegotiation at a later stage if we do want to enter into longer term deals I also want to keep the loan facility completely separate What are your thoughts on this and what limitations would you want to put on trades if we do not have a CSA Thanks Jonathan John Viverito PM To John CT cc Jane CT John CT Kevin CT Mark CT Morten E CT Steven CT Tom Bruce CT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT John During our last meeting with IBJ we pushed hard for the implementation of the CSA I believe that they have the systems capability to handle the requisite activities relating to the CSA as we understand that they utilize same with certain financial institution counterparties We expressed our view on these matters and also raised other issues that we had discussed in our recent conference call IBJ informed us that they have never entered into a CSA with a nonfinancial institution counterparty and my response was that Enron can then be the first We requested that they raise this issue with their respective superiors As you know their response to our discussions relating to this issue was In terms of CSA as we are not ready for running collateral operations we still do not prefer to use the CSA The legitimacy of this statement is certainly debatable and the underlying reason may actually be something entirely different including the possibility that they merely do not want to enter into a CSA with a nonfinancial institution We will continue to attempt to persuade IBJ to enter into the CSA with Enron however it is uncertain if this is achievable

raised when we spoke was that he wants the management reporting of the income from those trades to go to his group I told him that my understanding is that that should not be a problem JanErland please let me know if my understanding is incorrect Where we are right now with respect to the structuring process is that JanErland is working on the margin as set forth below in his attached email

structuring Darren I talked with Gary last week and explained that based on the Japanese tax advice that we have received from Baker McKenzieTokyo we cannot follow the same approach that we followed for the financial traders in the London and Sydney offices That is instead of having the trader as an employee of the local office provide services for ENA we need to have backtoback trades between Enron Japan EJ and Enron North America ENA Under this scenario you would be an Enron Japan EJ employee who would enter into the trades for EJ as principal Then EJ would enter into mirror trades with ENA Under this approach we have to figure out what margins should be retained by EJ These backtoback trades would need to be entered into at an arms length rate The amount of margin retained by EJ should be based on what risk it retains and the value it generatescosts it incurs in entering into those trades Do you Jane or JanErland have any thoughts on what margin should be retained by EJ Are there any third party comparables we can use to determine the margin Also Darren how long do you plan to be in the Tokyo office Best regards Susan From Darren NRON on PM ZE To Susan MuschENRON

given that Darren Delage will be in the Tokyo office entering into trades we should pursue a backtoback trading arrangement That is Darren would be working for Enron Japan EJ and would enter into the trades for EJ as principal Then EJ would enter into mirror trades with ENA The tax issue then is a transfer pricing issue Ed previously advised that the margin should be based on a profitsplit method In his June rd memo he advised Such a profit split would likely be along the lines of the various profit split methods that have been used to allocate profits among branches or local entities of banks and financial institutions that engage in global trading operations As we expect you are aware from experience in other jurisdictions there is no clearly agreed upon set of factors to use in profit splits for global trading operations but typical profit split factors employed have been trader compensation back office compensation a location or value factor and perhaps a risk or capital factor If our sense is correct that a profit split would ultimately be determined to be the appropriate price method this could entail a substantial effort to make the necessary functional analysis to develop the profit split These are initial impressions only and on your request we can evaluate the appropriate pricing method for the Japan financial trader operation in detail Basically under a profit split approach Enron Japan should earn a margin depending on what risks it retains and the costs it occurs with respect to these backtoback trades The amount of the margin is something that well have to develop based on how comparable unrelated trades would be priced Please let me know if you have any questions or need any additional information Best regards Susan Forwarded by Susan MuschENRONDEVELOPMENT on PM EdwinT AKERNETcom on PM To cc Jeremy AKERNETcom PaulTYO akerNetcom Yukinori AKERNETcom Subject Enron JapanBased TraderPE and TP Issues Dear Susan We confirm that we continue to recommend the basic approaches put forward in the June memo either use backtoback transactions if it is essential to have Japanbased personnel trading for ENA or other offshore affiliates or preferable purely from the tax standpoint if acceptable in light of operational considerations have personnel at Enron Australia or other affiliate in an appropriate time zone handle the Japan trading Your description of the backtoback trades as mirror transactions is correct in the sense that the trades would be symmetrical in order to transfer to ENA or other offshore affiliate the position it wants to take in the covered trade The terms might differ depending what decision is made about what mechanism to compensate Enron Japan for transfer pricing purposes ie if some margin were built into the backtoback trades to compensate Enron Japan As discussed in our June memo the transfer pricing issues are potentially difficult in view of the limited authority in this area but in our view such pricing issues would present less exposure than structuring the operation so that it would constitute a PE If you have any questions or if we can provide further assistance with this

Agreed to include this provision Part We still prefer to include the provisions relating to the Commodity Transactions in the respective Confirmations I look forward to receiving your input I note that Jane McBride has start ed here at Enron Japan therefore I have copied her on this correspondence Looking forward to seeing you in Houston soon Best regards John Forwarded by John ViveritoCorpEnron on AM John Viverito AM To Mark CT cc Kevin CT Steve n CT Tom Bruce CT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT Mark Thanks for your input I agree with all of the comments you have raised As to Part n the use of the English language is not uncommon in Japan wit h regard to these types of arrangements and should be insisted upon for transactions under the ISDA documentation I think that it will be useful to better understand Japanese market practic e relating to the use of the Credit Support Annex Therefore I have asked Baker McKenzie to provide a clear picture as to the situation in Japan an d will provide this information upon receipt Following receipt of John Suttles comments I will prepare the response to IBJ based on the points that have been raised by both you and John Thanks John Mark CT PM To John NRON cc Kevin CT Steve n CT Tom Bruce CT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT I had a brief conversation this morning with John Suttle Credit and it looks like hes going to insist on the CSA We are going to talk tomorrow and go through the whole agreement to get the rest of his comments While we have documentation for transactions entered into prior to execution of a master agreement the extent of their revisions makes me very uneasy Many of these points are very serious and if they can not agree we will have trouble coming to agreement even on the short form documents It would be helpful if they could explain the changes rather than just sending us a markup Following are my points responsive to their revisions Part a The addition of our affiliates has the affect of expanding the possible defaults too broadly and we cannot agree to these changes for example this would mean that if any Enron affiliate went into bankruptcy this agreement would be in default g This provision provides additional flexibility without any credit risk to the other party It should remain in place unless IBJ can articulate a reason to remove it Part The language inserted is much to vague Our original version spells out exactly what is expected of the parties If the documents we listed ar e not acceptable IBJ should tell us now what would be acceptable and if we agree we will put it in the agreement Part f By deleting the word not in this provision IBJ is saying tha t payments due to each other with respect to the same transaction will not ne t ie if we are paying fixed and they are paying floating we each have to make the full payment to the other rather than netting the two amounts to o ne payment This is not acceptable h If IBJ will use their NY branch as agent we should use Enron Corp or E NA Part a Our suggested language allows the purchaser of an option to receive payments due even though technically in default under another provision of the agreement Our position is that if there are no other possible payment requirements due from the purchaser the option should be honored c The section we delete requires that the market makers be in the same city For many markets in which we participate it is very difficult if n ot impossible to find multiple market makers in the same city e The change to business days is much too long This means we can no t have certainty as to the terms of the transaction for two weeks We can go as high as three days if necessary but even that is beyond common market practice g Their changes remove the ability to set off against obligations owed t o multiple Enron companies if they default and only allows setoff with each IBJ branch as a separate entity This may not be an issue if we will never trade or otherwise transact with them in any other Enron company and if we will never do business with any other branch of IBJ We usually dont like to restrict ourselves that way i We absolutely insist on the confidentiality of our transactions If there is some revision to this section they would like we can discuss it bu t wholesale deletion is out of the question j As with Part g this section adds flexibility to both parties while maintaining flexibility within the corporate family Given the frequency with which Enron moves businesses around within the family this section is important to us k This section results from an experience we had with a counterparty tha t went into bankruptcy and therefore default while they were in the money We disputed the amount owed and under the terms of the agreement without o ur revision we would have owed them interest at their cost of funds a rathe r high rate given their status as a bankrupt We feel the nondefault rate i s more appropriate m I cant imagine why they wouldnt want this section included it protects us both n You know more about this than I Part These are all important issues for us and we can discuss them individually if they object for some articulated reason If these provisio ns are not included here they will need to be included in each confirmation a significant burden for our back office systems which are not set up for it and we need to know now if they object to any of them Other revisions that they have made are acceptable unless Credit objects I hope this is helpful and sorry to have run on so long Im happy to discus s any of these issues at greater length if you want It sounds to me like IBJs expectations regarding execution of documents are a bit high given th e volume and nature of their comments John NRON PM To Tom Bruce CT cc ECT Kevin CT S teven CT Mark CT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT Tom As far as the progress on the ISDA documentation I am awaiting feedback fr om

AKERNETcom NicholasO Subject Enron Online Counterparty Authority In view of the importance of this issue it is desirable to deal with it in detail The Issue The essential issue we are focussing on is that set out in my email of May ie the need to avoid the possibility of a counterparty being able to claim that the transaction is not binding because a it was outside the companys business purposes or b execution of the application was not authorized This issue is not unique to Japan There is no question as to any specific Japanese laws impacting on the trading of any of the products through the internet including issues as to contractual enforceability of contracts entered into via the internet on which we advised on March A copy of that advice is attached to the bottom of this email Neither is there any question if the above issue is resolved of the Electronic Trading Agreement and General Terms and Conditions forming part of the contract We understand Mark Taylor to be concerned on this aspect Enrons Practice re EOL Our understanding is that Potential customers have been sent the password application under cover of a letter from Joseph Hirl inviting them to complete the application Neither the letter nor the application form indicate who is expected to sign the form Completed applications are reviewed by Enron primarily from a credit standpoint but also we understand from Mark Taylor to quickly confirm the authority of the signer by eg in the case of a US counterparty checking if the signatory shows the title director alongside his name If satisfied Enron then signs the acceptance part of the application and issues a password Four applications had been received regarding Japan as of am today and none has yet been approved Business Purposes Article of the Civil Code provides that a juristic person has rights and obligations in accordance with law and the business purposes specified in its constituent documents Where a corporation enters into a contract outside its business purposes the contract is prima facie void However if the counterparty did not know that the contract was beyond the power of the corporation and was not negligent in failing to know such fact the contract will be enforced under Article of the Civil Code The most prudent practice would be for Enron to obtain a copy of the counterpartys business purposes certified by the Legal Affairs Bureau or by a representative director and form a view on whether the proposed transaction falls within those purposes However since Japanese companies business purposes after listing a limited number of specific purposes generally include a final item along the lines of all incidental or ancillary business it is common for companies to not make this inquiry except in the most major contracts With respect to statutory corporations however care is required because often their business purposes are in fact limited Accordingly a rule of thumb solution would be if the counterparty name does not contain Kabushiki Kaisha or Yugen Gaisha at the end of the name to make further inquiries Authority to Bind the Company The Law The position in Japan is similar to that in a number of other countries in the sense that a Deemed Authority The law provides for a form of execution which if followed entitles a party to presume that the company is bound In Japan this involves the execution of a contract by the companys representative director This corresponds to the presumption concerning the affixing of the company seal in some states of the US and in the UK and the execution of the contract by directors in Australia It is possible for the powers of the representative director to be restricted by law or the constituent documents of the corporation Article of the Civil Code but if the counterparty did not know of such restriction the contract is still binding on the company b Apparent Authority In common with other countries Japan has a concept of apparent authority Article of the Commercial Code provides A company shall be liable to a bona fide third party for any act done by a director invested with any title such as president vice president executive director or managing director from which it may be assumed that he has authority to represent the company even in cases where the person has no power of representation Articles and of the Commercial Code extend the same concept to general managers so shihainin It is generally considered that Article then applies the concept to an employee who has been entrusted with certain types of matters or specific matters Accordingly in addition to persons having the titles listed in Article above the general view is that persons having titles such as general manager and division manager bucho will be deemed to have the authority to represent the company for normal transactions within the particular areas of the companys business for which they are responsible It is also likely that section managers kacho or section chiefs kakaricho have power to bind the company to a certain extent in areas for which they are responsible e Holding Out Even if an employee of the company is acting outside his actual authority if the company has held the employee out as having authority the company will be bound by hisher action Practical Considerations In formulating an approach for Enron to take on the basis of the above law the following factors are relevant a Practice regarding Representative Director Seal It is common for a counterparty to seek to take the advantage of the presumption referred to in a above by requiring the representative directors corporate seal to be affixed and if contract is in English for him to sign or to insist on tracing the chain of authority of the signatory up to the representative director eg by power of attorney for major or unusual transactions b Size of Transaction The question is what transactions fall into the major or unusual category Unfortunately the cases on this do not allow a clear line to be drawn As in many other countries the answer depends on factors such as those noted in c d and e below which vary company by company Accordingly where the contract involves or could involve a considerable ongoing exposure by the company Japanese corporations would not be surprised to be asked for the signatory to be at a certain level or for written confirmation of the signatorys authority to be obtained from a person at such level c Size of Company While it would be prudent and normal to insist upon the representative directors seal being affixed to a contract of the present type in the case of a smaller company it would not be normal practice to so insist in the case of a major company such as a bank or major trading company counterparty in which companies lower level employees are presumed to have greater authority d Business Department of Signatory The counterparty is more likely to be bound under the apparent authority doctrine if the signatory is in and carries a title which refers to the relevant business department eg energy than if he is not e Degree of Exposure To the extent that the online products to be made available are likely to expose the counterparty to considerable liability the possibility of a counterparty in the future disclaiming liability should not be discounted and would warrant a reasonably conservative approach f Recent History However even when faced with considerable losses during the recent economic crisis Japanese companies at least major companies have not generally attempted to use lack of authority as a defense presumably because of reputation considerations g Identity of Addressee The title of the person to whom the invitation letter is sent may be relevant For example if it was sent to the General Manager of the relevant department but the application came from a section chief there would be strong argument that the company had held the section chief out as having the necessary authority h Internal Procedures Since the law concerning execution by a representative director can be considered to broadly correspond to the law concerning execution under seal in some countries and by two directors in for example Australia the Japanese rules are not out of line with those of other countries Accordingly it should be necessary for Enron to take a more stringent approach to Japan in this respect than it does in marketing the same products in other countries The procedures in place for other countries may be sufficient for Japan as well although some adjustment will need to be made for Japans unique regime of company titles Conservative Approach If the online transactions are treated as a major or unusual transaction for the counterparty under common practice Enron would require The application to be executed under the registered seal of and counter signed by a representative director or by a person who is able to produce documentation showing a line of authority originating with a representative director A certified copy of the seal register A certified copy of the register of the company issued by the Legal Affairs Bureau to confirm the business purposes and the identity of the representative director Less Conservative Approach Major Companies For major Japanese trading companies banks insurance companies and other companies of equivalent size the following approach could be adopted which would not be out of line with market practice The application to be executed by a manager or general managerbucho of the relevant department or above or By a person able to establish a line of authority from such party A more aggressive approach would involve accepting applications signed by a person at the level of section manager kacho or section chief kakaricho but this is right on the line and we would prefer Enron to do so only if there is some history of dealings with the company or other evidence to back up an apparent authority argument Smaller Companies For other companies the approach would be as set out in above Perhaps your credit control procedures could be used to set a benchmark for dividing between small and large companies Likely Response of Target Companies Your marketing experts will be in a better position than us to form a view but taking into account Japanese commercial practice we do not believe any company is likely to be offended if Enron responds along the above lines to an application signed by a person who does not meet the above suggested approach particularly taking into account that the approach is not inconsistent with the correspondence and application form the companies have been sent and no applications have yet been approved Regards Paul DavisHideo Ohta Baker

you regarding the use of our internet trading website with customers in Japan Below is a list of initial questions regarding which we would be grateful for the benefit of your advice For your background information as you consider these questions be advised that counterparties must sign a written Password Application which provides that the counterparty intends to be bound by agreements entered into by clicking in the appropriate spaces on the website Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have I can be reached either by email at or by telephone at Have relevant regulators in your jurisdiction made any statements regarding marketing of or dealing in any of the following types of products through the internet or other electronic systems Commodity transactions relating to oil gas electricity or other energy commodities whether derivative transactions cash settled or physically settled Financial derivatives ie interest rate foreign exchange or credit derivatives Weather derivatives If so please could you provide us with a brief summary Our research has revealed no statements of regulators in Japan in connection with the marketing or dealing in the above types of products through the internet or other electronic systems from publicly available source We will let you know if we find any previous or future statements Do any specific laws or regulations exist in your jurisdiction which would prevent or in any way impact upon marketing or trading of any of the products set out in question above through the internet In answering this question please address issues relating to contractual formation and enforceability of contracts entered into via the internet In particular if a transaction entered into via the internet is enforceable under US or UK law and the transactions contain a choice of such law will such transactions including the choice of law be enforceable in Japan We do not have any specific laws or regulations which would marketing or trading of any of the products set out in question above through the internet Under Japanese law formation of any contract does not require any formality Japanese law generally does not require any formalities for offers or acceptances to be valid as such There is no Statute of Frauds and parties may make most types of contracts orally If there is enough evidence establishing that the offeree agreed to the terms offered an offeror may rely on it In most simple sales contracts for consumer goods for example it would be easy to prove that the customer agreed to pay x yen for product Y The Sellers electronic records showing that the customer clicked on the icon to buy product Y should be enough in this context In more complicated contracts the structure of the sellers Web pages should be carefully designed Having no court decisions we have no definite answer to the question of enforceability of shrinkwrap agreements in Japan However the legal implications of the Webwrap the online version of shrinkwrap may be somewhat different from shrinkwraps eg licenses for software sold over the counter Under a typical shrinkwrap license in the real world for example the customer cannot break the wrapper until after the customer purchases the product However in an online environment a customer has a choice to click on an AccepttoBuy icon before the customer purchases the product Further with a carefully compiled sequence of screens or pages which would in effect be able to let the customer read the terms and conditions before rushing to click on the icon it would be easier to prove that the customer read the terms and conditions than in a typical shrinkwrap license situation Unlike shrinkwrap in the real world the seller may obtain an electronic record showing that the customer clicked on the icon Given these differences the result possibly may be more favorable to sellers online than to those using shrinkwrap licenses If a transaction entered into via the internet is enforceable under US or UK law and the transactions contain a choice of such law such transactions including the choice of law will be enforceable in Japan If the answer to either of question or is yes please indicate whether the impact of any relevant statements laws or regulations will differ depending upon whether a the relevant internet site is maintained in your jurisdiction or elsewhere or b the party effecting the marketingtrading through the internet is locally licensed NA Please confirm that by marketing to or trading with counterparts in your jurisdiction via the internet local relevant regulatory bodieslocal laws or regulations will not consider the party maintaining the relevant website to have established a physical establishmentbranch in your jurisdiction We do not have any clear cut answer to this since we have no relevant laws regulations or court cases So long as the party maintains the relevant website with a computer server located outside Japan the likelihood of Japanese regulatory bodies to consider that the party maintaining such website established a physical establishmentbranch in Japan is

In relation to your specific questions our answers are as follows We confirm that there are no regulatory approvals required to trade Japanese weather derivatives whether or not the Enron counterparty is or is not incorporated or resident of Japan No except that trading weather derivatives online would make it more difficult for Enron to ascertain the suitability of the counterparty see gambling issue below as online transactions would probably allow very limited due diligence opportunities Enron will need to pay close attention to ensure that weather derivative products are not considered gambling activities As discussed in our memorandum of January all derivative transactions may potentially constitute gambling transactions If the transaction does constitute gambling Enron may be exposed to criminal sanctions if the activity is conducted in Japan and the contract may be declared void by a court and thus be unenforceable Under Article of the Criminal Code there is a defense to any possible criminal action if the transaction is entered into for legitimate purposes To determine whether the parties have a legitimate business purpose a court would need to look at all relevant facts and circumstances including the nature of the derivative contract entered into and the underlying business of the counterparties There are four possible combinations of parties to these contracts Case Enron Non JapanJapanese Resident Case Enron JapanJapanese Resident Case Enron JapanNon Japanese Resident Case Enron Non JapanNon Japanese Resident In both cases and Enron needs to ensure that the Japanese counterparty has a legitimate business purpose to confirm that the transaction does not fall within Article and of the Criminal Code which would render the contract unenforceable In cases and the need to comply with the law is also to ensure that Enron Japan and its officers do not unwittingly commit criminal offences under the Criminal Code In cases and Enron would need to ensure that the counterparty is permitted to enter into the transaction with Enron or Enron Japan without breaching the law or regulation that might apply to derivatives in that country Although we are not able to state conclusively that Enron will have no risk in entering into weather derivatives in Japan we consider that this risk will be reduced if a Enron entered into these transactions from offshore b Enron Japan is not involved in the marketing of these transactions in any way c Enron obtains the representations below where the counterparties are Japanese residents Please answer the following questions if you are a Japanese entity To ensure that this transaction does not fall within Article or of the Japanese Criminal Code please confirm that a you have read and fully understand the terms of the proposed transaction b you are entering into this transaction to hedge weather related risk that arises in the ordinary course of your business If your answers are affirmative for both a and b above Enron will rely on these representations and regard your company as having a legitimate business purpose to enter into this transaction as permitted under Article of the Criminal Code As we mentioned above while obtaining these representations could reduce the risk of Enron from contracting with inappropriate parties it obviously would not catch inappropriate counterparties that knowingly answer the questions falsely Therefore to the extent possible Enron should also conduct its own due diligence with respect to the counterparty to confirm the suitability of the transaction and to confirm that the counterparty has a legitimate business purpose in entering into the transaction We confirm that there should be no transaction tax applicable to weather derivatives We confirmed with MITI that they are setting up a committee to draw up new regulations for derivative transactions for industrial commodities not for weather but they envisage that such regulations will not be ready for another year Regards PADAH in consultation with JDPSTTS Original Message From mailto mailto Sent Tuesday June AM To PaulTYO akerNetcom Anne akernetcom Cc Subject ENRON Request for Further Advice PaulAnne The scheduled date for the launch of EOL weather trading in Australia is June rd We plan to trade Tokyo and Osaka in addition to Australian cities Therefore we need to have resolved all legal issues prior to this date Below we provide some background information and a basic operational description of Enron Online for your review We have also raised questions relating to this matter and look forward to your prompt response As similar questions have been asked and answered previously we would hope to receive your responses by the end of this week Background As you know Enron Corp has developed an online trading system using the internet for a number of physical products and financial derivatives which it or its subsidiaries trade This system is called Enron Online A preview of the system is available on the internet at wwwenrononlinecom One category of product traded through EnronOnline is weather derivatives Although there are differing types of weather derivatives they all have a floating price linked to meteorological readings eg temperature precipitation Enron proposes to offer weather derivatives linked to meteorological readings for Tokyo and Osaka and potentially for other Japanese and foreign cities to counterparties resident in Japan Initially the Enron contracting entity will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Corp that is incorporated in a country other than Japan and that has no presence in Japan Later the Enron contracting entity may be a Japanese resident corporation eg Enron Japan Corp In your advice dated January you generally indicated that there would be no legal impediment to Enron trading OTC weather derivatives in Japan We would ask that you expand on that advice Operation of EnronOnline EnronOnline allows counterparties to may make on line offers to Enron in respect of one of the products listed on the screen Enron may accept this offer through an on line response thereby forming a contract A potential counterparty wishing to trade through EnronOnline contacts Enron and fills out a registration form Enron will make its credit assessment on the counterparty If accepted the counterparty is required to sign a password agreement and is issued a password The first time a counterparty logs onto the system with its approved password it will be required to agree to an electronic trading Agreement ETA by clicking the I Agree Box after scrolling thought the ETA For each traded product there will be available online a set of contract terms known as General Terms and

Weather and Oil Derivatives Alan Jeremy has requested that I forward this on to you as he had experienced a bounce back problem with your address Forwarded by John ViveritoCorpEnron on AM Jeremy AKERNETcom AM To cc Subject FW Weather and Oil Derivatives Resending Original Message From Pitts Jeremy Sent Thursday July PM To Cc Davis Paul Eguchi Naoaki Toyohara Shinji nicholaso Subject FW Weather and Oil Derivatives John I refer to our telephone conversation this afternoon regarding our advice copy below and confirm the matters discussed as follows We note your conversation with Terry Tanaka of IBJ in which he commented that it was his understanding that the FSA had given informal approval for banks to conduct weather derivative transactions This gives banks who engage in weather derivative transactions and their counterparties a possible additional argument that the transaction are being conducted in accordance with law for the purposes of the defense in Article of the Criminal Code This does not change our advice with respect to transactions between Enron Japan and nonbank counterparties However if Enron Japan were to enter into a weather derivative with a bank Enron Japan would be able to rely on the tacit approval given by the FSA to the bank but only to the extent to which the bank would be willing to represent and warrant to Enron Japan that the bank was authorised to enter into the transaction under Japanese laws and regulations We note your comment regarding the possibility that Enron Japan would enter into backtoback transaction with an offshore Enron affiliate and thus transfer all risk in relation to the weather derivative transactions outside Japan As mentioned in our advice one of the factors that will suggest that Enron Japan is engaged in a legitimate business activity will be the fact that Enron Japan manages the risk under the transactions that it enters into and does not take purely speculative positions Entering into backtoback transactions is one way in which Enron Japan may manage risk However there are also other risk management techniques such as hedging in local markets to the extent possible or hedging in offshore markets Insofar as these different risk management techniques are all effective methods of risk management we do not believe that any one method of risk management is necessarily preferable to another We have checked the home page for the Japanese Financial Law Board and confirm that it does not contain any information directly relevant to weather derivatives The home page does contain discussion of the application of the Criminal Law to financial derivatives generally but simply notes that the parties to a financial derivative that is not specifically authorised by law cannot rely on the act in accordance with law defense under Article of the Criminal Law You have asked us whether we would be able to change our risk assessment from relatively low to extremely low We are most reluctant to change our view Our difficulty is that the risk of possible action by the regulators or by the police is extremely difficult to predict and it is therefore necessary for us to take a slightly cautious approach We do note that similar concerns about gambling were raised when swaps were first introduced in Japan in the s and again when new derivatives products such as oil derivatives and equity derivatives were introduced in the s However as far as we are aware no prosecutions have ever been commenced in Japan alleging that swap or derivative transaction constitute gambling In our advice we identified a number of factors that tend to raise or lower the risk of possible action We would like to emphasise that if Enron Japan does commence weather derivative trading in Japan Enron Japan should clearly add specific representations regarding the legitimate business issue in its contract documentation establish clear internal policies regarding counterparty selection and risk management possibly in the form of a board resolution only transact business with a authorised financial institutions see above or b large sophisticated counterparties with a legitimate business purpose and transact business in an appropriate manner These points are explained in further detail in the attached advice We hope this helps to clarify the risks Please let us know if you need additional

<27790534.1075860219451.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,alan.aronowitz@enron.com,2000-05-19 04:45:00,Enron Online Counterparty Authority Forwarded by Alan AronowitzHOUECT on AM PaulTYO akerNetcom AM To cc Hideo AKERNETcom NicholasO Subject Enron Online Counterparty Authority In view of the importance of this issue it is desirable to deal with it in detail The Issue The essential issue we are focussing on is that set out in my email of May ie the need to avoid the possibility of a counterparty being able to claim that the transaction is not binding because a it was outside the companys business purposes or b execution of the application was not authorized This issue is not unique to Japan There is no question as to any specific Japanese laws impacting on the trading of any of the products through the internet including issues as to contractual enforceability of contracts entered into via the internet on which we advised on March A copy of that advice is attached to the bottom of this email Neither is there any question if the above issue is resolved of the Electronic Trading Agreement and General Terms and Conditions forming part of the contract We understand Mark Taylor to be concerned on this aspect Enrons Practice re EOL Our understanding is that Potential customers have been sent the password application under cover of a letter from Joseph Hirl inviting them to complete the application Neither the letter nor the application form indicate who is expected to sign the form Completed applications are reviewed by Enron primarily from a credit standpoint but also we understand from Mark Taylor to quickly confirm the authority of the signer by eg in the case of a US counterparty checking if the signatory shows the title director alongside his name If satisfied Enron then signs the acceptance part of the application and issues a password Four applications had been received regarding Japan as of am today and none has yet been approved Business Purposes Article of the Civil Code provides that a juristic person has rights and obligations in accordance with law and the business purposes specified in its constituent documents Where a corporation enters into a contract outside its business purposes the contract is prima facie void However if the counterparty did not know that the contract was beyond the power of the corporation and was not negligent in failing to know such fact the contract will be enforced under Article of the Civil Code The most prudent practice would be for Enron to obtain a copy of the counterpartys business purposes certified by the Legal Affairs Bureau or by a representative director and form a view on whether the proposed transaction falls within those purposes However since Japanese companies business purposes after listing a limited number of specific purposes generally include a final item along the lines of all incidental or ancillary business it is common for companies to not make this inquiry except in the most major contracts With respect to statutory corporations however care is required because often their business purposes are in fact limited Accordingly a rule of thumb solution would be if the counterparty name does not contain Kabushiki Kaisha or Yugen Gaisha at the end of the name to make further inquiries Authority to Bind the Company The Law The position in Japan is similar to that in a number of other countries in the sense that a Deemed Authority The law provides for a form of execution which if followed entitles a party to presume that the company is bound In Japan this involves the execution of a contract by the companys representative director This corresponds to the presumption concerning the affixing of the company seal in some states of the US and in the UK and the execution of the contract by directors in Australia It is possible for the powers of the representative director to be restricted by law or the constituent documents of the corporation Article of the Civil Code but if the counterparty did not know of such restriction the contract is still binding on the company b Apparent Authority In common with other countries Japan has a concept of apparent authority Article of the Commercial Code provides A company shall be liable to a bona fide third party for any act done by a director invested with any title such as president vice president executive director or managing director from which it may be assumed that he has authority to represent the company even in cases where the person has no power of representation Articles and of the Commercial Code extend the same concept to general managers so shihainin It is generally considered that Article then applies the concept to an employee who has been entrusted with certain types of matters or specific matters Accordingly in addition to persons having the titles listed in Article above the general view is that persons having titles such as general manager and division manager bucho will be deemed to have the authority to represent the company for normal transactions within the particular areas of the companys business for which they are responsible It is also likely that section managers kacho or section chiefs kakaricho have power to bind the company to a certain extent in areas for which they are responsible e Holding Out Even if an employee of the company is acting outside his actual authority if the company has held the employee out as having authority the company will be bound by hisher action Practical Considerations In formulating an approach for Enron to take on the basis of the above law the following factors are relevant a Practice regarding Representative Director Seal It is common for a counterparty to seek to take the advantage of the presumption referred to in a above by requiring the representative directors corporate seal to be affixed and if contract is in English for him to sign or to insist on tracing the chain of authority of the signatory up to the representative director eg by power of attorney for major or unusual transactions b Size of Transaction The question is what transactions fall into the major or unusual category Unfortunately the cases on this do not allow a clear line to be drawn As in many other countries the answer depends on factors such as those noted in c d and e below which vary company by company Accordingly where the contract involves or could involve a considerable ongoing exposure by the company Japanese corporations would not be surprised to be asked for the signatory to be at a certain level or for written confirmation of the signatorys authority to be obtained from a person at such level c Size of Company While it would be prudent and normal to insist upon the representative directors seal being affixed to a contract of the present type in the case of a smaller company it would not be normal practice to so insist in the case of a major company such as a bank or major trading company counterparty in which companies lower level employees are presumed to have greater authority d Business Department of Signatory The counterparty is more likely to be bound under the apparent authority doctrine if the signatory is in and carries a title which refers to the relevant business department eg energy than if he is not e Degree of Exposure To the extent that the online products to be made available are likely to expose the counterparty to considerable liability the possibility of a counterparty in the future disclaiming liability should not be discounted and would warrant a reasonably conservative approach f Recent History However even when faced with considerable losses during the recent economic crisis Japanese companies at least major companies have not generally attempted to use lack of authority as a defense presumably because of reputation considerations g Identity of Addressee The title of the person to whom the invitation letter is sent may be relevant For example if it was sent to the General Manager of the relevant department but the application came from a section chief there would be strong argument that the company had held the section chief out as having the necessary authority h Internal Procedures Since the law concerning execution by a representative director can be considered to broadly correspond to the law concerning execution under seal in some countries and by two directors in for example Australia the Japanese rules are not out of line with those of other countries Accordingly it should be necessary for Enron to take a more stringent approach to Japan in this respect than it does in marketing the same products in other countries The procedures in place for other countries may be sufficient for Japan as well although some adjustment will need to be made for Japans unique regime of company titles Conservative Approach If the online transactions are treated as a major or unusual transaction for the counterparty under common practice Enron would require The application to be executed under the registered seal of and counter signed by a representative director or by a person who is able to produce documentation showing a line of authority originating with a representative director A certified copy of the seal register A certified copy of the register of the company issued by the Legal Affairs Bureau to confirm the business purposes and the identity of the representative director Less Conservative Approach Major Companies For major Japanese trading companies banks insurance companies and other companies of equivalent size the following approach could be adopted which would not be out of line with market practice The application to be executed by a manager or general managerbucho of the relevant department or above or By a person able to establish a line of authority from such party A more aggressive approach would involve accepting applications signed by a person at the level of section manager kacho or section chief kakaricho but this is right on the line and we would prefer Enron to do so only if there is some history of dealings with the company or other evidence to back up an apparent authority argument Smaller Companies For other companies the approach would be as set out in above Perhaps your credit control procedures could be used to set a benchmark for dividing between small and large companies Likely Response of Target Companies Your marketing experts will be in a better position than us to form a view but taking into account Japanese commercial practice we do not believe any company is likely to be offended if Enron responds along the above lines to an application signed by a person who does not meet the above suggested approach particularly taking into account that the approach is not inconsistent with the correspondence and application form the companies have been sent and no applications have yet been approved Regards Paul DavisHideo Ohta Baker

background information as you consider these questions be advised that counterparties must sign a written Password Application which provides that the counterparty intends to be bound by agreements entered into by clicking in the appropriate spaces on the website Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have I can be reached either by email at or by telephone at Have relevant regulators in your jurisdiction made any statements regarding marketing of or dealing in any of the following types of products through the internet or other electronic systems Commodity transactions relating to oil gas electricity or other energy commodities whether derivative transactions cash settled or physically settled Financial derivatives ie interest rate foreign exchange or credit derivatives Weather derivatives If so please could you provide us with a brief summary Our research has revealed no statements of regulators in Japan in connection with the marketing or dealing in the above types of products through the internet or other electronic systems from publicly available source We will let you know if we find any previous or future statements Do any specific laws or regulations exist in your jurisdiction which would prevent or in any way impact upon marketing or trading of any of the products set out in question above through the internet In answering this question please address issues relating to contractual formation and enforceability of contracts entered into via the internet In particular if a transaction entered into via the internet is enforceable under US or UK law and the transactions contain a choice of such law will such transactions including the choice of law be enforceable in Japan We do not have any specific laws or regulations which would marketing or trading of any of the products set out in question above through the internet Under Japanese law formation of any contract does not require any formality Japanese law generally does not require any formalities for offers or acceptances to be valid as such There is no Statute of Frauds and parties may make most types of contracts orally If there is enough evidence establishing that the offeree agreed to the terms offered an offeror may rely on it In most simple sales contracts for consumer goods for example it would be easy to prove that the customer agreed to pay x yen for product Y The Sellers electronic records showing that the customer clicked on the icon to buy product Y should be enough in this context In more complicated contracts the structure of the sellers Web pages should be carefully designed Having no court decisions we have no definite answer to the question of enforceability of shrinkwrap agreements in Japan However the legal implications of the Webwrap the online version of shrinkwrap may be somewhat different from shrinkwraps eg licenses for software sold over the counter Under a typical shrinkwrap license in the real world for example the customer cannot break the wrapper until after the customer purchases the product However in an online environment a customer has a choice to click on an AccepttoBuy icon before the customer purchases the product Further with a carefully compiled sequence of screens or pages which would in effect be able to let the customer read the terms and conditions before rushing to click on the icon it would be easier to prove that the customer read the terms and conditions than in a typical shrinkwrap license situation Unlike shrinkwrap in the real world the seller may obtain an electronic record showing that the customer clicked on the icon Given these differences the result possibly may be more favorable to sellers online than to those using shrinkwrap licenses If a transaction entered into via the internet is enforceable under US or UK law and the transactions contain a choice of such law such transactions including the choice of law will be enforceable in Japan If the answer to either of question or is yes please indicate whether the impact of any relevant statements laws or regulations will differ depending upon whether a the relevant internet site is maintained in your jurisdiction or elsewhere or b the party effecting the marketingtrading through the internet is locally licensed NA Please confirm that by marketing to or trading with counterparts in your jurisdiction via the internet local relevant regulatory bodieslocal laws or regulations will not consider the party maintaining the relevant website to have established a physical establishmentbranch in your jurisdiction We do not have any clear cut answer to this since we have no relevant laws regulations or court cases So long as the party maintains the relevant website with a computer server located outside Japan the likelihood of Japanese regulatory bodies to consider that the party maintaining such website established a physical establishmentbranch in Japan is

John Forwarded by John ViveritoCorpEnron on AM Anne AKERNETcom AM To cc PaulTYO akerNetcom Jeremy AKERNETcom Shinji AKERNETcom Toshio AKERNETcom Subject RE ENRON Request for Further Advice Dear John In relation to your specific questions our answers are as follows We confirm that there are no regulatory approvals required to trade Japanese weather derivatives whether or not the Enron counterparty is or is not incorporated or resident of Japan No except that trading weather derivatives online would make it more difficult for Enron to ascertain the suitability of the counterparty see gambling issue below as online transactions would probably allow very limited due diligence opportunities Enron will need to pay close attention to ensure that weather derivative products are not considered gambling activities As discussed in our memorandum of January all derivative transactions may potentially constitute gambling transactions If the transaction does constitute gambling Enron may be exposed to criminal sanctions if the activity is conducted in Japan and the contract may be declared void by a court and thus be unenforceable Under Article of the Criminal Code there is a defense to any possible criminal action if the transaction is entered into for legitimate purposes To determine whether the parties have a legitimate business purpose a court would need to look at all relevant facts and circumstances including the nature of the derivative contract entered into and the underlying business of the counterparties There are four possible combinations of parties to these contracts Case Enron Non JapanJapanese Resident Case Enron JapanJapanese Resident Case Enron JapanNon Japanese Resident Case Enron Non JapanNon Japanese Resident In both cases and Enron needs to ensure that the Japanese counterparty has a legitimate business purpose to confirm that the transaction does not fall within Article and of the Criminal Code which would render the contract unenforceable In cases and the need to comply with the law is also to ensure that Enron Japan and its officers do not unwittingly commit criminal offences under the Criminal Code In cases and Enron would need to ensure that the counterparty is permitted to enter into the transaction with Enron or Enron Japan without breaching the law or regulation that might apply to derivatives in that country Although we are not able to state conclusively that Enron will have no risk in entering into weather derivatives in Japan we consider that this risk will be reduced if a Enron entered into these transactions from offshore b Enron Japan is not involved in the marketing of these transactions in any way c Enron obtains the representations below where the counterparties are Japanese residents Please answer the following questions if you are a Japanese entity To ensure that this transaction does not fall within Article or of the Japanese Criminal Code please confirm that a you have read and fully understand the terms of the proposed transaction b you are entering into this transaction to hedge weather related risk that arises in the ordinary course of your business If your answers are affirmative for both a and b above Enron will rely on these representations and regard your company as having a legitimate business purpose to enter into this transaction as permitted under Article of the Criminal Code As we mentioned above while obtaining these representations could reduce the risk of Enron from contracting with inappropriate parties it obviously would not catch inappropriate counterparties that knowingly answer the questions falsely Therefore to the extent possible Enron should also conduct its own due diligence with respect to the counterparty to confirm the suitability of the transaction and to confirm that the counterparty has a legitimate business purpose in entering into the transaction We confirm that there should be no transaction tax applicable to weather derivatives We confirmed with MITI that they are setting up a committee to draw up new regulations for derivative transactions for industrial commodities not for weather but they envisage that such regulations will not be ready for another year Regards PADAH in consultation with JDPSTTS Original Message From mailto mailto Sent Tuesday June AM To PaulTYO akerNetcom Anne akernetcom Cc Subject ENRON Request for Further Advice PaulAnne The scheduled date for the launch of EOL weather trading in Australia is June rd We plan to trade Tokyo and Osaka in addition to Australian cities Therefore we need to have resolved all legal issues prior to this date Below we provide some background information and a basic operational description of Enron Online for your review We have also raised questions relating to this matter and look forward to your prompt response As similar questions have been asked and answered previously we would hope to receive your responses by the end of this week Background As you know Enron Corp has developed an online trading system using the internet for a number of physical products and financial derivatives which it or its subsidiaries trade This system is called Enron Online A preview of the system is available on the internet at wwwenrononlinecom One category of product traded through EnronOnline is weather derivatives Although there are differing types of weather derivatives they all have a floating price linked to meteorological readings eg temperature precipitation Enron proposes to offer weather derivatives linked to meteorological readings for Tokyo and Osaka and potentially for other Japanese and foreign cities to counterparties resident in Japan Initially the Enron contracting entity will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Corp that is incorporated in a country other than Japan and that has no presence in Japan Later the Enron contracting entity may be a Japanese resident corporation eg Enron Japan Corp In your advice dated January you generally indicated that there would be no legal impediment to Enron trading OTC weather derivatives in Japan We would ask that you expand on that advice Operation of EnronOnline EnronOnline allows counterparties to may make on line offers to Enron in respect of one of the products listed on the screen Enron may accept this offer through an on line response thereby forming a contract A potential counterparty wishing to trade through EnronOnline contacts Enron and fills out a registration form Enron will make its credit assessment on the counterparty If accepted the counterparty is required to sign a password agreement and is issued a password The first time a counterparty logs onto the system with its approved password it will be required to agree to an electronic trading Agreement ETA by clicking the I Agree Box after scrolling thought the ETA For each traded product there will be available online a set of contract terms known as General Terms and Conditions GTC The GTC is supplemented by a product description A draft product description for a weather derivative for a Japanese city is enclosed A sample GTC for an Australian weather derivative is also provided The GTCs for a Japanese city weather derivative would be similar but would reference Japanese weather stations A counterparty transacts through EnronOnline by clicking and submitting an online offer to Enron The offer may or may not be accepted by Enron The counterparty will receive notification that either the trade was successful or that their offer was not accepted The ETA specifies that acceptance occurs when the Enron message hits the server Would you please advise on the following points Please reconfirm your previous advice that there are no regulatory approvals required to trade Japanese weather derivatives where the Enron counterparty is resident in Japan Would you please consider both the circumstance i where the Enron contracting party to the weather derivative is neither incorporated nor resident in Japan and ii where the Enron contracting party to the weather derivative is incorporated or resident in Japan Do any of your conclusions in your previous advice that OTC weather derivatives can be offered legally in Japan whether based on weather readings for Japanese locations or foreign locations need to be modified if the OTC weather derivatives can be traded via Enron Online Any impact the legislation regulating gambling may have on these products Please reconfirm that there would not be any transaction taxes applying to weather derivatives Any other material legal issues that you advise are applicable to these types of products We are also providing below for your review a sample swap product description and our General Terms and Conditions for Australia heating degree day swaps Best regards John See attached file HDD Swap Osaka docSee attached file GTC HDD Aust doc

Weather and Oil Derivatives Alan Jeremy has requested that I forward this on to you as he had experienced a bounce back problem with your address Forwarded by John ViveritoCorpEnron on AM Jeremy AKERNETcom AM To cc Subject FW Weather and Oil Derivatives Resending Original Message From Pitts Jeremy Sent Thursday July PM To Cc Davis Paul Eguchi Naoaki Toyohara Shinji nicholaso Subject FW Weather and Oil Derivatives John I refer to our telephone conversation this afternoon regarding our advice copy below and confirm the matters discussed as follows We note your conversation with Terry Tanaka of IBJ in which he commented that it was his understanding that the FSA had given informal approval for banks to conduct weather derivative transactions This gives banks who engage in weather derivative transactions and their counterparties a possible additional argument that the transaction are being conducted in accordance with law for the purposes of the defense in Article of the Criminal Code This does not change our advice with respect to transactions between Enron Japan and nonbank counterparties However if Enron Japan were to enter into a weather derivative with a bank Enron Japan would be able to rely on the tacit approval given by the FSA to the bank but only to the extent to which the bank would be willing to represent and warrant to Enron Japan that the bank was authorised to enter into the transaction under Japanese laws and regulations We note your comment regarding the possibility that Enron Japan would enter into backtoback transaction with an offshore Enron affiliate and thus transfer all risk in relation to the weather derivative transactions outside Japan As mentioned in our advice one of the factors that will suggest that Enron Japan is engaged in a legitimate business activity will be the fact that Enron Japan manages the risk under the transactions that it enters into and does not take purely speculative positions Entering into backtoback transactions is one way in which Enron Japan may manage risk However there are also other risk management techniques such as hedging in local markets to the extent possible or hedging in offshore markets Insofar as these different risk management techniques are all effective methods of risk management we do not believe that any one method of risk management is necessarily preferable to another We have checked the home page for the Japanese Financial Law Board and confirm that it does not contain any information directly relevant to weather derivatives The home page does contain discussion of the application of the Criminal Law to financial derivatives generally but simply notes that the parties to a financial derivative that is not specifically authorised by law cannot rely on the act in accordance with law defense under Article of the Criminal Law You have asked us whether we would be able to change our risk assessment from relatively low to extremely low We are most reluctant to change our view Our difficulty is that the risk of possible action by the regulators or by the police is extremely difficult to predict and it is therefore necessary for us to take a slightly cautious approach We do note that similar concerns about gambling were raised when swaps were first introduced in Japan in the s and again when new derivatives products such as oil derivatives and equity derivatives were introduced in the s However as far as we are aware no prosecutions have ever been commenced in Japan alleging that swap or derivative transaction constitute gambling In our advice we identified a number of factors that tend to raise or lower the risk of possible action We would like to emphasise that if Enron Japan does commence weather derivative trading in Japan Enron Japan should clearly add specific representations regarding the legitimate business issue in its contract documentation establish clear internal policies regarding counterparty selection and risk management possibly in the form of a board resolution only transact business with a authorised financial institutions see above or b large sophisticated counterparties with a legitimate business purpose and transact business in an appropriate manner These points are explained in further detail in the attached advice We hope this helps to clarify the risks Please let us know if you need additional

Timothy Justin McBride Jane Cc Niesler Stefan Aronowitz Alan Keogh Alison Subject RE Enron Japan EOL Yen denominated WTI swap Jane happy to work through this with you In essence there are steps Firstly there is approving the GTCs and the product description As Justin said this done by the relevant lawyer for the jurisdiction or more particularly the Enron counterparty If the decision is to use US law the counterparty would be ENA In this case an EWS lawyer in Houston would give the signoff to both the GTCs and the product description The two are handled together Conversely if Japanese law is chosen then the Enron counterparty that would do an OTC trade for that product in Japan would be the counterparty That I assume would be EJ Which choice of law and counterparty to use It has been the practice to follow the currency For example in understand ENA offers Japanese and Australian weather in USD There is also a final legal signoff given by Mark Taylor This is generally a formality as Mark would be primarily concerned that relevant lawyer has given their OK Secondly each counterparty needs to be approved to trade the product This is done by the lawyer responsible for the product ie the one that approved the GTCs as well as the lawyer where the company is incorporatedresident Hence I would assume you would be approving Japanese counterparties irrespective of whether EJ or ENA is the counterparty Give me call Original Message From Timothy Justin Sent Wednesday October PM To McBride Jane Cc Niesler Stefan Minns David Aronowitz Alan Keogh Alison Subject RE

is ENA same as for the US WTI Swap The FX hedging will be done by people here in Tokyo who act as agents for ENA Thats nothing new they already do that Fair question remaining is what is the rational for the product for ENA and why are we involved in the product development First of all we are looking for the easiest and most practical solution ENA is interested because it extends the reach of an exiting product and provides additional deal flow through their books No EJ books as touched in this transactions The rational for EJ is purely marketing relate We underline our commitment to the market and proof ourselves as competitive and innovative suppliers of financial products for the Japanese Market It is supporting our overall market penetration effort The issue that it is not Enron Japan entering into the contract is secondary as the Japanese market is looking at Enron as a group Possible customer concerns about contracting with a foreign company is something we dont see as material The customer group we are targeting are international active companies that are used to dealings with nonJapanese counterparties In addition the credit rating of ENA is far better the EJs from a Japanese point of view I hope this helps to clarify some things Please feel free to call me if I left anything out or if you need some additional information Thank you Regards StN

<21785684.1075859998025.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,alan.aronowitz@enron.com,2000-05-19 04:45:00,Enron Online Counterparty Authority Forwarded by Alan AronowitzHOUECT on AM PaulTYO akerNetcom AM To cc Hideo AKERNETcom NicholasO Subject Enron Online Counterparty Authority In view of the importance of this issue it is desirable to deal with it in detail The Issue The essential issue we are focussing on is that set out in my email of May ie the need to avoid the possibility of a counterparty being able to claim that the transaction is not binding because a it was outside the companys business purposes or b execution of the application was not authorized This issue is not unique to Japan There is no question as to any specific Japanese laws impacting on the trading of any of the products through the internet including issues as to contractual enforceability of contracts entered into via the internet on which we advised on March A copy of that advice is attached to the bottom of this email Neither is there any question if the above issue is resolved of the Electronic Trading Agreement and General Terms and Conditions forming part of the contract We understand Mark Taylor to be concerned on this aspect Enrons Practice re EOL Our understanding is that Potential customers have been sent the password application under cover of a letter from Joseph Hirl inviting them to complete the application Neither the letter nor the application form indicate who is expected to sign the form Completed applications are reviewed by Enron primarily from a credit standpoint but also we understand from Mark Taylor to quickly confirm the authority of the signer by eg in the case of a US counterparty checking if the signatory shows the title director alongside his name If satisfied Enron then signs the acceptance part of the application and issues a password Four applications had been received regarding Japan as of am today and none has yet been approved Business Purposes Article of the Civil Code provides that a juristic person has rights and obligations in accordance with law and the business purposes specified in its constituent documents Where a corporation enters into a contract outside its business purposes the contract is prima facie void However if the counterparty did not know that the contract was beyond the power of the corporation and was not negligent in failing to know such fact the contract will be enforced under Article of the Civil Code The most prudent practice would be for Enron to obtain a copy of the counterpartys business purposes certified by the Legal Affairs Bureau or by a representative director and form a view on whether the proposed transaction falls within those purposes However since Japanese companies business purposes after listing a limited number of specific purposes generally include a final item along the lines of all incidental or ancillary business it is common for companies to not make this inquiry except in the most major contracts With respect to statutory corporations however care is required because often their business purposes are in fact limited Accordingly a rule of thumb solution would be if the counterparty name does not contain Kabushiki Kaisha or Yugen Gaisha at the end of the name to make further inquiries Authority to Bind the Company The Law The position in Japan is similar to that in a number of other countries in the sense that a Deemed Authority The law provides for a form of execution which if followed entitles a party to presume that the company is bound In Japan this involves the execution of a contract by the companys representative director This corresponds to the presumption concerning the affixing of the company seal in some states of the US and in the UK and the execution of the contract by directors in Australia It is possible for the powers of the representative director to be restricted by law or the constituent documents of the corporation Article of the Civil Code but if the counterparty did not know of such restriction the contract is still binding on the company b Apparent Authority In common with other countries Japan has a concept of apparent authority Article of the Commercial Code provides A company shall be liable to a bona fide third party for any act done by a director invested with any title such as president vice president executive director or managing director from which it may be assumed that he has authority to represent the company even in cases where the person has no power of representation Articles and of the Commercial Code extend the same concept to general managers so shihainin It is generally considered that Article then applies the concept to an employee who has been entrusted with certain types of matters or specific matters Accordingly in addition to persons having the titles listed in Article above the general view is that persons having titles such as general manager and division manager bucho will be deemed to have the authority to represent the company for normal transactions within the particular areas of the companys business for which they are responsible It is also likely that section managers kacho or section chiefs kakaricho have power to bind the company to a certain extent in areas for which they are responsible e Holding Out Even if an employee of the company is acting outside his actual authority if the company has held the employee out as having authority the company will be bound by hisher action Practical Considerations In formulating an approach for Enron to take on the basis of the above law the following factors are relevant a Practice regarding Representative Director Seal It is common for a counterparty to seek to take the advantage of the presumption referred to in a above by requiring the representative directors corporate seal to be affixed and if contract is in English for him to sign or to insist on tracing the chain of authority of the signatory up to the representative director eg by power of attorney for major or unusual transactions b Size of Transaction The question is what transactions fall into the major or unusual category Unfortunately the cases on this do not allow a clear line to be drawn As in many other countries the answer depends on factors such as those noted in c d and e below which vary company by company Accordingly where the contract involves or could involve a considerable ongoing exposure by the company Japanese corporations would not be surprised to be asked for the signatory to be at a certain level or for written confirmation of the signatorys authority to be obtained from a person at such level c Size of Company While it would be prudent and normal to insist upon the representative directors seal being affixed to a contract of the present type in the case of a smaller company it would not be normal practice to so insist in the case of a major company such as a bank or major trading company counterparty in which companies lower level employees are presumed to have greater authority d Business Department of Signatory The counterparty is more likely to be bound under the apparent authority doctrine if the signatory is in and carries a title which refers to the relevant business department eg energy than if he is not e Degree of Exposure To the extent that the online products to be made available are likely to expose the counterparty to considerable liability the possibility of a counterparty in the future disclaiming liability should not be discounted and would warrant a reasonably conservative approach f Recent History However even when faced with considerable losses during the recent economic crisis Japanese companies at least major companies have not generally attempted to use lack of authority as a defense presumably because of reputation considerations g Identity of Addressee The title of the person to whom the invitation letter is sent may be relevant For example if it was sent to the General Manager of the relevant department but the application came from a section chief there would be strong argument that the company had held the section chief out as having the necessary authority h Internal Procedures Since the law concerning execution by a representative director can be considered to broadly correspond to the law concerning execution under seal in some countries and by two directors in for example Australia the Japanese rules are not out of line with those of other countries Accordingly it should be necessary for Enron to take a more stringent approach to Japan in this respect than it does in marketing the same products in other countries The procedures in place for other countries may be sufficient for Japan as well although some adjustment will need to be made for Japans unique regime of company titles Conservative Approach If the online transactions are treated as a major or unusual transaction for the counterparty under common practice Enron would require The application to be executed under the registered seal of and counter signed by a representative director or by a person who is able to produce documentation showing a line of authority originating with a representative director A certified copy of the seal register A certified copy of the register of the company issued by the Legal Affairs Bureau to confirm the business purposes and the identity of the representative director Less Conservative Approach Major Companies For major Japanese trading companies banks insurance companies and other companies of equivalent size the following approach could be adopted which would not be out of line with market practice The application to be executed by a manager or general managerbucho of the relevant department or above or By a person able to establish a line of authority from such party A more aggressive approach would involve accepting applications signed by a person at the level of section manager kacho or section chief kakaricho but this is right on the line and we would prefer Enron to do so only if there is some history of dealings with the company or other evidence to back up an apparent authority argument Smaller Companies For other companies the approach would be as set out in above Perhaps your credit control procedures could be used to set a benchmark for dividing between small and large companies Likely Response of Target Companies Your marketing experts will be in a better position than us to form a view but taking into account Japanese commercial practice we do not believe any company is likely to be offended if Enron responds along the above lines to an application signed by a person who does not meet the above suggested approach particularly taking into account that the approach is not inconsistent with the correspondence and application form the companies have been sent and no applications have yet been approved Regards Paul DavisHideo Ohta Baker

you regarding the use of our internet trading website with customers in Japan Below is a list of initial questions regarding which we would be grateful for the benefit of your advice For your background information as you consider these questions be advised that counterparties must sign a written Password Application which provides that the counterparty intends to be bound by agreements entered into by clicking in the appropriate spaces on the website Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have I can be reached either by email at or by telephone at Have relevant regulators in your jurisdiction made any statements regarding marketing of or dealing in any of the following types of products through the internet or other electronic systems Commodity transactions relating to oil gas electricity or other energy commodities whether derivative transactions cash settled or physically settled Financial derivatives ie interest rate foreign exchange or credit derivatives Weather derivatives If so please could you provide us with a brief summary Our research has revealed no statements of regulators in Japan in connection with the marketing or dealing in the above types of products through the internet or other electronic systems from publicly available source We will let you know if we find any previous or future statements Do any specific laws or regulations exist in your jurisdiction which would prevent or in any way impact upon marketing or trading of any of the products set out in question above through the internet In answering this question please address issues relating to contractual formation and enforceability of contracts entered into via the internet In particular if a transaction entered into via the internet is enforceable under US or UK law and the transactions contain a choice of such law will such transactions including the choice of law be enforceable in Japan We do not have any specific laws or regulations which would marketing or trading of any of the products set out in question above through the internet Under Japanese law formation of any contract does not require any formality Japanese law generally does not require any formalities for offers or acceptances to be valid as such There is no Statute of Frauds and parties may make most types of contracts orally If there is enough evidence establishing that the offeree agreed to the terms offered an offeror may rely on it In most simple sales contracts for consumer goods for example it would be easy to prove that the customer agreed to pay x yen for product Y The Sellers electronic records showing that the customer clicked on the icon to buy product Y should be enough in this context In more complicated contracts the structure of the sellers Web pages should be carefully designed Having no court decisions we have no definite answer to the question of enforceability of shrinkwrap agreements in Japan However the legal implications of the Webwrap the online version of shrinkwrap may be somewhat different from shrinkwraps eg licenses for software sold over the counter Under a typical shrinkwrap license in the real world for example the customer cannot break the wrapper until after the customer purchases the product However in an online environment a customer has a choice to click on an AccepttoBuy icon before the customer purchases the product Further with a carefully compiled sequence of screens or pages which would in effect be able to let the customer read the terms and conditions before rushing to click on the icon it would be easier to prove that the customer read the terms and conditions than in a typical shrinkwrap license situation Unlike shrinkwrap in the real world the seller may obtain an electronic record showing that the customer clicked on the icon Given these differences the result possibly may be more favorable to sellers online than to those using shrinkwrap licenses If a transaction entered into via the internet is enforceable under US or UK law and the transactions contain a choice of such law such transactions including the choice of law will be enforceable in Japan If the answer to either of question or is yes please indicate whether the impact of any relevant statements laws or regulations will differ depending upon whether a the relevant internet site is maintained in your jurisdiction or elsewhere or b the party effecting the marketingtrading through the internet is locally licensed NA Please confirm that by marketing to or trading with counterparts in your jurisdiction via the internet local relevant regulatory bodieslocal laws or regulations will not consider the party maintaining the relevant website to have established a physical establishmentbranch in your jurisdiction We do not have any clear cut answer to this since we have no relevant laws regulations or court cases So long as the party maintains the relevant website with a computer server located outside Japan the likelihood of Japanese regulatory bodies to consider that the party maintaining such website established a physical establishmentbranch in Japan is

John Forwarded by John ViveritoCorpEnron on AM Anne AKERNETcom AM To cc PaulTYO akerNetcom Jeremy AKERNETcom Shinji AKERNETcom Toshio AKERNETcom Subject RE ENRON Request for Further Advice Dear John In relation to your specific questions our answers are as follows We confirm that there are no regulatory approvals required to trade Japanese weather derivatives whether or not the Enron counterparty is or is not incorporated or resident of Japan No except that trading weather derivatives online would make it more difficult for Enron to ascertain the suitability of the counterparty see gambling issue below as online transactions would probably allow very limited due diligence opportunities Enron will need to pay close attention to ensure that weather derivative products are not considered gambling activities As discussed in our memorandum of January all derivative transactions may potentially constitute gambling transactions If the transaction does constitute gambling Enron may be exposed to criminal sanctions if the activity is conducted in Japan and the contract may be declared void by a court and thus be unenforceable Under Article of the Criminal Code there is a defense to any possible criminal action if the transaction is entered into for legitimate purposes To determine whether the parties have a legitimate business purpose a court would need to look at all relevant facts and circumstances including the nature of the derivative contract entered into and the underlying business of the counterparties There are four possible combinations of parties to these contracts Case Enron Non JapanJapanese Resident Case Enron JapanJapanese Resident Case Enron JapanNon Japanese Resident Case Enron Non JapanNon Japanese Resident In both cases and Enron needs to ensure that the Japanese counterparty has a legitimate business purpose to confirm that the transaction does not fall within Article and of the Criminal Code which would render the contract unenforceable In cases and the need to comply with the law is also to ensure that Enron Japan and its officers do not unwittingly commit criminal offences under the Criminal Code In cases and Enron would need to ensure that the counterparty is permitted to enter into the transaction with Enron or Enron Japan without breaching the law or regulation that might apply to derivatives in that country Although we are not able to state conclusively that Enron will have no risk in entering into weather derivatives in Japan we consider that this risk will be reduced if a Enron entered into these transactions from offshore b Enron Japan is not involved in the marketing of these transactions in any way c Enron obtains the representations below where the counterparties are Japanese residents Please answer the following questions if you are a Japanese entity To ensure that this transaction does not fall within Article or of the Japanese Criminal Code please confirm that a you have read and fully understand the terms of the proposed transaction b you are entering into this transaction to hedge weather related risk that arises in the ordinary course of your business If your answers are affirmative for both a and b above Enron will rely on these representations and regard your company as having a legitimate business purpose to enter into this transaction as permitted under Article of the Criminal Code As we mentioned above while obtaining these representations could reduce the risk of Enron from contracting with inappropriate parties it obviously would not catch inappropriate counterparties that knowingly answer the questions falsely Therefore to the extent possible Enron should also conduct its own due diligence with respect to the counterparty to confirm the suitability of the transaction and to confirm that the counterparty has a legitimate business purpose in entering into the transaction We confirm that there should be no transaction tax applicable to weather derivatives We confirmed with MITI that they are setting up a committee to draw up new regulations for derivative transactions for industrial commodities not for weather but they envisage that such regulations will not be ready for another year Regards PADAH in consultation with JDPSTTS Original Message From mailto mailto Sent Tuesday June AM To PaulTYO akerNetcom Anne akernetcom Cc Subject ENRON Request for Further Advice PaulAnne The scheduled date for the launch of EOL weather trading in Australia is June rd We plan to trade Tokyo and Osaka in addition to Australian cities Therefore we need to have resolved all legal issues prior to this date Below we provide some background information and a basic operational description of Enron Online for your review We have also raised questions relating to this matter and look forward to your prompt response As similar questions have been asked and answered previously we would hope to receive your responses by the end of this week Background As you know Enron Corp has developed an online trading system using the internet for a number of physical products and financial derivatives which it or its subsidiaries trade This system is called Enron Online A preview of the system is available on the internet at wwwenrononlinecom One category of product traded through EnronOnline is weather derivatives Although there are differing types of weather derivatives they all have a floating price linked to meteorological readings eg temperature precipitation Enron proposes to offer weather derivatives linked to meteorological readings for Tokyo and Osaka and potentially for other Japanese and foreign cities to counterparties resident in Japan Initially the Enron contracting entity will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Corp that is incorporated in a country other than Japan and that has no presence in Japan Later the Enron contracting entity may be a Japanese resident corporation eg Enron Japan Corp In your advice dated January you generally indicated that there would be no legal impediment to Enron trading OTC weather derivatives in Japan We would ask that you expand on that advice Operation of EnronOnline EnronOnline allows counterparties to may make on line offers to Enron in respect of one of the products listed on the screen Enron may accept this offer through an on line response thereby forming a contract A potential counterparty wishing to trade through EnronOnline contacts Enron and fills out a registration form Enron will make its credit assessment on the counterparty If accepted the counterparty is required to sign a password agreement and is issued a password The first time a counterparty logs onto the system with its approved password it will be required to agree to an electronic trading Agreement ETA by clicking the I Agree Box after scrolling thought the ETA For each traded product there will be available online a set of contract terms known as General Terms and Conditions GTC The GTC is supplemented by a product description A draft product description for a weather derivative for a Japanese city is enclosed A sample GTC for an Australian weather derivative is also provided The GTCs for a Japanese city weather derivative would be similar but would reference Japanese weather stations A counterparty transacts through EnronOnline by clicking and submitting an online offer to Enron The offer may or may not be accepted by Enron The counterparty will receive notification that either the trade was successful or that their offer was not accepted The ETA specifies that acceptance occurs when the Enron message hits the server Would you please advise on the following points Please reconfirm your previous advice that there are no regulatory approvals required to trade Japanese weather derivatives where the Enron counterparty is resident in Japan Would you please consider both the circumstance i where the Enron contracting party to the weather derivative is neither incorporated nor resident in Japan and ii where the Enron contracting party to the weather derivative is incorporated or resident in Japan Do any of your conclusions in your previous advice that OTC weather derivatives can be offered legally in Japan whether based on weather readings for Japanese locations or foreign locations need to be modified if the OTC weather derivatives can be traded via Enron Online Any impact the legislation regulating gambling may have on these products Please reconfirm that there would not be any transaction taxes applying to weather derivatives Any other material legal issues that you advise are applicable to these types of products We are also providing below for your review a sample swap product description and our General Terms and Conditions for Australia heating degree day swaps Best regards John See attached file HDD Swap Osaka docSee attached file GTC HDD Aust doc

Weather and Oil Derivatives Alan Jeremy has requested that I forward this on to you as he had experienced a bounce back problem with your address Forwarded by John ViveritoCorpEnron on AM Jeremy AKERNETcom AM To cc Subject FW Weather and Oil Derivatives Resending Original Message From Pitts Jeremy Sent Thursday July PM To Cc Davis Paul Eguchi Naoaki Toyohara Shinji nicholaso Subject FW Weather and Oil Derivatives John I refer to our telephone conversation this afternoon regarding our advice copy below and confirm the matters discussed as follows We note your conversation with Terry Tanaka of IBJ in which he commented that it was his understanding that the FSA had given informal approval for banks to conduct weather derivative transactions This gives banks who engage in weather derivative transactions and their counterparties a possible additional argument that the transaction are being conducted in accordance with law for the purposes of the defense in Article of the Criminal Code This does not change our advice with respect to transactions between Enron Japan and nonbank counterparties However if Enron Japan were to enter into a weather derivative with a bank Enron Japan would be able to rely on the tacit approval given by the FSA to the bank but only to the extent to which the bank would be willing to represent and warrant to Enron Japan that the bank was authorised to enter into the transaction under Japanese laws and regulations We note your comment regarding the possibility that Enron Japan would enter into backtoback transaction with an offshore Enron affiliate and thus transfer all risk in relation to the weather derivative transactions outside Japan As mentioned in our advice one of the factors that will suggest that Enron Japan is engaged in a legitimate business activity will be the fact that Enron Japan manages the risk under the transactions that it enters into and does not take purely speculative positions Entering into backtoback transactions is one way in which Enron Japan may manage risk However there are also other risk management techniques such as hedging in local markets to the extent possible or hedging in offshore markets Insofar as these different risk management techniques are all effective methods of risk management we do not believe that any one method of risk management is necessarily preferable to another We have checked the home page for the Japanese Financial Law Board and confirm that it does not contain any information directly relevant to weather derivatives The home page does contain discussion of the application of the Criminal Law to financial derivatives generally but simply notes that the parties to a financial derivative that is not specifically authorised by law cannot rely on the act in accordance with law defense under Article of the Criminal Law You have asked us whether we would be able to change our risk assessment from relatively low to extremely low We are most reluctant to change our view Our difficulty is that the risk of possible action by the regulators or by the police is extremely difficult to predict and it is therefore necessary for us to take a slightly cautious approach We do note that similar concerns about gambling were raised when swaps were first introduced in Japan in the s and again when new derivatives products such as oil derivatives and equity derivatives were introduced in the s However as far as we are aware no prosecutions have ever been commenced in Japan alleging that swap or derivative transaction constitute gambling In our advice we identified a number of factors that tend to raise or lower the risk of possible action We would like to emphasise that if Enron Japan does commence weather derivative trading in Japan Enron Japan should clearly add specific representations regarding the legitimate business issue in its contract documentation establish clear internal policies regarding counterparty selection and risk management possibly in the form of a board resolution only transact business with a authorised financial institutions see above or b large sophisticated counterparties with a legitimate business purpose and transact business in an appropriate manner These points are explained in further detail in the attached advice We hope this helps to clarify the risks Please let us know if you need additional
