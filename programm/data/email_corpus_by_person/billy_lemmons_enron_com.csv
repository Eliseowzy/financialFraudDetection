<30064053.1075860844222.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,billy.lemmons@enron.com,2002-01-10 12:10:39,Accounting Article From Fortune MagazineKen Beth suggested that I forward a copy of this article to you Ive highligh ted some relevant points for your convenience Regards Billy ACCOUNTING IN CRISIS One Plus One Makes What The accounting profession had a credibility problem before Enron Now it ha s a crisis FORTUNE Monday January Where were the auditors People ask that question after every corporate col lapse and lately theyve been asking it with disturbing frequency At Wast e Management Sunbeam Rite Aid Xerox and Lucent major accounting firms either missed or ignored serious problems The number of public companies t hat have corrected or restated earnings since has doubled to acco rding to a study by Big Five accounting firm Arthur Andersen Now followin g the stunning bankruptcy of Andersens own client Enron that questionwh ere were the auditorshas become a deafening refrain I believe that the re is a crisis of confidence in my profession Andersen CEO Joseph Berardi no told a congressional committee investigating Enrons collapse in midDec ember Real change will be required to regain the public trust The full story of the Enron debacleand what Andersen did or did not do in its auditwill take months to emerge In the meantime no one disagrees w ith Berardinos diagnosis that theres a crisis in accountingeven if his sudden emphasis on industrywide reform springs from a desire to deflect att ention from Andersens own culpability But the kind of real change requi red is a matter of substantial debate The government gave the franchise of auditing public companies financial statements to the accounting industry after the stock market crash In the decades since the accountants h ave adroitly avoided significant government regulation by arguing that they can police themselves Now postEnron theyre doing it again The Big Fi ve CEOs issued a rare joint statement outlining how they intend to strength en financial reporting and auditing standards Selfregulation is right fo r investors the profession and the financial markets the release conclu des But is it Accountings main selfregulatory body the Public Oversight Boa rd is a monument to the professions failures The POB was created in the late s when Congress held hearings on a string of audit failures at pu blic companies that hadmuch like the recent rashshaken confidence in th e major auditing firms The POB which has no enforcement power investigat es alleged audit failures and oversees a triennial review process in which the major accounting firms examine one anothers procedures And yet proble ms persist arguably they have grown more acute Is accounting selfregul ation working On the face of it it is not says Representative John Ding ell the powerful Michigan Democrat who has long sparred with the accountin g profession In their defense the auditors note that current accounting methods many o f which were designed years ago are difficult to apply to todays compl ex financial transactions And there is no way they insist to prevent sop histicated fraud The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants A ICPA the industrys professional association points out that accountants examine the books of more than public companies every year they ar e accused of errors in just of those audits But oh the price of thos e few failures Lynn Turner former chief accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission estimates that investors have lost more than bill ion because of financial fraud and the accompanying earnings restatements s ince Perhaps the most glaring example of selfregulations deficiency has been a ccountants unwillingness to deal with conflicts of interest Over the year s the major auditing firms have transformed themselves into professional services companies that derive an increasing portion of revenues and profi ts from consulting selling computer systems advising clients on tax shelt ers and evaluating their business strategies In according to the SE C half of the Big Fives revenues came from consulting fees vs in Auditing meanwhile has become a commodity Firms have even been accused o f using it as a loss leader a way of getting in the door at a company to s ell moreprofitable consulting contracts Audit work is a marvelous market ing tool says Lou Lowenstein a professor emeritus of finance and law at Columbia University You are already there doing the audit You say their internal controls are no good Well who are they going to call to fix it But this requires a firm to work for the public auditing and management consulting You cannot serve them both says former SEC commissioner Be vis Longstreth This conflict may have played a role at Enron Andersen received millio n in auditing fees from Enron last year Thats money Andersen was paid bot h as Enrons outside auditor certifying its financial statements and as i ts internal auditor making sure Enron had the right systems to keep its bo oks and working to detect fraud and irregularities This double duty alone raised a serious potential for conflict Besides million in accounting fees Andersen was paid million for consulting services If you are au diting your own creations it is very difficult to criticize them says Ro bert Willens a Lehman Brothers tax expert who disapproves of the accountin g professions recent move into selling aggressive tax shelters Andersen h as not revealed the details of its work on Enrons highly controversial off balancesheet transactions but the accounting firms have never believed c onsulting fees compromise their objectivity They have militantly refused to ever acknowledge the possibility of a problem Longstreth says
