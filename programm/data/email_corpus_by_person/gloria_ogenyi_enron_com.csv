Electric Suppliers ARES in IL is not uniform accross utility lines The creditworthiness standards vary by utility and also depends on the billing option chosen by the ARES However the single billing option SBO has creditworthiness standards that have general application because SBO certification is an ICC responsibility with uniform qualification criteria All the applicable credit requirements set out below are cumulative Enrons Credit Rating of BBBSP and BaaMoodys General Creditworthiness Under Section Subchapter C of the IL Admin Code as part of the qualification as an ARES all applicants must fulfill a general license bond requirement In IL EES is licensed to serve nonresidential retail customers with maximum electrical demand of MW or more To secure this license EES was required to post bond in the sum of The bond is valid for one year and conditioned on the full and faithful performance of all duties and obligations of EES as an ARES If the license bond is cancelled modified expires or is drawn upon EES must execute and maintain an additional or replacement bond such that the cumulative value of all outstanding bonds never falls below the required amount The EES license bond expired on June EES must issue another bond or provide an extension certificate up to June and annually thereafter Registration Under SubPart B EES is registered as an ARES under Subpart B of Section expedited certification for ARES that seek to serve only nonresidential customers with maximum demand of MW or more Subpart B has additional financial qualifications To maintain certification under Subpart B EES needs to maintain at least one of the following longterm credit ratings of BBB SP Baa Moodys BBB Duff Phelps or BBB Fitch or Maintain a borrowing agreement with an affiliate that has the above ratings The amount of credit available to EES under the borrowing agreement shall not be less than or of EES revenue for last fiscal year or Show that the EES obligations arising from electric energy and fuel purchases are covered by an unconditional guaranty bond or LC in an amount not less than or of EESs revenue for the last fiscal year or Certify that it will reimburse its IL retail customers for additional costs they incur to acquire electricity upon EES contractual failure This certification shall be covered by an unconditional guaranty bond or LC in the sum of times the maximum MW EES estimates to schedule in the next months multiplied by the average of the highest daily market prices of energy traded in the previous year or EES maintains a line of credit or revolving credit agreement in the amount of or of its revenue for last fiscal year from an A rated financial insitution or EES earns points on the financial ratios pretax interest coverage funds from operations interest coverage funds from operations to total debt and total debt to total capital Enrons Credit Rating and downgrades To satisfy the Subpart B requirements EES provided an unconditional guaranty from Enron Corp Given our current credit rating of BBBSP and Baa Moodys that guaranty is still valid However if Enron Corp is downgraded below the required credit level EES will have to provide any of the above alternative forms of creditworthiness IMPACT The above creditworthiness requirements relate to EESs ability to do business in IL Failure to maintain the foregoing standards will result in the loss of our IL license This will trigger contractual default for all our customers both financial and physical Please note that EES is out of compliance on the license bond and needs to post a new bond ASAP Single Bill Option Pursuant to Section Subpart F any ARES that chooses the Single Bill Option SBO must demonstrate ability to establish and maintain sufficient financial resources to satisfy the obligation to remit to the utilities monies that it collects under the SBO tariff To satisfy these additional creditworthiness standards EES must either Post and maintain bond in the amount of of its estimated obligation to the utility under the SBO Provide an irrevocable LC issued by a financial insitution with an A rating Maintain at least the following long term credit ratings a BBB SP Baa Moodys BBBduff Phelps BBB Fitch Provide an unconditional guaranty from an affiliate with the above ratings Enrons Current Rating EES is currently working to obtain ICC certification under the SBO tariff This means that EES must maintain the minimum long term credit ratings set out in or provide a guaranty from an affiliate with those ratings EES is not rated However given Enron Corps current credit rating of BBB and Baa a parental guaranty will suffice to meet the qualification under the SBO tariff Further Downgrades If Enron Corp is down graded below the required minimum ratings EES will need to provide a bond or LC or forego the SBO option IMPACT EES will continue to do business in IL as an ARES Thus EES will maintain its ability to service its customers both financial and physical However there could be substantial impact on EES customer service and operation particularly our ability to meet customer expectations and timely collect outstanding receivables Instrument Fund Charges akin to stranded costs Under the Illinois tariffs EES can choose annually one of two remittance timelines for IFC charges To remit IFC charges within days of receipt of customer payment or more frequently as required or within days of utility invoicing whether or not customer has paid If EES chooses the nd option it has to provide a security deposit equal to one months estimated IFC charges for all EES customers Deposit amount will be determined based on monthly KW customer usage and the IFC charge per KWH If the expected IFC charge for EES customers is or more this deposit amount will be revised monthly If EES chooses the nd option remittance of bills within days of utility invoicing we will be required to provide the deposit IMPACT This deposit requirement for the IFC charges relate to Illinois Power customers and not to ComEd For ComEd IFC charges nets out to zero and customers do not pay those charges EES is currently doing business as a billing agent in IPs service territory and is required to execute the Billing Agent Agreement which will implement the deposit requirement If EES chooses the first remittance option it will avoid the deposit requirement However this may have operational implications

Manhattan Bank today I am working with ConEd to agree on the applicable interest rate We can dispute ConEds data However I do not think this is a good time to do so because Unlike our calc the ConEd calc is based on the summer peak for the customers even when we factor that in I think that the volumes used in ConEds calc may still be too high but I intend to raise that issue at a later time The number of customers EES has contracted as at today unknown to ConEd and who will soon be enrolled with ConEd makes any argument unecessary Per the UBP rules if the volumes increase by ConEd is entitled to request an increase in the deposit amount Whenever they come back to us for more we will dispute their data and hopefully reduce the dollar amount andor at least buy ourselves more time More time is important as the EDI rules in NY will be complete first quater of next year At that time EES will change its billing option the security requirement will be unecessary and our deposit will be returned to us with interest I had negotiated with ConEd to suspend their billing cycle on our customers to give us time to work through this issue This has revenue implications for them Disputing their numbers will appear as a gimmick would generate bad will and will frustrate our future negotiationsrelationship with them I will provide an update later in the day Thanks Gloria Original Message From Gahn Scott Sent Monday November PM To Dietrich Janet Cc Ogenyi Gloria Bertasi Ron Subject RE Enrons Security Review I was told Bradford would release the million tomorrow I dont know what form I will find out Also regarding the usage I do not know the answer Our numbers are systematically scraped directly off the ConEd website by account I do not believe that any errors in this process could be consistently that low We pull actual data and site profile normalizes and calendarizes the data Jeff probably is using the normalized info ConEd is likely using a design peak to maximize the deposit and ensure that even if we fail under design conditions they have sufficient security We could potentially use our data their web data to dispute their own calculation Gloria can we dispute ConEds calc based on the data we took from the website How tight is the approved deposit provision Original Message From Dietrich Janet Sent Monday November PM To Gahn Scott Subject FW

on mass market customers with October start dates Looking at this set of customers ConEd has estimated significantly higher consumption for our customers than Origination has calculated This is shown below with the credit requirement calculated for days during the summer peak ConEd Calculation Calculation using Origination Values of accounts Peak Month MWh Peak Month Electric Day Nat Gas Day Total Day Difference Extrapolating these figures out for all mass market customers signed as of today with start dates between October and January the credit requirements would be as follows ConEd Calculation Extrapolated Calculation using Origination Values of accounts Peak Month MWh Peak Month Electric Day Nat Gas Day Total Day Difference Using either calculation shows that are security requirement will very quickly be much higher than the million currently being requested These values do not include additional mass market origination or the switching of existing financially served customers to physical service The conversion of existing financially served customers to physical service could easily add another million RAC needs to be aware that the million will be a temporary
