threat of blackouts the agency charged with overseeing the states power grid has come under increasing attack and federal regulators are poised to order sweeping changes in its governing board Ever since the Legislature created the California Independent System Operator four years ago critics have lambasted the agency saying it is dominated by the power industry and does not have ratepayers interests at heart Criticism of the ISO has grown as electricity reserves have dwindled and as the agency has initiated statewide energy alerts that have required hundreds of businesses to cut back their operations There are people on the ISO governing board who have a direct financial interest in the policies they set said Severin Borenstein a professor of business administration and public policy at the University of California at Berkeley and the director of the University of California Energy Institute Today the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is expected to issue a ruling that would remake the ISOs member board which includes representatives of three investorowned utilities four municipal utilities and two power generators From its hightech headquarters in Folsom reminiscent of NASAs mission control center the nonprofit ISO essentially acts as traffic cop for a power system that serves threequarters of the state Responsible for assuring a stable source of electricity the ISO has the authority to initiate emergency alerts and if need be rolling blackouts if supplies drop to near nothing By law the utilities and power generators must comply with ISO directives Last month federal regulators proposed an order calling for the ISO board to be replaced by seven independent members The new board would be selected by the current ISO before it was replaced Striving to restore order to the states turbulent electricity market the commission said an overhaul of the ISOs management would be an important first step toward easing the burden on consumers CREATURE OF DEREGULATION The ISO was created as part of the Legislatures deregulation of the states electricity market in The Legislature set up the ISO as a stakeholder board with designated seats for participants in the energy marketplace The theory was that those involved in the industry would be best able to guarantee reliable electricity for the Bay Area and the other ISOserved areas in California It was designed to be as neutral as possible said Michael Shames executive director of the Utility Consumers Action Network in San Diego If anything its turned out to be far too cozy with power generators State Sen Debra Bowen DMarina Del Rey said lawmakers were told that the deregulation blueprint they adopted in was a better alternative than more sweeping proposals being considered by the state Public Utilities Commission Lawmakers were reassured at the time that the deregulation plan which was intended to lower power prices by increasing competition had the full backing of utilities including Pacific Gas and Electric Co power generators and large users of electricity You have to remember that the political climate was different then said Bowen the author of a pending measure replacing the existing ISO board with one appointed by the governor and independent of the industry We had a Republican Assembly and a Republican governor Pete Wilson with his appointees on the PUC with a free market point of view Bowen said The bargaining position of the ratepayers and consumer groups was not strong PRIVATE COMPANIES LEVERAGE Doug Heller assistant director of the Foundation for Consumer and Taxpayer Rights said the Legislature set up the ISO the way it did because it and the regulators were so transfixed with the idea of the free market that they ignored the tremendous leverage they were handing over to the private energy companies He added Because the ISO has a mandate to keep the lights on and procure power when the utilities are short this energy industrydominated board has used its mandate as justification for gouging consumers If the prices currently being paid for electricity are sustained over time Heller said ratepayers would have an average monthly bill of and a small business paying a monthly electricity tab could see its bill jump to based on current energy market prices Federal regulators almost certainly will not let this happen They are expected to announce measures today intended to keep wholesale prices stable and thus protect users from sharp increases in their power bills The ISO is currently chaired by Jan SmutnyJones executive director of the Independent Energy Producers Association a trade association whose members generate about megawatts of power in California The boards members include representatives from two power generators Dynegy Inc and an affiliate of Florida Power and Light the states three investorowned utilities PGE Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric

the best interests of consumers POWER PRICING GATEKEEPER Mike Florio an attorney for The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco and a member of the ISO board said that although the composition of the ISO board is only one element of the California energy crisis the ISO is at the crux of the matter because it establishes and administers the state market rules that determine how pricing gets done The ISO has been a law to itself with its attitude being We keep the lights on we know whats going on and others should butt out he said If federal regulators order an overhaul of the ISO today that may just be the beginning of the battle Florio said If the changes they order dont offer customers relief from the extremely high prices TURN and others will call for the state to buy the transmission system from the utilities as a means of wrestling back control from FERC For his part the consumer networks Shames is proposing a merger of the ISO and the California Power Exchange which coordinates

has been unfair There are larger market forces at work here Clearly we have a tight supply situation compared to demand which means there will always be upward pressure on prices Barkovich said We
