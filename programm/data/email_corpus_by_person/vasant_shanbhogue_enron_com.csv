discussed with Ben about the issues below and here are some thoughts This is NOT a complete approach but only a starting point for discussion The main task is to build a pricing system for many names This has two components How to price a single name How to price a liquid single name How to price an illiquid single name How to efficiently apply the methodology to multiple names The approach I would take for is a Define a small set of liquid names b Apply each of the different models we have say the six models Ben has mentioned below to these names c Include market prices if any for these names d Sit with traders get traders intuition on where each liquid name should price and note this on the spectrum of prices obtained in b and c e Try to determine attributes of the names that may explain the dispersion of the trader prices across the models f Quantify these attributes if possible g Try a different set of liquid names and repeat the process and see if the decisions in the last round still make sense The approach for may be a Define a small set of illiquid names b Apply each of the different models we have to these names c Sit with traders get traders intuition on where each illiquid name should price and note this on the spectrum of prices obtained in b d Try to determine attributes of the names that may explain the dispersion of the trader prices across the models e Check if these are similar to the attributes identified for liquid names f Define a master set of liquid names g Look for relationships by analyzing crosssection of data between attributes or prices of illiquid names to those of liquid names Once a mapping has been defined for an illiquid name to a set of liquid names and their attributes then this mapping can be entered into a table and the pricing can be automated for all names IN THEORY The success will depend on the success of the roundtable sessions for the approaches for and Building a new fundamental model is always a worthwhile task but we can get going with the above approaches immediately in parallel with developing any new models that we may build New models can be added to the suite of existing models I do not believe there will ever be a single model that will answer all questions for all names but rather we can refine the mappings and relative choices among models over time which would mean continuing roundtable sessions with traders Limited data makes calibration very hard so I would continually ask the question What do we calibrate throughout the discussions for and and this may help guide us to new models Vasant Benjamin Parsons AM To ECT London Credit Trading cc Vince J CT Vasant CT Amitava NRON Steven CT Grant CT Dale CT David A WallRisk CT Jitendra J CT Oliver CT Subject Pricing credit on thousands of names All Our challenge for the next few months is to build an automated system to provide differential pricing on thousands of credits by yearend Most of these credits will be illiquid in terms of market price information making the challenge harder and the end result more important in terms of competitive pricing advantage What we need is an overall strategy for how we plan to achieve this from the quantitative perspective Currently we have several models for credit pricing either in use or under development FMC Model default probability approach Using Bloombergs Fair Market par yield Curves probabilities are generated from the riskyLIBOR then defaultbankruptcy swap prices computed using expectation methodology FMC Model credit spread approach Using the FMCs then directly taking the LIBOR credit spread at each tenor adjusting for basis and compounding differences Bond Model FMC approach Taking the FMCs as benchmark curves the model regresses the input bonds specific to a name on the two best fitting benchmarks The result is a zero yield curve with the same shape as the FMCs but with the level tweaked for the specific issuer Prices are then generated using both spread and probability approaches Under testing Bond Model spline approach Taking only the bonds specific to an issuer the model fits an exponential cubic spline to the zerocoupon price curve then builds a zero yield curve from this Under testing Market Prices For certain liquid names or sectorsratings CDS market prices are used then recovery and event discount used to get bankruptcy swap prices KMV Using Expected Default Frequencies EDFs from the KMV model and database we will build a model to price default swaps making appropriate risk adjustments KMV is being installed now so model will be worked on next Each of these models returns a price credit default and bankruptcy and the accuracy of the price depends on many factors liquidity and regulatory differences between bond and CDS markets recovery assumptions risk premia capital charges etc The aim will be to accurately price as many liquid names as possible based upon these models then use these prices alongside other financial information as the backbone to a full automated pricing system Our inputs to the proposed pricing system for a specific name are model and market prices for all issuers alongside namespecific soft data from credit reports and financial statements If the credit is liquid enough a price will be generated from their own information only Otherwise the credit will be mapped onto a subset of liquid credits with financial information and historical price movements providing the mapping and weights The model price will then be periodically adjusted to align itself with market or trader prices and this adjustment will feed back into the weighting and mapping composition In loose terms we could think of the system price for an illiquid credit as being a weighted average of liquid market prices bonds equities default swaps where the weightings are calibrated using credit analysis financial ratios etc The key steps to implementing such a system will be Establishing what exactly we want to predict is it a price a rating a probability or a score We will need a clean market history to calibrate to which we only really have for ratings We will then need to develop a mapping from ratingscore to price Getting and cleaning the historical financial and credit data required to calibrate the model Building the mechanics of the model ie the calibration methodology Neural netsfuzzy logic seem the obvious candidates but which exact methods and software packages to use Determining an automated methodology for mapping names with limited information into the model Getting the true market price in order to feed back an error At present such a price exists for very few credits Allocating resources to the development McKinsey claimed such a system would take manmonths to develop Further ideas or comments are requested as we need to develop our strategy asap The model description above is fairly vague as we dont yet have the knowledge needed to fill in the specific details Further help will be

discussed with Ben about the issues below and here are some thoughts This is NOT a complete approach but only a starting point for discussion The main task is to build a pricing system for many names This has two components How to price a single name How to price a liquid single name How to price an illiquid single name How to efficiently apply the methodology to multiple names The approach I would take for is a Define a small set of liquid names b Apply each of the different models we have say the six models Ben has mentioned below to these names c Include market prices if any for these names d Sit with traders get traders intuition on where each liquid name should price and note this on the spectrum of prices obtained in b and c e Try to determine attributes of the names that may explain the dispersion of the trader prices across the models f Quantify these attributes if possible g Try a different set of liquid names and repeat the process and see if the decisions in the last round still make sense The approach for may be a Define a small set of illiquid names b Apply each of the different models we have to these names c Sit with traders get traders intuition on where each illiquid name should price and note this on the spectrum of prices obtained in b d Try to determine attributes of the names that may explain the dispersion of the trader prices across the models e Check if these are similar to the attributes identified for liquid names f Define a master set of liquid names g Look for relationships by analyzing crosssection of data between attributes or prices of illiquid names to those of liquid names Once a mapping has been defined for an illiquid name to a set of liquid names and their attributes then this mapping can be entered into a table and the pricing can be automated for all names IN THEORY The success will depend on the success of the roundtable sessions for the approaches for and Building a new fundamental model is always a worthwhile task but we can get going with the above approaches immediately in parallel with developing any new models that we may build New models can be added to the suite of existing models I do not believe there will ever be a single model that will answer all questions for all names but rather we can refine the mappings and relative choices among models over time which would mean continuing roundtable sessions with traders Limited data makes calibration very hard so I would continually ask the question What do we calibrate throughout the discussions for and and this may help guide us to new models Vasant Benjamin Parsons AM To ECT London Credit Trading cc Vince J CT Vasant CT Amitava NRON Steven CT Grant CT Dale CT David A WallRisk CT Jitendra J CT Oliver CT Subject Pricing credit on thousands of names All Our challenge for the next few months is to build an automated system to provide differential pricing on thousands of credits by yearend Most of these credits will be illiquid in terms of market price information making the challenge harder and the end result more important in terms of competitive pricing advantage What we need is an overall strategy for how we plan to achieve this from the quantitative perspective Currently we have several models for credit pricing either in use or under development FMC Model default probability approach Using Bloombergs Fair Market par yield Curves probabilities are generated from the riskyLIBOR then defaultbankruptcy swap prices computed using expectation methodology FMC Model credit spread approach Using the FMCs then directly taking the LIBOR credit spread at each tenor adjusting for basis and compounding differences Bond Model FMC approach Taking the FMCs as benchmark curves the model regresses the input bonds specific to a name on the two best fitting benchmarks The result is a zero yield curve with the same shape as the FMCs but with the level tweaked for the specific issuer Prices are then generated using both spread and probability approaches Under testing Bond Model spline approach Taking only the bonds specific to an issuer the model fits an exponential cubic spline to the zerocoupon price curve then builds a zero yield curve from this Under testing Market Prices For certain liquid names or sectorsratings CDS market prices are used then recovery and event discount used to get bankruptcy swap prices KMV Using Expected Default Frequencies EDFs from the KMV model and database we will build a model to price default swaps making appropriate risk adjustments KMV is being installed now so model will be worked on next Each of these models returns a price credit default and bankruptcy and the accuracy of the price depends on many factors liquidity and regulatory differences between bond and CDS markets recovery assumptions risk premia capital charges etc The aim will be to accurately price as many liquid names as possible based upon these models then use these prices alongside other financial information as the backbone to a full automated pricing system Our inputs to the proposed pricing system for a specific name are model and market prices for all issuers alongside namespecific soft data from credit reports and financial statements If the credit is liquid enough a price will be generated from their own information only Otherwise the credit will be mapped onto a subset of liquid credits with financial information and historical price movements providing the mapping and weights The model price will then be periodically adjusted to align itself with market or trader prices and this adjustment will feed back into the weighting and mapping composition In loose terms we could think of the system price for an illiquid credit as being a weighted average of liquid market prices bonds equities default swaps where the weightings are calibrated using credit analysis financial ratios etc The key steps to implementing such a system will be Establishing what exactly we want to predict is it a price a rating a probability or a score We will need a clean market history to calibrate to which we only really have for ratings We will then need to develop a mapping from ratingscore to price Getting and cleaning the historical financial and credit data required to calibrate the model Building the mechanics of the model ie the calibration methodology Neural netsfuzzy logic seem the obvious candidates but which exact methods and software packages to use Determining an automated methodology for mapping names with limited information into the model Getting the true market price in order to feed back an error At present such a price exists for very few credits Allocating resources to the development McKinsey claimed such a system would take manmonths to develop Further ideas or comments are requested as we need to develop our strategy asap The model description above is fairly vague as we dont yet have the knowledge needed to fill in the specific details Further help will be especially required on this if we are to continue to move at internet speed Regards Ben

discussed with Ben about the issues below and here are some thoughts This is NOT a complete approach but only a starting point for discussion The main task is to build a pricing system for many names This has two components How to price a single name How to price a liquid single name How to price an illiquid single name How to efficiently apply the methodology to multiple names The approach I would take for is a Define a small set of liquid names b Apply each of the different models we have say the six models Ben has mentioned below to these names c Include market prices if any for these names d Sit with traders get traders intuition on where each liquid name should price and note this on the spectrum of prices obtained in b and c e Try to determine attributes of the names that may explain the dispersion of the trader prices across the models f Quantify these attributes if possible g Try a different set of liquid names and repeat the process and see if the decisions in the last round still make sense The approach for may be a Define a small set of illiquid names b Apply each of the different models we have to these names c Sit with traders get traders intuition on where each illiquid name should price and note this on the spectrum of prices obtained in b d Try to determine attributes of the names that may explain the dispersion of the trader prices across the models e Check if these are similar to the attributes identified for liquid names f Define a master set of liquid names g Look for relationships by analyzing crosssection of data between attributes or prices of illiquid names to those of liquid names Once a mapping has been defined for an illiquid name to a set of liquid names and their attributes then this mapping can be entered into a table and the pricing can be automated for all names IN THEORY The success will depend on the success of the roundtable sessions for the approaches for and Building a new fundamental model is always a worthwhile task but we can get going with the above approaches immediately in parallel with developing any new models that we may build New models can be added to the suite of existing models I do not believe there will ever be a single model that will answer all questions for all names but rather we can refine the mappings and relative choices among models over time which would mean continuing roundtable sessions with traders Limited data makes calibration very hard so I would continually ask the question What do we calibrate throughout the discussions for and and this may help guide us to new models Vasant Benjamin Parsons AM To ECT London Credit Trading cc Vince J CT Vasant CT Amitava NRON Steven CT Grant CT Dale CT David A WallRisk CT Jitendra J CT Oliver CT Subject Pricing credit on thousands of names All Our challenge for the next few months is to build an automated system to provide differential pricing on thousands of credits by yearend Most of these credits will be illiquid in terms of market price information making the challenge harder and the end result more important in terms of competitive pricing advantage What we need is an overall strategy for how we plan to achieve this from the quantitative perspective Currently we have several models for credit pricing either in use or under development FMC Model default probability approach Using Bloombergs Fair Market par yield Curves probabilities are generated from the riskyLIBOR then defaultbankruptcy swap prices computed using expectation methodology FMC Model credit spread approach Using the FMCs then directly taking the LIBOR credit spread at each tenor adjusting for basis and compounding differences Bond Model FMC approach Taking the FMCs as benchmark curves the model regresses the input bonds specific to a name on the two best fitting benchmarks The result is a zero yield curve with the same shape as the FMCs but with the level tweaked for the specific issuer Prices are then generated using both spread and probability approaches Under testing Bond Model spline approach Taking only the bonds specific to an issuer the model fits an exponential cubic spline to the zerocoupon price curve then builds a zero yield curve from this Under testing Market Prices For certain liquid names or sectorsratings CDS market prices are used then recovery and event discount used to get bankruptcy swap prices KMV Using Expected Default Frequencies EDFs from the KMV model and database we will build a model to price default swaps making appropriate risk adjustments KMV is being installed now so model will be worked on next Each of these models returns a price credit default and bankruptcy and the accuracy of the price depends on many factors liquidity and regulatory differences between bond and CDS markets recovery assumptions risk premia capital charges etc The aim will be to accurately price as many liquid names as possible based upon these models then use these prices alongside other financial information as the backbone to a full automated pricing system Our inputs to the proposed pricing system for a specific name are model and market prices for all issuers alongside namespecific soft data from credit reports and financial statements If the credit is liquid enough a price will be generated from their own information only Otherwise the credit will be mapped onto a subset of liquid credits with financial information and historical price movements providing the mapping and weights The model price will then be periodically adjusted to align itself with market or trader prices and this adjustment will feed back into the weighting and mapping composition In loose terms we could think of the system price for an illiquid credit as being a weighted average of liquid market prices bonds equities default swaps where the weightings are calibrated using credit analysis financial ratios etc The key steps to implementing such a system will be Establishing what exactly we want to predict is it a price a rating a probability or a score We will need a clean market history to calibrate to which we only really have for ratings We will then need to develop a mapping from ratingscore to price Getting and cleaning the historical financial and credit data required to calibrate the model Building the mechanics of the model ie the calibration methodology Neural netsfuzzy logic seem the obvious candidates but which exact methods and software packages to use Determining an automated methodology for mapping names with limited information into the model Getting the true market price in order to feed back an error At present such a price exists for very few credits Allocating resources to the development McKinsey claimed such a system would take manmonths to develop Further ideas or comments are requested as we need to develop our strategy asap The model description above is fairly vague as we dont yet have the knowledge needed to fill in the specific details Further help will be especially required on this if we are to continue to move at internet speed Regards Ben
