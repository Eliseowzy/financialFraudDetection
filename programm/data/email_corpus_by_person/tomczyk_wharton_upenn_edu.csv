Technological Innovation CoChaired by Mark Myers and Sid Winter The Wharton School Knowledge may be the most important source of competitive advantage for a firm but capturing the potential gains is a continuing challenge Firms are filing patent applications at an unprecedented rate while struggling to keep up with accelerating development cycles and shrinking lead times Emerging technologies changing legal interpretations and growing administrative burdens on the patent system are creating a new and unfamiliar context for the management of intellectual property In response firms are rethinking their strategies for realizing the rewards from their innovation The Mack Center at the Wharton School has assembled thought leaders from leading companies government and academia to address issues such as the following What strategies are firms using to create protect and use their knowledge assets Do mechanisms such as secrecy control of complementary assetsand lead time play an important role as a substitute or supplement for patent protection How is the US patent and trademark office responding to the remarkable growth in patenting Should they be protecting not only inventions but also ways of distributing and selling them How should they deal with applications for patents on sequences of the human genome In a world where technology is developed and employed globally what are the prospects for international harmonization of intellectual property laws and practice Are the patent office and the courts up to the task of creating and effectively enforcing clear intellectual property rights for emerging technologies AGENDA Wharton Impact Conference Updated Location Yasuda Auditorium nd Fl Steinberg Conference Center th Street The Wharton School

Insead The High Technology Acquisitions Research Project jointly organized by The Wharton School and INSEAD has been conducting research to identify the determinants of success in high technology acquisitions Our research includes developing a portfolio of indepth case studies building a unique acquisitions database and hosting semiannual workshops for industry practitioners These tools allow us to perform rigorous analysis to determine success factors in high technology mergers and acquisitions Firms that have participated in our research process so far include Cisco Cable Wireless Hewlett Packard Lucent Symantec and Xerox Timely Insights for Company DecisionMakers One of the most unique aspects of this project is the reporting of research in progress to give industry decision makers access to the insights from our research as they are revealed To test and refine our findings we host an ongoing series of workshops that bring together practitioners from some of the most experienced acquirers in the high tech arena and academicians whose research interests converge on the role of acquisitions in technologybased competition Our next workshop on December will be the third in the series Prior events were held in December at Wharton and June at INSEAD in Paris France Reports of these events are available on the ET website Objectives Our objective is to build a community of practice around the complex phenomenon of managing acquisitions in hightech environments A major goal is to identify and validate new best practices and winning strategies in mergers and acquisitions Most of our focus involves issues of value and concern to large multinational corporations We are particularly interested in how mergers and acquisitions are pursued as part of a companys
