<4773951.1075854592515.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,brettlawler@hotmail.com,2000-11-10 17:31:00,ReGuys I just typed a small novel below about JRTC and thought I send it out its answerin a question a friend asked about how the simulated comabt stuff works and has an example at the end Excellent question about what makes the bad guys run away during an exercise The Army paid Grumman a shitload of cash to make laser tag stuff for us Its called MILES and if you ever see a picture of an army unit on an exercise you will see that the soldier is wearing a harness over his normal Load Bearing VestLBV the harness has four receptors on the front and four on the back in addition there is a doughnut shaped belt of receptors that goes on the kevlar helmet Vehicles also have receptors mounted to them every thing from HMMVs to the tanks to the helicopters Our weapons systems have transmitters on them itll look like a little box mounted on the front of the weapon the box has a pressure sensor so every time the gas from a blank round firing hits it it fires a laser beam down range If the laser beam strikes a receptor the guys harness will emit this God awful high pitched whine that lets everyone know he is downdead ATs and Dragons bazooka like antiarmor weapons are simulated by what are called Vipers same weight same size except it fires a big powerful laser that will be strong enough to activate an enemy tanks MILES The armor vehicles MILES game is pretty neat There are two types of kills on a tank a Mobility kill and a critical kill If the Viper or other weapon doesnt have a solid hit on a sensor in a critical area a mobility kill will result which means the explosion just blew the trak of the vehicle but its radios and weapons still work A critical kill means the vehicle and all inside are dead dead dead If a tank gets a critical kill the MILES gear will actually shut the vehicle down and kill its radios The guy will just be drivin along and then he will hear over his radio a females voice say Critical kill and the only thing that will work on the vehicle after that are the brakes So direct fire weapons systems are pretty easy to replicate target wears a receptor shooter fires a transmitter Indirect fire weapons though are a bit more difficult whereas before the shooter always had eyes on the target and thus could directly place a laser beam on target artillery often shoots targets that no one directly see There are two ways around this At the National Training Center NTC where they do all the armor against armor training they have the MILES system You have an armored motorized rifle companyMRC sitting at point X I have an observer Km away who with optics can see your MRC my FO calls in a fire mission based on the target description a Bn will be fired rounds fired in volleys as there are only tubes in a Bn The ObserverControllers OCs kinna like referees will monitor the Call for Fire from the observer to the tubes and the OCs will take the fire mission data and plug it into their big MILES computer which will take into account any errors the observer may have made and any errors the gun batteries instead of Artillery Companies we have artillery Batteries guns may have made When the gun batteries tell the observer that they have pulled the trigger the OCs who are always listening will pull the Miles trigger What happens then is a satellite hovering above NTC will blast down a laser with a footprint large enough to simulate the area artillery rounds would take up it will do this times to simulate all volleys landing Any vehicles caught in this footprint will be assessed as damageddestroyed At JRTC where the Light Fighters ie no armor assets organic to them learn to play we dont get no stinkin satellites What we do there is when a fire mission is called to the guns the OCs will monitor it and enter the data in their computers the computer will take into account any errors made by the FO and the guns and will spit out a grid coordinate this grid will be passed to a Fire Marker which is a crazy guy with a four wheeler a GPS and a god gun a hand held transmitter that fires a universal kill laser ie men to tanks and aircraft I say crazy because these guys are civilians who get bonuses based on how fast they can get to the target grid Their average response time is minutes which is about minutes longer then it would be in real life so its not as cool as MILES So youll see these guys haulin ass through the woods on theses wheelers tryin to get to their target grids on time and God help you if he pulls up into your position and no you cant haul ass if you see one comin your way cause your OC who is walkin with your unit will zap you on the spot if he sees you runnin from a fire marker Ill close this bad boy with a little story Oh shit there I was all good war stories gotta start with this We had started the first phase of the rotation Entry into the Box the box is the JRTC engagement area at hrs the previous night and had fought our way Km SW hand railing a road identifying minewire obstacles and eliminating the Observers over watching them It was the next morning and we were dead fkin tired and had finally reached our main objective which was a road intersection in a semi wooded area just to the south of the main air field that the rest of the Brigade Combat Team BCT was gonna use to lift in the rest of the support assets There was a BIG triangular berm area just off the road basically the dirt walls were ft tall yard long We moved out of the tree line and occupied it cause at the time it looked like it would be super easy to defend which was good cause we needed to hole up for a bit and catch out breath plus our COLT team Combat Observer Laser Team mounted on a HMMVV FOs with Laser designators to guide Copperheads and Hellfire missiles basically vehicle killers and Bradley support vehicles had just discovered BOOM a mine field at the intersection this was happening as we were occupying the berm So we detached a small element to go evac the Casualties from the vehicles the SG and a couple of joes min later the SG and his team were nailed by antipersonnel mines surrounding the mine field while trying to aid the wounded inside the vehicles At the same time a Civilian truck with two redneck lookin females showed up like they were fixin to drive right on through the road so we had to send a few guys out of the berm to stopsearch the vehicle at JRTC they employ real civilian actors to portray Civilians on the Battlefield or COBs because in real life there are COBs and we gotta know how to deal with them and accomplish our mission at the same time So we got the SG and a couple of guys down at the obstacle a COB truck right outside the berm when the CO decides to go check on the obstacle By this time we had been in this BIG berm read TRP Target Reference Point or somethin the enemy probably has his guns laid on just waitin for some morons to park their sad tired asses in there long enough to get a mission off for like minutes when sure enough off in the distance we hear this vrrrrrm getting steadily louder and louder We were so tired we were basically denying the obvious theres no way hes headed for us please God dont let him be headed for us basically you had an entire company in a yard radius which is about the same size as a mm mortar impact area So there we are listening to this wheeler get closer and closer and basically all we can do is start to get all our gear back on and get ready to HAUL ass Of course we cant legally run until the first round impacts So this guys comes tearin down the road shoots off the road and pulls SMACK DAB into the middle of the berm jumps off his bike and starts UNLOADING with air burst Arty Simulators basically a little flare gun that pops sticks of TNT up ft into the air to simulate incoming rounds Note these are only used when the grid is so accurate that using ground burst simulators would pose a hazard to troops Basically what this told us is that we were setup the baddies were just waitin for us cause the rounds were accurate on the first volley and needed no adjustment So yeah this joker is poppin off airburst TNT after the first burst I yelled INCOMING and got up and hauled ASS Luckily I was close to the exit and started movin out FAST because between airbursts the Fire Marker was just sweeping left to right with the God gun as guys were scramblin tryin to get out I got out of the Berm and just kept runnin a good M because Im Artillery and I know what the burst radius is on these suckers I looked back and saw the Infantry guys stoppin at a tree just outside the berm Since there were no visible Real life ground bursts they thought they were safe As I was yellin at them to keep movin an OC came out and just whacked em all guys As the rest of the people who made it out were still runnin about of us and we were all now M North of the berm scattered all over hell Little bunches of guys runnin to trees and collapsing Just as the last of the living made it out of the berm we hear this vehicle come tearing outta the trees about M to our left and from lower ground Sure enough its a DsHKA read Dishka basically a Cal on a friggin truck bed so there this fucker is lighting us up from the left and enemy mm Mortar fire blastin our tail ends Since the DsHKA was a high payoff TGT I was immediately on my net sreamin Holy Shit we got a DsHKA here Grid HELLLLPPPP At the same time we got Infantry guys tryin to suppress the joker on the back of truck with their Ms while trying to get two Vipers together we were told by the OCs that the only thing theyve ever seen kill vehicle here with was two Vipers fired at the same section of the vehicle at exactly the same time but the Viper teams were scattered all over hell All this happened within about seconds the CO had seen us come tearin outta the Berm and heard the DsHKA light up so he was on his net talkin to the Kiowas scout helicopters but theyre armed So were pinned down trying to suppress this truck while dodgin Cal laser blasts since its just MILES a blade of grass can deflect the laser FINALLY the Kiowas show up actually they got there respectably fast only minutes chase the bastard down and smash him with their hellfires With of guys dead and one DsHKA down we were ready to get a little rest and then start huntin the mortar and other DsHKAs that were supposed to be in the area Basically we got the shit ambushed outta us it was really a pretty nice setup on the enemies part We were stupid enough to setup in an obvious terrain feature one that was no doubt on the Enemys target lists So when the mortar rounds started droppin and we started pouring out of the berm there the cal was waitin to mow down whoever didnt get killed by the Arty Anyways thats one of my JRTC stories and subsequently one of the largest emails Ive ever written So Im gonna forward it to the rest of the guys Welp its about time to go get my drink on talk to yall later LAWLEROUT Hell I thought Consultants had a lotta acronymsHey when you guys go through these exercises what makes someone high tail out of an attack stanceie I know youre not firing live rounds at one another so how do they simulate real life scenarios Also in concerns with deer hunting Ill be headed down to

hit on a sensor in a critical area a mobility kill will result which means the explosion just blew the trak of the vehicle but its radios and weapons still work A critical kill means the vehicle and all inside are dead dead dead If a tank gets a critical kill the MILES gear will actually shut the vehicle down and kill its radios The guy will just be drivin along and then he will hear over his radio a females voice say Critical kill and the only thing that will work on the vehicle after that are the brakes So direct fire weapons systems are pretty easy to replicate target wears a receptor shooter fires a transmitter Indirect fire weapons though are a bit more difficult whereas before the shooter always had eyes on the target and thus could directly place a laser beam on target artillery often shoots targets that no one directly see There are two ways around this At the National Training Center NTC where they do all the armor against armor training they have the MILES system You have an armored motorized rifle companyMRC sitting at point X I have an observer Km away who with optics can see your MRC my FO calls in a fire mission based on the target description a Bn will be fired rounds fired in volleys as there are only tubes in a Bn The ObserverControllers OCs kinna like referees will monitor the Call for Fire from the observer to the tubes and the OCs will take the fire mission data and plug it into their big MILES computer which will take into account any errors the observer may have made and any errors the gun batteries instead of Artillery Companies we have artillery Batteries guns may have made When the gun batteries tell the observer that they have pulled the trigger the OCs who are always listening will pull the Miles trigger What happens then is a satellite hovering above NTC will blast down a laser with a footprint large enough to simulate the area artillery rounds would take up it will do this times to simulate all volleys landing Any vehicles caught in this footprint will be assessed as damageddestroyed At JRTC where the Light Fighters ie no armor assets organic to them learn to play we dont get no stinkin satellites What we do there is when a fire mission is called to the guns the OCs will monitor it and enter the data in their computers the computer will take into account any errors made by the FO and the guns and will spit out a grid coordinate this grid will be passed to a Fire Marker which is a crazy guy with a four wheeler a GPS and a god gun a hand held transmitter that fires a universal kill laser ie men to tanks and aircraft I say crazy because these guys are civilians who get bonuses based on how fast they can get to the target grid Their average response time is minutes which is about minutes longer then it would be in real life so its not as cool as MILES So youll see these guys haulin ass through the woods on theses wheelers tryin to get to their target grids on time and God help you if he pulls up into your position and no you cant haul ass if you see one comin your way cause your OC who is walkin with your unit will zap you on the spot if he sees you runnin from a fire marker Ill close this bad boy with a little story Oh shit there I was all good war stories gotta start with this We had started the first phase of the rotation Entry into the Box the box is the JRTC engagement area at hrs the previous night and had fought our way Km SW hand railing a road identifying minewire obstacles and eliminating the Observers over watching them It was the next morning and we were dead fkin tired and had finally reached our main objective which was a road intersection in a semi wooded area just to the south of the main air field that the rest of the Brigade Combat Team BCT was gonna use to lift in the rest of the support assets There was a BIG triangular berm area just off the road basically the dirt walls were ft tall yard long We moved out of the tree line and occupied it cause at the time it looked like it would be super easy to defend which was good cause we needed to hole up for a bit and catch out breath plus our COLT team Combat Observer Laser Team mounted on a HMMVV FOs with Laser designators to guide Copperheads and Hellfire missiles basically vehicle killers and Bradley support vehicles had just discovered BOOM a mine field at the intersection this was happening as we were occupying the berm So we detached a small element to go evac the Casualties from the vehicles the SG and a couple of joes min later the SG and his team were nailed by antipersonnel mines surrounding the mine field while trying to aid the wounded inside the vehicles At the same time a Civilian truck with two redneck lookin females showed up like they were fixin to drive right on through the road so we had to send a few guys out of the berm to stopsearch the vehicle at JRTC they employ real civilian actors to portray Civilians on the Battlefield or COBs because in real life there are COBs and we gotta know how to deal with them and accomplish our mission at the same time So we got the SG and a couple of guys down at the obstacle a COB truck right outside the berm when the CO decides to go check on the obstacle By this time we had been in this BIG berm read TRP Target Reference Point or somethin the enemy probably has his guns laid on just waitin for some morons to park their sad tired asses in there long enough to get a mission off for like minutes when sure enough off in the distance we hear this vrrrrrm getting steadily louder and louder We were so tired we were basically denying the obvious theres no way hes headed for us please God dont let him be headed for us basically you had an entire company in a yard radius which is about the same size as a mm mortar impact area So there we are listening to this wheeler get closer and closer and basically all we can do is start to get all our gear back on and get ready to HAUL ass Of course we cant legally run until the first round impacts So this guys comes tearin down the road shoots off the road and pulls SMACK DAB into the middle of the berm jumps off his bike and starts UNLOADING with air burst Arty Simulators basically a little flare gun that pops sticks of TNT up ft into the air to simulate incoming rounds Note these are only used when the grid is so accurate that using ground burst simulators would pose a hazard to troops Basically what this told us is that we were setup the baddies were just waitin for us cause the rounds were accurate on the first volley and needed no adjustment So yeah this joker is poppin off airburst TNT after the first burst I yelled INCOMING and got up and hauled ASS Luckily I was close to the exit and started movin out FAST because between airbursts the Fire Marker was just sweeping left to right with the God gun as guys were scramblin tryin to get out I got out of the Berm and just kept runnin a good M because Im Artillery and I know what the burst radius is on these suckers I looked back and saw the Infantry guys stoppin at a tree just outside the berm Since there were no visible Real life ground bursts they thought they were safe As I was yellin at them to keep movin an OC came out and just whacked em all guys As the rest of the people who made it out were still runnin about of us and we were all now M North of the berm scattered all over hell Little bunches of guys runnin to trees and collapsing Just as the last of the living made it out of the berm we hear this vehicle come tearing outta the trees about M to our left and from lower ground Sure enough its a DsHKA read Dishka basically a Cal on a friggin truck bed so there this fucker is lighting us up from the left and enemy mm Mortar fire blastin our tail ends Since the DsHKA was a high payoff TGT I was immediately on my net sreamin Holy Shit we got a DsHKA here Grid HELLLLPPPP At the same time we got Infantry guys tryin to suppress the joker on the back of truck with their Ms while trying to get two Vipers together we were told by the OCs that the only thing theyve ever seen kill vehicle here with was two Vipers fired at the same section of the vehicle at exactly the same time but the Viper teams were scattered all over hell All this happened within about seconds the CO had seen us come tearin outta the Berm and heard the DsHKA light up so he was on his net talkin to the Kiowas scout helicopters but theyre armed So were pinned down trying to suppress this truck while dodgin Cal laser blasts since its just MILES a blade of grass can deflect the laser FINALLY the Kiowas show up actually they got there respectably fast only minutes chase the bastard down and smash him with their hellfires With of guys dead and one DsHKA down we were ready to get a little rest and then start huntin the mortar and other DsHKAs that were supposed to be in the area Basically we got the shit ambushed outta us it was really a pretty nice setup on the enemies part We were stupid enough to setup in an obvious terrain feature one that was no doubt on the Enemys target lists So when the mortar rounds started droppin and we started pouring out of the berm there the cal was waitin to mow down whoever didnt get killed by the Arty Anyways thats one of my JRTC stories and subsequently one of the largest emails Ive ever written So Im gonna forward it to the rest of the guys Welp its about time to go get my drink on talk to yall later LAWLEROUT Hell I thought Consultants had a lotta acronymsHey when you guys go through these exercises what makes someone high tail out of an attack stanceie I know youre not firing live rounds at one another so how do they simulate real life scenarios Also in concerns with deer hunting Ill be headed down to

asked about how the simulated comabt stuff works and has an example at the end Excellent question about what makes the bad guys run away during an exercise The Army paid Grumman a shitload of cash to make laser tag stuff for us Its called MILES and if you ever see a picture of an army unit on an exercise you will see that the soldier is wearing a harness over his normal Load Bearing VestLBV the harness has four receptors on the front and four on the back in addition there is a doughnut shaped belt of receptors that goes on the kevlar helmet Vehicles also have receptors mounted to them every thing from HMMVs to the tanks to the helicopters Our weapons systems have transmitters on them itll look like a little box mounted on the front of the weapon the box has a pressure sensor so every time the gas from a blank round firing hits it it fires a laser beam down range If the laser beam strikes a receptor the guys harness will emit this God awful high pitched whine that lets everyone know he is downdead ATs and Dragons bazooka like antiarmor weapons are simulated by what are called Vipers same weight same size except it fires a big powerful laser that will be strong enough to activate an enemy tanks MILES The armor vehicles MILES game is pretty neat There are two types of kills on a tank a Mobility kill and a critical kill If the Viper or other weapon doesnt have a solid hit on a sensor in a critical area a mobility kill will result which means the explosion just blew the trak of the vehicle but its radios and weapons still work A critical kill means the vehicle and

shooter fires a transmitter Indirect fire weapons though are a bit more difficult whereas before the shooter always had eyes on the target and thus could directly place a laser beam on target artillery often shoots targets that no one directly see There are two ways around this At the National Training Center NTC where they do all the armor against armor training they have the MILES system You have an armored motorized rifle companyMRC sitting at point X I have an observer Km away who with optics can see your MRC my FO calls in a fire mission based on the target description a Bn will be fired rounds fired in volleys as there are only tubes in a Bn The ObserverControllers OCs kinna like referees will monitor the Call for Fire from the observer to the tubes and the OCs will take the fire mission data and plug it into their big MILES computer which will take into account any errors the observer may have made and any errors the gun batteries instead of Artillery Companies we have artillery Batteries guns may have made When the gun batteries tell the observer that they have pulled the trigger the OCs who are always listening will pull the Miles trigger What happens then is a satellite hovering above NTC will blast down a laser with a footprint large enough to simulate the area artillery rounds would take up it will do this times to simulate all volleys landing Any vehicles caught in this footprint will be assessed as damageddestroyed At JRTC where the Light Fighters ie no armor assets organic to them learn to play we dont get no stinkin satellites What we do there is when a fire mission is called to the guns the OCs will monitor it and enter the data in their computers the computer will take into account any errors made by the FO and the guns and will spit out a grid coordinate this grid will be passed to a Fire Marker which is a crazy guy with a four wheeler a GPS and a god gun a hand held transmitter that fires a universal kill laser ie men to tanks and aircraft I say crazy because these guys are civilians who get bonuses based on how fast they can get to the target grid Their average response time is minutes which is about minutes longer then it would be in real life so its not as cool as MILES So youll see these guys haulin ass through the woods on theses wheelers tryin to get to their target grids on time and God help you if he pulls up into your position and no you cant haul ass if you see one comin your way cause your OC who is walkin with your unit will zap you on the spot if he sees you runnin from a fire marker Ill close this bad boy with a little story Oh shit there I was all good war stories gotta start with this We had started the first phase of the rotation Entry into the Box the box is the JRTC engagement area at hrs the previous night and had fought our way Km SW hand railing a road identifying minewire obstacles and eliminating the Observers over watching them It was the next morning and we were dead fkin tired and had finally reached our main objective which was a road intersection in a semi wooded area just to the south of the main air field that the rest of the Brigade Combat Team BCT was gonna use to lift in the rest of the support assets There was a BIG triangular berm area just off the road basically the dirt walls were ft tall yard long We moved out of the tree line and occupied it cause at the time it looked like it would be super easy to defend which was good cause we needed to hole up for a bit and catch out breath plus our COLT team Combat Observer Laser Team mounted on a HMMVV FOs with Laser designators to guide Copperheads and Hellfire missiles basically vehicle killers and Bradley support vehicles had just discovered BOOM a mine field at the intersection this was happening as we were occupying the berm So we detached a small element to go evac the Casualties from the vehicles the SG and a couple of joes min later the SG and his team were nailed by antipersonnel mines surrounding the mine field while trying to aid the wounded inside the vehicles At the same time a Civilian truck with two redneck lookin females showed up like they were fixin to drive right on through the road so we had to send a few guys out of the berm to stopsearch the vehicle at JRTC they employ real civilian actors to portray Civilians on the Battlefield or COBs because in real life there are COBs and we gotta know how to deal with them and accomplish our mission at the same time So we got the SG and a couple of guys down at the obstacle a COB truck right outside the berm when the CO decides to go check on the obstacle By this time we had been in this BIG berm read TRP Target Reference Point or somethin the enemy probably has his guns laid on just waitin for some morons to park their sad tired asses in there long enough to get a mission off for like minutes when sure enough off in the distance we hear this vrrrrrm getting steadily louder and louder We were so tired we were basically denying the obvious theres no way hes headed for us please God dont let him be headed for us basically you had an entire company in a yard radius which is about the same size as a mm mortar impact area So there we are listening to this wheeler get closer and closer and basically all we can do is start to get all our gear back on and get ready to HAUL ass Of course we cant legally run until the first round impacts So this guys comes tearin down the road shoots off the road and pulls SMACK DAB into the middle of the berm jumps off his bike and starts UNLOADING with air burst Arty Simulators basically a little flare gun that pops sticks of TNT up ft into the air to simulate incoming rounds Note these are only used when the grid is so accurate that using ground burst simulators would pose a hazard to troops Basically what this told us is that we were setup the baddies were just waitin for us cause the rounds were accurate on the first volley and needed no adjustment So yeah this joker is poppin off airburst TNT after the first burst I yelled INCOMING and got up and hauled ASS Luckily I was close to the exit and started movin out FAST because between airbursts the Fire Marker was just sweeping left to right with the God gun as guys were scramblin tryin to get out I got out of the Berm and just kept runnin a good M because Im Artillery and I know what the burst radius is on these suckers I looked back and saw the Infantry guys stoppin at a tree just outside the berm Since there were no visible Real life ground bursts they thought they were safe As I was yellin at them to keep movin an OC came out and just whacked em all guys As the rest of the people who made it out were still runnin about of us and we were all now M North of the berm scattered all over hell Little bunches of guys runnin to trees and collapsing Just as the last of the living made it out of the berm we hear this vehicle come tearing outta the trees about M to our left and from lower ground Sure enough its a DsHKA read Dishka basically a Cal on a friggin truck bed so there this fucker is lighting us up from the left and enemy mm Mortar fire blastin our tail ends Since the DsHKA was a high payoff TGT I was immediately on my net sreamin Holy Shit we got a DsHKA here Grid HELLLLPPPP At the same time we got Infantry guys tryin to suppress the joker on the back of truck with their Ms while trying to get two Vipers together we were told by the OCs that the only thing theyve ever seen kill vehicle here with was two Vipers fired at the same section of the vehicle at exactly the same time but the Viper teams were scattered all over hell All this happened within about seconds the CO had seen us come tearin outta the Berm and heard the DsHKA light up so he was on his net talkin to the Kiowas scout helicopters but theyre armed So were pinned down trying to suppress this truck while dodgin Cal laser blasts since its just MILES a blade of grass can deflect the laser FINALLY the Kiowas show up actually they got there respectably fast only minutes chase the bastard down and smash him with their hellfires With of guys dead and one DsHKA down we were ready to get a little rest and then start huntin the mortar and other DsHKAs that were supposed to be in the area Basically we got the shit ambushed outta us it was really a pretty nice setup on the enemies part We were stupid enough to setup in an obvious terrain feature one that was no doubt on the Enemys target lists So when the mortar rounds started droppin and we started pouring out of the berm there the cal was waitin to mow down whoever didnt get killed by the Arty Anyways thats one of my JRTC stories and subsequently one of the largest emails Ive ever written So Im gonna forward it to the rest of the guys Welp its about time to go get my drink on talk to yall later LAWLEROUT Hell I thought Consultants had a lotta acronymsHey when you guys go through these exercises what makes someone high tail out of an attack stanceie I know youre not firing live rounds at one another so how do they simulate real life scenarios Also in concerns with deer hunting Ill be headed down to Junction our lease to pull a trophy this weekend Ill probably freeze my ass off but Ive had my deer picked out since Sept Later Dickey The information contained in this communication is intended

<13081562.1075854681625.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,brettlawler@hotmail.com,2000-11-07 04:31:00,Im back JRTC was a helluva lot better than I thought it would be It was a month long and though at times more boring then anything I have ever experienced in my entire life I still got to get attacked by an actual HindD helicopter Soviet BRDMs suicide squads with backpacks stuffed with chemical weapons and explosives that charge your tactical operations centers TOC then detonate themselves Basically it went like this As soon as we got there we started preping for a LightHeavy Combined Arms Deliberate Attack Live Fire Exercise Basically what this came down to was we had mm and mm howitzers and mm mortars with more ammo then you will ever see in an excercise Kiowas MAs Bradleys Tow vehicles engineer platoon and a dismounted platoon Our job was to assault through a bunker complex to set up a support by fire SBF posn in order to facilitate the main efforts assault on the Battalions Bn main obj Basically what this boils down to is smash a path from start point to bunker complex smash bunker complex continue smashing path to SBF posn Once at SBF posn smash put hellacious ammounts of steel on the Bn main obj for minutes to allow a notional Bn Main effort to get up to the obj unmolested Needles to say it was awesome I will never see that many assets together using that much steel unless some bad guy screws up really really bad somewhere and we go do it for real after experiencing this there is no way in high holy hell I would ever want to be anywhere near the recieving end of this hellstorm It was my first act out of OBC with my Company and the Live Fire OC thought I did well enough to warrant recieving a Division coin As far as the actual JRTC rotation went it was pretty boring compared to the Live Fire It was four phases Entry into the Box seizing an airfieldfoothold Low Intensity Conflict LIC Attack on ShugartGordon MOUT stuff Defense The only exciting stuff came in phases and when we actually had heavy contact was especially cool cause me and my guys were personally responsible so much death and pain to enemy dismounts attempting to breach our obstacles in order to pass their main effort of armored vehicles Ts and BRDMs that the little bastards backed up reconsolidated and tried again by this time our plt defending the obstacle was wiped out But guess what my Forward Observer wasnt with the Platoon but was in an OP closer to the obstacle the bad guys smashed the platoons posn and thought it was safe to try again on breachin the obstacle We called a mass repeat on the obstacle rounds of and mm needless to say they got the hell outta there in a hurry but not without leaving a couple of smoking vehicle hulls and a mound dead dismounts As a result of destroying their breach effort we turned them back into the Brigades main Engagement Area where the Armor guys slugged it out with them for awhile Anyways JRTC was fun if you like ur people any deployment will be fun Louisianna was nice a welcome change to this Island stuff plus the terrain looked just like home In fact it was and a half hours away from your deer camp Bill I was tempted to just pack it up and take off walkin and just wait fer opening day Well this concludes my post JRTC brief any quetions Get Your Private Free Email from MSN Hotmail at Share information about yourself create your own public profile at
