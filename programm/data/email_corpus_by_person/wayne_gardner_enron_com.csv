GintyEnron nron Communications Donald LassereEnron nron Communications David MerrillENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Japan Trading Dear Sue Because of the important role of Japan in the trading business of EBS I want to make sure I understand very clearly our regulatory options For the sake of simplicity I limit the discussion below to trading of segments between Japan and the US on the grounds that the Japanese principles that apply to any other trading of international segments would be identical The discussion is further limited to the purchase of IPLCs because that is the standard form of telecom capacity available for purchase out of Japan Finally based on input from Regulatory the discussion assumes that the purchased IPLCs are divided into halfcircuits The Japan halfcircuit terminates in Japan and in the middle of the Pacific The US halfcircuit terminates in the middle of the Pacific picking up where the Japan halfcircuit terminates and in the US I Our only option from a regulatory standpoint We understand that the only option from a regulatory prespective is as follows EBS Networks YK YK purchases the Japan halfcircuits because it has an ST license and switch in Japan through which it will route ALL trades EBS Trading LP Trading purchases the US halfcircuits only Each of Trading and YK can resell their respective halfcircuits in the form of capacity under the EBS Master Services Agreement the Master to others who may be resellers or endusers II Tax consequences of structuring trades in accordance with this option At best the tax consequences of the foregoing are that half of the earnings on Japan to US trading will be subject to immediate Japan income tax with no ability to defer the cash payment of tax with Enrons US tax loss carryforward In addition there may be significant exposure to US income tax we are in the midst of quantifying this risk and evaluating potential ways around it which would incrementally increase the effective income tax rate to If instead Trading undertook all the Trading activity virtually all of the earnings of Japan to US trading would be subject to a single rate of US income tax and the payment of such tax could be deferred for a significant period of time due to Enrons large US tax loss carryforward III The following options have been ruled out by Regulatory for the following reasons Unworkable Option Trading does not acquire an ST license Trading buys US and Japan halfcircuits directly and resells them in the form of capacity under the Master to others who may be resellers or endusers This option is illegal from a regulatory standpoint even though YK has an ST license Japanese telecom regs provide that a reseller of Japanese IPLC capacity must hold an ST license directly In other words the regulations provide that no affiliate of the YK licensee may resell IPLCs unless that affiliate itself acquires a license Moreover Trading cannot claim that it is not engaged in resale activities that require an ST license Japanese telecom regulations treat the resale of capacity under the Master as a resale of the underlying IPLC Unworkable Option Trading does not acquire an ST license YK purchases the Japan halfcircuits Trading purchases the US halfcircuits YK then resells the Japan halfcircuits to Trading Trading then resells the entire circuits under the Master to others who may be resellers or endusers For the reasons set forth under Option this option is illegal from a regulatory standpoint even if the sale from the YK to Trading and the subsequent resale by Trading occur in tandem one immediately after the other Unworkable Option EBS Trading LP forms a whollyowned US special purpose vehicle SPV which obtains an ST license SPV executes a costplus contract with EBS Networks YK The costplus contract provides that SPV has the right to use and control the telecom equipment owned by EBS Networks YK in exchange for periodic payments based on the cost of the equipment SPV buys entire circuits and resells them in the form of capacity under the Master to others who may be resellers or endusers This option is illegal from a regulatory standpoint because SPV does not own or lease the equipment through which it trades capacity Even if it were legal from a regulatory standpoint this option is NOT workable because the companies that control the Japanese capacity market would sell only to a licensed Japanese company Unworkable Option EBS Trading LP forms a whollyowned US special purpose vehicle SPV which obtains an ST license SPV establishes a local branch in Japan and controls a nominal amount of the telecom equipment in Japan through which the SPVs Japanese trading is switched or routed SPV buys Japan to US full circuit IPLCs and resells them in the form of capacity under the Master Sales Agreement This option is illegal from a regulatory standpoint because SPV does not own or lease ALL the equipment through which it trades capacity Even if it were legal from a regulatory standpoint this option is NOT workable because the companies that control the Japanese capacity market would sell only to a licensed Japanese company Unworkable Option EBS Trading LP forms a whollyowned US special purpose vehicle SPV which obtains an ST license SPV establishes a local branch in Japan and controls ALL of the telecom equipment in Japan through which the SPVs Japanese trading is switched or routed SPV buys Japan to US full circuit IPLCs and resells them in the form of capacity under the Master Sales Agreement Although perfectly legal from a regulatory standpoint this option is NOT workable because the companies that control the Japanese capacity market would sell only to a licensed Japanese company This also creates a tax problem in that Japan would treat the SPV as having a Japanese permanent establishment subject to Japanese income tax on the earnings attributed to it Please confirm clarify where ambiguous or correct where inaccurate Due to the extremely tax inefficient results of what appears to be our only option we need to be absolutely certain that our understanding is correct Is it clear that there are no other options here

for Meeting Wayne to remind there are two operational issues that had been on the agenda that keep getting deferred the Singapore license entity and a regulatory issue in Korea The deferral of the Singapore one defers our license application and our timeline for Singapore I told the commercial team we hoped to deal with it in this weeks call but that even then the license would slip to January with Singapore processing time So we need to try to decide the entity this week or next either in this call or by email or in a separate call whatever is the most efficient way Otherwise with the holidays we may lose an additional month What is the best mechanism to decide this In Singapore if we can see our way clear to go with the already established entity of course that would be simpler but I defer to the groups judgment For the Korea question perhaps all we need to do is agree to ask Kim and Chang to look at it including mine and Jan Haizmans and JaeMoo Lees thoughts and give us their advice If legal authorizes that I can get some material worked up to send I will be on the Thursday call from the beginning unless I am in the air in which case I will join around minutes into

tax need to analyze peering arrangements is that it appears that EBS may use such arrangements to effectively provision IP transport and IP transit obligations see attached note from Gunnar Frey Do you believe what Gunnar contemplates in his note falls within the definition of a peering arrangement set forth in your note I think the basic questions are best framed in concrete terms If a US customer with an office in Sao Paulo were to pay EBS Inc to provide IP transport from Sao Paulo to the US would EBS Inc be required to establish a Brazilian entity with a Brazilian telecom license to provide the IP transport If the answer to the foregoing question is yes would it matter whether the IP transport were provisioned through the purchase of private line capacity from Sao Paulo to Miami or via the peering arrangement described below with Impsat If the answer to the foregoing question is no would EBS licensed Brazilian entity have to be a party to the Impsat peering arrangement

LassereEnron nron Communications Arshak SarkissianEnron nron Communications Subject Re BMC Software Wayne You may have surmised this already but for the BMC Sao Paulo E I am planning to use Impsat Fiber Network I wrote you about this company at the end of November and proposed this scenario I think last time we spoke you said you thought we should be able to do this without creating a foreign entity or tax liability Is that still true Thanks Wayne Arshak and I have been working to reach an agreement with Impsat FIber Networks Impsat has an extensive network in countries in Latin America as well as a pop in Miami We have been discussing a peeringtransit agreement whereby one of our customers could connect to an Impsat port in Latin America for IP transit to the EIN As we envision this now we would swap Impsat a dedicated mbps port to our network for one into their network The connection between the two networks will take place in Miami If an EBS customer wanted IP capacity back to the US they could connect to any Impsat port in Latin America The customer would pay Impsat a port connection fee at every point where they connected to Impsat in Latin America EBSs customer would pay EBS USA for the capacity eg mbps The reverse would be true for an Impsat customer in the US The Impsat customer could connect to an EIN port for a fee that would be paid directly to EBS but any charges for capacity would be paid to Impsat The Impsat customer could use the EIN for transport between EBS pops and an EBS customer could have transit between Impsats pops We would expect the EBS customers Latin America requirement to be part of a larger VBN deal with components in the US and possibly other continents Would this scenario create a tax liability for EBS in Latin America Impsat

AndersonEnron nron Communications Robbi RossiEnron nron Communications Sue NRON Subject Re Proposed Tarl Agenda Meeting for am Thursday January locationcallin to be announced Wayne This my response to your question What is the regulatory analysis of peering arrangments Peering is an act of establishing a relationship to pass Internet traffic between one national internet backbone provider to another national provider Peering is currently not subject to any industryspecific regulations and is governed by commericial requirements The reason that peering is not regulated by Federal Communications Commission or any other agency is mainly due to two factors data traffic has not been subjected to the same stringent regulation as voice traffic history of Internet Since it was the National Science Foundation NSF who founded the first backbone to encourage the exchange of information between different scientists and researchers the open environment for peering was essential to the rapid growth of the Internet Currently most of the Internet traffic is exchanged through private pooling instead of the public Network Access Point NAP With private peering traffic can be exchanged in the same city which avoids the classic sydrome in which traffic that orignates and terminates in Houston would have to travel through NY or even India Please note that peering is not be be confused with Interconnection in the PSTN which are very cumbersome and expensive May I also ask for what reason are you bringing up the topic of peering is there a deal involving this topic Please let me know if you have any questions Xi Xi Wayne Gardner AM To Alisa ChristensenEnron nron Communications Beth WapnerEnron nron Communications Cynthia HarknessEnron nron Communications David

Subject Proposed Tarl Agenda Meeting for am Thursday January locationcallin to be announced I propose a hour meeting to try to regroup from the holidays and hopefully come up with a framework that will allow us to pick up the pace for future meetings Below is a proposed agenda Establish what we have learned to date Trading of private line and lambda service terminating in Japan unavoidably requires a local license held by local entity therefore trading of private line and lambda service terminating in Japan must be done by a local entity exposure to high Japanese tax and potential double tax reduced if Japan only has halfcircuit but this requires having multiple EBS parties to a trade and trading halfcircuits may not even be a commercial alternative a Master and a confirm must be bilateral ie there can be only be one counterparty on each side of the agreement thus a customer that wishes to trade an entire segment eg Tokyo to San Jose will have to execute two Masters and two confirms if the halfcircuit alternative is used US tax guidelines to avoid double tax on Japanese trading Trading of Australian bandwidth entails no license requirements Trading of Western European bandwidth entails no license requirements provided that no physical fiber is owned Trading US telecom capacity requires an FCC license EBS Inc has an FCC license No other affiliate of EBS Inc needs to acquire an FCC license IF that affiliate is directly or indirectly whollyowned by EBS Inc With regard to any IP transport deal we must have the counterparty enter into a separate Master agreement and confirm with each EBS entity involved in the transaction Thus in an IP transport deal involving numerous countries that require licensed local entities to provide local IP services the counterparty will be required to execute a Master with each of the local entities This is the ONLY feasible way from a legal standpoint to structure an IP transport deal but is not a very good solution None of the foregoing points raise significant accounting issues Other What are the important near term questions that remain to be answered and how long will it take to answer them Does private line and lambda trading of segments terminating in Hong Kong Singapore and India unavoidably require local license held by local entity If so is there any way to limit the problem Does IP transport constitute a telecommunications service that requires a license in Sao Paulo Tel Aviv Japan Singapore Hong Kong and India If so must that license be held by a local entity Does IP transit constitute a telecommunications service that requires a license in Sao Paulo Tel Aviv Japan Singapore Hong Kong and India If so must that license be held by a local entity What is the legal relationship of parties

GintyEnron nron Communications Donald LassereEnron nron Communications David MerrillENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Japan Trading Dear Sue Because of the important role of Japan in the trading business of EBS I want to make sure I understand very clearly our regulatory options For the sake of simplicity I limit the discussion below to trading of segments between Japan and the US on the grounds that the Japanese principles that apply to any other trading of international segments would be identical The discussion is further limited to the purchase of IPLCs because that is the standard form of telecom capacity available for purchase out of Japan Finally based on input from Regulatory the discussion assumes that the purchased IPLCs are divided into halfcircuits The Japan halfcircuit terminates in Japan and in the middle of the Pacific The US halfcircuit terminates in the middle of the Pacific picking up where the Japan halfcircuit terminates and in the US I Our only option from a regulatory standpoint We understand that the only option from a regulatory prespective is as follows EBS Networks YK YK purchases the Japan halfcircuits because it has an ST license and switch in Japan through which it will route ALL trades EBS Trading LP Trading purchases the US halfcircuits only Each of Trading and YK can resell their respective halfcircuits in the form of capacity under the EBS Master Services Agreement the Master to others who may be resellers or endusers II Tax consequences of structuring trades in accordance with this option At best the tax consequences of the foregoing are that half of the earnings on Japan to US trading will be subject to immediate Japan income tax with no ability to defer the cash payment of tax with Enrons US tax loss carryforward In addition there may be significant exposure to US income tax we are in the midst of quantifying this risk and evaluating potential ways around it which would incrementally increase the effective income tax rate to If instead Trading undertook all the Trading activity virtually all of the earnings of Japan to US trading would be subject to a single rate of US income tax and the payment of such tax could be deferred for a significant period of time due to Enrons large US tax loss carryforward III The following options have been ruled out by Regulatory for the following reasons Unworkable Option Trading does not acquire an ST license Trading buys US and Japan halfcircuits directly and resells them in the form of capacity under the Master to others who may be resellers or endusers This option is illegal from a regulatory standpoint even though YK has an ST license Japanese telecom regs provide that a reseller of Japanese IPLC capacity must hold an ST license directly In other words the regulations provide that no affiliate of the YK licensee may resell IPLCs unless that affiliate itself acquires a license Moreover Trading cannot claim that it is not engaged in resale activities that require an ST license Japanese telecom regulations treat the resale of capacity under the Master as a resale of the underlying IPLC Unworkable Option Trading does not acquire an ST license YK purchases the Japan halfcircuits Trading purchases the US halfcircuits YK then resells the Japan halfcircuits to Trading Trading then resells the entire circuits under the Master to others who may be resellers or endusers For the reasons set forth under Option this option is illegal from a regulatory standpoint even if the sale from the YK to Trading and the subsequent resale by Trading occur in tandem one immediately after the other Unworkable Option EBS Trading LP forms a whollyowned US special purpose vehicle SPV which obtains an ST license SPV executes a costplus contract with EBS Networks YK The costplus contract provides that SPV has the right to use and control the telecom equipment owned by EBS Networks YK in exchange for periodic payments based on the cost of the equipment SPV buys entire circuits and resells them in the form of capacity under the Master to others who may be resellers or endusers This option is illegal from a regulatory standpoint because SPV does not own or lease the equipment through which it trades capacity Even if it were legal from a regulatory standpoint this option is NOT workable because the companies that control the Japanese capacity market would sell only to a licensed Japanese company Unworkable Option EBS Trading LP forms a whollyowned US special purpose vehicle SPV which obtains an ST license SPV establishes a local branch in Japan and controls a nominal amount of the telecom equipment in Japan through which the SPVs Japanese trading is switched or routed SPV buys Japan to US full circuit IPLCs and resells them in the form of capacity under the Master Sales Agreement This option is illegal from a regulatory standpoint because SPV does not own or lease ALL the equipment through which it trades capacity Even if it were legal from a regulatory standpoint this option is NOT workable because the companies that control the Japanese capacity market would sell only to a licensed Japanese company Unworkable Option EBS Trading LP forms a whollyowned US special purpose vehicle SPV which obtains an ST license SPV establishes a local branch in Japan and controls ALL of the telecom equipment in Japan through which the SPVs Japanese trading is switched or routed SPV buys Japan to US full circuit IPLCs and resells them in the form of capacity under the Master Sales Agreement Although perfectly legal from a regulatory standpoint this option is NOT workable because the companies that control the Japanese capacity market would sell only to a licensed Japanese company This also creates a tax problem in that Japan would treat the SPV as having a Japanese permanent establishment subject to Japanese income tax on the earnings attributed to it Please confirm clarify where ambiguous or correct where inaccurate Due to the extremely tax inefficient results of what appears to be our only option we need to be absolutely certain that our understanding is correct Is it clear that there are no other options here

for Meeting Wayne to remind there are two operational issues that had been on the agenda that keep getting deferred the Singapore license entity and a regulatory issue in Korea The deferral of the Singapore one defers our license application and our timeline for Singapore I told the commercial team we hoped to deal with it in this weeks call but that even then the license would slip to January with Singapore processing time So we need to try to decide the entity this week or next either in this call or by email or in a separate call whatever is the most efficient way Otherwise with the holidays we may lose an additional month What is the best mechanism to decide this In Singapore if we can see our way clear to go with the already established entity of course that would be simpler but I defer to the groups judgment For the Korea question perhaps all we need to do is agree to ask Kim and Chang to look at it including mine and Jan Haizmans and JaeMoo Lees thoughts and give us their advice If legal authorizes that I can get some material worked up to send I will be on the Thursday call from the beginning unless I am in the air in which case I will join around minutes into

tax need to analyze peering arrangements is that it appears that EBS may use such arrangements to effectively provision IP transport and IP transit obligations see attached note from Gunnar Frey Do you believe what Gunnar contemplates in his note falls within the definition of a peering arrangement set forth in your note I think the basic questions are best framed in concrete terms If a US customer with an office in Sao Paulo were to pay EBS Inc to provide IP transport from Sao Paulo to the US would EBS Inc be required to establish a Brazilian entity with a Brazilian telecom license to provide the IP transport If the answer to the foregoing question is yes would it matter whether the IP transport were provisioned through the purchase of private line capacity from Sao Paulo to Miami or via the peering arrangement described below with Impsat If the answer to the foregoing question is no would EBS licensed Brazilian entity have to be a party to the Impsat peering arrangement

LassereEnron nron Communications Arshak SarkissianEnron nron Communications Subject Re BMC Software Wayne You may have surmised this already but for the BMC Sao Paulo E I am planning to use Impsat Fiber Network I wrote you about this company at the end of November and proposed this scenario I think last time we spoke you said you thought we should be able to do this without creating a foreign entity or tax liability Is that still true Thanks Wayne Arshak and I have been working to reach an agreement with Impsat FIber Networks Impsat has an extensive network in countries in Latin America as well as a pop in Miami We have been discussing a peeringtransit agreement whereby one of our customers could connect to an Impsat port in Latin America for IP transit to the EIN As we envision this now we would swap Impsat a dedicated mbps port to our network for one into their network The connection between the two networks will take place in Miami If an EBS customer wanted IP capacity back to the US they could connect to any Impsat port in Latin America The customer would pay Impsat a port connection fee at every point where they connected to Impsat in Latin America EBSs customer would pay EBS USA for the capacity eg mbps The reverse would be true for an Impsat customer in the US The Impsat customer could connect to an EIN port for a fee that would be paid directly to EBS but any charges for capacity would be paid to Impsat The Impsat customer could use the EIN for transport between EBS pops and an EBS customer could have transit between Impsats pops We would expect the EBS customers Latin America requirement to be part of a larger VBN deal with components in the US and possibly other continents Would this scenario create a tax liability for EBS in Latin America Impsat is incorporated in Delaware and trades on the NASDAQ Their hqs are in Argentina I welcome anyones comments Thanks Gunnar Frey Enron Broadband Services Global Bandwidth Risk Management Tel Fax Gunnar

AndersonEnron nron Communications Robbi RossiEnron nron Communications Sue NRON Subject Re Proposed Tarl Agenda Meeting for am Thursday January locationcallin to be announced Wayne This my response to your question What is the regulatory analysis of peering arrangments Peering is an act of establishing a relationship to pass Internet traffic between one national internet backbone provider to another national provider Peering is currently not subject to any industryspecific regulations and is governed by commericial requirements The reason that peering is not regulated by Federal Communications Commission or any other agency is mainly due to two factors data traffic has not been subjected to the same stringent regulation as voice traffic history of Internet Since it was the National Science Foundation NSF who founded the first backbone to encourage the exchange of information between different scientists and researchers the open environment for peering was essential to the rapid growth of the Internet Currently most of the Internet traffic is exchanged through private pooling instead of the public Network Access Point NAP With private peering traffic can be exchanged in the same city which avoids the classic sydrome in which traffic that orignates and terminates in Houston would have to travel through NY or even India Please note that peering is not be be confused with Interconnection in the PSTN which are very cumbersome and expensive May I also ask for what reason are you bringing up the topic of peering is there a deal involving this topic Please let me know if you have any questions Xi Xi Wayne Gardner AM To Alisa ChristensenEnron nron Communications Beth WapnerEnron nron Communications Cynthia HarknessEnron nron Communications David

Subject Proposed Tarl Agenda Meeting for am Thursday January locationcallin to be announced I propose a hour meeting to try to regroup from the holidays and hopefully come up with a framework that will allow us to pick up the pace for future meetings Below is a proposed agenda Establish what we have learned to date Trading of private line and lambda service terminating in Japan unavoidably requires a local license held by local entity therefore trading of private line and lambda service terminating in Japan must be done by a local entity exposure to high Japanese tax and potential double tax reduced if Japan only has halfcircuit but this requires having multiple EBS parties to a trade and trading halfcircuits may not even be a commercial alternative a Master and a confirm must be bilateral ie there can be only be one counterparty on each side of the agreement thus a customer that wishes to trade an entire segment eg Tokyo to San Jose will have to execute two Masters and two confirms if the halfcircuit alternative is used US tax guidelines to avoid double tax on Japanese trading Trading of Australian bandwidth entails no license requirements Trading of Western European bandwidth entails no license requirements provided that no physical fiber is owned Trading US telecom capacity requires an FCC license EBS Inc has an FCC license No other affiliate of EBS Inc needs to acquire an FCC license IF that affiliate is directly or indirectly whollyowned by EBS Inc With regard to any IP transport deal we must have the counterparty enter into a separate Master agreement and confirm with each EBS entity involved in the transaction Thus in an IP transport deal involving numerous countries that require licensed local entities to provide local IP services the counterparty will be required to execute a Master with each of the local entities This is the ONLY feasible way from a legal standpoint to structure an IP transport deal but is not a very good solution None of the foregoing points raise significant accounting issues Other What are the important near term questions that remain to be answered and how long will it take to answer them Does private line and lambda trading of segments terminating in Hong Kong Singapore and India unavoidably require local license held by local entity If so is there any way to limit the problem Does IP transport constitute a telecommunications service that requires a license in Sao Paulo Tel Aviv Japan Singapore Hong Kong and India If so must that license be held by a local entity Does IP transit constitute a telecommunications service that requires a license in Sao Paulo Tel Aviv Japan Singapore Hong Kong and India If so must that license be held by a local entity What is the legal relationship of parties to peering arrangements What is the regulatory analysis of peering arrangments What is the tax analysis of peering arrangments Other Update on Singapore Pioneer Status application Are there things should we be doing to try to get ahead of the curve I encourage questions and comments on the agenda W Wayne Gardner Enron Broadband Services Smith Street Houston TX Phone Fax
