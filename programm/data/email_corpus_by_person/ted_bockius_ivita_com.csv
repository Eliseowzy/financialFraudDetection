below indicates there is a big demand for a company that can help startups identify visionairy customers The Ten Dangers of Early Market Selling Ignoring the key goals of Early Market sales Not understanding the psychographics you are dealing with Employing ineffective qualification ie segmentation criteria Asking the wrong people in your organization to find and close the first few deals Not knowing where to find likely visionary buyers Failing to align with the visionarys goals and requirements Mistaking pragmatists in drag for visionaries Not charging for custom RD andor implementation services Structuring each deal as a product sale rather than a whole project Failing to see whenhow to cross the chasm and avoid the plunge Back to Basics Surviving the Ten Traps of Early Market Selling Part I In Decembers edition of Under the Buzz vol no LifeCyclebased Enterprise Sales The Key to Crossing the Chasm I made brief references to sales strategies for the Early Market while focusing attention on strategies for crossing the Chasm Executives and VCs among our readers responded that the topic of enterprise sales was indeed timely and many welcomed the guidance offered In parallel at the Net Market Makers Ground Zero conference panel I hosted in early December enterprise sales was a key concern on the minds of panelists and audience members alike Even though some product categories appear to have passed beyond the stage of gestation that the early market represents many categories appear still to be experiencing early adoption in fact while many BB companies especially erstwhile net marketplaces repurpose their businesses see section of this edition new categories of offerings continue to emerge including efinance services supply chain visibilityexecution and collaborative commerce solutions section of this issue And even companies in categories that may be starting to move across the chasm still need to tackle the big hairy audacious projects of their visionary customers more effectively Early Market Adoption Dynamics and Ten Key Traps to Avoid It is frequently stated that in order to establish the value proposition of a new technology the early market phase requires a simple strategy just go get a customer Reinforcing this approach our firm emphasizes that the core market development strategy at this point is indeed dealdriven So whats the problem If you have a sufficiently attractive and discontinuous innovation to bring to the table surely it is indeed a question of just going out and closing a deal with a willing customer Well not so fast In my own personal experience running software companies I experienced significant difficulties to make this strategy work and in my consulting practice I see companies flounder every day in early market customer engagement Hence success in the Early Market is far from being a trivial feat Therefore I want to examine in some detail the principal traps and how companies can avoid them At least ten potentially critical dangers lie in wait for unsuspecting companies the first five of which I shall address here Ignoring the key goals of Early Market sales Companies tend to act as if this is a time to sell to as many customers as possible in order to build a reference list that will impress later adopters Unfortunately by treating all comers as early adopters they often end up with the worst possible compromise they get involved in extended sales cycles with mainly hesitant customers who end up requesting custom enhancements in return for small pilot contracts that take ages to close In those cases where companies do attract a bonafide visionary customer they are often unsure how to manage the opportunity Thus they jump through technical hoops to satisfy the customers aggressive requirements but fail to get compensated for the value they deliver Assuming for a moment that your company does have a valid Early Market proposition ie a discontinuous innovation that promises to enable business in a significantly new way then the main objectives are to prove a that the new category is indeed a hot one and b that you are a player with leadership potential The best way of achieving these goals is to find a few big companymaking deals with visible customers who are willing to take a risk on your technology because they believe it can garner for them a real and dramatic competitive advantage Commerce Ones deal with General Motors in late to build an online eprocurement marketplace was a good example of how to do this On the day the deal was announced the companys stock price registered a significant uptick and it emerged as a leading players in eprocurement alongside Ariba Not understanding the psychographics you are dealing with The early market has two distinct constituencies each of which is quite different in turn from the other three pragmatists conservatives and skeptics While technology enthusiasts are technologyfocused visionaries are businessfocused More important they are critical partners in the early market buyer alliance required to make anything of significance happen techies need the funding provided by empowered visionaries to implement the new technologies in a true industryshaping project while visionaries rely on techies to tell them whether or not the new technology has a chance of actually working in a live setting Thus while visionaries may not actually care two hoots about technology per se or they may not really understand its intrinsic characteristics they do have a keen awareness of its relevance to their business objectives Unfortunately in their anxiety to find acceptance for their new new thing companies confuse pragmatists with these two groups resulting in missed opportunities perhaps the worst of which is the sin of giving too much away for free because visionaries are resultssensitive but not pricesensitive Employing ineffective qualification ie segmentation criteria Many companies fail to recognize that Early Market selling in common with later stages in the Life Cycle does require a segmentation strategy though quite a counterintuitive one As a result they spend precious energy selling to the wrong target customers For example in the Bowling Alley you segment for pragmatist managers in selfreferencing groups such as microniches of vertical markets whereas in the tornado you segment for anyone ready to make a quick purchase decision for maximum volume and on Main Street you segment for end users in selected niche markets whose needs and preferences you can serve effectively In contrast during the Early Market stage when all constituencies except for the small number of techies and visionary executives automatically disqualify themselves from buying the new new thing vendors must segment ruthlessly for visionary executives in visible organizations Asking the wrong people in your organization to find and close the first few deals In most cases assigning your entire sales force large or small to the task of finding and closing big deals with visionaries is asking for trouble In order to engage with executives in such organizations your best resources must be actively engaged After all these are the defining projects that will establish your company in the new category so they are core for the company The basic model for this in a young BB company is an evangelistic sales team led by the CEO and CTO supported wherever possible by a cadre of evangelist sales technology and domain professionals Though not entirely unlike the SWAT group which is appropriate for the Bowling Alley this teaming model tends to be more of a virtual team consisting of the key partners in the project i the visionary customer ii the technology company and iii the senior service firm Not knowing where to find likely visionary buyers One of the main problems associated with selling to techies and visionaries is that theres no way of telling from their business card or job title what their IT adoption behavior is Worse still they tend not to congregate in herds so its difficult to find groups of them Fortunately however visionaries tend to leave a trail there arent many of them and they usually have a track record of sorts While visionary individuals quickly make a name for themselves and unlike company owners such as Michael Dell often move from one company to another companies stay in one place and in general they fall into one of two categories large Global organizations or fastgrowing companies often in newish industries eg wireless telecommunications One of the best ways of identifying them is the combined personal networks of any management team as well as in publications that detail their successful and unsuccessful projects After a short brainstorm session you can usually draw up a list of twenty or more suspects and this is as good a place as any to start The five points above deal mainly with understanding what the early market stage is really about and how to identify and connect with visionary buyers The last five dangers relate to how to successfully engage with bonafide visionaries and determine when to move to the next stage in the Life Cycle Here is the complete list of ten traps the last five in bold to be addressed later For readers whose business is currently in the early market stage I encourage you to measure your progress in avoiding the traps we have described here by analyzing each significant sale closed to date as well as those currently in the pipeline If you have fallen into one of these traps I strongly recommend that you debate this issue with your colleagues because every mistake made here can cost you dearly For readers whose business is not currently in this adoption stage consider the contrast between the dynamics of the early market and the stage you believe your business is in This will help you to distinguish between the appropriate strategies for each stage Failing to align with the visionarys goals and requirements From the time you first hit it off with a true visionary buyer you must do everything possible to fit in with their vision because they always have a project in mind before you came along whether it be a plan to change the groundrules in their industry gain a defensible leap in market share or revolutionize some business process Strangely enough the worst possible mistake is to act like a typical product vendor because the one thing that will scare them off is a vendor eager to do a deal at all costs For example agreeing to do complex custom product enhancements at the drop of a hat smack of desperation and tends to make them feel that you may not be able to deliver what they need in the timeframe they need it Remember far from being pricesensitive visionaries are extremely resultssensitive This is because if you think about it their willingness to go where no man hath gone before makes them vulnerable if it should fail Thus visionaries need their chosen technology provider to do whatever it takes to make them successful In light of this you can and should count on them to be a true partner in the whole project along with the senior service partner who may already be a valued counselor to them Mistaking pragmatists in drag for visionaries Pragmatists just like conservatives and even skeptics read the same books on core competencies and competitive advantage as do visionaries and they can be equally proficient in the lingo of strategy Apart from any other consideration talking big sounds much better than to admit right off the bat that the real reason they came to your seminar is well fear that they may be missing out on something important Not as Seinfeld might say that theres anything wrong with being a pragmatist Its just that if we dont listen carefully we can waste fatal amounts of time and money courting them only to have a big deal forecast to close within three months turn into a small pilot that doesnt close for a year or ever with very little resource commitment by the customer So how can you tell immediately that you are dealing with a pragmatist rather than a visionary Well there are two guaranteed signs to probe for the visionary always has a project in mind that they are dying to tell you about whereas the pragmatist or conservative is only there to keep tabs on the new stuff and make sure they dont need to do anything about it for the time being when your prospective customer asks so who else is doing this if they are a visionary their expression is one of anticipation that they might be the first in their industry to invest in this new stuff whereas pragmatists will always betray their true colors by the concerned look on their faces at this point Having spotted a pragmatist the best way to deal with them is to let them know that you understand their lack of readiness to buy at this time and will keep them informed about your progress This reverse psychology provides them with valuable assurance and may even intrigue them enough to result in a pilot purchase that you will not treat as a big deal warranting whatever it takes support Not charging for custom RD or implementation services Due to the plain anxiety to gain acceptance for the new innovation companies have a strong tendency to want to give everything away in order to please their customer and thus get the contract signed quickly Since we have said that visionary buyers are resultssensitive rather than pricesensitive this approach can only delay the deal and worse still actually diminish the size of the initial commitment In fact the one thing that worries them about a vendors eagertoplease approach in an earlymarket project negotiation is when we agree to do everything for free and by next week into the bargain Why would this worry them if they stand to receive extra value for free Well put yourself in their place if you have just knowingly asked your chosen vendor to develop one or two additional features in an still untested technology wouldnt you worry just a little whether or not they can deliver something working in such a short time In pure financial terms this foolhardy attitude reduces dramatically the revenue received from the hard work of providing the requisite technology and services usually at the cost of other key commitments Structuring each deal as a product sales rather than a whole project Most software companies are designed from the start to be product businesses even if they know they will have to provide for plenty of customization to their products by engineering andor professional services Furthermore the business model is set as a licensefee business with service fees tacked on as a secondary tactical sideline This generally makes it difficult to identify and close true earlymarket opportunities effectively and profitably The reason is that this model causes the vendor to focus on selling a product license which flies directly in the face of the customers goals The clearest sign that vendors are approaching the early market sales opportunities incorrectly is that the product becomes their key point of reference for every question asked by the customer they point to benefits the product provides to show how the product can solve the customers problem whatever it may be Unfortunately for product vendors visionary customers see new technologies as concepts in search of proof rather than as finished products Furthermore they recognize that they are the only customers willing to commit time resources and money to incorporating the new technology into their project assuming it is a key catalyst to make the project viable However the more the vendor sets out to prove that the product does everything the customer needs the more they get into hot water via repeated demos the customer sends different teams to see the latest custom demo that doesnt quite do everything the customer dreams of the company then has to do unnatural acts by the following week in order to recover the lost ground with a demo that actually works by which time the customer has become concerned that the vendor is not really listening to their requests but just trying to sell them something The only solution to this problem during this stage is for the vendor to think like a service company evaluating every valid opportunity as a project rather than a product sale Engineering and implementation resources should be allocated a priori to these projects the best and most senior talent needs to be allocated to comanaging the project and ensuring followthrough contracts should be structured on a riskreward basis and every piece of valueadding work should be charged for large companies understand that you are not a registered charity By and large deal structure should emulate the structure of large technology integration projects the customer should commit to a a significant cash payment upfront to fund startup resources then b milestone payments for each key project phase and c a final payment for project completion and full rollout Customers need to know that the vendor is committed to their success so pricing and fees must reflect this emphasis Remember they are resultssensitive so that whenever they are not charged for work that they consider critical they will become concerned about ontime delivery of a working solution There is only one exception to this pricing guideline work performed to make good on basic existing functionality should be funded by technology vendor as a basic part of their contractual obligation Failing to see know whenhow to move to the next stage Unfortunately a year or two into the Early Market stage there is no Gartner Group or Forrester report to let you know for sure that its time to change strategies and negotiate the delicate but vital leap across the Chasm In fact the only reliable indications that you have reached the end of this bigproject stage are twofold no new visionaries all of the visionaries that could have been attracted to your technology have already made their commitments and these customers are now anxiously waiting to for their project to be completed and pragmatists are still wary of making any more than a token toeinthewater commitment to a pilot project Now if youve been reasonably successful during this stage you probably have between three and seven live projects at various stages of completion and a number of pilots in place with the pragmatists you managed to eke out a deal with But still its not easy to know that its time to cross the chasm Whats left to do is review each significant project in detail to see what competitive advantage benefits your visionary customers have realized Selling to pragmatist department managers in the bowling alley requires that you translate this discourse about pursuing competitive advantage to eliminating severe competitive disadvantage No matter how clearly your first pragmatist customers intellectualize the positive benefits of the technology remember that they are not sufficiently motivated to emotionally to take the plunge unless they truly believe that they are suffering a severed jugular type of emergency This allows you to start plotting a target beachhead strategy If herd behavior starts to occur in the same market segment this is an indication that it is safe to proceed Deciding when enough is enough in the Early Market is about determining when you have too many oneoff projects to deal with and dont see new visionaries calling to discuss new ones This is the most reliable way of knowing that it is time to start the delicate transition toward the Bowling Alley without hopefully crashing down into the Chasm In a forthcoming issue we shall discuss the how of this challenge how to negotiate the delicate and crucial task of crossing the awesome and dangerous chasm Giri Iyer Corporate Evangelist iVita Corp Northwest Freeway

below indicates there is a big demand for a company that can help startups identify visionairy customers The Ten Dangers of Early Market Selling Ignoring the key goals of Early Market sales Not understanding the psychographics you are dealing with Employing ineffective qualification ie segmentation criteria Asking the wrong people in your organization to find and close the first few deals Not knowing where to find likely visionary buyers Failing to align with the visionarys goals and requirements Mistaking pragmatists in drag for visionaries Not charging for custom RD andor implementation services Structuring each deal as a product sale rather than a whole project Failing to see whenhow to cross the chasm and avoid the plunge Back to Basics Surviving the Ten Traps of Early Market Selling Part I In Decembers edition of Under the Buzz vol no LifeCyclebased Enterprise Sales The Key to Crossing the Chasm I made brief references to sales strategies for the Early Market while focusing attention on strategies for crossing the Chasm Executives and VCs among our readers responded that the topic of enterprise sales was indeed timely and many welcomed the guidance offered In parallel at the Net Market Makers Ground Zero conference panel I hosted in early December enterprise sales was a key concern on the minds of panelists and audience members alike Even though some product categories appear to have passed beyond the stage of gestation that the early market represents many categories appear still to be experiencing early adoption in fact while many BB companies especially erstwhile net marketplaces repurpose their businesses see section of this edition new categories of offerings continue to emerge including efinance services supply chain visibilityexecution and collaborative commerce solutions section of this issue And even companies in categories that may be starting to move across the chasm still need to tackle the big hairy audacious projects of their visionary customers more effectively Early Market Adoption Dynamics and Ten Key Traps to Avoid It is frequently stated that in order to establish the value proposition of a new technology the early market phase requires a simple strategy just go get a customer Reinforcing this approach our firm emphasizes that the core market development strategy at this point is indeed dealdriven So whats the problem If you have a sufficiently attractive and discontinuous innovation to bring to the table surely it is indeed a question of just going out and closing a deal with a willing customer Well not so fast In my own personal experience running software companies I experienced significant difficulties to make this strategy work and in my consulting practice I see companies flounder every day in early market customer engagement Hence success in the Early Market is far from being a trivial feat Therefore I want to examine in some detail the principal traps and how companies can avoid them At least ten potentially critical dangers lie in wait for unsuspecting companies the first five of which I shall address here Ignoring the key goals of Early Market sales Companies tend to act as if this is a time to sell to as many customers as possible in order to build a reference list that will impress later adopters Unfortunately by treating all comers as early adopters they often end up with the worst possible compromise they get involved in extended sales cycles with mainly hesitant customers who end up requesting custom enhancements in return for small pilot contracts that take ages to close In those cases where companies do attract a bonafide visionary customer they are often unsure how to manage the opportunity Thus they jump through technical hoops to satisfy the customers aggressive requirements but fail to get compensated for the value they deliver Assuming for a moment that your company does have a valid Early Market proposition ie a discontinuous innovation that promises to enable business in a significantly new way then the main objectives are to prove a that the new category is indeed a hot one and b that you are a player with leadership potential The best way of achieving these goals is to find a few big companymaking deals with visible customers who are willing to take a risk on your technology because they believe it can garner for them a real and dramatic competitive advantage Commerce Ones deal with General Motors in late to build an online eprocurement marketplace was a good example of how to do this On the day the deal was announced the companys stock price registered a significant uptick and it emerged as a leading players in eprocurement alongside Ariba Not understanding the psychographics you are dealing with The early market has two distinct constituencies each of which is quite different in turn from the other three pragmatists conservatives and skeptics While technology enthusiasts are technologyfocused visionaries are businessfocused More important they are critical partners in the early market buyer alliance required to make anything of significance happen techies need the funding provided by empowered visionaries to implement the new technologies in a true industryshaping project while visionaries rely on techies to tell them whether or not the new technology has a chance of actually working in a live setting Thus while visionaries may not actually care two hoots about technology per se or they may not really understand its intrinsic characteristics they do have a keen awareness of its relevance to their business objectives Unfortunately in their anxiety to find acceptance for their new new thing companies confuse pragmatists with these two groups resulting in missed opportunities perhaps the worst of which is the sin of giving too much away for free because visionaries are resultssensitive but not pricesensitive Employing ineffective qualification ie segmentation criteria Many companies fail to recognize that Early Market selling in common with later stages in the Life Cycle does require a segmentation strategy though quite a counterintuitive one As a result they spend precious energy selling to the wrong target customers For example in the Bowling Alley you segment for pragmatist managers in selfreferencing groups such as microniches of vertical markets whereas in the tornado you segment for anyone ready to make a quick purchase decision for maximum volume and on Main Street you segment for end users in selected niche markets whose needs and preferences you can serve effectively In contrast during the Early Market stage when all constituencies except for the small number of techies and visionary executives automatically disqualify themselves from buying the new new thing vendors must segment ruthlessly for visionary executives in visible organizations Asking the wrong people in your organization to find and close the first few deals In most cases assigning your entire sales force large or small to the task of finding and closing big deals with visionaries is asking for trouble In order to engage with executives in such organizations your best resources must be actively engaged After all these are the defining projects that will establish your company in the new category so they are core for the company The basic model for this in a young BB company is an evangelistic sales team led by the CEO and CTO supported wherever possible by a cadre of evangelist sales technology and domain professionals Though not entirely unlike the SWAT group which is appropriate for the Bowling Alley this teaming model tends to be more of a virtual team consisting of the key partners in the project i the visionary customer ii the technology company and iii the senior service firm Not knowing where to find likely visionary buyers One of the main problems associated with selling to techies and visionaries is that theres no way of telling from their business card or job title what their IT adoption behavior is Worse still they tend not to congregate in herds so its difficult to find groups of them Fortunately however visionaries tend to leave a trail there arent many of them and they usually have a track record of sorts While visionary individuals quickly make a name for themselves and unlike company owners such as Michael Dell often move from one company to another companies stay in one place and in general they fall into one of two categories large Global organizations or fastgrowing companies often in newish industries eg wireless telecommunications One of the best ways of identifying them is the combined personal networks of any management team as well as in publications that detail their successful and unsuccessful projects After a short brainstorm session you can usually draw up a list of twenty or more suspects and this is as good a place as any to start The five points above deal mainly with understanding what the early market stage is really about and how to identify and connect with visionary buyers The last five dangers relate to how to successfully engage with bonafide visionaries and determine when to move to the next stage in the Life Cycle Here is the complete list of ten traps the last five in bold to be addressed later For readers whose business is currently in the early market stage I encourage you to measure your progress in avoiding the traps we have described here by analyzing each significant sale closed to date as well as those currently in the pipeline If you have fallen into one of these traps I strongly recommend that you debate this issue with your colleagues because every mistake made here can cost you dearly For readers whose business is not currently in this adoption stage consider the contrast between the dynamics of the early market and the stage you believe your business is in This will help you to distinguish between the appropriate strategies for each stage Failing to align with the visionarys goals and requirements From the time you first hit it off with a true visionary buyer you must do everything possible to fit in with their vision because they always have a project in mind before you came along whether it be a plan to change the groundrules in their industry gain a defensible leap in market share or revolutionize some business process Strangely enough the worst possible mistake is to act like a typical product vendor because the one thing that will scare them off is a vendor eager to do a deal at all costs For example agreeing to do complex custom product enhancements at the drop of a hat smack of desperation and tends to make them feel that you may not be able to deliver what they need in the timeframe they need it Remember far from being pricesensitive visionaries are extremely resultssensitive This is because if you think about it their willingness to go where no man hath gone before makes them vulnerable if it should fail Thus visionaries need their chosen technology provider to do whatever it takes to make them successful In light of this you can and should count on them to be a true partner in the whole project along with the senior service partner who may already be a valued counselor to them Mistaking pragmatists in drag for visionaries Pragmatists just like conservatives and even skeptics read the same books on core competencies and competitive advantage as do visionaries and they can be equally proficient in the lingo of strategy Apart from any other consideration talking big sounds much better than to admit right off the bat that the real reason they came to your seminar is well fear that they may be missing out on something important Not as Seinfeld might say that theres anything wrong with being a pragmatist Its just that if we dont listen carefully we can waste fatal amounts of time and money courting them only to have a big deal forecast to close within three months turn into a small pilot that doesnt close for a year or ever with very little resource commitment by the customer So how can you tell immediately that you are dealing with a pragmatist rather than a visionary Well there are two guaranteed signs to probe for the visionary always has a project in mind that they are dying to tell you about whereas the pragmatist or conservative is only there to keep tabs on the new stuff and make sure they dont need to do anything about it for the time being when your prospective customer asks so who else is doing this if they are a visionary their expression is one of anticipation that they might be the first in their industry to invest in this new stuff whereas pragmatists will always betray their true colors by the concerned look on their faces at this point Having spotted a pragmatist the best way to deal with them is to let them know that you understand their lack of readiness to buy at this time and will keep them informed about your progress This reverse psychology provides them with valuable assurance and may even intrigue them enough to result in a pilot purchase that you will not treat as a big deal warranting whatever it takes support Not charging for custom RD or implementation services Due to the plain anxiety to gain acceptance for the new innovation companies have a strong tendency to want to give everything away in order to please their customer and thus get the contract signed quickly Since we have said that visionary buyers are resultssensitive rather than pricesensitive this approach can only delay the deal and worse still actually diminish the size of the initial commitment In fact the one thing that worries them about a vendors eagertoplease approach in an earlymarket project negotiation is when we agree to do everything for free and by next week into the bargain Why would this worry them if they stand to receive extra value for free Well put yourself in their place if you have just knowingly asked your chosen vendor to develop one or two additional features in an still untested technology wouldnt you worry just a little whether or not they can deliver something working in such a short time In pure financial terms this foolhardy attitude reduces dramatically the revenue received from the hard work of providing the requisite technology and services usually at the cost of other key commitments Structuring each deal as a product sales rather than a whole project Most software companies are designed from the start to be product businesses even if they know they will have to provide for plenty of customization to their products by engineering andor professional services Furthermore the business model is set as a licensefee business with service fees tacked on as a secondary tactical sideline This generally makes it difficult to identify and close true earlymarket opportunities effectively and profitably The reason is that this model causes the vendor to focus on selling a product license which flies directly in the face of the customers goals The clearest sign that vendors are approaching the early market sales opportunities incorrectly is that the product becomes their key point of reference for every question asked by the customer they point to benefits the product provides to show how the product can solve the customers problem whatever it may be Unfortunately for product vendors visionary customers see new technologies as concepts in search of proof rather than as finished products Furthermore they recognize that they are the only customers willing to commit time resources and money to incorporating the new technology into their project assuming it is a key catalyst to make the project viable However the more the vendor sets out to prove that the product does everything the customer needs the more they get into hot water via repeated demos the customer sends different teams to see the latest custom demo that doesnt quite do everything the customer dreams of the company then has to do unnatural acts by the following week in order to recover the lost ground with a demo that actually works by which time the customer has become concerned that the vendor is not really listening to their requests but just trying to sell them something The only solution to this problem during this stage is for the vendor to think like a service company evaluating every valid opportunity as a project rather than a product sale Engineering and implementation resources should be allocated a priori to these projects the best and most senior talent needs to be allocated to comanaging the project and ensuring followthrough contracts should be structured on a riskreward basis and every piece of valueadding work should be charged for large companies understand that you are not a registered charity By and large deal structure should emulate the structure of large technology integration projects the customer should commit to a a significant cash payment upfront to fund startup resources then b milestone payments for each key project phase and c a final payment for project completion and full rollout Customers need to know that the vendor is committed to their success so pricing and fees must reflect this emphasis Remember they are resultssensitive so that whenever they are not charged for work that they consider critical they will become concerned about ontime delivery of a working solution There is only one exception to this pricing guideline work performed to make good on basic existing functionality should be funded by technology vendor as a basic part of their contractual obligation Failing to see know whenhow to move to the next stage Unfortunately a year or two into the Early Market stage there is no Gartner Group or Forrester report to let you know for sure that its time to change strategies and negotiate the delicate but vital leap across the Chasm In fact the only reliable indications that you have reached the end of this bigproject stage are twofold no new visionaries all of the visionaries that could have been attracted to your technology have already made their commitments and these customers are now anxiously waiting to for their project to be completed and pragmatists are still wary of making any more than a token toeinthewater commitment to a pilot project Now if youve been reasonably successful during this stage you probably have between three and seven live projects at various stages of completion and a number of pilots in place with the pragmatists you managed to eke out a deal with But still its not easy to know that its time to cross the chasm Whats left to do is review each significant project in detail to see what competitive advantage benefits your visionary customers have realized Selling to pragmatist department managers in the bowling alley requires that you translate this discourse about pursuing competitive advantage to eliminating severe competitive disadvantage No matter how clearly your first pragmatist customers intellectualize the positive benefits of the technology remember that they are not sufficiently motivated to emotionally to take the plunge unless they truly believe that they are suffering a severed jugular type of emergency This allows you to start plotting a target beachhead strategy If herd behavior starts to occur in the same market segment this is an indication that it is safe to proceed Deciding when enough is enough in the Early Market is about determining when you have too many oneoff projects to deal with and dont see new visionaries calling to discuss new ones This is the most reliable way of knowing that it is time to start the delicate transition toward the Bowling Alley without hopefully crashing down into the Chasm In a forthcoming issue we shall discuss the how of this challenge how to negotiate the delicate and crucial task of crossing the awesome and dangerous chasm Giri Iyer Corporate Evangelist iVita Corp Northwest Freeway
