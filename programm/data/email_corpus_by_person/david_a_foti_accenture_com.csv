Foti Accenture Allen Parkway Suite Houston Texas om To David A ccenture cc AM Subject RE ECS Contract Review New Idea Dave If possible I would like for you to sit down with Lindy and a few folks from our group who have been looking at this I want to make sure that it would be an efficient use of your time and that we would not be duplicating anything I will have Lindy contact you so we can set something up and then move forward as necessary Thanks Steve Original Message From ENRON Sent Tuesday October AM To Harris Steven Subject ECS Contract Review New Idea Steve I worked it out so you will be getting the lowest possible rate for my time hour normal rate is I would like to send you an engagement letter this week for up to weeks or hours k I think we can get it done in less time but the hours provides some flexibility if we decide to go deeper on something we would only charge you for the hours we use I am visualizing the deliverable as an analysis of your restructuring options as well as the NPV Income and operational effect for each To the extent time allows I will be able to help negotiate and close whatever option you choose In order for me to offer our preferred rate it is important to note that I would need to be able to do this project on somewhat of a flexible basis eg Friday meetings emails and phone vs being onsite weeks fulltime Even with this flexible structure I feel confident that we can have the deliverable complete by mid December Please let me know if it is ok to draw up an engagement letter with these terms As for the new idea I have been spending much of my time lately helping merchant power generators think about ways to leverage the value of their asset positionmarket intelligence It occurred to me that there is an analogy here that relates to pipelines Pipelines have operational events that may have market effects Unplanned outage majorminordurationnotice Planned outages over a certain volume Operation flow order SOLs Key Plants backed in Takes over schedule volumes key points Linepack levels Pressure drops at key points Since the pipeline is exposed to gas prices through gas needed for operational purchases it is rationale that these phenomena would be studied and acted read traded upon in order to minimize TWs market risk read generate income TW can setup a risk management group to execute this idea It is not unusual for a pipeline to have a risk management function Duke Pipeline for example has a VP of Risk Management for Pipelines These events would be studied in the follow way Determine whether there is a correlation between an event and gas pricesbasis differentials based on historical data For those events that have a strong correlations develop a trading strategy around the relationship Backtest the trading strategy against historical data determine profitability For operational events that are applicable setup a system to execute program trading that is directly linked to SCADA Secondary benefits of this risk management trading strategy would be developing the expertise to make decisions related to benefits of selling the capacity physical vs through basis derivatives or some combination of both Steve if you are interested in this idea I can start drawing up a workplan for this study Dave David A Foti Accenture Allen Parkway Suite Houston Texas Forwarded by David A FotiInternalAccenture on AM David A Foti To PM cc Subject Contract Review MM RCM Steve I have some ideas related to ECS contract restructuring options If your team is available I could come by next Friday midmorning or later to start discussing with them On the administrative side I am working to nail down the lowest hourly rate I can get for you I would probably propose something like hours rate in the engagement letter This amount of time should be adequate to put together a short study on your different options I will send you a engagement letter this week I would just need to get that signed by you before Friday Also please let me know if you need any other information on the Reliability Centered Maintenance idea as you prepare to talk to the other officers Dave David A Foti Accenture Allen Parkway Suite

Original Message From ENRON Sent Wednesday October PM To Harris Steven Subject TW Earnings Idea Twist on ECS Deals Hello Steve Havent talked to you in a while hope all is well A quick update I moved over from EES to Accentures Energy group about six months ago and have been focusing on Trading and Risk Management Pipeline Optimization projects I had an idea which I thought you might find interesting Accenture has a strategic alliance with a technology provider for Reliability Centered Maintenance RCM basically an advanced methodology technology for making maintenance decisions They are the standard for electric TD companies and are now trying to move over into the pipeline segment This is how I was thinking about using them to structure a deal TW hires Accenture to implement RCM RCM Benefits are determined by a pilot project weeks Accenture pays TW upfront for years of projected benefits from RCM say MM as part of our guarantee TW pays Accenture an annual licensing fee for the use of RCM over the next years which will flow into the next rate case I am currently pursuing another project with Ben Asante so I am around the Enron building Let me know if you would like to get together to discuss further Hope all is well Dave mobile David A Foti Accenture Allen Parkway Suite Houston Texas This message is for the designated recipient only and may contain privileged or
