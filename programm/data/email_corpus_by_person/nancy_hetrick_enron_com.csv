Connie ENRON Sent Friday October AM To Hetrick Nancy Subject PUC Concerns with V Cutover Nancy We believe a good starting point for next weeks workshops as well as Staffs discussions with the Commissioners would be a chart that breaks out the following Functions that will not change from Texas SET v to v Functions that will experience minor changes from v to v Functions that will experience significant changes from v to v Functions that new to v Wed like to answer the following questions with respect to such a breakout Can we reasonably expect that functions in Categories and will function with the same degree of reliability in v as they currently do in v What are the risks associated with the failure of functions in Categories and What are the ramifications of those failures What workarounds are conceivable What workarounds are practical Additionally Staff has the following concerns and questions with the options presented thus far for cutting over to Texas SET Version None of the schedules thus far have allowed sufficient time for production testing Market participants have suggested that weeks is appropriate There is high probability based on problems encountered with v during the pilot of major problems with transactions Since nonchoosing customers will be migrated to the affiliate REP in January this coupled with the first concern above poses a significant risk This risk is most significant since the largest percentage of transferred customers is in the residential class There is no plan that clearly lays out riskstradeoffs if the migration doesnt work For example if the cutover fails would parties continue with If so what are the ramifications for full market open on and on market participants who have not tested on v Is market open as defined by participants tied absolutely to cutting over to v What happens if the market opens under v What functionality would be missing Are there easy workarounds for this missing functionality Is it a possibility that everyone cuts over to v on Dec the pilot caps are lifted for all customer classes but residential customers are still left with bundled rates nonPTB but not transferred until February What are the risks and ramifications for each market participant and each customer class if frame of testing has major problems that cannot be corrected for release in v by the timelines
