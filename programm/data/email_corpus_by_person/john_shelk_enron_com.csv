responses to the California situation and other related energy issues The star witness was Gov Davis Others were Govs Martz of Montana and Hoeven of North Dakota against price caps Sens Murkowski Murray and Cantwell Washington States attorney general Oregons PUC chairman and the five FERC commissioners Once Davis left after several hours of testimony and two rounds of questions most of the press and audience left Enron was mentioned several times as follows Sen Thompson the Ranking Republican mentioned Lockyers Spike comments in the context of asking Gov Davis about why business would make new investments in the state when on top of the regulatory uncertainty there is the broader political hostility expressed in this way by state officials Davis had two chances to disavow Lockyer and did not Thompson gave him a second chance when he basically repeated the question and made specific reference again to Spike asking Davis if FERC acted this week because of the AGs Spike comments The first time Davis said that the people he represents are mad they want him to fight back this is rough business the industry people are used to a wildcatters environment things occassionally get out of hand and we are not going to take it On the second instance he said that the state was building new power plants and investment was not being diminished Sen Bennett RUT did an excellent job questioning Gov Davis about his handling of the situation using quotes from California newspapers to make the case that Davis was slow to act He also argued that the state had done a bad job as a power purchaser contrasting the states recent year contract with Constellation for power at peak and offpeak with Enrons willingness last year to sell them power for five years at The Republicans also pressed Davis on why he attacks outofstate generators but is not nearly as vocal about California munis who charged even more Davis said they should make refunds too While not saying Enron by name Gov Davis did make a comment about companies with trading floors that compete with the New York Stock Exchange with meteorologists and very talented people who might have the ability to find loopholes in the new order He said this in answer to a question about what FERC needed to do now that the new order was issued and he said watch out for manipulation by those subject to the order Sen Thompson pressed Washington State AG Gregoire about why she appeared to be investigating outofstate suppliers even though they had a small percentage of the market in her state with lots of document requests and other investigative action while not doing the same to others During that exchange either Thompson or the AG I think it was the AG said Enron had over billion in sales to Washington State Enron was not on the list of companies Thompson or the AG said were subject to her information demands She said she would be expanding her inquiry though Highlights and Analysis As started at yesterdays Senate Energy hearing the mantra from the Western Democrats was we want our money back Chairman Lieberman and others pressed FERC about how California could get refunds and the same in other Western states particularly Oregon and Washington Chairman Hebert said that the settlement conference process would allow all parties to raise all issues including refunds in California and outside California He said that the conference could include issues that the commission could not act on itself including refunds not otherwise allowed under the Federal Power Act Chairman Lieberman vowed to keep the committee active in overseeing FERCs activities in implementing the new order particularly as it relates to refunds While he acknowledged that new legislation could not apply to pending cases he seemed inclined to pursue legislation to repeal the day delay in the Federal Power Act relating to refunds Commissioner Wood spoke of the need to increase the penalities and enforcement tools available to the commission including the ability to order short suspensions of authority for regulated entities to transact business treble damages and other administrative penalties There was also discussion among the committee and commissioners about beefing up FERCs market monitoring capabilities so that it acted more like the SEC FCC and FTC than it has in the past The Democrats on the committee and among the witnesses said that FERCs latest order is a step in the right direction None of them called for legislative action on price caps as proposed by Sens Feinstein and Smith Sen Murkowski had done a good job of taking the wind out of the legislated price cap sails by saying at the start of the hearing when he testified that the bills sponsors had pulled back from swift action when they spoke at yesterdays hearing Davis did say the still thinks that costbased rates are better but he said the new order is some price relief and that it corrected the mistakes in the April order There was some discussion of natural gas again Davis said that FERC should now turn its attention to natural gas He said that El Paso controlled too much of the capacity until recently He called on FERC to enforce laws against price manipulation Note we have had several back channel reports that the Lieberman committee intends to look into the El Paso and Williams cases now at FERC about alleged affiliate issues There was some discussion of the termination of the new FERC order Lieberman pressed several witnesses about whether Sept is too soon Davis said it was and that they needed at least until the end of if not more time and that order should apply until California has enough new generation in place Hebert did not back down when pressed by Lieberman later in the hearing saying there needs to be a deadline to get action on new supplies however he and the others basically said they would revisit the issue if events warrant Several times Sen Lieberman and others said they generally support deregulation but that the effort to get more states to do so will never happen if the price situation is not brought under control and public confidence restored Gov Davis did throw a few kind words toward Pres Bush and Pat Wood saying that each was open to doing more about the high cost of natural gas to California including the possible reimposition of rate regulation of transportation to California He said he liked Pat Wood and he noted that FERC did not take serious price mitigation action until the two new Bush appointees were on the commission Lieberman asked the Washington State AG whether the Justice Dept or the FTC were doing anything to address high energy prices She said not to her knowledge even though she has asked them to do so We can expect a Lieberman et al request for Justice and FTC involvement going forward I suspect While Chairman Liebermans tone and closing comments were in the nature of his normal thoughtful tone it is clear that he and others see this as a major issue for them to ride He commended FERC at the end of the hearing for doing their best but pledged he would stay involved closing the session with a smile and the words see you soon

His name is Bil l Burks and he is the Associate General Manager of the City Utilities of Sp ringfield Missouri In his comments he stated that his utility was whole heartedly supporting FERC moving forward to push for on RTO and then went on to talk about how Missouri is going to continue to suffer from seams iss ues if FERC doesnt stick to their guns on just a few major RTOs He stated that flexible standardization would not work and that the FERC should put out a platform of standardized tariffs and if there was some uti lity or group of stakeholders that thought they were special or

Week Summary of Standards and Practices Panel RTO Week Day October Afternoon Session Standardizing Markets Business and Other Practices Panelists for this discussion were Sarah Barpoulis PGE National Energy Group William P Boswell GISB Bill Burkes substituting for David J Chr istiano City Utilities of Springfield Missouri David N Cook NERC Gene ral Counsel Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection LeRoy Koppendrayer Minnes ota Public Utilities Commission and Marty Mennes Florida Power Light Co mpany General Observations The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time Massey left la te in the afternoon FERC Staff was active in the discussion however t he commissioners were very active as well asking perhaps as much as of all questions There was a general consensus that standards were needed much discussion focused simply on how much and by who The Commission seeme d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo rward and how far they needed to go Panelists urged the need to mover for ward as quickly as possible but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward There was d iscussion on identifying which industry group NERC or GISB would take the reins in the future On an interesting tangential note there was noticea ble conflict between NERC and GISB with veiled insults between the two org anizations somewhat common during the discussions FERC Deliverables A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne eded from the Commission Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical The first major topic was How many RTOs What is their scope All panel ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b y FERC in strong definitive language N o one offered any specific langua ge but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement The next topic was What will be standard market design Panelists varie d on this but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent Some urged f or one mandatory design for North America one supported a set of rigid sta ndard designs one supported a single design with requests for exceptions followed by an indepth review process and one seemed to prefer the curre nt situation The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha t the industry needed to move forward They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions asking questions like Do we need to issue a MegaOrder that addresses all these issues and How much detail do you need us to provide General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas Kormos and Burkes went so far as t o say FERC should Mandate as much as they felt comfortable and then go a little further Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea bu t in general did not oppose the concept citing only general warnings and t he need for cautious investigation One item of interest Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th e RTO Design and RTO Implementation section would address many of the que stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design Korm os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry The se ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote and asked the following questions Congestion Management When Operational Security Violations occu r how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i s nonetheless efficient Will LMP based systems be standard or will there be others that must be accommodated Transmission Service Are transmission services required to sch edule covered schedules only or are they risk management tools protect ing from congestion charges both covered and uncovered schedules are a llowed Loop Flows Are contractpath based or flowbased transmission services appropriate If contractpath based how are parallel path issues to be addressed Grandfathered Transmission Service Should contracts existing pr ior to RTO development be transferred or is there an equitable way to reti re those contracts Are there other solutions Energy Imbalance Markets How are imbalance markets to function Will they serve as realtime energy markets support unbalanced schedules be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service require balanced sche dules or will they be required at all Ancillary Services Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services required to schedule or will they be treated primarily as fina ncial instruments protecting against realtime POLR charges Losses Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce ss or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs but technical ly unwieldy NonJurisdictionals How are nonjurisdictionals to be integrate d into the new world Should systems be designed with the assumption that nonjurisdictional will be part of an RTO Or should they be designed to t reat each NJE as a separate entity Hopefully FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica l questions in an assertive manner and give some solid direction in which to move Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions pointing out that vague answers ie do congestion management will t ake a year or two to resolve but specific answers ie LMP with financi al hedging instruments will take only months The Commission asked Mike about moving forward and he told them that effectively it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed Now for a funny point One of the commissioners I think Breathitt refer red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest Kormos flat out said My profession is understanding how power systems work and I dont believe that that statement is true He then backpedaled a bit and said t hat it would need more study but he stood by his statement that the assert ion by the Northwest interests was false NERC and GISB A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standardse tting organization Massey went so far as to ask Are we looking at a bea uty contest between NERC and GISB Cook and Boswell then went into severa l short polite jabs at each others organizations Other participants cont inually reiterated the need for ONE INDEPENDENT organization Interesting ly Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI SB while Cook preferred to only talk about the new structure of NERC and did not focus on its history Brownell offered some nottoosubtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions ie were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder GISB was easily a ble to say they were not but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation Poin t Brownell Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC playing Dave Cooks yesm an He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERCs suppos ed successes such as TLR and ETag If staffers have tenure they will likely remember that these successes have not been so successful resulti ng in several filings and interventions We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues but general consensus was that I could not be done There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISBEISB The arguments began winding down after a some time and Boswell strongly ur ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward NERC s omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position In general I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top Let me know if you have any questions Andy Rodriquez Regulatory Affairs Enron Corp

speakers Senator Voinvich Supports Congress passing a national energy policy by the end of the year His concerns include need to develop nuclear energy said he and Sen Lander are working on a bill impact of high energy prices on low income consumers and small businesses bc we are too reliant on natural gas did not offer any alternatives to heating w gas the need to harmonize energy and

<6233595.1075852002229.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,john.shelk@enron.com,2001-06-20 10:37:00,Todays Senate HearingSenate Governmental Affairs Committee held an unusually long hearing today am to pm on FERCs responses to the California situation and other related energy issues The star witness was Gov Davis Others were Govs Martz of Montana and Hoeven of North Dakota against price caps Sens Murkowski Murray and Cantwell Washington States attorney general Oregons PUC chairman and the five FERC commissioners Once Davis left after several hours of testimony and two rounds of questions most of the press and audience left Enron was mentioned several times as follows Sen Thompson the Ranking Republican mentioned Lockyers Spike comments in the context of asking Gov Davis about why business would make new investments in the state when on top of the regulatory uncertainty there is the broader political hostility expressed in this way by state officials Davis had two chances to disavow Lockyer and did not Thompson gave him a second chance when he basically repeated the question and made specific reference again to Spike asking Davis if FERC acted this week because of the AGs Spike comments The first time Davis said that the people he represents are mad they want him to fight back this is rough business the industry people are used to a wildcatters environment things occassionally get out of hand and we are not going to take it On the second instance he said that the state was building new power plants and investment was not being diminished Sen Bennett RUT did an excellent job questioning Gov Davis about his handling of the situation using quotes from California newspapers to make the case that Davis was slow to act He also argued that the state had done a bad job as a power purchaser contrasting the states recent year contract with Constellation for power at peak and offpeak with Enrons willingness last year to sell them power for five years at The Republicans also pressed Davis on why he attacks outofstate generators but is not nearly as vocal about California munis who charged even more Davis said they should make refunds too While not saying Enron by name Gov Davis did make a comment about companies with trading floors that compete with the New York Stock Exchange with meteorologists and very talented people who might have the ability to find loopholes in the new order He said this in answer to a question about what FERC needed to do now that the new order was issued and he said watch out for manipulation by those subject to the order Sen Thompson pressed Washington State AG Gregoire about why she appeared to be investigating outofstate suppliers even though they had a small percentage of the market in her state with lots of document requests and other investigative action while not doing the same to others During that exchange either Thompson or the AG I think it was the AG said Enron had over billion in sales to Washington State Enron was not on the list of companies Thompson or the AG said were subject to her information demands She said she would be expanding her inquiry though Highlights and Analysis As started at yesterdays Senate Energy hearing the mantra from the Western Democrats was we want our money back Chairman Lieberman and others pressed FERC about how California could get refunds and the same in other Western states particularly Oregon and Washington Chairman Hebert said that the settlement conference process would allow all parties to raise all issues including refunds in California and outside California He said that the conference could include issues that the commission could not act on itself including refunds not otherwise allowed under the Federal Power Act Chairman Lieberman vowed to keep the committee active in overseeing FERCs activities in implementing the new order particularly as it relates to refunds While he acknowledged that new legislation could not apply to pending cases he seemed inclined to pursue legislation to repeal the day delay in the Federal Power Act relating to refunds Commissioner Wood spoke of the need to increase the penalities and enforcement tools available to the commission including the ability to order short suspensions of authority for regulated entities to transact business treble damages and other administrative penalties There was also discussion among the committee and commissioners about beefing up FERCs market monitoring capabilities so that it acted more like the SEC FCC and FTC than it has in the past The Democrats on the committee and among the witnesses said that FERCs latest order is a step in the right direction None of them called for legislative action on price caps as proposed by Sens Feinstein and Smith Sen Murkowski had done a good job of taking the wind out of the legislated price cap sails by saying at the start of the hearing when he testified that the bills sponsors had pulled back from swift action when they spoke at yesterdays hearing Davis did say the still thinks that costbased rates are better but he said the new order is some price relief and that it corrected the mistakes in the April order There was some discussion of natural gas again Davis said that FERC should now turn its attention to natural gas He said that El Paso controlled too much of the capacity until recently He called on FERC to enforce laws against price manipulation Note we have had several back channel reports that the Lieberman committee intends to look into the El Paso and Williams cases now at FERC about alleged affiliate issues There was some discussion of the termination of the new FERC order Lieberman pressed several witnesses about whether Sept is too soon Davis said it was and that they needed at least until the end of if not more time and that order should apply until California has enough new generation in place Hebert did not back down when pressed by Lieberman later in the hearing saying there needs to be a deadline to get action on new supplies however he and the others basically said they would revisit the issue if events warrant Several times Sen Lieberman and others said they generally support deregulation but that the effort to get more states to do so will never happen if the price situation is not brought under control and public confidence restored Gov Davis did throw a few kind words toward Pres Bush and Pat Wood saying that each was open to doing more about the high cost of natural gas to California including the possible reimposition of rate regulation of transportation to California He said he liked Pat Wood and he noted that FERC did not take serious price mitigation action until the two new Bush appointees were on the commission Lieberman asked the Washington State AG whether the Justice Dept or the FTC were doing anything to address high energy prices She said not to her knowledge even though she has asked them to do so We can expect a Lieberman et al request for Justice and FTC involvement going forward I suspect While Chairman Liebermans tone and closing comments were in the nature of his normal thoughtful tone it is clear that he and others see this as a major issue for them to ride He commended FERC at the end of the hearing for doing their best but pledged he would stay involved closing the session with a smile and the words see you soon

responses to the California situation and other related energy issues The star witness was Gov Davis Others were Govs Martz of Montana and Hoeven of North Dakota against price caps Sens Murkowski Murray and Cantwell Washington States attorney general Oregons PUC chairman and the five FERC commissioners Once Davis left after several hours of testimony and two rounds of questions most of the press and audience left Enron was mentioned several times as follows Sen Thompson the Ranking Republican mentioned Lockyers Spike comments in the context of asking Gov Davis about why business would make new investments in the state when on top of the regulatory uncertainty there is the broader political hostility expressed in this way by state officials Davis had two chances to disavow Lockyer and did not Thompson gave him a second chance when he basically repeated the question and made specific reference again to Spike asking Davis if FERC acted this week because of the AGs Spike comments The first time Davis said that the people he represents are mad they want him to fight back this is rough business the industry people are used to a wildcatters environment things occassionally get out of hand and we are not going to take it On the second instance he said that the state was building new power plants and investment was not being diminished Sen Bennett RUT did an excellent job questioning Gov Davis about his handling of the situation using quotes from California newspapers to make the case that Davis was slow to act He also argued that the state had done a bad job as a power purchaser contrasting the states recent year contract with Constellation for power at peak and offpeak with Enrons willingness last year to sell them power for five years at The Republicans also pressed Davis on why he attacks outofstate generators but is not nearly as vocal about California munis who charged even more Davis said they should make refunds too While not saying Enron by name Gov Davis did make a comment about companies with trading floors that compete with the New York Stock Exchange with meteorologists and very talented people who might have the ability to find loopholes in the new order He said this in answer to a question about what FERC needed to do now that the new order was issued and he said watch out for manipulation by those subject to the order Sen Thompson pressed Washington State AG Gregoire about why she appeared to be investigating outofstate suppliers even though they had a small percentage of the market in her state with lots of document requests and other investigative action while not doing the same to others During that exchange either Thompson or the AG I think it was the AG said Enron had over billion in sales to Washington State Enron was not on the list of companies Thompson or the AG said were subject to her information demands She said she would be expanding her inquiry though Highlights and Analysis As started at yesterdays Senate Energy hearing the mantra from the Western Democrats was we want our money back Chairman Lieberman and others pressed FERC about how California could get refunds and the same in other Western states particularly Oregon and Washington Chairman Hebert said that the settlement conference process would allow all parties to raise all issues including refunds in California and outside California He said that the conference could include issues that the commission could not act on itself including refunds not otherwise allowed under the Federal Power Act Chairman Lieberman vowed to keep the committee active in overseeing FERCs activities in implementing the new order particularly as it relates to refunds While he acknowledged that new legislation could not apply to pending cases he seemed inclined to pursue legislation to repeal the day delay in the Federal Power Act relating to refunds Commissioner Wood spoke of the need to increase the penalities and enforcement tools available to the commission including the ability to order short suspensions of authority for regulated entities to transact business treble damages and other administrative penalties There was also discussion among the committee and commissioners about beefing up FERCs market monitoring capabilities so that it acted more like the SEC FCC and FTC than it has in the past The Democrats on the committee and among the witnesses said that FERCs latest order is a step in the right direction None of them called for legislative action on price caps as proposed by Sens Feinstein and Smith Sen Murkowski had done a good job of taking the wind out of the legislated price cap sails by saying at the start of the hearing when he testified that the bills sponsors had pulled back from swift action when they spoke at yesterdays hearing Davis did say the still thinks that costbased rates are better but he said the new order is some price relief and that it corrected the mistakes in the April order There was some discussion of natural gas again Davis said that FERC should now turn its attention to natural gas He said that El Paso controlled too much of the capacity until recently He called on FERC to enforce laws against price manipulation Note we have had several back channel reports that the Lieberman committee intends to look into the El Paso and Williams cases now at FERC about alleged affiliate issues There was some discussion of the termination of the new FERC order Lieberman pressed several witnesses about whether Sept is too soon Davis said it was and that they needed at least until the end of if not more time and that order should apply until California has enough new generation in place Hebert did not back down when pressed by Lieberman later in the hearing saying there needs to be a deadline to get action on new supplies however he and the others basically said they would revisit the issue if events warrant Several times Sen Lieberman and others said they generally support deregulation but that the effort to get more states to do so will never happen if the price situation is not brought under control and public confidence restored Gov Davis did throw a few kind words toward Pres Bush and Pat Wood saying that each was open to doing more about the high cost of natural gas to California including the possible reimposition of rate regulation of transportation to California He said he liked Pat Wood and he noted that FERC did not take serious price mitigation action until the two new Bush appointees were on the commission Lieberman asked the Washington State AG whether the Justice Dept or the FTC were doing anything to address high energy prices She said not to her knowledge even though she has asked them to do so We can expect a Lieberman et al request for Justice and FTC involvement going forward I suspect While Chairman Liebermans tone and closing comments were in the nature of his normal thoughtful tone it is clear that he

timing of next weeks meeting to resolve the legislation reflects the legislative realities that the committees of jurisdiction in Congress will take up the realibility legislation along with other electricity issues as early as the second week of September In fact congressional staff in the Senate and House are drafting legislative language on electricity issues during the August recess They have pressed the coalition for a final work product I gathered that at least some of what Jeffspresentation to the NERC board would be about concerns matters beyond the legislation as such but since they go to the NERC boards operation and independence may go to our comfort level with NERC as the standards setting organization Given the issues and concerns that have been addressed and communicated to NERC and our preference for the PJM model as Jeff told John Q Anderson in the conference call I think NERC got the information it wanted to get out of the call even though it didnt like the answers ie whether Sarah and I have been faithfully representing Enrons position whether Enron supports an SRO type organization and whether there is anything they can do to get us on board Perhaps we should have another conference call early next week so that Sarah and I have our guidance from everyone going into the August th meeting For one thing we need to determine if we are in any position to provide detailed comments on the shortened NERC version at the August th meeting or whether we do not wish to engage them on what specific changes it would take to get us on board My sense is that since we have to deal with the players in the room on other issues our overall position will be strengthened if we have some specific comments to make to explain our decision not to support NERCs version even the shortened one Dont get me wrong we have plenty of good reasons not to I just wasnt sure how engaged we wanted to be in identifying changes that would bring us on board since I

restructuring was very positive Gov Taft and Chairman Schriber strongly endorsed FERCs recent moves regarding RTOs Also all talk on restructuring is to move forward and not backwards towards reregulation There was also consensus on adopting a national energy policy and many speakers linked a national energy policy to national security Following is a brief summary of comments from various speakers Senator Voinvich Supports Congress passing a national energy policy by the end of the year His concerns include need to develop nuclear energy said he and Sen Lander are working on a bill impact of high energy prices on low income consumers and small businesses bc we are too reliant on natural gas did not offer any alternatives to heating w gas the need to harmonize energy and environmental policies business and environmentalists need to come to the table very opposed to Sen Jeffords multiemissions bill called it a threat to Ohios economy said he is working with others on a compromise new source review problem needs to be fixed and if new ambient air standards go into effect then entire state of OH will be out of compliance Governor Taft Announced that he is forming a Federal Energy Policy Group to build consensus in Ohio on promoting the development of wholesale markets that will lead to strong retail markets PUCO Chair Schriber will chair this group The Governors staff learned this at the same time the rest of us did I have asked Tom Winters to follow through with the governors office to find out what their plans are I told him we likely would be interested in having a spot in the group He is going to look into this further and get back to me The Governor announced that transmission issues particularly RTOs are his highest priority He also announced the Smart Community Challenge Awards for communities that decrease energy use Also October is officially Ohio Energy Month Senate President Finan His comments focussed on the state making efforts to promote use of Ohio coal burning it cleanly and helping companies afford the environmental technologies so they can burn Ohio coal Speaker Pro Tem Cates Did not say much other than a coherent energy policy is absolutely necessary Consumers Counsel Tongren Took credit for success of municipal aggregation Wants to work with federal government on energy policy Laid out questions he has for state and national energy policy Rob thanked FERC for their work last week on RTOs Allen Hill CEO of DPL Said he was very encouraged by FERCs aggressive agenda and that it is important to get RTOs in place and operational as soon as possible He supports a national energy policy Says industry needs environmental certainty Said SB will survive bc it was based on consensus Ohio needs to finish rules on supplier defaults Jerry Jordan President Ind Petroleum Producers Assocation Urged Ohio to stick to the effort of electric restructuring He reviewed the history of gas restructuring in Ohio and

off all their old YK contingency plans and cash in on peoples fears to strengthen their position In any case I would suspect that a large RTO with a significant budget is much more likely to be secure than a dues based NERC Look at NERCs offices They are in a shopping mall How secure is that Last time I visited they didnt even have any sort of identity cards or badge system or anything the whole place was wide open Anyone could walk in off the street and shut down a large portion of NERCs infrastructure by just randomly unplugging computers Contrast that with places like ISONE and NYISO who have significant levels of security in their systems that are extremely sophisticated and complex Or compare that with the MISOs hardened facility capable of withstanding an F tornado hit You tell me whether NERC or RTOs are going to be more secure Dave is right on with his classification of the idea of NIMDA being an attack on the electric utility industry as preposterous Thats akin to saying that a chain letter is an attack on the banking industry because bank statements come in the mail And Dan points out a more valid thing to consider a terrorist isnt going to attack a tariff desk

September RE NERC Statements on Impact of Security Threats on RTOs The attached email in Microsoft Word form contains statements that NERC made during a recent meeting with members of the national press The statements concern NERCs view of the implications of terrorist threats for FERCs Four RTO policy set forth in its July th Order The statements also may bear upon the effort to establish a new standards setting organization particularly the possibility that NERCs responsibilities could be shifted to EISB Also attached is an article containing the views of RJ Rudden Associates Inc that discusses the risks associated with centralizing control center operations Specifically NERC representatives informed the press that on September the grid was the target of an insidious cyber attack that shut down some facilitiesfrom an information administration standpoint They noted that this resulted in service denials although it is not clear whether they indicated where or how much This event was attributed to the socalled NIMBA virus NERCs statements suggest a new strategy to preserve the role theyve played not only in security matters but possibly other aspects pertaining to reliability standards They warn against any immediate transition to fewer RTOs as envisioned in FERCs July th Order Moreover it is likely that NERC will argue that given its expertise and experience recent events make transitioning to a new standards organization EISB ill advised It is unclear what if any impact all this may have on RTO development the legislative effort to establish a new reliability standards body or the NERC Boards consideration of pending reform proposals at its October meeting However we can expect security related issues to be included in future discussions of

focus on it in his report there was an individual who sat on the panel from Missouri that did a fantastic job of supporting FERC and market postitions despite the fact that he is a public power guy His name is Bil l Burks and he is the Associate General Manager of the City Utilities of Sp ringfield Missouri In his comments he stated that his utility was whole heartedly supporting FERC moving forward to push for on RTO and then went on to talk about how Missouri is going to continue to suffer from seams iss ues if FERC doesnt stick to their guns on just a few major RTOs He stated that flexible standardization would not work and that the FERC should put out a platform of standardized tariffs and if there was some uti lity or group of stakeholders that thought they were special or unique or d ifferent then the burden of proff should be on them to petition FERC for a n exemption not the other way around Im thinking that this gentlemen would be an excellent choice for a committ

Week Summary of Standards and Practices Panel RTO Week Day October Afternoon Session Standardizing Markets Business and Other Practices Panelists for this discussion were Sarah Barpoulis PGE National Energy Group William P Boswell GISB Bill Burkes substituting for David J Chr istiano City Utilities of Springfield Missouri David N Cook NERC Gene ral Counsel Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection LeRoy Koppendrayer Minnes ota Public Utilities Commission and Marty Mennes Florida Power Light Co mpany General Observations The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time Massey left la te in the afternoon FERC Staff was active in the discussion however t he commissioners were very active as well asking perhaps as much as of all questions There was a general consensus that standards were needed much discussion focused simply on how much and by who The Commission seeme d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo rward and how far they needed to go Panelists urged the need to mover for ward as quickly as possible but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward There was d iscussion on identifying which industry group NERC or GISB would take the reins in the future On an interesting tangential note there was noticea ble conflict between NERC and GISB with veiled insults between the two org anizations somewhat common during the discussions FERC Deliverables A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne eded from the Commission Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical The first major topic was How many RTOs What is their scope All panel ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b y FERC in strong definitive language N o one offered any specific langua ge but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement The next topic was What will be standard market design Panelists varie d on this but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent Some urged f or one mandatory design for North America one supported a set of rigid sta ndard designs one supported a single design with requests for exceptions followed by an indepth review process and one seemed to prefer the curre nt situation The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha t the industry needed to move forward They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions asking questions like Do we need to issue a MegaOrder that addresses all these issues and How much detail do you need us to provide General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas Kormos and Burkes went so far as t o say FERC should Mandate as much as they felt comfortable and then go a little further Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea bu t in general did not oppose the concept citing only general warnings and t he need for cautious investigation One item of interest Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th e RTO Design and RTO Implementation section would address many of the que stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design Korm os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry The se ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote and asked the following questions Congestion Management When Operational Security Violations occu r how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i s nonetheless efficient Will LMP based systems be standard or will there be others that must be accommodated Transmission Service Are transmission services required to sch edule covered schedules only or are they risk management tools protect ing from congestion charges both covered and uncovered schedules are a llowed Loop Flows Are contractpath based or flowbased transmission services appropriate If contractpath based how are parallel path issues to be addressed Grandfathered Transmission Service Should contracts existing pr ior to RTO development be transferred or is there an equitable way to reti re those contracts Are there other solutions Energy Imbalance Markets How are imbalance markets to function Will they serve as realtime energy markets support unbalanced schedules be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service require balanced sche dules or will they be required at all Ancillary Services Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services required to schedule or will they be treated primarily as fina ncial instruments protecting against realtime POLR charges Losses Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce ss or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs but technical ly unwieldy NonJurisdictionals How are nonjurisdictionals to be integrate d into the new world Should systems be designed with the assumption that nonjurisdictional will be part of an RTO Or should they be designed to t reat each NJE as a separate entity Hopefully FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica l questions in an assertive manner and give some solid direction in which to move Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions pointing out that vague answers ie do congestion management will t ake a year or two to resolve but specific answers ie LMP with financi al hedging instruments will take only months The Commission asked Mike about moving forward and he told them that effectively it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed Now for a funny point One of the commissioners I think Breathitt refer red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest Kormos flat out said My profession is understanding how power systems work and I dont believe that that statement is true He then backpedaled a bit and said t hat it would need more study but he stood by his statement that the assert ion by the Northwest interests was false NERC and GISB A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standardse tting organization Massey went so far as to ask Are we looking at a bea uty contest between NERC and GISB Cook and Boswell then went into severa l short polite jabs at each others organizations Other participants cont inually reiterated the need for ONE INDEPENDENT organization Interesting ly Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI SB while Cook preferred to only talk about the new structure of NERC and did not focus on its history Brownell offered some nottoosubtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions ie were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder GISB was easily a ble to say they were not but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation Poin t Brownell Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC playing Dave Cooks yesm an He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERCs suppos ed successes such as TLR and ETag If staffers have tenure they will likely remember that these successes have not been so successful resulti ng in several filings and interventions We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues but general consensus was that I could not be done There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISBEISB The arguments began winding down after a some time and Boswell strongly ur ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward NERC s omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position In general I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top Let me know if you have any questions Andy Rodriquez Regulatory Affairs Enron Corp

developments the Aug nd introduction of an antiRTO bill or at least antimandatory RTOs and on a meeting I had yesterday afternoon with Andy Black the policy coordinator for Chairman Joe Barton on the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee to discuss their intentions with respect to electricity legislation this Fall HR Reps Tom Sawyer DOH and Richard Burr RNC On Aug nd the last day Congress was in session before the August Recess the above named members of the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee introduced HR the Interstate Transmission Act The legislation is bad because among other things it requires FERC to establish transmission pricing policies that provide incentives for voluntary participation and formation of RTOs with language prohibiting policies that have the effect of forcing transmitting utilities to join RTOs Also objectionable is that the bill would limit pancaking but at the same time require FERC to establish a reasonable transition mechanism or period for additive charges The legislation prohibits FERC from conditioning any order upon a transmitting utility being required to transfer operational control of jurisdictional facilities to an ISO or RTO The bill would require that participating transmitting utilities must approve the form structure and operating entity of any RTO In addition to the RTO language the bill has the old version of the NERC reliability legislation in it The bill also has a PUHCA exemption for RTOs repeals Federal Power Act sec on the disposition of property and includes the tax changes that IOUs seek for transfers of property to an independent transmission company Barbara Hueter advises that First Energy has its hq in Rep Sawyers district Rep Burr is from North Carolina so perhaps Duke had its utility hat on in working with him I am checking into where Duke is on this issue Rep Burr is the Vice Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and close to Chairman Tauzin so his support for this legislation is significant see Andy Black comment below Andy Black Meeting Andy is meeting with various trade associations this month to discuss electricity legislation He is only meeting with a few companies on a oneonone basis Enron Reliant Dynegy and TXU His timing is to have a legislative draft for Chairman Barton to review when Congress returns after Labor Day If Chairman Barton approves or makes changes the draft will be circulated to members of the subcommittee and the public for further comment The intent is to mark up an electricity bill this Fall so that if the Senate acts on electricity in its comprehensive energy bill the issue will be ripe for consideration in a HouseSenate conference committee Here is a run down of my comments and Andys comments on specific issues a RTOs Chairman Barton supports RTOs At a minimum the draft will affirm FERCs authority as the commissioners have requested Andy is considering going beyond that to mandate RTO participation Not sure he can hold that position in the subcommittee He is looking to Enron and others to help them explain and build support for RTOs Informed him of our initial informal coalition steps However Andy asked me to look at sec of the SawyerBurr referenced above which I realized after the meeting is the part that deals with incentive rates and negotiated rates to expand transmission and voluntary RTOs I have a call in to Andy to reconcile these statements since the SawyerBurr bill is based on voluntary RTOs Hopefully he is thinking of using the incentive and negotiated rate language and NOT the objectionable voluntary RTO aspects I will strongly encourage him to do the right thing in that regard b PUHCA The draft will use the Pickering bill HR Told Andy about our concerns with the record keeping provisions of that bill Will send him our legislative language to clarify these provisions so that they do not open up all of Enrons records even those unrelated to transactions with a regulated utility affiliate c PURPA Prospective repeal On back up power they are thinking of requiring that rates for back up power be just and reasonable until there is retail competition in the state d Interconnection They have received a proposal from Trigen that Andy says we will like I am contacting EPSA to get the details e Net Metering They are likely to include the Inslee bill to require net metering I explained our concern that the bills mandate applies to all retail energy suppliers including EES even though this should only apply to utilities with an obligation to serve that it does not make sense to mandate it on service providers like EES per Jims helpful comments yesterday I need to get more information to Andy f Transmission Jurisdiction Thankfully Andy is NOT going to use those portions of the bill as reported by subcommittee in the last Congress that gave use heart burn on jurisdiction Specifically the draft will not say FERC does not have jurisdiction over the transportation component of a bundled retail sale the draft will not get into the bundledunbundled issue at all The draft will bring munis coops and PMAs under the FERC umbrella for transmission jurisdiction purposes g Siting On siting Andy is thinking of some type of mechanism that would give a State one year before federal eminent domain attaches h Reliability On a negative note Andy intends to use the latest NERC reliability language because NERCs version has strong support among the Members of the subcommittee and no other alternative has emerged with political support ie not PJM I explained our concerns He said our best bet is for DoE or FERC to come forward to seek something other than the NERC version He said Members eyes glaze over on reliability with everything else on the plate i Negawatts I raised the absence of negawatts on his issue list He said he is open to considering it again but that there was left over political baggage and unresolved issues from when this was attempted during consideration of the California bill earlier this summer Your questions and comments on the any of the above are most welcome

that yes it does appear to address this tax issue involving interconnections at least in pa rt There is language in Title VIII on various tax issues One of them ex ludes from gross income certain amounts received by electric utilities spe cifically including connection fees In the example in the email the iss ue was not fees paid directly but assets paid for by the generator that ar e then transferred to the utility Will check on that angle In any event Title VIII while in the Barton bill is not in the jurisdict ion of Bartons subcommittee Instead the tax title would have to go thro ugh the Ways and Means Committee There were some energy tax provisions in the Housepassed energy bill last August Chris and I will consult tomorr ow to see if this issue was included in that bill Aside from the tax issue Barton bill would require the type of interconnec tion rulemaking that FERC is now conducting both for connections to local distribution and to transmission In each case the cost of interconnecti on would have to be comparable to what the utility charges others similarly situated I will go back to double check but off the top of my head I re call that the Bingaman draft

worked closely with other EPSA members over the past several years on problems that we have encountered in the interconnection procedures and IAs EEI will also make a presentation Additionally as you are probably a ware over the past several years we have discussed problems with FERC hotl ine and have also had FERC staff call us to inquire about general interconn ection issues this ANOPR is meant to address many of those issues At the end of the Nov meeting other meeting participants will have a br ief amount of time to raise issues Donna Fulton will attend for Enron F ERC then plans to convene a series of meetings to establish generic interco nnection procedures and parts of an IA results due to FERC Dec We wi ll then also submit Enron comments on the ERCOT IA and procedures by Dec FERC IS NOT addressing the cost issues during this stage of the proceedings therefore it will most likely not be dealing with the tax grossup and c rediting issues yet It plans to deal with cost issues in a subsequent rul emaking We certainly understand that cost issues are typically the most problematic part of interconnection negotiations but this is the way FERC wants to proceed FERC will continue to deal with cost issues in orders wh en disputed IAs are filed at FERC unexecuted By way of background on ERCOT as I understand it ERCOT basically rolls in the interconnection costs networktype upgrades to the entire grid throu gh TCOS an uplift However TCOS are not allowed to be unlimited ERCO T has the ability to decide whether the generator interconnection is in the best interest of the grid Some attribute all the new generation in ERCOT to this method We will need to formulate Enrons view in the next phase of the interconnection proceeding For Thurs meeting I think Donna should raise these issues While certain basic aspects of the IA should be standardized to eliminat e the waste of time we usually face dealing with the same problems over and over the IA should be flexible enough to allow for individual business ci rcumstances for example the notice to proceed that we have been including While having timelines and procedures are fine the larger problem has b een getting utilities to actually follow their own filed procedures for ex ample Entergy was one of the first to file procedures yet seems to have a problem sticking to their timelines This yet again means that RTOs are critical to stop the discriminatory practices and to provide incentives to treat us as customers There needs to be more discussion on best practice No below Energy r esource or capacity resource This should be reviewed in the context of FE RCs NOPR on icap Enron just submitted comments that capacity as a separ ate payment is not necessary in functioning markets In addition

James D Wehn Samuel Fillinger Mark Subject RE FERC rulemaking on Generator Interconnection I skimmed the attached NOPR looking for the approach FERC was proposing to take to the key issue we fought over here in CA a couple of years ago Alt hough I did not see the word congestion the implication of what I read i s that the generator would pay for his extension cord plus any congestion i mpacts that it makes on the grid The implication of the last statement is that the generator would put the grid back into the condition it was in b ut for the new generator That is great assuming I did not skim from too high an altitude Did I I also read the thing from the point of view of an issue that I had forgott en about until recently That is if the generator pays for all of this up grade and but for stuff and then gives it to the utility are there ta xes due on the gift When we developed our project in Pittsburg CA PG Es initial position was that we owed them for the upgrades AND for the tax es on the upgrades about additional charge which they turned ov er to the state and fed This is potentially A LOT of money to waste on an interconnect if it is an expensive one Working with Enrons tax dep t I do not remember specifically with whom we convinced PGE that taxes were probably not due for various reasons and we mutually agreed to get a private letter ruling from the IRS confirming We also agreed that IF the taxes were ever due that we would pay them I understand that that IRS ruling was put in abeyance pending some sort of law congress was consideri ng I may be making this up here as I go along because Calpine bought the project from us and I lost track of the various machinations The point of all of this Is it reasonable in this NOPR process on interconnection t o address the tax issue Is it too late Is it irrelevant to the FERC pro cess Does anyone know the status of the law making process I am concerned about taxes for two reasons First many of the opponents t o the proposed NOPR approach thought that all grid upgrades should be paid for by the utility and included in rate base In other words all gener ators are good and benefit the ratepayers On fundamental grounds they w ill resist paying for upgrades If they believe that they will get the ins ult after injury treatment pay for upgrades AND for taxes on the upgrades they will resist the NOPR more strenously FYI to everyone Calpine str ongly resisted paying for upgrades at Pittsburg and somehow got out of it And guess what Now with all of the new plants MW added by Calpine within a mile area of MW of existing there are congestion problem s around all of the projects just as we forecasted ISO is now considerin g adding a new zone andor charging PGE andor the projects for congestion Because PGE did not and probably never will in our lifetime add the g rid upgrades so as to include in ratebase the projects will be hurt Beca use all of this is not forecastable in the context of developing a project in a timely manner this outcome exactly as we had forecasted is why we s upported the approach in the proposed NOPR Second perhaps naively I am assuming that the tax issue is no different for gas pipeline upgrades than for electric transmission system upgrades On a project we are now develo ping in Roseville CA we are faced with significant gas pipeline system up grades in PGEs system Significant grossups for tax impacts of the gift are are being discussed as I remember for Pittsburgs electric transmissi on system upgrades Since it sounds like the same issue sure would be nic e if we could get some appropriate precedence going Any possibliity of de aling with the tax issues in this NOPR Original Message From Lindberg Susan Sent Friday October AM To Parquet David Hueter Barbara

Linda NRON Subject BartonTauzin letter to Gov Davis Committee News Release The Committee on Energy and Commerce WJ Billy Tauzin Chairman Chairmen Tauzin Barton Urge Gov Davis To Respond Immediately to Inquiries Washington July House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Bill y Tauzin RLA and Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee Chairman Joe Barton RTX today sent the following letter to California Governor Gray Davis July The Honorable Gray Davis Governor State of California State Capitol Sacramento California Dear Governor Davis As you know the Energy and Commerce Committee recently considered legislation containing several targeted measures to assist California in resolving its energy supply crisis One of these measures wa s a temporary safe harbor provision effective only upon the Californ ia Governors request to protect critical extended emergency operation of powerplants from challenges under the Clean Air Act During the course of six hearings the Subcommittee on Energy an d Air Quality held on the California electric crisis including two hearings on draft legislation Members of the Committee repeatedly told California officials that these plants were vulnerable to legal challenge even with written agreements for extended operation between state air officia ls and the powerplants Nevertheless California officials testifying or providin g information on behalf of your state and your citizens claimed that such a safe harbor was not necessary I fear events have proven that on this important matter the concerns expressed by Members of our Committee were valid and that our interpretation of the legal jeopardy faced by California was accurate On June th several community groups filed a lawsuit in federal court agains t three electric generating units in California all located at the Potrero power plant site alleging multiple violations of the Clean Air Act for emergency extended operation On the same day the City and County of San Francisco filed formal notice that it would also pursue legal action agains t the three Potrero units All parties involved in the litigation strongly assert that the extended operation agreement between state air officials an d the Potrero power plant does nothing to prevent them from pursuing all available legal remedies under federal and state law The legal action against the units located at the Potrero power plant claims that extended operation violates limits contained in federal a ir permits and seeks fines potentially amounting to millions of dollars Understandably as a result of this potentially huge fine the operator of the Potrero power plant has filed a motion with the Federal Energy Regulato ry Commission to clarify that it will not be required to operate the three generating units even during periods of electrical emergency Thus the mere filing of this lawsuit could have a nearterm impact of the amount of power available in California Perhaps even more troubling is our understanding that substanti al amounts of electric power produced by peaking plants and other facilities i n California could also be subject to similar legal action The California Independent System Operator lists units representing megawatts of peaking units which are subject to legal limits on their total hours of operation In addition several new units are being brought online this summer without required Clean Air Act control equipment According to incomplete information we received from the California Air Resources Board CARB generating units have been identified in California which may exhaust allowable annual operating hours contained in their air permits pri or to this summers peak demand period These units may represent up to of generation approximately the critical operating reserve shortfall of a Sta ge III electric emergency Although presented with written requests for information from t he Committee on April CARB could not or would not provide the Committ ee with precise information on units that may have been offline due to permit limits a projection of the number of generating units that will face permi t constraints that could cause such units to be offline the amount of generation associated with these facilities the possible impact of these units on system reliability and additional information related to air emissions from facilities that will be operating under modified conditions We believe that in the face of the pending legal action it i s even more important that such information be accurately and objectively determined As we mentioned above over several months in the spring and early summer of this year the Committee sought Californias support of an extremely narrow safe harbor provision to protect the extended operation of certain powerplants Regrettably the Committee did not receive any suppor t from your administration for such changes to the law as represented by the testimony and responses attached to this letter Instead witnesses representing California claimed such a legal safe harbor for emergency generation was unnecessary even if it could only be granted during perio ds of emergency and upon your personal request to the Environmental Protection Agency EPA It appears now that citizen groups in California as well as the City and County of San Francisco do not believe that the actions tak en by you your state agencies and local air quality districts are legal The pending litigation challenges the very agreements which California previous ly claimed granted sufficient legal flexibility to keep these units ru nning during times of emergency It is time then to reconsider this issue So that the Committee may understand the extent of this critica l situation and respond accordingly we would ask for your consideration of t he following We would urge you to reply fully to the Committees earlier requests that CARB specifically identify each generating unit and power plant that is in jeopardy of exceeding limitations contained in the Clean Air Act and thus potentially subject to the citizen suit provisions of the Act We should have a clear idea of the power production which is at risk In view of the fact that we have moved from the world of legal theory into the world of legal fact and several California generating units are no w being sued under authorities contained in the Clean Air Act we ask whether you will now favor creating in federal law a limited environmentallyneutr al safe harbor for these essential units which could only be effectuated upon your request to EPA Finally we would ask that if you support such legislation that you wo rk with our Committee so that we can truly try and resolve this issue in a targeted provision which helps ensure the lights stay on in

Linda NRON Subject BartonTauzin letter to Gov Davis Committee News Release The Committee on Energy and Commerce WJ Billy Tauzin Chairman Chairmen Tauzin Barton Urge Gov Davis To Respond Immediately to Inquiries Washington July House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Bill y Tauzin RLA and Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee Chairman Joe Barton RTX today sent the following letter to California Governor Gray Davis July The Honorable Gray Davis Governor State of California State Capitol Sacramento California Dear Governor Davis As you know the Energy and Commerce Committee recently considered legislation containing several targeted measures to assist California in resolving its energy supply crisis One of these measures wa s a temporary safe harbor provision effective only upon the Californ ia Governors request to protect critical extended emergency operation of powerplants from challenges under the Clean Air Act During the course of six hearings the Subcommittee on Energy an d Air Quality held on the California electric crisis including two hearings on draft legislation Members of the Committee repeatedly told California officials that these plants were vulnerable to legal challenge even with written agreements for extended operation between state air officia ls and the powerplants Nevertheless California officials testifying or providin g information on behalf of your state and your citizens claimed that such a safe harbor was not necessary I fear events have proven that on this important matter the concerns expressed by Members of our Committee were valid and that our interpretation of the legal jeopardy faced by California was accurate On June th several community groups filed a lawsuit in federal court agains t three electric generating units in California all located at the Potrero power plant site alleging multiple violations of the Clean Air Act for emergency extended operation On the same day the City and County of San Francisco filed formal notice that it would also pursue legal action agains t the three Potrero units All parties involved in the litigation strongly assert that the extended operation agreement between state air officials an d the Potrero power plant does nothing to prevent them from pursuing all available legal remedies under federal and state law The legal action against the units located at the Potrero power plant claims that extended operation violates limits contained in federal a ir permits and seeks fines potentially amounting to millions of dollars Understandably as a result of this potentially huge fine the operator of the Potrero power plant has filed a motion with the Federal Energy Regulato ry Commission to clarify that it will not be required to operate the three generating units even during periods of electrical emergency Thus the mere filing of this lawsuit could have a nearterm impact of the amount of power available in California Perhaps even more troubling is our understanding that substanti al amounts of electric power produced by peaking plants and other facilities i n California could also be subject to similar legal action The California Independent System Operator lists units representing megawatts of peaking units which are subject to legal limits on their total hours of operation In addition several new units are being brought online this summer without required Clean Air Act control equipment According to incomplete information we received from the California Air Resources Board CARB generating units have been identified in California which may exhaust allowable annual operating hours contained in their air permits pri or to this summers peak demand period These units may represent up to of generation approximately the critical operating reserve shortfall of a Sta ge III electric emergency Although presented with written requests for information from t he Committee on April CARB could not or would not provide the Committ ee with precise information on units that may have been offline due to permit limits a projection of the number of generating units that will face permi t constraints that could cause such units to be offline the amount of generation associated with these facilities the possible impact of these units on system reliability and additional information related to air emissions from facilities that will be operating under modified conditions We believe that in the face of the pending legal action it i s even more important that such information be accurately and objectively determined As we mentioned above over several months in the spring and early summer of this year the Committee sought Californias support of an extremely narrow safe harbor provision to protect the extended operation of certain powerplants Regrettably the Committee did not receive any suppor t from your administration for such changes to the law as represented by the testimony and responses attached to this letter Instead witnesses representing California claimed such a legal safe harbor for emergency generation was unnecessary even if it could only be granted during perio ds of emergency and upon your personal request to the Environmental Protection Agency EPA It appears now that citizen groups in California as well as the City and County of San Francisco do not believe that the actions tak en by you your state agencies and local air quality districts are legal The pending litigation challenges the very agreements which California previous ly claimed granted sufficient legal flexibility to keep these units ru nning during times of emergency It is time then to reconsider this issue So that the Committee may understand the extent of this critica l situation and respond accordingly we would ask for your consideration of t he following We would urge you to reply fully to the Committees earlier requests that CARB specifically identify each generating unit and power plant that is in jeopardy of exceeding limitations contained in the Clean Air Act and thus potentially subject to the citizen suit provisions of the Act We should have a clear idea of the power production which is at risk In view of the fact that we have moved from the world of legal theory into the world of legal fact and several California generating units are no w being sued under authorities contained in the Clean Air Act we ask whether you will now favor creating in federal law a limited environmentallyneutr al safe harbor for these essential units which could only be effectuated upon your request to EPA Finally we would ask that if you support such legislation that you wo rk with our Committee so that we can truly try and resolve this issue in a targeted provision which helps ensure the lights stay on in California this summer Thank you in advance for your consideration of our requests Sincerely WJ Billy Tauzin Chairman Energy and Commerce Committee Joe Barton Chairman Subcommittee on Energy and Air

<8992970.1075849425716.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,john.shelk@enron.com,2001-06-26 02:14:00,Follow Up On California Information Cc up on the Monday conference call discussion yesterday with Rick and others about nailing down the numbers and documentation so we can feed the Hill information on the mistakes Governor Davis made last year and this year on power supply contracts As I understand it there are two aspects of this The offer of Enron and others last year to sell power to California utilities for cents per kw Failure to accept these offers resulted in higher power costs in the range of billion as I recall from yesterdays call The long term contracts that California signed this year after taking actions and making statements that drove up the forward price curves are now under water to the tune of billion On both counts we will be pressed for assumptions and documentation to pursue these arguments which parallel the comments made by senior management in Capitol Hill meeting last week We will work on back up on this end but we would greatly appreciate your assistance in this regard as well With Congress out of session starting COB on Thursday we will need information pulled together by tomorrow COB to get the final product in the hands of congressional types and others who can use it on a timely basis Thanks
