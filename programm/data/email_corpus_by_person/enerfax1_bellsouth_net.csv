proceeding a month after it began Both El Paso and the California PUC have painted contradicting versions of events and the hearing looks no cl oser to conclusion than when it began El Paso is attempting to discredit a study prepared by The Brattle Group a Massachusetts consultant hired by Edison to find evidence that El Paso Merchant wielded market power It du tifully concluded that soaring California prices were not caused by regular market forces and pointed to a conspiracy to widen borderbasin price spr eads As part of El Pasos effort to tarnish the study a professor of pol

California must not be full El Paso Merchant must have unutilized but available delivery ri ghts and Other shippers must have fully utilized their delivery rights The final condition he says proves

billion power industry may have hit a sna g after a couple Democratic senators claimed it could contain regulatory lo opholes The Democrats say that the provision would allow any affiliate of a utility holding company that held investment securities of companies with an indirect interest in the electric or natural gas utility business to av oid registering with the SEC In a letter to the SEC the senators argued th at such an unregistered company would not be subject to the same regulation s as other investment companies They allege that it creates potentially da ngerous loopholes in the system of investor protection that has enabled the mutual fund industry to grow successfully over the last years A House energy subcommittee is expected to hold a bill writing session next month t o formulate a federal power deregulation plan The SEC was also asked to re think its support for repeal of the s Public Utility Holding Act The a ct was cre ated to protect consumers from some utilities which issued stoc ks and bonds based on shaky assets evaded state regulations and quickly e xpanded their holdings through questionable financial deals House Republic ans contend the law is outdated and inhibits the creation of bigger more e fficient power markets Before Enrons collapse some Democrats also support ed repealing the law The power industry also has lobbied for years for the law to be struck down The Senators claim that Enron followed in the foots teps of utility holding companies in the Depression years by creating a hig hly complex corporate structure for the apparent purpose of obscuring signi ficant information from investors and engaging in selfdealing transactions with affiliated entities In a SEC report contended that the public utilities holding act could be

lower but it may take months to do it he cautioned Other traders are more optimistic Longer ter m Im bullish says John Beaver President Private Futures Group Oklahoma City Its more difficult to be bullish on the front of the board but lookin g at the charts it suggests that prices may be set to rise Theres a gap on the weekly chart between and on the weekly chart week endin g January and January and if prices could fill that gap it would be a positive sign that prices were set to move higher he said A gap is a pattern on the price charts followed by market technicians The idea is that the gap may act as a barrier to in this case further price advances Once the gap is filled however a potential limitation to price advance s has been removed and prices would be empowered to move

attempting to discredit a study prepared by The Brattle Group a Massachusetts consultant hired by Edison to find evidence that El Paso Merchant wielded market power It du tifully concluded that soaring California prices were not caused by regular market forces and pointed to a conspiracy to widen borderbasin price spr eads As part of El Pasos effort to tarnish the study a professor of pol

California must not be full El Paso Merchant must have unutilized but available delivery ri ghts and Other shippers must have fully utilized their delivery rights The final condition he says proves

attempting to discredit a study prepared by The Brattle Group a Massachusetts consultant hired by Edison to find evidence that El Paso Merchant wielded market power It du tifully concluded that soaring California prices were not caused by regular market forces and pointed to a conspiracy to widen borderbasin price spr eads As part of El Pasos effort to tarnish the study a professor of pol

California must not be full El Paso Merchant must have unutilized but available delivery ri ghts and Other shippers must have fully utilized their delivery rights The final condition he says proves that market power is impossible to es tablish CAMINUS ENERGY SOFTWARE SHOWCASE HOUSTON TEXAS Youre Invited To a four hour exposition of software and services that will set the new s tandard for the

up a trade down to I look for a slow deteriorating front end of the board he noted Im back in a be arish mode and I think were headed below I believe that there is a probability the market will work lower but it may take months to do it he cautioned Other traders are more optimistic Longer ter m Im bullish says John Beaver President Private Futures Group Oklahoma City Its more difficult to be bullish on the front of the board but lookin g at the charts it suggests that prices may be set to rise Theres a gap on the weekly chart between and on the weekly chart week endin g January and January and if prices could fill that gap it would be a positive sign that prices were set to move higher he said A gap is a pattern on the price charts followed by market technicians The idea is that the gap may act as a barrier to in this case further price advances Once the gap is filled however a potential limitation to price advance s has been removed and prices would be empowered to move higher I dont have any interest in being short the market at the level I dont wan t to be in a trade that may only make or cents and have to worry abou t it he said If you are a commercial trader are

remove existing exemptions and put the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in charge of overseeing all energy derivative transactions conducted on multilateral markets and electronic trading

the electric power supply but those fears were never realized Now utilities are preparing for the next wave of development of these facilities that house computers used to process and store digital information for the Internet according to the latest in a series of E Source reports from Platts A series of studies titled Delivering Energy Services to Internet Hotels and Other HighDensity Electronic Loads explains why those anticipated electric loads never materialized Many of the data centers that were planned for were never built Those built and operating are running at low occupancy rates Now utilities are preparing for a future wave of data center development as the economy improves and demand for Internetbased services increase accordingly The amount of power drawn by microprocessor chips continues to rise and so the computers installed in future data centers may de mand much more power than those installed today However a future power crunch is unlikely as utilities are already preparing for the next wave of expansion Utilities are instituting infrastructure charges that shift risk from the utility industry to the data center developers They are also encouraging their data center customers to use new more efficient electronic technologies that only recently came onto the market BR BFONTFONT COLOR BACKffffff styleBACKGROUNDCOLOR ffffff SIZE PTSIZE

between January and January an extended holiday weekend The low price for the March contract on January was but the high price on January was thus a cent gap or area where no trading took place was left on the chart Todays trading also left a gap between the low and Fridays high of The significance of the gaps is that typically buying demand is so great or selling pressure so heavy that the market will gap higher or lower with the next days trading opening well above the previous days high or substantially lower than the low of the day before The gap on the March daily chart from should be a good reference point for support A gap was also left in todays trading The area between to is good intermediate support These gaps are significant in that they are holding said Beaver Other traders arent such strong believers Gaps are almost always filled if for no other reason than markets go up and down You wait long enough and they will be filled the question is when said a Houston

former CEO Jeffrey Skilling vigorously defends Enrons accounting methods and touts the partnership deals now linked to its collapse The tape raises questions about Skillings recent testimony to lawmakers in which he said he knew of nothing wrong with Enrons finances when he resigned last August citing personal reasons In a transcript of the tape Skilling responds to an Enron employees concern about a Wall Street Journal article The September story discussed Enrons use of an accounting method that books longterm contracts as current income The article also said Enron would have had a nd quarter loss if not for million in unrealized gains from risk management activities However Skilling says the story is just totally without merit adding that Enrons accounting is conservative and the company provides more data in its annual report than anyone in a transactionbased industry He then concludes that the company is in a strong position from an accounting basis During the same meeting Skilling tells employees the company will be bringing in partners to help Enron leverage its capital in its new Enron Net Works division Earlier this month in testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee Skilling said he was not aware of any inappropriate financing arrangements designed to conceal liabilities or overstate earnings Skilling is likely to be asked again about

ffffff SIZE PTSIZE FAMILYSANSSERIF FACEArial LANGBPRICES AT KEY LEVELBBR PP ALIGNLEFTBR Since late January natural gas futures have made an impressive advance of over cents under fundamental conditions that appear to be unsupportive of increasing prices Although students of the laws of supply and demand would require a shift in production consumption or other economic variables to revise their assessments of natural gas prices market technicians see the situation from the standpoint of only analyzing price behavior or variables derived from price movements I look at a number of different tools but there is a beautiful down trendline that projects lower prices says an Oklahoma City analyst The big debate as prices move up is that although there are overlapping technical patterns the current rise may be the fourth wave higher of a five wave pattern down and there is one more new price low coming The counter to that argument is that if prices reach and hold above prices will not make that final fifth wave down and that there is a bigger rally coming A close over per MMBtu not just a trade over is one issue that we are studying carefully he said Prices maybe at a pivotal point It will be key to see how prices handle themselves in the mid s Theres a very good chance that prices will retreat to the low s I am in a negative mode on this market But if we close above the trendline at then I will take a neutral to positive stance on this market BR PP ALIGNCENTERBCHECK OUT FREE TRIAL OF BR GASTRADER NEWSLETTER AT GASTRADERNETFONTFONT COLOR BACKffffff
