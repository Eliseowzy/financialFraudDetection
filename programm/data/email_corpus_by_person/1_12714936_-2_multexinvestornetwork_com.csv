and they are most bullish on shares of companies whose earnings growth is especially strong Thats a major reason why tech stocks have been in the doghouse lately Earnings have been heading south Whether or not you want to invest in tech now generally depends on how patient you are If youre willing to get in early and wait until earnings recover and estimates get revised upward something that will probably be occurring around mid this is a great time to jump in If youre not so patient you have to agonize trying to guess the timing of recovery Click here to read more articleaspdocidnd

rally By Charles Payne founder CEO and principal analyst Wall Street Strategies With Thanksgiving smack dab in the middle of the week it was hard determining what the market wanted to do or where investors heads were at After all the market seemed to be running on empty until the holidayshortened Friday session when the market zoomed Of course sticking with the engine analogy naysayers will say that the market was just rolling downhill benefiting from an abbreviated session that saw lighterthannormal volume I would agree that Fridays session wasnt an applestoapples comparison with regular sessionsit was more like running a soapbox derby racer versus an openwheel Indytype car that the market typically runs during a full session According to those folks that dont believe in the current market rally Fridays results were amusing and even entertaining but of no enduring value It would be easy to write the session off as a dayrace that held little value in the grand scheme of things but that would be a big mistake In the soapbox derby gravity draws the homemade racers down a modest hill The same could have happened to stocks on Friday Instead stocks climbed up that same modest hill Stocks defied both gravity and the naysayers by trading higher and higher as the day went on There is a message in that achievement I think it tells us that when left to its own devices the market wants to rally higher Sure when there are earnings reports economic data brokerage downgrades wars unemployment fear and warnings from corporate America the race becomes akin to handling a highperformance race car and turning corners at miles an hour It isnt as easy as it looks Click here to read more articleaspdocidnd INVESTMENT IDEAS Models of success Surviving Internet players have
