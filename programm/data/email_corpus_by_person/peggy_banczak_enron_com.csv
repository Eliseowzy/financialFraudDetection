<9278.1075853241903.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,peggy.banczak@enron.com,2001-01-25 09:07:00,Amparo Appeal Cc an email from Rogelio Lopez Velarde summarizing the current status of the Amparo proceeding related to the Vitro project The attached analysis clearly differs from the information provided by the Lopez Velarde firm at the end of December when they indicated the Amparo proceeding should be dismissed by the end of January As I believe you are aware the dismissal with prejudice of the Amparo proceeding is a condition precedent to first disubursement under the Vitro Loan Agreement Although there are still many other conditions that must be satisfied before first disbursement can occur we do not anticipate that six weeks will pass before such conditions have been satisfied Therefore I contacted the inhouse attorney for the lender the InterAmerican Development Bank to discuss the status of the Amparo proceeding with him At my urging he has agreed that the InterAmerican Development Bank will waive the dismissal of the Amparo proceeding as a condition to first disbursement and will instead require that the proceeding be dismissed prior to second disbursement I have been informed that second disbursement will not occur until at least a month subsequent to first disbursement In such case it is anticipated that the waiver of this condition to first disbursement will provide sufficient time for the docket to be cleared and for the Amparo proceeding to be dismissed prior to second disbursement The project company will be required to request in writing that the InterAmerican Development Bank waive this condition precedent and such written request will be prepared after a review to determine whether other waivers may be requested but in sufficient time for the InterAmerican Development Bank to process the request through their internal channels prior to the date of first disbursement Should you have any questions or comments please do not hesitate to contact me Forwarded by Peggy BanczakHOUECT on PM Rogelio Lpez Velarde AM Please respond to Rogelio Lpez Velarde To Peggy Banczak cc Subject Amparo Appeal Dear Peggy Last Friday Jorge Canals and I met with the clerk of the First Circuit Court of Appeals for Mexico City to discuss the appeal filed by the petitioner Consorcio Desarrollo Econmico Mexicano SA de CVThis clerk is in charge ofpreparing the resolution for the judge that will be presenting the case before the other two judges that compose thecourt of appeals The purpose of this first meeting was to deliver copies of all of the other cases that have been dismissed and to deliver a Memorandum of Law that we prepared for him As you know it is important that the court of appeals becomesaware about the fact that the same petitioner has filed almostidentical Amparo complaints and that all of them have been dismissed with prejudice there is only one pending an appeal This is relevant because in all of these cases the courts have dismissed the complaints based on the same grounds lack of standing and therefore such cases were never published As we have monitored the clerk confirmed to us that our case is number in the docket Unfortunately and since the docket order cannot be changed the clerk believes that the case may be resolved in about weeks As discussed before we are planning to meet with the sitting judge inchambers next week along with the General Counsel of the Energy Regulatory Commission to see what we can do to expedite the resolution of the case and more importantly to make sure that the complaint is conclusively dismissed with prejudice as required under the financing agreements Very truly yours Rogelio LopezVelarde Hernn Gonzlez Lopez Velarde Heftye Abogados Guillermo Gonzalez Camarena No Piso Col Santa Fe Centro de Ciudad Mexico DF Telephone Fax email The information contained herein may be confidential andor privileged This information is intended to be reviewed only by the individual or the entity to which is addressed If the reader of this email message is not the intended recipient or a representative of the intended recipient you are hereby notified that any review dissemination or copying of this email message or the information contained herein is prohibited If you have received this email message in error please immediately notify the sender and delete this communication from your system
