met less than a week ago on Wednesday May during the OECD Forum in Paris Im an independent consultant and innovator with a special interest in energy and new technologies I have more than ten years experience in research and innovation in economics business and technology I attended the session on energy you chaired during that OECD Forum After the session I had a discussion with you Unfortunately your time was too short You gave me your card and asked me to write you As I told you I think I can add value to your staff bring new lines of businesses to Enron and with them many new clients And above all unprecedented profits I am writing you to propose my contribution in these purposes Im mainly making three proposals to Enron Working for Enron as an external consultant Here I would rather like to work on assignments medium or long term with a preference for the following jobs risk assessment andor management strategic analysis on geopolitical macroeconomics and societal issues I think these are important tasks for a company like Enron The current problems with Enrons Dabhol power plant in the Maharashtra state in India stresses the kind of importance Im mentioning I can also conduct surveys and provide Enron with technical and fruitful information and policy recommendations Ive done a job like that recently on the oilpipeline project in Chad and Cameroon As you may already know this is a billion project recently launched with the support of the World Bank and led by three major energy firms Exxon and Chevron of the USA and Petronas of Malaysia I wrote a detailed and long report which combined public and private sectors concerns and also communities interests Having operations worldwide Enron I think needs the type of technical works Ive done on that major energy project I have a good expertise in energy economics I attend international congresses on that subject for instance in Boston in January Since more than five years as a journalist or as an independent consultant I have been covering the works and studies of or participated to workshops and seminar organized by the IEA International Energy Association I know Mr Robert Priddle IEA chair who also attended that energy session during the OECD Forum I know the work he and his team of experts have been doing Being fully employed by Enron In this respect I would prefer to work as a researcher for either Enron Project Development and Management or Capital and Risk Management departments In these fields Ive also innovated Ive created among concepts tools and processes For instance the Sensible Guide for Action This is a tool theoretically powerful and practically very efficacious Its main goal is to help decisionmakers in both private and public sectors The Sensible Guide for Action assists them in their approach to solve technical problems The SGA is a fiveleaf bough Ive also created a method to assess a firm capacity to create wealth This method can be adapted to fit some particular projects The method is very useful in countries where theres no stocks market and where capital markets are not sufficiently large Thats the case of underdeveloped countries in general where yet the energy demand if forecast to grow the most in the coming decades Enron cannot overlook this or miss the business and profit opportunities in this growth The Business of Businesses Dear Dr Lay if you accept this third proposal it will probably be the best investment Enron has ever made Im an independent researcher and entrepreneur with a strong quantitative analysis competence and a multidisciplinary background both by education and professionally Im a graduate in mathematics and in mechanical engineering University of Paris and also in business and economics Institut dEtudes Politiques of Paris In this third proposal Im bringing to Enron two key inventions Ive made two types of financial products targeting consumers and companies I believe they will interest Enron These products have a market potential worldwide unlimited They will create an entirely new industry the business of businesses Im currently looking for investors with whom I can launch those products We will be the world leader here and remain in that position for a long time before copycats try to reach us Ive created the products and nobody knows about them or about their extraordinary markets I started to talk to you about these products when we met but you were hurrying and the many solicitations and noises of the Forum made it difficult to explain my point Im writing you as you asked me because firstly I believe these products will interest Enron Secondly I know how these products will boost three types of Enron services Online Marketplace Broadband Services and Energy Commodities Plus these products and the business of businesses they create are an excellent placement for Enron Among the many reasons why I believe my products will interest Enron are these i Their market is global ii They are directly related to consumption and savings iii Theyre excellent saving vehicles for instance for pension or life insurance iv They concern payment transactions and transmissions And thanks to information technology costs here decrease while productivity will grow v They are both offline and online business These products will be excellent for Enron ebusiness vi I want to be and remain a global leader vii The products growth potential is borderless viii Theres no competitor and before copycats arrive we would have strongly imposed ourselves as The Leader and the Reference increasing chances that customers remain faithful to us ix My products will allow Enron to beat its competitors x Enron will earn a lot of revenues many new clients and very big and unprecedented profits Im looking for investors willing to put around million Given that the revenues generated can very rapidly reach the range of million to billion that initial million is a wise and very profitable investment If youre interested Im ready to present the products and its business scenario to you The business model is very innovative unprecedented These products market is the whole world But the first three markets I would like to attack are the UK Germany and moreover Japan Todays news about Japan is rather bad Economists and many observers see a declining Japan Me not They may be right from a pure statistical and macroeconomic viewpoint But they fail to see deeper They overlook the other face of Japan For my part I see great business opportunities in Japan today and for the coming decade Particularly for the financial products Im proposing These financial products I want Enron to launch with me in Japan perfectly fit Japanese consumption manners their problematic pension system and life insurance structure there Public pension systems are under pressure every where particularly in Japan In Germany they are trying to reform it But theres no consensus in the governments federal and states or in the Parliaments federal and states Last week Chancellor Gerhard Schrder won some parliamentary approval But the package he proposed is far from solving the issue In the meantime problems may accumulate the situation could worsen What seems sure is that in a foreseeable future governments not only in Germany but in all developed and ageing countries will no longer be able to pay pensions at the level they have promised or are continuing to promise An additional bad news even company pensions will suffer In todays Financial Times Tuesday May page Peter Thompson incoming chairman of the British National Association of Pension Funds warned UK workers that they would no longer rely on comfortable company He adds that many wold have to work until they were years longer than the current retirement age if they wanted to enjoy a financially comfortable old age Therefore workers and citizens should start right no to save for themselves My products are here the best saving vehicle I know And to what I know of Enron it seems to me that Enrons shareholders also will appreciate the kind of new business and investment opportunity Im bringing to their company They will allow Enron to create a new and unprecedented business model that all its competitors will envy In a way Enron will change for its advantage the way to do business in general and energy business in particular thanks to the business of businesses concept Ive elaborated Dear Dr Lay as I read in Enrons web site the list of awards you have received impressive Congratulations Two qualities common to all of them are leadership and creativity I wish these will help you to catch the wonderful opportunity Im bringing to you in order to allow Enron to accomplish a phenomenal progress Leadership and moreover creativity are also two qualities Ive been trying to put into practice This effort creates a sort of affinity between us Thus I think we can easily understand one another speaking in some way the same language Hence an additional reason that brings me to write you and to make my proposal directly to you Given what Ive learned of Enrons vision and values I would like to stress four of the twelve headings that are listed in Enron vision and values page innovation diversity change and excellence Four headings that are at work in each of the three proposals Ive just made to you When I knew you were coming to that Forum I prepared some materials for you and was ready to present my proposals to you in details and to answer all your questions Im still ready to do it Im even ready to come to Houston for that purpose In one recent Enrons ad I read Enron Endless possibilities Lets make it true Lets do it together Lets reap the enormous benefits of The Business of Businesses Thank you Best regards Francois Ndengwe rue de Cambrai Paris France Tel Mobile Email PS May you please find my rsum here attached Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at rsumdoc
