operate it They wont purchase materials until their well comes in Pogo anticipates the well should be completed in about a week and a half Just to recap we will need a chromatograph sulphur monitor water monitor flow control positive shutin and a means of overpressure protection The chromatograph will require commercial electricity Operation of the facility without the above will have to be

Pogo Interconnect Michelle I was wondering where we stand now on the Pogo interconnect South of WT on the West Texas Lateral Per our phone conversation a few days ago it sounded like the day landowner notification would be the biggest hold up What will be the design capacity for the interconnect I think you told me but I cant find it in my notes My understanding is that there will be a chromatograph sulfur monitor water monitor flow control and a way to shut in if pressure reaches our MAOP Also who will own and operate the station Let me know if Im off base on any of this or what Ive missed and also dont hesitate to call if you need anything Please let us know as things progress Thanks Arnie Work Home Cell Page

operate it They wont purchase materials until their well comes in Pogo anticipates the well should be completed in about a week and a half Just to recap we will need a chromatograph sulphur monitor water monitor flow control positive shutin and a means of overpressure protection The chromatograph will require commercial electricity Operation of the facility without the above will have to be
