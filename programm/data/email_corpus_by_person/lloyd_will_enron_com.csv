<6212638.1075848309227.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,lloyd.will@enron.com,2001-02-13 10:02:00,Utility Spotlight Tx dereg different than Cal Forwarded by Lloyd WillHOUECT on PM Dick S George on AM To DS George cc Subject Utility Spotlight Tx dereg different than Cal CC list suppressed Compassionate Competition Utility Spotlight Maybe its the new tenant in the White House Or maybe its just the natural rivalry between Republican pork rinds and Democrat brie and Chablis At any rate around midJanuary I found my email box stuffed with pushed press releases touting the Texas solution to utility restructuring According to the clippings the Lone Star State has at last created a regional power market that will actually workand with no help from California One such clipping is a new consultants study commissioned by the Association of Electric Companies of Texas It checks off all the mistakes that California made one by one and then purports to show how the Texas model sets things right This study provides an effective analysis of the course Texas has followed on the road to competition versus how it was done in California said John Fainter president of the AECT It provides compelling evidence that Texas is on track to achieve significant benefits from competition But as I see it the Texas law Senate Bill the Texas Electric Choice Act signed in by thenGov George W Bush contains the same basic failing as did Assembly Bill the California lawit creates a tariff structure for Texas that will surely run aground if electricity prices dont behave as expected Just like California the Texas law creates a rate freeze keyed to revenue levels set under the old regulated regime and then mandates a guaranteed rate cut on top of that for residential and small commercial customers percent in Texas instead of percent as in California good until Jan both with adjustments allowed for fuel cost increases So if power prices in Texas should spike out of control between now and more than warranted by fuel costs you could have the same mess as in Californiautilities buying high and selling low Yet the Texas model does lack one drawback It doesnt have FERC Thats because Texas enjoys its own private power grid the ERCOT ISOformed by the Electric Reliability Council of Texaswhich operates entirely within the state and thus stands largely exempt from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission That gives Texas an advantagea stateregulated ISO dedicated to state interests WE DONT PERCEIVE ANY IMMEDIATE THREAT OF GENERATION SHORTAGES Thats what I heard from Bill Bojorquez ERCOTs director of settlement when I talked with him on Jan ERCOT is generally seen as friendly to merchant generation and the PUC has already OKd standards for ERCOT for generation interconnection to help create a climate that encourages construction of new power plants Bojorquez calls ERCOT the nations largest ISO in terms of load peak demand last summer of MW and tells how its doing things differently from other regions For instance ERCOT will create no central power exchange or auction market for wholesale power or ancillary services We wont settle any markets says Bojorquez And ERCOT will rely on socialized uplift charges to recover congestion costs beginning June when pilot programs start up in Texas for retail electric choice and continuing at least through It will not create a scheme for tradable transmission congestion rights TCRs unless congestion costs exceed million in any month period However Bojorquez concedes that ERCOT is transitioning to a new single control area and is building new control area facilities in Wheeler Texas with a backup office in Austin That effort proved a budget buster in California And ERCOT offers another unique feature As I learned from two technology experts from Lodestar which has signed software deals with the ISO ERCOT will perform all the forecasting load profiling and customer aggregation and will initiate most of the required data transfers between utilities suppliers and the scheduling coordinators known in Texas by the delightful acronym of QSEpronounced as quesywhich stands for qualified scheduling entity According to Steve Doroff Lodestars senior vice president of product development and Jason Iacobucci product manager at the company the Texas law barred utilities from passing along to their ratepayers any new cost incurred for any new services associated with retail choice That rule was enough they said to convince the utilities to delegate all the ordinary marketing functions to the ISO including the development of data formatting and communications protocols between suppliers utilities and scheduling coordinators for customer enrollment and load and revenue estimations using electronic data interchange EDI and XML software systems This feature has proved a godsend to the Texas market says Lodestar It centralizes the myriad of data transfers under the control of one playerwith one software networkinstead of fragmenting the job among various utilities marketers and aggregators and new players such as the meter data management agent as in California That means Texas will be spared the trouble of having to estimate and allocate the dollar cost of sales and marketing functions between utilities and unregulated retailers That task has become a minefield for PUCs See News Digest Jan p Nevertheless the retailers suppliers and utilities are free to develop their own software systems to interact with ERCOT If the QSEs are smart they wont take ERCOTs word for it Doroff told me Theyll do their own calculations THIS SCENARIO MAY BE MORE PROBLEMATIC FOR TEXAS THAN CALIFORNIA says Mark Krebs the outspoken attorney from Laclede Gas Here Krebs was talking about generation siting not ISO market design Yet his words show that Texas eventually may face the same problems we saw last year in California Writing on Nov on behalf of the American Gas Cooling Center Krebs told Jim Linville of the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission that the new draft rules proposed in Texas in November governing air emissions for distributed generation and smallscale electric generation comments taken until Feb might spell trouble for the state See wwwtnreestatetxus Krebs criticizes the Texas policy of forcing all DG plants statewide to comply with emissions rules designed for the HoustonGalveston ozone nonattainment area where many cogeneration and DG units are planned The potential impact writes Krebs would appear to be a ban upon all DG with the illusory exception of renewables and fuel cells on the ostensible grounds that as stated in the rule increased use of small electric generating units could undermine the emission reductions achieved with recently permitted combinedcycle power plants Senate Bill requires a percent reduction for NOx emissions and a percent cut for SO for grandfathered plants by May As ERCOT acknowledged in January in a study of generating plants in the DallasFt Worth area such rules may force power producers to take generating plants out of service in the Dallas area ERCOT commented further in a report on potential electric system constraints released Oct The DFW area could experience significant problems of peak period supply adequacy and voltage stability if significant amounts of the inarea generation become unavailable and no new inarea plants are built A number of new merchant power plants are being planned or built in North Texas but all are outside the metro area Greenfield sites for new generation development are

Meam dispute reflects more issues than money BY NANCY cotten HIRST Contributing Editor Delta Business Journal On the surface the dispute between the Municipal Energy Agency of Mississippi MEAM and the ClarksdaleYazoo City alliance appears to be about money and contracts Yazoo City and Clarksdale say they are pulling out of the eightcity energysupply association because they can provide power to their cities less expensively on their own MEAM says that they have the right to do this but only in accordance w ith the original MEAM contract which specifies that an entity can only withdr aw from the agency on condition of five years written notice This provis ion is typical of this type contract and lends a degree of stability to a coalition of political bodies Complicating the matter is the fact the MEAM has financed the upgrading of the generating facilities at Yazoo City and Clarksdale The total project upgraded three framefive gas turbines and added three waste heat recovery steam generators and cost in excess of million Part of this project w as paid for by MEAM revenues and the rest by a million bond issue The Greenwood generating facility was also part of this project but Greenwood elected to pay out of other resources rather than participate in the bond issue This leaves seven cities responsible for the bond issue an d dependent on the generating capacity of the two cities for a portion of their electrical power supply MEAM also purchases power from other resources to supplement the genera ting capacity of Yazoo City Clarksdale and Greenwood SEPA Cajun Electric Cooperative Oklahoma Gas and Electric and Entergy Services Inc are amon g recent suppliers with Entergy holding the largest contracts The exit of Yazoo City and Clarksdale from MEAM would hurt the organiza tion not only in loss of generating power but also in the loss of volume purchasing power from other supplies This type loss is one of the reasons for a fiveyear notice in the original contract The other cities involved in MEAM would be given time to deal with the adverse impact Clarksdale and Yazoo City however say that MEAM has broken its contra ct with them The two cities plan to form their own alliance to take advantag e of the savings that they perceive to be available in the deregulated wholesale energy market They also plan to buy out the bond issue obligati on from MEAM and finance it through revenue bond issues of their own At this point the story breaks down into two other issues One is a ver y legitimate difference in style of operation and management between MEAM
