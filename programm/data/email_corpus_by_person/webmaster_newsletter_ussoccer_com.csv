ways The first a jetblack Chevrolet S x pickup truck which Milbrett received for being named the US Soccer Chevrolet Female Player of the Year She upgraded from a fourdoor Not her style The truck represents the ruggedness of the fivefoottwo Milbrett who despite her small stature has scored career international goals good for sixth best in world history It also represents the outdoors woman and

newsfullstoryspsiNewsid POINTCOUNTERPOINT w journalists Jere Longman and Steve Davis Every month well pose a question or make a statement about something in soccer that will be debated on by two individuals from the same walk of life Be it a coach player general manager the two will each give their side of the story so to speak In this case weve enlisted the help of two soccer journalists In one corner wearing a Mia Hamm replica jersey under his shirt and blue blazer Jere Longman who covers international sport and the Olympics for the New York Times and whose extensive coverage of the Womens World Cup turned into a book about the US Womens National Team entitled The Girls of Summer In the other corner wearing a wornout replica of the now infamous US Mens denim star jersey Steve Davis a general columnist whos also been covering soccer for The Dallas MorningNews for over a decade and has covered the last two Mens World Cups This months question What event had a greater impact on soccer in the United States World Cup or Womens World Cup Jere Longman proWWC It is indisputable that the Womens World Cup had a greater impact on soccer in the United States than the mens World Cup The Womens World Cup produced an American champion and the American public loves a winner In three weeks without benefit of lavish pregame shows or newspaper special sections the Womens World Cup built a galvanizing momentum It went from almost zero on the public radar to a consuming moment that drew over fans to the final match against China at the Rose Bowl and attracted million television viewers Steve Davis proWC Back in the early s soccer was like the puny kid in junior high lots of potential plenty of good things ahead but still the last one picked for the team and having some trouble fitting in World Cup changed all that It was international soccers coming out party in the United States A land that respects the big event the colossal show began to see soccer as a sport it could learn to like For soccer fans it was their moment in the sun More importantly in the big picture Americans who wouldnt know a corner kick from a corner market tuned in to see what the fuss was about Until the United States wins a World Cup nothing else will be more influential in elevating the sports domestic profile Continue newsfullstoryspsiNewsid FROM THE BLEACHERS w PHILIPS Chant
