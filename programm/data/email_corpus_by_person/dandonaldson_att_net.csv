Hello this is Jeffrey of Enron Capital Trade Corporation may I speak with As the agent you hear most of your prerecorded voice segment and when it ends you simply speak and ask for the person being called And very importantly with PerfectScript every call automatically starts very positive and upbeat Additionally PerfectScript also allows agents to use at will other prerecorded segments eg responses to questions standard instructions disclosures etc throughout the day The other party does not detect any voice segment as being prerecorded because there are no clicks or beeps Agents talk less but since they prerecord these segments also using very positive voice inflections their presentations are also more effective and upbeat OTHER SIGNIFICANT FEATURES Interactive Voice Response IVR
