on action that every citizen can take in the event that the Florida recount confirms the election of George Bush but Al Gore fails to concede We all know what is going on in Florida and that the election hinges on the outcome I am writing you today to prepare us all for what we will have to do if what I think is going to happen actually does The recount which will be finished by pm Thursday will likely show Bush to be the winner once again with only a few thousand overseas ballots to be counted Those ballots will be overwhelmingly for Bush a minimum of and probably closer to If the count goes our way we have won this election This is when something critical happens Either Gore bows out gracefully or he doesnt and I can almost guarantee he wont These are people wedded to power who will only go down kicking and screaming They will use every legal maneuver in the book to steal the election In when Richard Nixon had every right and reason to challenge the election results he didnt for the sake of the country Expect no such noble behavior this time What will they try One bet is to find a friendly judge to throw out the Florida results on a flimsy premise They are already floating this as a trial balloon in the form of the allegedly confusing ballots in Palm Beach County I have seen the ballots they are not confusing in the least Indeed they are identical in form to the punchcard ballots used in Chicago and Cook County Illinois in this very election What is more it is just as likely that Palm Beach County voters who wanted to vote for Bush inadvertently voted for Nader All parties approved the form of ballot before the election The formofballot issue is a mere pretext for an effort a judicial invalidation of the Florida election While I hope this scenario doesnt come to pass I fear that it will and it will only have disastrous results for the country The election fight could drag on for months and actually be decided by a court If this comes to pass the vision of our Founders and the blood of patriots will have been betrayed Personally I am not going to stand for this and I hope you wont either The good news is that we are not without voice HERE IS WHAT MUST BE DONE if the vote count affirms Bushs election we allow a short grace period to see the reaction of the Gore camp If they have not graciously conceded after a few hours we must bombard the news media and our public officials AT EVERY LEVEL with phone calls of outrage that demand Gores concession I mean literally millions of phone calls We must jam their phone banks with calls There are millions of us so it shouldnt be too difficult While youre at it send emails to your local newspapers as well If it becomes widely reported and it will that there is a groundswell demanding that

today that they are going to court to get an additional inning added to the end of Game ofthe World Series The batting pitching and bench coaches for the Mets held a press conference earlier today They were joined by members of the Major League Players Union We meant to hit those pitches from the Yankee pitchers said the Mets batting coach We were confused by the irregularities of the pitches we received and believe we have been denied our right to hit One claim specifically noted that a small percentage of the Mets batters had intended to swing at fast balls but actually swung at curve balls It was clear that these batters never intended to swing at curve balls though a much higher percentage were not confused by the pitches Reporters at the press conference pointed out that the Mets had extensively reviewed film of the Yankees pitchers prior to the World Series and had infact faced the Yankees in interleague play earlier in the year The fact remains that some of the pitches confused us and denied us of our right to hit said the Mets batting coach The World Series is not over yet and the Yankees are celebrating prematurely Major League Baseball has reviewed the telecast of all the World Series games and recounted the balls and strikes called by the umpires of each game While some of the strikes called against the Mets were in fact balls there were not enough of them to change the outcome of the World series the commissioner said Another portion of the Mets legal claim stated that based on onbase percentage the Mets had actually won the World Series regardlessof the final scores of the games Its clear that we were slightly onbase more often than the Yankees said a Mets spokesman The World Series crown is rightly ours The manager of the Mets has remained in relative seclusion engaging in some light jogging for exercise He has stated that he believes we need to let the process run its course without rush to judgment
