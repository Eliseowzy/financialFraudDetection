<6594630.1075862095737.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,shayes@eea-inc.com,2001-07-31 06:42:45,Baseline TableI am writing to make a correction to yesterdays table Joel and I were looking over Connecticuts SIP rule because he noticed that seemed too early Connecticut defines baseline EGUs as those that were operating prior to and those units are allocated from the main trading budget The change I would like to note is that the state also distinguishes between new units and new EGUs New EGUs are anything operating prior to the season and they are allocated separately but also from the main trading budget The point is that anything prior to will receive allowances from the main pool they will just be allocated differently This wont affect our current tasks as Connecticut does not allocate until three months prior to the start of the season I am attaching a corrected table Thanks Sara
