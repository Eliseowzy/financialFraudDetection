each state Louisiana on verge of power crisis they say I think I might move to Nebraska Heres an attachment for easy distribution Heres the full article for quick scanning Monday April PM ET Power Situation by State By The Associated Press A statebystate look at the electric power situation for summer Alabama Blackouts and rolling brownouts are unlikely as utilities are required to maintain a reserve percent above what is needed to meet peak demand Residential and business customers will pay rates about percent above a year ago Alaska Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely Hydroelectric power is plentiful and generating systems are not being taxed Electric bills are expected to fall slightly Arizona There is little likelihood of a power interruption Utilities are prepared to handle the summer electricity demand and price caps prevent the major utilities from increasing rates Arkansas Blackouts and rolling brownouts are highly unlikely Electric bills are expected to rise percent as increased fuel costs are passed on to customers and because the summer is expected to be even hotter than a year ago when readings topped out at degrees in Little Rock California Forecasts of tight power supplies throughout the West have energy experts in California warning of statewide rolling blackouts this summer Power grid managers say concerted conservation efforts accelerated construction of new power plants and a bit of luck could help avoid blackouts Grid managers have already ordered rotating blackouts on four days since January Los Angeles will most likely be spared because the LA Department of Water and Power provides its own generation and isnt connected with the states grid Colorado The state is unlikely to experience blackouts or brownouts as percent of its power comes from coalfired plants Because of fixed longterm contracts for coal producers do not anticipate any fuel cost adjustments Connecticut No brownouts or blackouts are anticipated Brownouts are possible though if there is a prolonged spike in usage while power plants are down Utilities are under a mandatory price rate cap Delaware Enough power is available to avoid blackouts or brownouts but questions linger about whether utilities can deliver it Power is undergoing deregulation in Delaware and officials are concerned over the possibility of increased costs However under a deregulation law the cost of electricity is temporarily capped Florida Power outages are unlikely this summer as the state has reserves of about percent Utility companies have already increased their rates to cover higher fuel costs Unless coal and oil wholesale prices increase sharply consumers should not expect major rate increases Georgia Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely in the state because a forprofit regulatory system gives suppliers an incentive to build more generating plants Rising costs for natural gas which fuels almost all new electric plants could increase residential electric bills by percent Hawaii There is little likelihood of blackouts rolling brownouts or price spikes As an island state Hawaiis electricity system is not connected with that of other states Each island has its own generation system and supply is sufficient to meet demand Idaho There is little chance of blackouts or rolling brownouts but bills are rising The states largest utility wants a percent increase in residential rates Illinois Blackouts and rolling brownouts are unexpected as generating has been increased with a number of small peaker plants Homeowners shouldnt see a rate increase either electricity rates are locked in through under the states deregulation plan Indiana There is no expectation of blackouts or brownouts unless there are weeks of very hot weather or a power plant stops operating Utility companies are urging consumers to conserve energy and believe that will maintain the remaining state energy surpluses which have decreased from percent to percent over the past decade Iowa While the state does not expect blackouts this summer problems could occur as early as with serious capacity problems by Only singledigit price increases are expected this summer Kansas Blackouts and rolling brownouts are unlikely Kansas has never had a regional transmission blackout The size of electric bills will depend on how hot it gets and how much power customers use for air conditioning State law prohibits price spikes by regulated utilities which supply percent of residential customers Kentucky Electricity rates in the state are among the lowest in the nation but will likely rise between percent and percent by largely due to pollution control equipment upgrades There is adequate supply to avoid brownouts and blackouts this summer Louisiana No blackouts are expected this summer but utility officials say the state is on the verge of a power crisis unless more plants are built Consumer advocates say bills are likely to increase by as much as percent with very high natural gas prices and a hot summer in the forecast Maine Five new natural gasfired power plants are on line or coming on line soon reducing the prospect of any rolling blackouts No consumer rate increases are expected Maryland The Public Service Commission does not expect any service interruptions and believes electricity rates will not rise An electric deregulation plan implemented last year reduced and then froze rates for homes and businesses Massachusetts Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely because New England has added a half dozen new power plants in the past months enough supply to outpace demand surges Residents will likely see hefty rate hikes in the winter including as much as percent for some consumers Michigan Under a state law signed last year that will deregulate the electricity industry in utilities cut rates by percent and must cap those rates for five years Although demand for electricity is growing between percent and percent annually utilities say they have enough supply to meet demand Minnesota No blackouts or rolling brownouts are likely unless there is an extended heat wave or a power plant failure Electricity costs are expected to remain steady Many customers however will spend the summer months paying off natural gas and electricity bills from the long cold winter Mississippi Blackouts this summer are unlikely The two main power suppliers are taking measures to boost their reserves during peak summer months and new independent generating plants also are available Mississippi Power expects bills for customers to be percent to percent higher this summer Entergy another supplier has not filed its summer rate plan yet Missouri Utilities have plenty of generating capacity and supply contracts so service interruptions arent expected The state Public Service Commission says three large utilities are bringing new or expanded generating plants on line State law bars rate spikes by PSCregulated utilities so customer bills shouldnt reflect higher generating costs Montana Blackouts and rolling brownouts are not expected Montana Power customers will not see price increases this summer because the company is under a virtual rate freeze until July Flathead Electrics rates rose percent on April and an additional percent increase is possible this fall The two companies serve more than half of the customers in Montana Nebraska No rolling blackouts are expected Electric bills are not expected to increase since the states largest utility already increased its rates by percent to percent Nevada Major utilities are not expecting blackouts or rolling brownouts but monthly electricity bills for two power companies will go up percent to percent a month through September based on alreadyauthorized incremental rate increases State lawmakers reacting to Californias energy crisis are processing measures that would block deregulation from taking effect Gov Kenny Guinn also has said he will not let deregulation take effect under and laws unless hes confident consumers wont be harmed New Hampshire Blackouts are unlikely but customers may have to conserve power on very hot days As part of deregulation rates will drop about percent for customers of the states largest electric utility But rates could rise percent to percent for customers of the secondlargest utility New Jersey Blackouts are unlikely because of protections included in a yearold energy deregulation law Rates are capped until However regulators allowed utilities to raise natural gas rates over the summer percent a month through July to make up for money lost over the winter to skyrocketing fuel prices New Mexico Most of the state will escape power outages and rate increases during the summer months New York To head off potential power shortfalls in New York City the New York Power Authority is rushing to finish construction of small natural gas turbines Upstate New Yorks largest utility says it has enough power to avoid blackouts and brownouts during the summer Rates are regulated across much of the state but in New York City customers pay market prices North Carolina No blackouts or rolling brownouts are expected No major rate cases are pending in the state among the large regulated utilities North Dakota The state exports about percent of the electricity produced from seven coalfired power plants and is facing no power shortages this summer Electricity bills to power air conditioners are not expected to double from the previous summer the way natural gas bills doubled in the winter Ohio No blackouts or rolling brownouts are expected unless there is a long heat wave Prices for residential customers will remain flat for the next five years as part of a deregulation plan that took effect Jan Oklahoma There is little likelihood of blackouts or rolling brownouts between May and September but Oklahoma Gas Electric which has customers in the state and northwestern Arkansas expects electricity bills to be percent to percent above last summer Oregon Some extraordinary measures may be needed to ensure there are no rolling blackouts or brownouts this summer The measures could include curtailing hydroelectric programs that help salmon Price spikes could occur Pennsylvania No blackouts or brownouts are expected The state is a net exporter of power and has more than enough supply to meet demand Electricity bills will not rise this summer because power companies agreed to cap their rates in come cases through Rhode Island Blackouts are unlikely partly because of power plants built in New England in recent years Businesses could see electric rates rise as much as percent South Carolina With reserves of about percent there is very little chance of power interruption in the state Two major utilities have obtained rate increases of about percent to reflect higher fuel costs Increased demand from summer air conditioning normally pushes summer bills up percent by July South Dakota The majority of power comes from dams or coalfired generating plants rather than natural gas There is little chance of power shortages this summer and rates should remain stable Tennessee Tennessee Valley Authority electric rates were last raised in and should remain steady through the summer No blackouts or brownouts are expected Texas Additional transmission lines should reduce the likelihood of blackouts or rolling brownouts Certain fuel surcharges related to natural gas prices may cause higher electricity bills Utah Officials are counting on Californians to cut their energy use and free more power for use on the Western electricity grid to avoid blackouts or brownouts Utah power has received a percent interim rate increase and has percent rate increase awaiting approval Vermont Chances of blackouts or brownouts are low Much of Vermonts electricity is imported from Quebec though the state is also dependent on the regional power grid that serves New England Electric rates are regulated Virginia Blackouts and brownouts are highly unlikely because of an increase in the generating capacity of the states largest utility The size of electric bills will be determined by the weather and consumption not any change in rates which are capped through Washington Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely although utilities will have a razorthin power margin that would not withstand the loss of a power plant or transmission line Electricity largely comes from dams and a severe drought is reducing the water supply and raising prices Industrial and residential customers of public utility districts have already seen rate increases Rates could rise percent to percent this year West Virginia Generating capacity is sufficient to meet peak air conditioning needs None of the four major utilities has requested a rate increase Wisconsin Electric bills could run as much as percent higher this summer because of surcharges to cover rising prices for natural gas which fuels many plants State officials ordered utilities in December to increase their reserves from percent to percent to bolster reliability during the summer Wyoming Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely but could occur because the state grid is intertwined with other systems that could experience shortages Xcel Energy serving Cheyenne has applied for a percent price increase Similar filings are expected from other suppliers

Network May Doom Davis Power Deal By MIGUEL BUSTILLO and NANCY VOGEL Times Staff Writers SACRAMENTODoes it make sense for California to own only part of the states power grid That question is dividing state legislators and energy experts after Gov Gray Davis announcement of a billion deal to buy Southern California Edisons transmission lines The deal was reached Monday three days after Pacific Gas Electric Co balked at selling its power lines to the state and filed for bankruptcy Davis and Democratic legislators have pushed to purchase the whole transmission system owned by the states debtsaddled private utilities They reason that by owning the highway that electricity must travel to reach homes and businessesa mile web of wire that is the worlds fifthlargest coordinated power gridthe state would gain a negotiating advantage with the companies that produce the power If Californias transmission grid were entirely owned by the public political leaders believe the state could gain jurisdiction over key electricity issues now decided by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which has been reluctant to intervene in the energy crisis The state not the commission could then set its own transmission fees and control the flow of electricity across the grid Transmission charges bring in roughly billion a year for the three utilities With that money the state could not only repay itself for the purchase of the power lines but also fund system upgrades to unclog electricity bottlenecks that contribute to blackouts Owning the wires is a business and this business operates at a profit said Assemblyman Roderick Wright DLos Angeles who will head a series of committee hearings on the plan to buy the Edison lines Were not going into their yards and buying old trucks or something we are buying a vital piece of their electrical system However now that Pacific Gas Electric has opted to try to find a solution to its debt problem in Bankruptcy Court rather than continue negotiations with the state the prospects of California acquiring the entire system appear uncertain at best That is generating concern about what California is getting for its moneyand whether the state stands a chance of gaining any independence from federal regulatorsif it buys only the lines of Edison and San Diego Gas Electric The Edison deal which needs legislative approval is unlikely to garner a single vote from RepublicansAssembly Republican leader Dave Cox RFair Oaks calls the grid purchase a socialistic idea The plan may also encounter some Democratic opposition It was a tough sell to begin with and I think if you are going to only buy part it becomes a tougher sell said Assemblyman Dean Florez DShafter And some utility experts say California gains little if anything unless it acquires the whole system The motivating factor for buying the grid as opposed to hydroelectric power plants is because it addressed the central problem facing California The federal government is unwilling to crack down on the generators that are ripping us off and we need to take back control said UC Irvine professor Peter Navarro If you only buy of the system you might as well have nothing California would not be able to make some of the most critical upgrades needed to improve the flow of electricity if it did not acquire PGEs portion of the system The worst energy bottleneck in California is the notorious Path a series of highvoltage lines that move power between Southern and Northern California Path lies largely in PGEs territory Davis and some state legislators say California still has a chance to buy the entire grid Some in fact believe that the utilitys bankruptcy increases the likelihood of a deal Talks between Davis and PGE had faltered in recent weeks and a judge may have better luck bridging their differences Negotiations between the state and San Diego Gas Electric continue leaving the possibility of a deal with that utility But acquiring PGEs portion the largest and most important by far now requires the approval of a federal Bankruptcy Court judge And in that arena the state may have to compete with private companies for the lines TransElect a Washington company that wants to create a national network of independently owned transmission lines has offered to buy and operate the grids of Edison and PGE for a total of billion The company has also been in contact with the Davis administration on the possibility of leasing the lines from California if they are bought by the state For the state to buy any of the systems it needs approval from FERCfar from a sure thing The commission in recent years has encouraged states to put management of large sections of the nations transmission grid into private hands to achieve more efficient electricity flow Even if the commission approved the purchase the state may not receive any increased powers FERC would like to see one large regional transmission system in the West said David Clement a transmission expert with Cambridge Energy Research Associates If FERC were to unconditionally approve the sale then the transmission system owned by Edison would leave FERC authority However FERC could easily condition the sale such that the transmission grid remains under their authority Copyright Los Angeles Times

J NRON cc Subject CA Legislative Committee Hearing on California Border Gas Prices FYI This is the presentation that the Brattle Groupa consulting group that Edison has long used on gas issues in Californiagave last week to t he legislative committee investigating wholesale gas prices at the California Border The day following this presentation which was followed by a presentation by the California PUCs FERC lawyer the committee called El Paso and Dynegy to respond to Brattles and the CPUC FERC lawyers presentations Also attached is the best synopsis of the hearing that Ive seen in the press Best Jeff Competing evidence clouds Calif investigation Prompted in part by the California Public Utilities Commission the California Assembly has been scrutinizing the role that interstate pipelines have played in the states current energy crisis In the efforts to find a smoking gun legislators have leane d heavily on a report prepared by The Brattle Group a consultancy commissioned by utility Southern California Edison to dig up evidence of market power abuse But the states biggest transporter of gas to California El Paso Natu ral Gas is not ready to take the rap The pipeline has commissioned its own study which i t recently presented as evidence that it has not circumvented any laws or regulation As reported in both the trade press and national media SoCal Ed and the CP UC are pointing the finger of blame at El Paso for alleged manipulation of California borde r prices through affiliate deals and capacity hoarding And exhibit A in their case against El Paso is The Brattle Groups study of the California market Richard Zeiger a spokesman for Assembly Member Darrell Steinberg chairman of the California Assembly Judiciary Committee told Gas Daily that The Brattle Groups market study proved that the surge in gas prices at the California border was not caused by normal market forces GD His remarks followed an oversight hearing during which Assembly members questioned Dynegy and El Paso officials about their involvement in the California market El Paso presented a different version of events to the Assembly In a repor t presented to legislators a research group hired by El Paso concluded that a convergence of factors not a conspiracy caused the price runup Lukens Consulting Group a Houstonbased consultancy was retained by El Pa so to conduct work on several fronts In its study of the California market Lukens concluded that the increasing convergence of the gas and electricity businesses was one of the main culprits in the California gas price imbroglio Assemblyman John Campbell a Republican member of the oversight committee said he didnt see any smoking gun in either report We had our committee hearing and we certainly had a lot on the Brattle Study and a little on the Lukens study To some degree Im not sure that the California legislature is the best place to adjudicate the differences between these two studies Campbell said I believe FERC is looking at this situation and it would seem to me that thats the appropriate place Campbell said that the CPUC had been prodding the California legislature to give support to its claims of market power abuse by pipelines Its being pushed basically by the Public Utilities Commission here which believes that there was collusion by pipeline companies to push up gas prices in California he said The CPUC Campbell suggested sought satisfaction before the California assembly when it had failed on the federal level Theres a concerted effort not jus t on natural gas but on other things here in California for entities and organizations here to point the finger elsewhere for the problems that were having in this state and I think youre seein g some of that with the public utilities commission Whether either report wins over the public incensed by high natural gas prices is a different matter entirely In the meanwhile the dueling California market studies se em to have taken on a life of their own The Brattle Group Study for instance has become the center of a heavily litigated effort to force FERC to compel the release of market data by California market participants Following on a request by SoCal Ed which said it needed additional data to round out The Brattle Group report FERC Chief ALJ Curtis Wagner issued subpoenas to the other three major pipelines that serve the state as well as to Sempra Energy Trading Several parties resisted FERCs call for market information saying the requested data contained commercially sensitive information FERC allowed the discovery process to move forward but only after attaching strict data protection rules restricting access to evidence GD Critics of the pipeline industry have already suffered one setback in their case The commission recently dismissed the CPUCs claim that El Paso rigged the auction of a large block of pipeline capacity in favor of affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy In addressing the California Assembly representatives of Dynegy said that FERCs recent ruling on th e California border controversy obviated the need for more investigation The controversy however is far from over FERC last month also ordered a hearing into whether El Paso Natural Gas and its affiliates manipulated capacity to driv e up the price of gas delivered into California GD That hearing is

Date April To Jan SmutnyJones Steven Kelly Katie Kaplan Cc IEP Board Members From Julee MalinowskiBall Re Legislative Status Report Week Ending RECENT EVENTS Rule Never assume an issue is done until the ink is dry from the Governors signature and even then you never know The Senate Republicans agreed late this week to oppose SB x Sher which makes several IEPsponsored proposals to the siting process due to a controversial provision added in the Assembly Appropriations Committee regarding unemployment compensation Assembly Republicans let it slide on process because CMTA and the Chambers objections to the egregious language was so last minute Senate Republicans had more time to look at the issue and agreed not to let it go forward Since they control of the final vote in a bill requiring twothirds their united opposition stopped the bill one vote shy The author was granted reconsideration and discussions will be ongoing over the next week on how to proceed The bestcase scenario at this point is getting one Republican to drop from the ranks Worstcase scenario is the bill dies and our language gets picked up in another vehicle starting the whole process all over again The more likely scenario however lies somewhere in between Parties will agree to some compromise language send the bill back to the Assembly to make the appropriate changes then bring it back to the Senate for a clean vote Longterm contracting was moved to the front burner this week by Asm Wright AB and Senator Morrow SB both with different results Both measures which are almost identical set forth a criteria which if followed by an IOU when signing a longterm contract with an energy supplier would eliminate the need for a reasonableness review by the CPUC AB passed out of the Assembly Utilities and Commerce committee with little discussion and a few technical amendments SB faced a longer more difficult hearing in front of Senator Bowens Energy Committee IEP along with the three IOUs testified in support of the measure while TURN expressed great concerns with the concept of leaving the CPUC out of the picture In the end the Senate committee agreed to put the bill off for further discussions passed a motion in support of getting the appropriate rule waver so the bill can be heard again after Fridays policy committee deadline and scheduled a stakeholder meeting for Thursday morning Senator Burton announced on the Senate Floor Thursday morning however that all requests for rule wavers would be denied AB appears to be the only active vehicle on this issue and IEP will be at the negotiating table providing input on the language as it moves forward AB x is scheduled for hearing next week in the Senate Energy Committee IEP met with committee staff this week which revealed some possible latitude in amending the bill IEP and other member company lobbyists will be pushing hard for an opposed position from the rest of the committee before the hearing Tuesday afternoon At this time however we do not have any alternative language for the bill After further review by some IEP member companies the previously drafted amendments appear unworkable and were withdrawn from consideration We anticipate on waiting to see where the committee on Tuesday takes the issue before another attempt at drafting alternative language SB x SotoScott was amended this week before its hearing in the Senate Appropriations committee next week The new language finds a backdoor to the price cap issue by imposing a percent tax on the sale of electric power that exceeds a base price of per MWhr CMTA the Chamber and CalTax will be coordinating strategy for the hearing with IEP and the generators but despite the bills multiple constitutional and legal problems most admit the measure will move forward with little trouble A new player on the scene will probably provide the most noteworthy testimony InterGen North America which is developing a MW power plant in Palm Springs plans on testifying that if this measure is signed by the Governor they will absolutely pull the project and go to Oklahoma Newly amended this week is AB x Cardoza which now makes it a felony for a corporation that sells electricity or natural gas at unjust or unreasonable rates Sponsored by Lt Governor Bustamante the measure establishes stiff fines and possible jail time that could be subject to the states three strikes law AB x has already generated opposition from Republicans and constitutional questions from legal experts Although Cardoza noted that several aspects of the bill are unresolved and could change the intent will remain the same and he insists that energy companies that take advantage of Californians will still face significant penalties SB x Burton which establishes a State Power Authority passed the Assembly this week by a to vote The measure needs the Senate to concur on the Assembly amendments before it heads to the Governors desk Attached are the most recent

RudolphHOUEES on AM Susan J NRON AM Power Concern Offers California a Secret Deal By JEFF GERTH and LOWELL BERGMAN Duke Energy a powergenerating company accused of overcharging customers millions of dollars during Californias yearold energy crisis has secretly offered Gov Gray Davis a deal that it hopes will solve its legal problems while helping to calm the states chaotic electricity markets The proposed settlement outlined in documents prepared in March by Dukes lawyers calls for an end to various state investigations private lawsuits and state complaints to federal authorities accusing Duke of overcharging In return Duke would make an unspecified appropriate payment but admit no wrongdoing Duke is committed to sharing pain and expediting highlevel confidential discussions that would embrace the governors political and public relations needs according to the documents which were given to The New York Times by someone who wanted the issue aired publicly Governor Davis acknowledged the secret discussions in an interview in San Francisco yesterday and said he hoped to meet with more generators soon But he insisted that none of the companies would escape a substantial payment because he said they have penalized the state with excessive prices My general approach to the energy companies is that you have already charged the utilities a percent credit penalty for the power they were buying from you Mr Davis said so youre going to have to have a very substantial reduction in what the companies are owed Mr Davis said Duke had walked in with a number of demands including an end to state inquiries but that that was not likely to happen Were not about to call off the dogs said the governor a Democrat who will seek reelection next year Duke based in Charlotte NC is a major investor in Californias wholesale electricity market having spent more than billion since the state opened its generating plants to outside operators in It is also near the top of the list of companies accused of overcharging Duke has been ordered by federal regulators to justify or refund million in disputed charges this year an amount that is thirdhighest among federally regulated companies in the California market By entering secret negotiations with Mr Davis and being the first generator to settle Duke could gain a publicrelations advantage in much the same way that the Liggett Group donned a white hat by being the first company to open talks with the state governments in the tobaccolitigation wars Weve just simply tried to be part of the solution Richard B Priory Dukes chairman and chief executive said in an interview adding that the company was offering ideas and throwing in suggestions Publicly Mr Davis has disparaged outofstate electricity generators before and after he began talking with them privately In an interview two weeks ago with The Los Angeles Times he called the generators the biggest snakes on the planet Earth for their pricing practices Californias electricity costs have risen to about billion last year from billion in By some estimates they could approach billion this year for every resident The state has stepped in to buy power for financially crippled utilities including Pacific Gas and Electric which is now in bankruptcy court The Davis administration has struck power deals with companies like Duke in hopes of securing a stable and affordable source of power To pay those bills Mr Davis is seeking the largest municipal bond issue in American history billion although some state officials privately estimate that the final amount will be higher The governor hopes the bond issue will eventually take the states taxpayers off the hook But how those costs are allocated among ratepayers utilities and generators and whether the bond issue can even succeed remain unanswered questions A major impediment to resolving the electricity crisis according to state officials utility executives and economists is the secrecy surrounding the administrations negotiations Several Republicans have sued the Davis administration to learn the terms of specific contracts entered into by the state On Monday the administration released a page financial analysis including its most detailed disclosure about the overall costs of state electricity contracts Last week Republicans blocked legislation that Mr Davis says he needs to pass the bond issue The bill could come up for a vote later this week The thing that has hindered Governor Davis the most among the legislative ranks is the demand for secrecy over the negotiations and the agreements that have been reached said Senator Joseph L Dunn a Democrat from Santa Ana and the chairman of a select committee investigating the price spikes Mr Davis in the interview said there were legitimate commercial reasons for keeping contract terms confidential The political uncertainty has spilled over into the markets where the bonds would have to be sold The states credit rating while still solid is slipping Already companies that do business with California like Duke are citing the states creditworthiness as a reason for charging higher prices in their dealing with the state though the state has stepped in as buyer since February The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission recently ordered generators to justify high prices in California this year or pay million in refunds The companies including Duke Reliant Energy Dynegy Inc and the Williams Company deny any wrongdoing and cite the states credit situation as one reason for the high prices Mr Priory the Duke chairman said that resolution of credit issues would lead his company to drop the socalled credit premium it now charges on power sales As of March Duke was owed more than million by the states power managers documents show In its confidential submission to Mr Davis and his aides Duke said it would forgive an appropriate amount of certain receivables or make an appropriate payment based upon a methodology that fairly represents its share of alleged overcharges The documents do not give an amount but Dukes annual report shows that its wholesale energy division had written off million for power sales to California that had not been collected Even with that writeoff the units profits before taxes doubled from to and quadrupled for the first quarter of this year Dukes preliminary global settlement template of March goes on Duke is committed to sharing pain with state and others on a fair and equitable basis without admitting legal liability because Duke has done nothing illegal Duke says that much of its California power was sold last year on the forward markets not the more volatile and higherpriced spot markets But Mr Priory also noted in his interview that at least percent was sold for whatever the market price is On March Dukes lawyer at the request of Mr Daviss legal affairs secretary forwarded to the governors office additional information about pending litigation involving Duke and its power sales in California The documents show that a top Duke priority is the prompt suspension of state investigations lowering of rhetoric and stay of state litigation as well as the withdrawal of staterelated claims at the federal energy commission Also in March the operators of the states power grid told the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that wholesale electricity prices in California were more than billion above competitive prices over the previous months Duke has questioned the methodology of that submission and wants the claim withdrawn The inquiries of concern to Duke include those being conducted by the office of the attorney general William Lockyer and the California Public Utilities Commission Barry P Goode the governors legal affairs secretary says he subsequently referred Dukes lawyer to the attorney generals office The two state agencies say that their inquiries are continuing Sandra Michioku a spokeswoman for Mr Lockyer said Our investigation is ongoing Loretta Lynch the president of the utility commission said in a telephone interview yesterday The public utilities commission has not been involved in any settlement discussions with generators and our investigations into overcharges and withholding are ongoing and strong The Duke documents say the company should be given preferential treatment for its conciliatory stance Other generators said they were not involved in settlement discussions with Mr Davis nationalDAVIhtmlexDeiD enD cbdddf Visit NYTimescom for complete access to the most

The energy secretary said he was in California to gauge what we can do to add to what California is already doing The trip came after President Bush revealed plans for a series of conservation measures for federal buildings and military bases nationwide Those facilities in California account for of the states total energy use Today Abraham is scheduled to meet with federal officials in San Francisco to work out details of the nationwide program for more than federal buildings After meeting with Abraham at the White House earlier Thursday Bush said Were worried about blackouts that may occur this summer and we want to be a part of any solutions This administration is deeply concerned about California and its citizens Defending his response to the California crisis Bush said As I said from the very beginning of my administration well work to help California in any way we can Also Thursday Davis met with alternative energy producers in an attempt to persuade them to continue operations despite being owed more than billion by Californias private utilities Alternative energy producers including oil companies that generate electricity as a byproduct of their operations account for about of the electricity consumed in California Several have stopped producing after the utilities could no long afford to pay soaring prices for their power Davis assigned S David Freeman and former Assemblyman Richard Katz a Davis appointee to a state water board to be in charge of negotiations Davis said he hoped that the talks could be completed within a week And in a sign that major energy companies may get more involved in the California crisis Kenneth Lay CEO of the Houstonbased energy giant Enron Corp met Thursday with Davis Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg DSherman Oaks and Senate President Pro Tem John Burton DSan Francisco Meanwhile Bush on Thursday directed federal agencies to take appropriate actions to conserve energy use at their facilities In California such measures could include setting thermostats to degrees lowering lighting and turning off escalators during Stage and Stage power emergencies administration officials said Those occur when the states electricity reserves fall below and respectively and can trigger interruptions in service Bush did not set an energysaving target But the Defense Department one of the states single largest energy consumersusing about of peak demandpledged to reduce peak use by this summer and an additional by summer That would make available megawatts officials said enough to provide electricity to about homes during the summer The federal government accounts for about of total energy use across the country making it one of the nations largest energy consumers according to the Energy Department Bush also offered to make available to the state powergenerating units owned by the federal government But his efforts failed to mollify Democratic critics who renewed calls for the administration to impose price controls on wholesale electricity The generating companies are gouging California consumers while the president turns his back on us Sen Barbara Boxer DCalif said in a statement Rep Sam Farr DCarmel leader of the California Democratic congressional delegation sent a letter to Vice President Dick Cheney protesting Democrats exclusion from Cheneys meeting this week with California GOP lawmakers As we head into the high summer demand months it is unfortunate that you have decided to keep Democrats in the dark about the administrations plans to deal with the crisis Farr said Bushs conservation initiative comes after Cheney who is heading a task force on national energy policy was assailed by some critics for emphasizing production over conservation Conservation has got to be an integral part of making sure weve got a reasonable energy policy Bush said Thursday But what the vice president was saying is we cant conserve our way to energy independence nor can we conserve our way to having enough energy available Weve got to do both We must conserve but weve also got to find new sources of energy David M Nemtzow president of the Alliance to Save Energy called the directive an emergency answer to a longterm problem We need to fix the underlying problem by investing in energyefficient lighting cooling and controls he said We hope that this crisis will encourage the president to increase the budget for energy management rather than cut it by as previously proposed Political analysts said the effort was driven by concerns for not only electrons but also elections Its all about political conservation said Marshall Wittmann senior fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute Thomas E Mann senior fellow at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution agreed The administration has come to the view that just because they cant win California in a presidential election doesnt mean the Republican Party can afford to kiss off the largest state in the Union Analysts speculated that the administration came under pressure from California Republicans in Congress who worried about perceptions that the White House was not being aggressive enough in responding to the crisis As federal officials search for ways that California can avoid blackouts this summer a Woodland Hillsbased advocacy group More Power to You has suggested that the Navy hook its nuclearpowered ships to the state power grid to provide energy while in port The Navy has nuclearpowered aircraft carriers and submarines in San Diego and Washington state But Navy officials said it is not technologically feasible to use the nuclear reactors aboard the ships to provide power for the grid because most of that power goes directly to the propulsion systems Even to capture power not used for propulsion would require extensive construction on shore and retrofitting aboard ship officials said Also using ships to provide onshore power could disrupt training and deployment schedules

a special programin San Diego County Since several AReM members continue to do business in sDGEs service territory you might be interested in it The program is to be known as the Rolling Blackout Reduction Program RBRP SDGE proposes to deploy customerowned backup emergency generators during any ISOdeclared Stage event to bring additional generation online to reduce the need to have rolling blackouts Based on discussions with customers SDGE expects that approximately to additional megawatts MW of additional power could be made available through this proposed program These additional megawatts of demand reduction are critical to offset San Diegos anticipated share of ISO mandated statewide firm load reductions SDGE expects that the ISO will most likely require MW of statewide reductions during Stage firm load reduction events SDGEs share of this MW is or MW Therefore to MW of additional backup generation can reasonably be expected to reduce the number and duration of rotating outages in San Diego The RBRP is designed to run for a year beginning on May and pay capacity incentives each month for six months starting May and continuing through November Its availability for Summer will be determined after the upcoming summer SDGE proposes that this program be implemented only in San Diego county at this time Participating customers must have a backup emergency generator that is capable of providing at least percent of customers annual maximum demand but not less than kW Customers participation in the program is entirely voluntary but would require a firm commitment and be supported by both a contract and other tariff obligations terms and conditions As discussed more fully below participating customers will earn incentive payments for their actual load reduction and in addition if a customers load reduction is sufficiently great the customer also will receive a circuit exemption Once SDGE receives notification from the ISO that a Stage event and rolling outages have been declared SDGE would in turn notify participating customers to reduce demand through the use of their backup generation Customers would be required to reduce demand as quickly as possible but no later than minutes after the customer receives the notification SDGE would offset the amount of generation brought on line against the amount specified by the ISO the Stage event for the load curtailment to achieve the necessary load drop If SDGE were required to curtail more load than the backup generation provides or should load reduction be required faster than the generators could be started then SDGE would follow its normal curtailment plan to meet the full ISO requirement for load reduction net of the load reduction on the system caused by the customerowned backup generation The backup generators will run until ISO no longer requires a firm load reduction and all firm load is back in service SDGEs proposed tariff imposes no program limits on how often SDGE may call upon a customer to run its backup generator These and other terms and conditions are specified in SDGEs proposed tariff which appears as Attachment B to this Petition Do any

Page Edition STAR Montana s power crisis may be more intense thanCalifornias By JIM ROBBINS New York Times BUTTE Mont The last largescale metal mine is silent in this city that sits astride the Rocky Mountains The ton housesized orehauling trucks which once rumbled with loads hours a day have not fired up their engines since last summer Nor have the conveyors the crushers the concentrators and the grinders And most of the workers who carved out a living extracting copper molybdenum and silver from the foot deep Continental Pit have scattered to other states and other jobs Montana Resources which owns the mine has been out of affordable power for nine months At the beginning of the mine was paying a megawatt hour up from the year before Last week however a megawatt hour cost While California has grabbed most of the national headlines for a power crisis caused by deregulation gone awry rolling blackouts resumed there last week another power deregulation crisis has been unfolding here in Montana And in some ways it is far more striking in its impact While Californians may be somewhat protected from skyrocketing costs Montanans are not Paper companies mines and other large industrial companies in Montana have been laying off workers because they cannot afford to pay their electric bills Residents are expecting their household electric costs to as much as double by July A growing number of Montanans want to roll back the clock to a time when their state blessed with its own sources of cheaply produced power had some of the lowest electricity rates in the country Many residents are directing their anger at the Legislature which in their view deregulated the market for electrical power solely at the behest of the Montana Power Co once the states dominant utility Under deregulation that took effect three years ago Montana Power sold its hydroelectric and coalfired generating plants to PPL Corp the Allentown Pa company that sells power in states and in Canada Great Britain and Latin America Like other owners of power generation sites PPL has been profiting immensely under deregulation by charging rates based on the forces of supply and demand Montana Power still distributes electric power around the state but soon will be getting out of that business as well The change has left large power consumers such as Montana Resources scrambling to survive They have scoured the region for affordable alternatives They have asked PPL to make at least some cheaper electricity available but it is unclear if that will happen And they have lobbied the Legislature to reregulate electrical power Weve got to play all of our cards said Greg Stricker president of Montana Resources as he gazed over the companys open mining pit and a giant statue of the Virgin Mary that sits high on a mountain above it Were faced with extinction PPL however says it has no choice but to sell its power at market prices On a national scale the plight of Montana which has less than a million people is not as visible as that of California which has million But Montana s experience shows what can happen when power prices spiral out of control and businesses and consumers are not protected Montana s power crisis is rooted in the history of the Montana Power Co It was formed in by Anaconda Copper Mining to ensure power for Anacondas extensive mining milling and sawmill operations Montana Power built hydroelectric dams on rivers across the state dams that still create power at low cost Anaconda also was accustomed to getting its own way The company owned most of the states daily newspapers until and wielded tremendous influence among elected officials Anaconda the historian Bernard DeVoto wrote maintained a more thoroughgoing ownership of Montana s wealth government and inhabitants than any other corporation has ever been able to maintain in any other state The Anaconda era ended in when the company was bought by Atlantic Richfield the oil company that has since been acquired by BP Arco closed the mines in and the smelter in Montana Power which had become the states regulated utility outlived its creator By the mids however Montana Power was

a virtue of necessity Montana Power began the process of getting out of the power business It diversified creating an Internet service provider called Touch America It also began to push for power deregulation saying it would result in lower costs and more customer choices The company was hoping that deregulation would make itself attractive to investors and potential buyers A deregulation bill the Electric Utility Restructuring and Customer Choice Act was introduced in March when the legislative session was nearly over Lawmakers most of them farmers and ranchers and businessmen approved it hastily To some critics of deregulation the passage smacked of the era when Anaconda dictated what the Legislature should do Few Montana lawmakers understood what was happening said Ken Toole a Democratic state senator and an opponent of the deregulation It was a steamroller with the mantra of free market Toole said Debate took place in a compressed period of time and it was not brought before the public Montana Power disputed that interpretation Jack Haffey its president and chief operating officer said it was not a bill pulled out of somebodys pocket and foisted on the public Still

California are beginning to embrace an alternative energy plan expected to be introduced as a bill this week that would get the state out of the power buying business in as little as six months and restore Edison Internationals EIX Southern California Edison unit to financial solvency without requiring the utility to sell any of its assets to the state If the plan wins the support of both houses of the Legislature lawmakers hope it will also convince a bankruptcy court judge in San Francisco that it can be used to lift PGE Corps PCG Pacific Gas Electric unit out of Chapter bankruptcy protection Clearly this would be a positive development said Paul Patterson a utility analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston in New York It would offer a way to restore the utilities to financial viability Weve noticed over the weekend that the situation in the Assembly is improving The proposal by Assemblyman Joe Nation DSan Rafael and Assemblyman John Dutra DFremont has gained the interest of some members of the Assembly Republican Caucus all of whom have resisted previous attempts at rescuing SoCal Ed from near bankruptcy Consumer groups have been resistant to any form of what they call a utility bailout But a spokesman at The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco said the group is studying the Plan B proposal On Friday a spokesman to Gov Gray Davis said state Sen Richard Polanco the Senate Majority Leader would introduce legislation this week enacting the agreement the governor reached with SoCal Ed exactly one month ago that would allow the utility to issue about billion in bonds to recoup its unrecovered power costs and sell its power lines to the state for billion to pay off its debt But Nation and Dutra members of the socalled Plan B group are looking to alter that agreement There are a lot of people who question the validity of buying the grid from SoCal Ed Nation an economist by trade said I think there is an understanding that the existing memorandum of understanding wont pass One of the problems with having the state purchase the grid at this point is that there wont be enough funds available to maintain and upgrade the lines to improve the flow of electricity according to several members of the Senate Budget Committee Were preparing for massive budget cuts this week because of this electricity crisis the member of the Senate Budget Committee said Plan Eliminates Purchase Of SoCal Eds Power Lines Nations proposal calls for the state to hold a fiveyear option to buy SoCal Eds transmission lines for its book value price of billion and eliminate a provision that would ease the regulation of the utility by the California Public Utilities Commission In exchange SoCal Ed can securitize a larger portion of its billion in unrecovered power costs backed by a larger dedicated rate component Moreover the utility would sell the state additional power at a cost beyond the years already agreed upon in the memorandumofunderstanding and additional power from other company sources Nation also wants to set up a ratepayer revenue account to refund consumers if generators agree to accept less than cents on the dollar He said however he does not plan to include a provision in any legislation that states generators must take a haircut on money the companies claim they are owed by SoCal Ed Republicans including Assemblyman George Runner RLancaster and Assemblyman Keith Richman RGranada Hills have been working closely with Nation and the Plan B group Jamie Fisfis a spokesman for the Assembly Republican Caucus said the caucus is not yet ready to support the plan but Republicans are happy they are being included in the discussions We have two criteria when we evaluate the plan Fisfis said The plan has to keep power rates as low as possible and puts more supply into the grid Steve Maviglio Davis press secretary said the governor has always said hes open to improvements in the memorandumofunderstanding But it has to remain a balanced transaction Maviglio said Nation a member of the Assembly since said the state would only have to spend a couple of weeks renegotiating the memorandumofunderstanding with Edison and that it could likely win a twothirds majority vote in the Assembly shortly after that Nation said he has had a number of conversations with Edison International executives on his proposal and they have been generally receptive because they believe the agreement with the governor wont pass A SoCal Ed spokesman was unavailable for comment Lawmakers Seeking Quick Exit From Power Buying Business California has committed billion of its roughly billion general fund buying power since January on behalf of PGE SoCal Ed and Sempra Energys SRE San Diego Gas Electric unit But several lawmakers and one of Davis financial advisers said Sunday that the state wants to desperately get out of the power buying business soon because of the economic impact the energy spending will likely have on education transportation and other state programs We are beginning to realize that if we dont get out of the business of buying electricity we will be in the same boat as the utilities said one state Senator who is also a member of the Senate Budget Committee Nation agreed saying the best thing we can do for California is get out of this mess were in We need to get the DWR out of the business of buying power Lawmakers Working To Keep SoCal Ed Out Of Bankruptcy A number of Democrats in the Assembly who have said SoCal Ed may be better off in bankruptcy now want to see the utility remain solvent Nation said I think several months ago bankruptcy wouldnt have seemed like such a challenge Nation said Nation said he fears that if SoCal Ed were in a bankruptcy setting the states socalled qualifying facilities renewable and gas fired power plants that contract directly with the utilities may win the right to sell their cheap power on the open market If that happens it will dramatically raise the risk to the state because we will be forced to buy that power Nation said I think people understand what the risks are and thats a real danger By

Decision on Power Rate Hike Energy Panel will discuss a new plan today that would shift more of the burden to residences from business By TIM REITERMAN and MARLA DICKERSON Times Staff Writers SAN FRANCISCOThe states utility regulators delayed a decision Monday on how to structure a billion electricity rate increase until today when they will take up a revised plan that is expected to shift a larger share onto residential customers Assailed by power users and pressured by the governor the California Public Utilities Commission said more time was needed to assess the impact on competing interest groups The problem here is making sure we are allocating the increase equitably PUC President Loretta Lynch said after the meeting That she said is tricky About half the residential customers of the states two largest utilities would see increases under Lynchs plan proposed last week Bills for Southern California Edison customers who use moderate to heavy amounts of power would rise about to Similar customers of Pacific Gas Electric Co would experience increases of about to To encourage conservation Lynch said she favors moving more of the overall burden of the increases to residential customers who are moderate users of electricity Other commissioners say they believe that such a shift is necessary to protect the states business climate Consumer advocates voiced concern that the PUC may be yielding to pressure from industry groups that enjoy relatively low rates but say they are being hit unfairly with much larger percentage increases than residential customers The fear is the commission is caving in and taking the increase off big business customers and putting it on residential users above of baseline said Mike Florio senior attorney for the Utility Reform Network The baseline amount on a bill is the minimum of electricity deemed necessary for a customer and varies by region Under state legislation there is no rate increase for consumption up to of baseline Also exempted are lowincome customers who already receive discounted electricity rates The commission passed an increase of cents a kilowatt hour March In recent weeks the panel has been conducting hearings on how to divvy up the increase among million customers of Edison and PGE Mondays meeting was supposed to climax that process paving the way for utilities to start billing customers June Dozens of speakers addressed the commission and boisterous protesters in white coveralls repeatedly criticized the rate increase chanting I aint payin no hike while theyre getting rich from our power rates Who you gonna call Rate Busters One had to be dragged away from the microphone To stunned surprise Lynch later announced that the commission would not vote on her rate design proposed last week or a similar one proposed by a PUC administrative law judge Lynch revised the plan over the weekend and some commissioners said they had not yet seen the changes The delay means two commissioners will be out of town when the fivemember panel designs the states largest rate increase ever Commissioner Richard Bilas is undergoing a medical procedure in Mendocino County Commissioner Henry Duque is traveling to Texas as a director of the National Assn of Utilities Commissioners They said the law permits them to vote by phone as long as they do it from a publicly accessible place Lynchs proposal called for average rate increases of about to for various classes of customers But officials said the proposal was being reviewed after testimony late last week and mounting concerns among some commissioners that it would hit industry and big commercial customers too hard potentially hurting the states economy After his financial advisors reviewed the PUCs proposals Gov Gray Davis put out a statement over the weekend saying his own proposal including a slightly smaller rate hike was better My plan raises sufficient revenues to deal with the problem without putting an undue burden on California consumers and businesses that might hurt our economy he said The governors office last week asked the PUC to come around said press secretary Steve Maviglio There are gaps between his proposal and the PUCs Carl Wood one of three Davis appointees on the commission said that he was generally comfortable with the Lynch proposal but that this is a big decision and it is not ready for a vote Jeff Brown another Davis appointee said he spoke to the governors office recently and learned that Davis had two primary concerns about the proposal No that there be sufficient price signals within the residential class to make people conserve and that the industrials not be walloped and have some mitigation of the rate increase Brown said he would like to see industrial users paying less than the hike in Lynchs proposal He said that would mean residents who consume of their baseline amount would have their rates rise instead of about I want the proposed amount for industrial customers to go down somewhat but cant put all the burden on residentials he said There are no good answers Duque and Bilas appointees of former Republican Gov Pete Wilson expressed concerns that the rate proposal would further damage the economy Industry is not getting a fair shake Bilas said If you want to achieve maximum conservation you put the increase where demand is most elastic It should be placed on you and me Duque said I think industrial users are getting an undue amount Business groups have argued strongly that consumers must endure their fair share of the pain in order to encourage conservation Carl Guardino president and chief executive of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group said his group phoned Davis staff to voice their opposition to the proposed rate structure We found a receptive audience he said They saw that this proposed rate structure will deeply hinder our economy Reiterman reported from San Francisco Dickerson from Los Angeles Copyright Los Angeles Times

Calif Probe Focuses On DynegyMirant PlantsCommissioners Updated Monday May PMET By Jason Leopold and Mark Golden Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow JonesCalifornia officials are focusing an investigation into the states wholesale electricity markets on two power plants operated by two of the states largest merchant power companies Mirant Corp MIR news msgs and a joint venture between Dynegy Inc DYN news msgs and N RG Energy NRG news msgs according to two commissioners on the California Public Utilities Commission The CPUC and the state Attorney General are investigating whether output wa s withheld in order to maintain high prices over the past seven months at Mirants Pittsburg plant in northern California and the Encina power plant which is equally owned by Dynegy and NRG near San Diego All power plants in the state are being examined but investigators have found that the Encina and Pittsburg plants have reduced power during supply shortages causing market prices to rise But so far the commissioners said investigators have found no activity th at is clearly illegal Is it unethical Yes one PUC commissioner said But is it illegal No unless there was collusion This is the system we set up What the generato rs are doing would be the appropriate thing to do if you are going to maximize your profit to shareholders Spokesmen for Mirant and Dynegy flatly denied the charges What we did was both legal and ethical said Mirant spokesman Chuck Griffin There was a very forthright attempt to keep these plants up and running Unequivocally we have never held anything back Some of the turbines at the Encina plant are peaking units which are supposed to ramp up and down to meet demand Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel l said The plant is operated by NRG but Dynegy markets the power from the plant and tells NRG how much power to generate based on what has been sold Weve done absolutely nothing to manipulate prices Stengell said Electricity demand increases and decreases throughout the day Our production increases and decreases to follow changing demand Ultimately t he ISO determines the exact amount of dispatch A spokesman for Attorney General William Lockyer declined to comment on the ongoing investigation CPUC President Loretta Lynch told California newspapers last week that her office and that of Lockyers have enough information to take legal action against generators next month though she declined to name the companies involved and she said that the exact nature of the legal action is still under review We get really tired of these assertions with no evidence to back them up Griffin said This whole idea that any generation was held back at any tim e is completely bogus It is pure political rhetoric Mirants California power plants have run at full power during critical tim es except under one of two conditions Griffin said Either generating units were broken and had to be taken off line to be fixed or they were beginnin g to run in a way that violated environmental restrictions and Mirant had to get permission to run at full power any longer There are no other reasons than those two said Griffin Nevertheless several employees at the power plants involved have testified that generating units were ramped down even when the states Independent System Operator had warned of tight supplies according to one commissioner And a senior NRG employee at the Encina power plant in Carlsbad told Dow Jones Newswires that he was told by Dynegys Houston trading floor to ramp down the large megawatt plant on at least occasions when he knew power supplies were tight We would be told to ramp down the units even when we knew the state needed the megawatts the employee said Then the spot price would go up but we didnt really pay too much attention to that because as far as we know everybody was doing this We knew how much power other plants were operatin g at and we knew they werent at full capacity NRG spokeswoman Meredith Moore said that the ISO gives instructions to Dyne gy and Dynegy tells NRG what to do And there have been conditions when the I SO told us to ramp down during Stage emergencies Moore said Also one CPUC commissioner pointed out that the states deregulation law doesnt require owners of power plants to bid all of their capacity into th e market The states incumbent utilities who were forced to sell their power plants as part of deregulation also may have contributed to the problem accordin g to an ISO study By not securing nearly enough power in advance to meet the ir customers projected needs the states three main utilities contributed to Stage and power emergencies last summer and forced the grid operator to pay a much higher price to keep the lights on The utilities argued that they underscheduled their load so they wouldnt have to pay the generators high bid prices The ISO market last year had a price cap while other markets did not Mirants Griffin meanwhile said all the finger pointing isnt solving the states problem If they are going to get to a solution in California they have to get beyond silly political rhetoric Griffin said The real solution to the problem is to get new supply and if they are going to do that they have to make this market look attractive to the kind of people who can build power plants By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires Mark

Ken Smith PM Please respond to Ken Smith The following are summaries of todays appearance by Sen John Burton to the Sacramento Press Club and of his news conference this afternoon announcing a lawsuit against FERC John Burton held what amounted mostly to a QA session at a lunch with the Sacramento Press Club today He started by talking about the Edison MOU which he said will be assigned to the Senate Utility Committee for review the Judiciary Committee will look at the legal elements and the Natural Resources Committee will look at issues surrounding easements One columnist commented that Burton would love it to death meaning it would get so much attention it will be hard for it to advance The MOU he said includes language that eliminates oversight by the PUC He said that will not be the case when it leaves the Senate Burton is obviously troubled by the MOU he said some people say it doesnt just make Edison creditworthy it makes them whole He said the following would have to take place for the MOU to be acceptable Back debt must be verified All creditors must take a haircut The transmission lines would need to be purchased for an amount close to what the governor has mentioned million or more must come from Edisons parent to pay back debt When asked whether million was enough he said no and that he feels the parent should pay a ton That led to a discussion of the dedicated rate component which he doesnt like He used the example that if electricity costs and the dedicated rate component is if prices drop to people will unnecessarily pay higher rates A larger infusion of cash from Edisons parent could eliminate the need for the dedicated rate component Burton called the dedicated rate component a big problem and said it could be the strongest argument for use in an initiative campaign He said he planned to tell the governor this afternoon that the state should set an acceptable purchase price for power and not pay anything more note this is a populist approach that is getting a lot of support from radio talk shows and other media He later threw out the number The state is going to have blackouts whether or not it pays top dollar he said so this is one way he sees to fight back Its tough medicine but as he put it Youve got to take castor oil and it tastes crappy but two days later youre over it and your stomachs OK Burton also used a quote from his late brother Phil on how he believe the situation should be handled The only way to deal with exploiters is to terrorize the bastards Asked how long the committee process would take re the MOU Burton said the MOU sets August as a deadline but that if there is ongoing progress there are allowances that would let the process go as long as into December LAWSUIT PRESS CONFERENCE Shortly after the lunch Burton held a press conference to announce a lawsuit against FERC was filed today in the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit A copy of the brief and press release was faxed earlier this afternoon to Jim Steffes and should be available in his office If additional copies are needed please contact me or Scott Govenar The plaintiffs are Burton individually and on behalf of the Senate Bob Hertzberg individually and on behalf of the Assembly and the City of Oakland At the event were Burton Hertzberg Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown atty Joe Cotchett of Cotchett Pitre Simon in Burlingame atty Clark Kelso a constitutional scholar from McGeorge School of Law Sen Liz Figueroa and Joan Breuner vice mayor of Oakland The suit asks for FERC to respond within days and a ruling within days Burton opened by explaining that they were suing FERC for not fulfilling its statutory authority to maintain fair and justifiable rates Hertzberg added that FERC had ignored the law and that they were compelled to file suit for Californians relief Joe Cotchett said the suit is very basic and is based on the Federal Power Act which he says limits power costs to fair and justifiable rates A primary strategy in this suit is to present it as a health and welfare and public safety suit he noted that there are million disabled children and convalescent homes in CA who can be adversely affected by blackouts He said it is not an economic lawsuit its about senior citizens disabled kids and convalescent facilities Today also happened to be the legislative day for the California Association of Health Facilities the nursing home trade assn and several nursing home workers were apparently asked to sit at the back of the room for effect Cotchett said FERC has been told for years that there were opportunities to exert market power He also claimed that a Redondo Beach facility obviously AES was fined million by FERC for taking its plant offline and substituting higher rates He said however that this order had been sealed He cited an industry report that predicts hours of blackouts this summer which could mean four hours a day That could be he said potentially the ruination of a lot of medicine in refrigeration Cotchett noted that only hospitals with more than beds are exempt from blackouts which does not protect surgical centers or many health facilities Jerry Brown added that prices are unjust and people are suffering Continued high prices could mean potential civic disruption and that there will be more actions to mobilize Western mayors Liz Figueroa spoke briefly to reiterate the health aspects of the lawsuit Burton had mentioned Clark Kelso who regularly appears on TV here as a legal expert and I believe was a colleague of Justice Anthony Kennedy in his Press Club appearance He said Kelso had appeared regularly in the media early on to say that the state had no standing to file the suit Burtons lawyers sent him the brief and Kelso thought enough of it to join the legal team Kelso reiterated that FERC has been aware of potential market power for three years and that the commission has delayed action unreasonably It has failed to define fair and justifiable that failure he said violates the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of the Constitution Kelso said this is not a partisan issue and called upon fellow Republicans to support the effort Joan Breuner sp Oaklands vice mayor said only that she believed that if the energy situation were happening in Texas rather than California the president and FERC would have acted long ago During the QA session Cotchett said the urgency filing is necessary because generators supply of the electricity in CA and all five have rate renewals before FERC He also said one of the cases that is relevant is Bush v Gore in which the Supreme Court found that failure to set standards regarding elections obviously in that case violates the Equal Protection clause He also said six states have expressed interest in the case and have requested briefs Oregon Nevada Arizona Washington Minnesota and one other he didnt name None of these states has yet committed to joining the suit

Calif Elec Dereg Wed Sources Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LOS ANGELES Dow JonesEdison International EIX saying the current state of Californias power markets threatens the company with bankruptcy will call Wednesday for an end to Californias fouryear experiment with deregulation sources familiar with the issue told Dow Jones Newswires John Bryson chief executive of Edison International is expected to announce that the companys regulated utility unit Southern California Edison wont be able to recover more than billion in losses related to power purchases and continue serving its retail customers unless the states deregulated market structure is scrapped In a move tantamount to a call for reregulation Edison will propose to break ground on new power plants within days and reenter the powergeneration business Southern California Edison was required to exit under the states landmark deregulation law the sources said Edison plans to follow the announcement by filing a request with state regulators to increase retail electricity rates by as much as the sources said even though regulators rejected Edisons request for a rate increase of last week The utility has lined up the support of some state lawmakers for the broader proposal which would require action by the state legislature the sources said Southern California Edison with million customers is one of the countrys largest electric utilities Edison was the first of the states utilities to sign on to the deregulation effort and as it says on its Web site played a central role in the restructuring of the electric industry in California Among the concessions won by utilities in is the rate freeze which they demanded to help them recover costs related to deregulation but which is now producing huge losses Edisons current losses stem from an imbalance between the soaring prices it must pay to purchase power on the wholesale markets and the fixed rate at which it can sell power to its customers About half of those losses are offset the utilitys own power sales revenues which are accounted for separately and used to pay down deregulationrelated debt Rising power costs have produced a surplus in that account Edison wouldnt reveal the current size of the surplus but said previously that the California Power Exchange paid the utility billion over its generating costs for power through the end of September at a time when its powerpurchase losses were billion PowerPurchase Losses Mounting The net losses continue to mount Californias wholesale power prices hovered at record levels all summer and spiked even higher in the past two weeks as colder weather arrived in the Northwest at a time when much of Californias power supply was down for maintenance The price of power for delivery Wednesday in California hit an average of a megawatthour Tuesday up from a megawatthour a week ago the result of high demand and a decision by Californias wholesale market operator to lift its cap on prices The rate Southern California Edison can charge its retail customers however is fixed at MWh Last week Merrill Lynch Co MER downgraded its ratings for Edison International and PGE Corp PCG the parent of Californias other major utility Pacific Gas Electric to neutral saying the utilities may be forced to file for bankruptcy if the state doesnt allow them to raise their retail rates A Morgan Stanley Dean Witter MDW analyst drew the same conclusion Monday also cutting his rating to neutral Edison to this point has kept its powerpurchase losses off its earnings statement in hopes that a political or regulatory solution will allow them to be collected later The California Public Utilities Commission put the hope of such a solution further out of reach last week however when it ruled against rate increases sought by Edison and PGE Credit rating agency Fitch Inc on Monday lowered its ratings for Edison International and Southern California Edisons senior unsecured debt to the Aminus level citing increased liquidity pressure and uncertainty about the utilities ability to recover the costs of their power purchases The agency downgraded Edison International the parent because half its consolidated cash flow is provided by Southern California Edison Edison which sources said plans to remain in the retail electricity business said late last week that it has secured a billion line of credit and expects to have enough cash on hand to continue to pay for wholesale electricity for the next several months California paid more than billion for power last week sources said Some of that however was paid to Southern California Edison which still generates about megawatts of power in the state Shares in Edison International have fallen over the past three weeks They closed

Edison Mission Energy Power Project Starts Construction After Expedited Approval By California Energy Commission Monday December pm Source Dow Jones Operation Targeted for August IRVINE Calif Dec PRNewswire Edison Mission Energy EME an Edison International company NYSE EIX started construction of its new Sunrise power plant on Thursday December having received expedited approval from the California Energy Commission CEC to proceed The power generation facility will be located in Kern County California and will bring both short and longterm generation capacity to the state which is in dire need of new power generation From the onset of the California power crisis we have sought to find means to bring new power to the California market said John E Bryson chairman and CEO of Edison International This CEC approval will help ensure that this critical new project will be able to provide a significant amount of new peaking power to the state as soon as next August Our thanks and appreciation go to the California Energy Commission and the environmental and regulatory agencies for their swift consideration of this important project This power has been offered by contract to the state so that the pricing for it does not depend on Californias broken deregulated power market said Alan J Fohrer president and CEO of EME Alternatively EME will seek to enter into a longterm costbased contract with either Pacific Gas Electric Company or San Diego Gas Electric Company to further ensure that Californias consumers reap the benefit of this additional power resource Fohrer said The Sunrise Power Project will be completed in two phases Phase will consist of a megawatt MW simplecycle peaking facility scheduled to be in service during the summer Phase will convert the peaking facility to a MW combinedcycle operation with an inservice date of summer The project will meet or exceed all pertinent environmental and safety standards Final regulatory approvals have been received for Phase I of the project only EME will be seeking expedited permitting approval for the Phase II expansion in line with the fasttrack approval process recently enacted by the California legislature EME has also negotiated an agreement with the labor unions for an adequate supply of highly skilled labor in order to achieve an accelerated construction schedule The accelerated schedule is aimed at providing this additional power to California by next summer Edison Mission Energy specializes in the development acquisition construction management and operation of global power production facilities As one of the worlds leading global power producers Edison Mission Energy owns nearly megawatts of generating capacity including interests in projects currently under

week because they cost more to run than the price cap Did you see the same thing PH We have some small turbines that we put in Reno and the Lake Tahoe area in the last few months They were supposed to provide peak power but they get uneconomic in a hurry under the price cap scheme You know weve tried to isolate ourselves as best we could from the California situation and behave very independent of how California behaves So Nevada is a great test case to see if price caps have an unintended effect outside of California We were able to minimize the impact on our customers Monday but the situation has maximized the attention of the country on the impact of price caps By Mark Golden Dow Jones Newswires END DOW JONES NEWS PM PM EDT

Elec Dereg Wed Sources Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LOS ANGELES Dow JonesEdison International EIX saying the current state of Californias power markets threatens the company with bankruptcy will call Wednesday for an end to Californias fouryear experiment with deregulation sources familiar with the issue told Dow Jones Newswires John Bryson chief executive of Edison International is expected to announce that the companys regulated utility unit Southern California Edison wont be able to recover more than billion in losses related to power purchases and continue serving its retail customers unless the states deregulated market structure is scrapped In a move tantamount to a call for reregulation Edison will propose to break ground on new power plants within days and reenter the powergeneration business Southern California Edison was required to exit under the states landmark deregulation law the sources said Edison plans to follow the announcement by filing a request with state regulators to increase retail electricity rates by as much as the sources said even though regulators rejected Edisons request for a rate increase of last week The utility has lined up the support of some state lawmakers for the broader proposal which would require action by the state legislature the sources said Southern California Edison with million customers is one of the countrys largest electric utilities Edison was the first of the states utilities to sign on to the deregulation effort and as it says on its Web site played a central role in the restructuring of the electric industry in California Among the concessions won by utilities in is the rate freeze which they demanded to help them recover costs related to deregulation but which is now producing huge losses Edisons current losses stem from an imbalance between the soaring prices it must pay to purchase power on the wholesale markets and the fixed rate at which it can sell power to its customers About half of those losses are offset the utilitys own power sales revenues which are accounted for separately and used to pay down deregulationrelated debt Rising power costs have produced a surplus in that account Edison wouldnt reveal the current size of the surplus but said previously that the California Power Exchange paid the utility billion over its generating costs for power through the end of September at a time when its powerpurchase losses were billion PowerPurchase Losses Mounting The net losses continue to mount Californias wholesale power prices hovered at record levels all summer and spiked even higher in the past two weeks as colder weather arrived in the Northwest at a time when much of Californias power supply was down for maintenance The price of power for delivery Wednesday in California hit an average of a megawatthour Tuesday up from a megawatthour a week ago the result of high demand and a decision by Californias wholesale market operator to lift its cap on prices The rate Southern California Edison can charge its retail customers however is fixed at MWh Last week Merrill Lynch Co MER downgraded its ratings for Edison International and PGE Corp PCG the parent of Californias other major utility Pacific Gas Electric to neutral saying the utilities may be forced to file for bankruptcy if the state doesnt allow them to raise their retail rates A Morgan Stanley Dean Witter MDW analyst drew the same conclusion Monday also cutting his rating to neutral Edison to this point has kept its powerpurchase losses off its earnings statement in hopes that a political or regulatory solution will allow them to be collected later The California Public Utilities Commission put the hope of such a solution further out of reach last week however when it ruled against rate increases sought by Edison and PGE Credit rating agency Fitch Inc on Monday lowered its ratings for Edison International and Southern California Edisons senior unsecured debt to the Aminus level citing increased liquidity pressure and uncertainty about the utilities ability to recover the costs of their power purchases The agency downgraded Edison International the parent because half its consolidated cash flow is provided by Southern California Edison Edison which sources said plans to remain in the retail electricity business said late last week that it has secured a billion line of credit and expects to have enough cash on hand to continue to pay for wholesale electricity for the next several months California paid more than billion for power last week sources said Some of that however was paid to Southern California Edison which still generates about megawatts of power in the state Shares in Edison International have fallen over the past three weeks They closed

Edison Mission Energy Power Project Starts Construction After Expedited Approval By California Energy Commission Monday December pm Source Dow Jones Operation Targeted for August IRVINE Calif Dec PRNewswire Edison Mission Energy EME an Edison International company NYSE EIX started construction of its new Sunrise power plant on Thursday December having received expedited approval from the California Energy Commission CEC to proceed The power generation facility will be located in Kern County California and will bring both short and longterm generation capacity to the state which is in dire need of new power generation From the onset of the California power crisis we have sought to find means to bring new power to the California market said John E Bryson chairman and CEO of Edison International This CEC approval will help ensure that this critical new project will be able to provide a significant amount of new peaking power to the state as soon as next August Our thanks and appreciation go to the California Energy Commission and the environmental and regulatory agencies for their swift consideration of this important project This power has been offered by contract to the state so that the pricing for it does not depend on Californias broken deregulated power market said Alan J Fohrer president and CEO of EME Alternatively EME will seek to enter into a longterm costbased contract with either Pacific Gas Electric Company or San Diego Gas Electric Company to further ensure that Californias consumers reap the benefit of this additional power resource Fohrer said The Sunrise Power Project will be completed in two phases Phase will consist of a megawatt MW simplecycle peaking facility scheduled to be in service during the summer Phase will convert the peaking facility to a MW combinedcycle operation with an inservice date of summer The project will meet or exceed all pertinent environmental and safety standards Final regulatory approvals have been received for Phase I of the project only EME will be seeking expedited permitting approval for the Phase II expansion in line with the fasttrack approval process recently enacted by the California legislature EME has also negotiated an agreement with the labor unions for an adequate supply of highly skilled labor in order to achieve an accelerated construction schedule The accelerated schedule

Ken Smith PM Please respond to Ken Smith The following are summaries of todays appearance by Sen John Burton to the Sacramento Press Club and of his news conference this afternoon announcing a lawsuit against FERC John Burton held what amounted mostly to a QA session at a lunch with the Sacramento Press Club today He started by talking about the Edison MOU which he said will be assigned to the Senate Utility Committee for review the Judiciary Committee will look at the legal elements and the Natural Resources Committee will look at issues surrounding easements One columnist commented that Burton would love it to death meaning it would get so much attention it will be hard for it to advance The MOU he said includes language that eliminates oversight by the PUC He said that will not be the case when it leaves the Senate Burton is obviously troubled by the MOU he said some people say it doesnt just make Edison creditworthy it makes them whole He said the following would have to take place for the MOU to be acceptable Back debt must be verified All creditors must take a haircut The transmission lines would need to be purchased for an amount close to what the governor has mentioned million or more must come from Edisons parent to pay back debt When asked whether million was enough he said no and that he feels the parent should pay a ton That led to a discussion of the dedicated rate component which he doesnt like He used the example that if electricity costs and the dedicated rate component is if prices drop to people will unnecessarily pay higher rates A larger infusion of cash from Edisons parent could eliminate the need for the dedicated rate component Burton called the dedicated rate component a big problem and said it could be the strongest argument for use in an initiative campaign He said he planned to tell the governor this afternoon that the state should set an acceptable purchase price for power and not pay anything more note this is a populist approach that is getting a lot of support from radio talk shows and other media He later threw out the number The state is going to have blackouts whether or not it pays top dollar he said so this is one way he sees to fight back Its tough medicine but as he put it Youve got to take castor oil and it tastes crappy but two days later youre over it and your stomachs OK Burton also used a quote from his late brother Phil on how he believe the situation should be handled The only way to deal with exploiters is to terrorize the bastards Asked how long the committee process would take re the MOU Burton said the MOU sets August as a deadline but that if there is ongoing progress there are allowances that would let the process go as long as into December LAWSUIT PRESS CONFERENCE Shortly after the lunch Burton held a press conference to announce a lawsuit against FERC was filed today in the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit A copy of the brief and press release was faxed earlier this afternoon to Jim Steffes and should be available in his office If additional copies are needed please contact me or Scott Govenar The plaintiffs are Burton individually and on behalf of the Senate Bob Hertzberg individually and on behalf of the Assembly and the City of Oakland At the event were Burton Hertzberg Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown atty Joe Cotchett of Cotchett Pitre Simon in Burlingame atty Clark Kelso a constitutional scholar from McGeorge School of Law Sen Liz Figueroa and Joan Breuner vice mayor of Oakland The suit asks for FERC to respond within days and a ruling within days Burton opened by explaining that they were suing FERC for not fulfilling its statutory authority to maintain fair and justifiable rates Hertzberg added that FERC had ignored the law and that they were compelled to file suit for Californians relief Joe Cotchett said the suit is very basic and is based on the Federal Power Act which he says limits power costs to fair and justifiable rates A primary strategy in this suit is to present it as a health and welfare and public safety suit he noted that there are million disabled children and convalescent homes in CA who can be adversely affected by blackouts He said it is not an economic lawsuit its about senior citizens disabled kids and convalescent facilities Today also happened to be the legislative day for the California Association of Health Facilities the nursing home trade assn and several nursing home workers were apparently asked to sit at the back of the room for effect Cotchett said FERC has been told for years that there were opportunities to exert market power He also claimed that a Redondo Beach facility obviously AES was fined million by FERC for taking its plant offline and substituting higher rates He said however that this order had been sealed He cited an industry report that predicts hours of blackouts this summer which could mean four hours a day That could be he said potentially the ruination of a lot of medicine in refrigeration Cotchett noted that only hospitals with more than beds are exempt from blackouts which does not protect surgical centers or many health facilities Jerry Brown added that prices are unjust and people are suffering Continued high prices could mean potential civic disruption and that there will be more actions to mobilize Western mayors Liz Figueroa spoke briefly to reiterate the health aspects of the lawsuit Burton had mentioned Clark Kelso who regularly appears on TV here as a legal expert and I believe was a colleague of Justice Anthony Kennedy in his Press Club appearance He said Kelso had appeared regularly in the media early on to say that the state had no standing to file the suit Burtons lawyers sent him the brief and Kelso thought enough of it to join the legal team Kelso reiterated that FERC has been aware of potential market power for three years and that the commission has delayed action unreasonably It has failed to define fair and justifiable that failure he said violates the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of the Constitution Kelso said this is not a partisan issue and called upon fellow Republicans to support the effort Joan Breuner sp Oaklands vice mayor said only that she believed that if the energy situation were happening in Texas rather than California the president and FERC would have acted long ago During the QA session Cotchett said the urgency filing is necessary because generators supply of the electricity in CA and all five have rate renewals before FERC He also said one of the cases that is relevant is Bush v Gore in which the Supreme Court found that failure to set standards regarding elections obviously in that case violates the Equal Protection clause He also said six states have expressed interest in the case and have requested briefs Oregon Nevada Arizona Washington Minnesota and one other he didnt name None of these states has yet committed to joining the suit

Calif Probe Focuses On DynegyMirant PlantsCommissioners Updated Monday May PMET By Jason Leopold and Mark Golden Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow JonesCalifornia officials are focusing an investigation into the states wholesale electricity markets on two power plants operated by two of the states largest merchant power companies Mirant Corp MIR news msgs and a joint venture between Dynegy Inc DYN news msgs and N RG Energy NRG news msgs according to two commissioners on the California Public Utilities Commission The CPUC and the state Attorney General are investigating whether output wa s withheld in order to maintain high prices over the past seven months at Mirants Pittsburg plant in northern California and the Encina power plant which is equally owned by Dynegy and NRG near San Diego All power plants in the state are being examined but investigators have found that the Encina and Pittsburg plants have reduced power during supply shortages causing market prices to rise But so far the commissioners said investigators have found no activity th at is clearly illegal Is it unethical Yes one PUC commissioner said But is it illegal No unless there was collusion This is the system we set up What the generato rs are doing would be the appropriate thing to do if you are going to maximize your profit to shareholders Spokesmen for Mirant and Dynegy flatly denied the charges What we did was both legal and ethical said Mirant spokesman Chuck Griffin There was a very forthright attempt to keep these plants up and running Unequivocally we have never held anything back Some of the turbines at the Encina plant are peaking units which are supposed to ramp up and down to meet demand Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel l said The plant is operated by NRG but Dynegy markets the power from the plant and tells NRG how much power to generate based on what has been sold Weve done absolutely nothing to manipulate prices Stengell said Electricity demand increases and decreases throughout the day Our production increases and decreases to follow changing demand Ultimately t he ISO determines the exact amount of dispatch A spokesman for Attorney General William Lockyer declined to comment on the ongoing investigation CPUC President Loretta Lynch told California newspapers last week that her office and that of Lockyers have enough information to take legal action against generators next month though she declined to name the companies involved and she said that the exact nature of the legal action is still under review We get really tired of these assertions with no evidence to back them up Griffin said This whole idea that any generation was held back at any tim e is completely bogus It is pure political rhetoric Mirants California power plants have run at full power during critical tim es except under one of two conditions Griffin said Either generating units were broken and had to be taken off line to be fixed or they were beginnin g to run in a way that violated environmental restrictions and Mirant had to get permission to run at full power any longer There are no other reasons than those two said Griffin Nevertheless several employees at the power plants involved have testified that generating units were ramped down even when the states Independent System Operator had warned of tight supplies according to one commissioner And a senior NRG employee at the Encina power plant in Carlsbad told Dow Jones Newswires that he was told by Dynegys Houston trading floor to ramp down the large megawatt plant on at least occasions when he knew power supplies were tight We would be told to ramp down the units even when we knew the state needed the megawatts the employee said Then the spot price would go up but we didnt really pay too much attention to that because as far as we know everybody was doing this We knew how much power other plants were operatin g at and we knew they werent at full capacity NRG spokeswoman Meredith Moore said that the ISO gives instructions to Dyne gy and Dynegy tells NRG what to do And there have been conditions when the I SO told us to ramp down during Stage emergencies Moore said Also one CPUC commissioner pointed out that the states deregulation law doesnt require owners of power plants to bid all of their capacity into th e market The states incumbent utilities who were forced to sell their power plants as part of deregulation also may have contributed to the problem accordin g to an ISO study By not securing nearly enough power in advance to meet the ir customers projected needs the states three main utilities contributed to Stage and power emergencies last summer and forced the grid operator to pay a much higher price to keep the lights on The utilities argued that they underscheduled their load so they wouldnt have to pay the generators high bid prices The ISO market last year had a price cap while other markets did not Mirants Griffin meanwhile said all the finger pointing isnt solving the states problem If they are going to get to a solution in California they have to get beyond silly political rhetoric Griffin said The real solution to the problem is to get new supply and if they are going to do that they have to make this market look attractive to the kind of people who can build power plants By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires Mark

Decision on Power Rate Hike Energy Panel will discuss a new plan today that would shift more of the burden to residences from business By TIM REITERMAN and MARLA DICKERSON Times Staff Writers SAN FRANCISCOThe states utility regulators delayed a decision Monday on how to structure a billion electricity rate increase until today when they will take up a revised plan that is expected to shift a larger share onto residential customers Assailed by power users and pressured by the governor the California Public Utilities Commission said more time was needed to assess the impact on competing interest groups The problem here is making sure we are allocating the increase equitably PUC President Loretta Lynch said after the meeting That she said is tricky About half the residential customers of the states two largest utilities would see increases under Lynchs plan proposed last week Bills for Southern California Edison customers who use moderate to heavy amounts of power would rise about to Similar customers of Pacific Gas Electric Co would experience increases of about to To encourage conservation Lynch said she favors moving more of the overall burden of the increases to residential customers who are moderate users of electricity Other commissioners say they believe that such a shift is necessary to protect the states business climate Consumer advocates voiced concern that the PUC may be yielding to pressure from industry groups that enjoy relatively low rates but say they are being hit unfairly with much larger percentage increases than residential customers The fear is the commission is caving in and taking the increase off big business customers and putting it on residential users above of baseline said Mike Florio senior attorney for the Utility Reform Network The baseline amount on a bill is the minimum of electricity deemed necessary for a customer and varies by region Under state legislation there is no rate increase for consumption up to of baseline Also exempted are lowincome customers who already receive discounted electricity rates The commission passed an increase of cents a kilowatt hour March In recent weeks the panel has been conducting hearings on how to divvy up the increase among million customers of Edison and PGE Mondays meeting was supposed to climax that process paving the way for utilities to start billing customers June Dozens of speakers addressed the commission and boisterous protesters in white coveralls repeatedly criticized the rate increase chanting I aint payin no hike while theyre getting rich from our power rates Who you gonna call Rate Busters One had to be dragged away from the microphone To stunned surprise Lynch later announced that the commission would not vote on her rate design proposed last week or a similar one proposed by a PUC administrative law judge Lynch revised the plan over the weekend and some commissioners said they had not yet seen the changes The delay means two commissioners will be out of town when the fivemember panel designs the states largest rate increase ever Commissioner Richard Bilas is undergoing a medical procedure in Mendocino County Commissioner Henry Duque is traveling to Texas as a director of the National Assn of Utilities Commissioners They said the law permits them to vote by phone as long as they do it from a publicly accessible place Lynchs proposal called for average rate increases of about to for various classes of customers But officials said the proposal was being reviewed after testimony late last week and mounting concerns among some commissioners that it would hit industry and big commercial customers too hard potentially hurting the states economy After his financial advisors reviewed the PUCs proposals Gov Gray Davis put out a statement over the weekend saying his own proposal including a slightly smaller rate hike was better My plan raises sufficient revenues to deal with the problem without putting an undue burden on California consumers and businesses that might hurt our economy he said The governors office last week asked the PUC to come around said press secretary Steve Maviglio There are gaps between his proposal and the PUCs Carl Wood one of three Davis appointees on the commission said that he was generally comfortable with the Lynch proposal but that this is a big decision and it is not ready for a vote Jeff Brown another Davis appointee said he spoke to the governors office recently and learned that Davis had two primary concerns about the proposal No that there be sufficient price signals within the residential class to make people conserve and that the industrials not be walloped and have some mitigation of the rate increase Brown said he would like to see industrial users paying less than the hike in Lynchs proposal He said that would mean residents who consume of their baseline amount would have their rates rise instead of about I want the proposed amount for industrial customers to go down somewhat but cant put all the burden on residentials he said There are no good answers Duque and Bilas appointees of former Republican Gov Pete Wilson expressed concerns that the rate proposal would further damage the economy Industry is not getting a fair shake Bilas said If you want to achieve maximum conservation you put the increase where demand is most elastic It should be placed on you and me Duque said I think industrial users are getting an undue amount Business groups have argued strongly that consumers must endure their fair share of the pain in order to encourage conservation Carl Guardino president and chief executive of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group said his group phoned Davis staff to voice their opposition to the proposed rate structure We found a receptive audience he said They saw that this proposed rate structure will deeply hinder our economy Reiterman reported from San Francisco Dickerson from Los Angeles Copyright Los Angeles Times

email also in red Forwarded by Jennifer RudolphHOUEES on PM From Jeff NRON on PM From the Dow Jones Newswire SoCal Ed May Be Near Financial Solvency With Plan B LOS ANGELES Dow JonesLegislators in California are beginning to embrace an alternative energy plan expected to be introduced as a bill this week that would get the state out of the power buying business in as little as six months and restore Edison Internationals EIX Southern California Edison unit to financial solvency without requiring the utility to sell any of its assets to the state If the plan wins the support of both houses of the Legislature lawmakers hope it will also convince a bankruptcy court judge in San Francisco that it can be used to lift PGE Corps PCG Pacific Gas Electric unit out of Chapter bankruptcy protection Clearly this would be a positive development said Paul Patterson a utility analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston in New York It would offer a way to restore the utilities to financial viability Weve noticed over the weekend that the situation in the Assembly is improving The proposal by Assemblyman Joe Nation DSan Rafael and Assemblyman John Dutra DFremont has gained the interest of some members of the Assembly Republican Caucus all of whom have resisted previous attempts at rescuing SoCal Ed from near bankruptcy Consumer groups have been resistant to any form of what they call a utility bailout But a spokesman at The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco said the group is studying the Plan B proposal On Friday a spokesman to Gov Gray Davis said state Sen Richard Polanco the Senate Majority Leader would introduce legislation this week enacting the agreement the governor reached with SoCal Ed exactly one month ago that would allow the utility to issue about billion in bonds to recoup its unrecovered power costs and sell its power lines to the state for billion to pay off its debt But Nation and Dutra members of the socalled Plan B group are looking to alter that agreement There are a lot of people who question the validity of buying the grid from SoCal Ed Nation an economist by trade said I think there is an understanding that the existing memorandum of understanding wont pass One of the problems with having the state purchase the grid at this point is that there wont be enough funds available to maintain and upgrade the lines to improve the flow of electricity according to several members of the Senate Budget Committee Were preparing for massive budget cuts this week because of this electricity crisis the member of the Senate Budget Committee said Plan Eliminates Purchase Of SoCal Eds Power Lines Nations proposal calls for the state to hold a fiveyear option to buy SoCal Eds transmission lines for its book value price of billion and eliminate a provision that would ease the regulation of the utility by the California Public Utilities Commission In exchange SoCal Ed can securitize a larger portion of its billion in unrecovered power costs backed by a larger dedicated rate component Moreover the utility would sell the state additional power at a cost beyond the years already agreed upon in the memorandumofunderstanding and additional power from other company sources Nation also wants to set up a ratepayer revenue account to refund consumers if generators agree to accept less than cents on the dollar He said however he does not plan to include a provision in any legislation that states generators must take a haircut on money the companies claim they are owed by SoCal Ed Republicans including Assemblyman George Runner RLancaster and Assemblyman Keith Richman RGranada Hills have been working closely with Nation and the Plan B group Jamie Fisfis a spokesman for the Assembly Republican Caucus said the caucus is not yet ready to support the plan but Republicans are happy they are being included in the discussions We have two criteria when we evaluate the plan Fisfis said The plan has to keep power rates as low as possible and puts more supply into the grid Steve Maviglio Davis press secretary said the governor has always said hes open to improvements in the memorandumofunderstanding But it has to remain a balanced transaction Maviglio said Nation a member of the Assembly since said the state would only have to spend a couple of weeks renegotiating the memorandumofunderstanding with Edison and that it could likely win a twothirds majority vote in the Assembly shortly after that Nation said he has had a number of conversations with Edison International executives on his proposal and they have been generally receptive because they believe the agreement with the governor wont pass A SoCal Ed spokesman was unavailable for comment Lawmakers Seeking Quick Exit From Power Buying Business California has committed billion of its roughly billion general fund buying power since January on behalf of PGE SoCal Ed and Sempra Energys SRE San Diego Gas Electric unit But several lawmakers and one of Davis financial advisers said Sunday that the state wants to desperately get out of the power buying business soon because of the economic impact the energy spending will likely have on education transportation and other state programs We are beginning to realize that if we dont get out of the business of buying electricity we will be in the same boat as the utilities said one state Senator who is also a member of the Senate Budget Committee Nation agreed saying the best thing we can do for California is get out of this mess were in We need to get the DWR out of the business of buying power Lawmakers Working To Keep SoCal Ed Out Of Bankruptcy A number of Democrats in the Assembly who have said SoCal Ed may be better off in bankruptcy now want to see the utility remain solvent Nation said I think several months ago bankruptcy wouldnt have seemed like such a challenge Nation said Nation said he fears that if SoCal Ed were in a bankruptcy setting the states socalled qualifying facilities renewable and gas fired power plants that contract directly with the utilities may win the right to sell their cheap power on the open market If that happens it will dramatically raise the risk to the state because we will be forced to buy that power Nation said I think people understand what the risks are and thats a real danger By

Edition STAR Montana s power crisis may be more intense thanCalifornias By JIM ROBBINS New York Times BUTTE Mont The last largescale metal mine is silent in this city that sits astride the Rocky Mountains The ton housesized orehauling trucks which once rumbled with loads hours a day have not fired up their engines since last summer Nor have the conveyors the crushers the concentrators and the grinders And most of the workers who carved out a living extracting copper molybdenum and silver from the foot deep Continental Pit have scattered to other states and other jobs Montana Resources which owns the mine has been out of affordable power for nine months At the beginning of the mine was paying a megawatt hour up from the year before Last week however a megawatt hour cost While California has grabbed most of the national headlines for a power crisis caused by deregulation gone awry rolling blackouts resumed there last week another power deregulation crisis has been unfolding here in Montana And in some ways it is far more striking in its impact While Californians may be somewhat protected from skyrocketing costs Montanans are not Paper companies mines and other large industrial companies in Montana have been laying off workers because they cannot afford to pay their electric bills Residents are expecting their household electric costs to as much as double by July A growing number of Montanans want to roll back the clock to a time when their state blessed with its own sources of cheaply produced power had some of the lowest electricity rates in the country Many residents are directing their anger at the Legislature which in their view deregulated the market for electrical power solely at the behest of the Montana Power Co once the states dominant utility Under deregulation that took effect three years ago Montana Power sold its hydroelectric and coalfired generating plants to PPL Corp the Allentown Pa company that sells power in states and in Canada Great Britain and Latin America Like other owners of power generation sites PPL has been profiting immensely under deregulation by charging rates based on the forces of supply and demand Montana Power still distributes electric power around the state but soon will be getting out of that business as well The change has left large power consumers such as Montana Resources scrambling to survive They have scoured the region for affordable alternatives They have asked PPL to make at least some cheaper electricity available but it is unclear if that will happen And they have lobbied the Legislature to reregulate electrical power Weve got to play all of our cards said Greg Stricker president of Montana Resources as he gazed over the companys open mining pit and a giant statue of the Virgin Mary that sits high on a mountain above it Were faced with extinction PPL however says it has no choice but to sell its power at market prices On a national scale the plight of Montana which has less than a million people is not as visible as that of California which has million But Montana s experience shows what can happen when power prices spiral out of control and businesses and consumers are not protected Montana s power crisis is rooted in the history of the Montana Power Co It was formed in by Anaconda Copper Mining to ensure power for Anacondas extensive mining milling and sawmill operations Montana Power built hydroelectric dams on rivers across the state dams that still create power at low cost Anaconda also was accustomed to getting its own way The company owned most of the states daily newspapers until and wielded tremendous influence among elected officials Anaconda the historian Bernard DeVoto wrote maintained a more thoroughgoing ownership of Montana s wealth government and inhabitants than any other corporation has ever been able to maintain in any other state The Anaconda era ended in when the company was bought by Atlantic Richfield the oil company that has since been acquired by BP Arco closed the mines in and the smelter in Montana Power which had become the states regulated utility outlived its creator By the mids however Montana Power was worrying about its own future Power deregulation a national trend looked inevitable and the companys big industrial customers already were shopping for sources of cheaper electricity So trying to make a virtue of necessity Montana Power began the process of getting out of the power business It diversified creating an Internet service provider called Touch America It also began to push for power deregulation saying it would result in lower costs and more customer choices The company was hoping that deregulation would make itself attractive to investors and potential buyers A deregulation bill the Electric Utility Restructuring and Customer Choice Act was introduced in March when the legislative session was nearly over Lawmakers most of them farmers and ranchers and businessmen approved it hastily To some critics of deregulation the passage smacked of the era when Anaconda dictated what the Legislature should do Few Montana lawmakers understood what was happening said Ken Toole a Democratic state senator and an opponent of the deregulation It was a steamroller with the mantra of free market Toole said Debate took place in a compressed period of time and it was not brought before the public Montana Power disputed that interpretation Jack Haffey its president and chief operating officer said it was not a bill pulled out of somebodys pocket and foisted on the public Still Montana Power emerged with marketable power plants and its thriving Touch America business The company sold its power plants to PPL investing much of the proceeds in Touch America Montana Powers shares adjusted for an August split soared to nearly in March from less than before deregulation The shares have since returned to a below range closing on Friday at Company insiders cashed in their stock options at the peak and some became rich And for a while at least deregulation appeared to be working Competition among power suppliers was pushing down the price of electricity In January Montana Resources power costs fell to a megawatt hour from the regulated price of But starting in June Stricker said the market started to go nuts Rising demand coupled with a lack of new supply pushed up prices sharply A megawatt hour spiked as high as and then settled back into the to range The regions power crisis has been aggravated recently by a drought that has reduced the amount of hydroelectric power generated Steve Walsh a Montana Resources spokesman said the companys suppliers told it that rates could reach a megawatt hour in the third quarter Montana s labor force meanwhile has suffered Since last summer according to the Montana affiliate of the AFLCIO more than workers have lost their jobs in layoffs caused by power price inflation

a special programin San Diego County Since several AReM members continue to do business in sDGEs service territory you might be interested in it The program is to be known as the Rolling Blackout Reduction Program RBRP SDGE proposes to deploy customerowned backup emergency generators during any ISOdeclared Stage event to bring additional generation online to reduce the need to have rolling blackouts Based on discussions with customers SDGE expects that approximately to additional megawatts MW of additional power could be made available through this proposed program These additional megawatts of demand reduction are critical to offset San Diegos anticipated share of ISO mandated statewide firm load reductions SDGE expects that the ISO will most likely require MW of statewide reductions during Stage firm load reduction events SDGEs share of this MW is or MW Therefore to MW of additional backup generation can reasonably be expected to reduce the number and duration of rotating outages in San Diego The RBRP is designed to run for a year beginning on May and pay capacity incentives each month for six months starting May and continuing through November Its availability for Summer will be determined after the upcoming summer SDGE proposes that this program be implemented only in San Diego county at this time Participating customers must have a backup emergency generator that is capable of providing at least percent of customers annual maximum demand but not less than kW Customers participation in the program is entirely voluntary but would require a firm commitment and be supported by both a contract and other tariff obligations terms and conditions As discussed more fully below participating customers will earn incentive payments for their actual load reduction and in addition if a customers load reduction is sufficiently great the customer also will receive a circuit exemption Once SDGE receives notification from the ISO that a Stage event and rolling outages have been declared SDGE would in turn notify participating customers to reduce demand through the use of their backup generation Customers would be required to reduce demand as quickly as possible but no later than minutes after the customer receives the notification SDGE would offset the amount of generation brought on line against the amount specified by the ISO the Stage event for the load curtailment to achieve the necessary load drop If SDGE were required to curtail more load than the backup generation provides or should load reduction be required faster than the generators could be started then SDGE would follow its normal curtailment plan to meet the full ISO requirement for load reduction net of the load reduction on the system caused by the customerowned backup generation The backup generators will run until ISO no longer requires a firm load reduction and all firm load is back in service SDGEs proposed tariff imposes no program limits on how often SDGE may call upon a customer to run its backup generator These and other terms and conditions are specified in SDGEs proposed tariff which appears as Attachment B to this Petition Do any

Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO In a visit meant to underscore the Bush administrations heightened concern about the California electricity crisis Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham met Thursday with Gov Gray Davis in Sacramento to discuss federal energy conservation plans I think we have an approach that can result in significant savings Abraham told Davis The energy secretary said he was in California to gauge what we can do to add to what California is already doing The trip came after President Bush revealed plans for a series of conservation measures for federal buildings and military bases nationwide Those facilities in California account for of the states total energy use Today Abraham is scheduled to meet with federal officials in San Francisco to work out details of the nationwide program for more than federal buildings After meeting with Abraham at the White House earlier Thursday Bush said Were worried about blackouts that may occur this summer and we want to be a part of any solutions This administration is deeply concerned about California and its citizens Defending his response to the California crisis Bush said As I said from the very beginning of my administration well work to help California in any way we can Also Thursday Davis met with alternative energy producers in an attempt to persuade them to continue operations despite being owed more than billion by Californias private utilities Alternative energy producers including oil companies that generate electricity as a byproduct of their operations account for about of the electricity consumed in California Several have stopped producing after the utilities could no long afford to pay soaring prices for their power Davis assigned S David Freeman and former Assemblyman Richard Katz a Davis appointee to a state water board to be in charge of negotiations Davis said he hoped that the talks could be completed within a week And in a sign that major energy companies may get more involved in the California crisis Kenneth Lay CEO of the Houstonbased energy giant Enron Corp met Thursday with Davis Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg DSherman Oaks and Senate President Pro Tem John Burton DSan Francisco Meanwhile Bush on Thursday directed federal agencies to take appropriate actions to conserve energy use at their facilities In California such measures could include setting thermostats to degrees lowering lighting and turning off escalators during Stage and Stage power emergencies administration officials said Those occur when the states electricity reserves fall below and respectively and can trigger interruptions in service Bush did not set an energysaving target But the Defense Department one of the states single largest energy consumersusing about of peak demandpledged to reduce peak use by this summer and an additional by summer That would make available megawatts officials said enough to provide electricity to about homes during the summer The federal government accounts for about of total energy use across the country making it one of the nations largest energy consumers according to the Energy Department Bush also offered to make available to the state powergenerating units owned by the federal government But his efforts failed to mollify Democratic critics who renewed calls for the administration to impose price controls on wholesale electricity The generating companies are gouging California consumers while the president turns his back on us Sen Barbara Boxer DCalif said in a statement Rep Sam Farr DCarmel leader of the California Democratic congressional delegation sent a letter to Vice President Dick Cheney protesting Democrats exclusion from Cheneys meeting this week with California GOP lawmakers As we head into the high summer demand months it is unfortunate that you have decided to keep Democrats in the dark about the administrations plans to deal with the crisis Farr said Bushs conservation initiative comes after Cheney who is heading a task force on national energy policy was assailed by some critics for emphasizing production over conservation Conservation has got to be an integral part of making sure weve got a reasonable energy policy Bush said Thursday But what the vice president was saying is we cant conserve our way to energy independence nor can we conserve our way to having enough energy available Weve got to do both We must conserve but weve also got to find new sources of energy David M Nemtzow president of the Alliance to Save Energy called the directive an emergency answer to a longterm problem We need to fix the underlying problem by investing in energyefficient lighting cooling and controls he said We hope that this crisis will encourage the president to increase the budget for energy management rather than cut it by as previously proposed Political analysts said the effort was driven by concerns for not only electrons but also elections Its all about political conservation said Marshall Wittmann senior fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute Thomas E Mann senior fellow at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution agreed The administration has come to the view that just because they cant win California in a presidential election doesnt mean the Republican Party can afford to kiss off the largest state in the Union Analysts speculated that the administration came under pressure from California Republicans in Congress who worried about perceptions that the White House was not being aggressive enough in responding to the crisis As federal officials search for ways that California can avoid blackouts this summer a Woodland Hillsbased advocacy group More Power to You has suggested that the Navy hook its nuclearpowered ships to the state power grid to provide energy while in port The Navy has nuclearpowered aircraft carriers and submarines in San Diego and Washington state But Navy officials said it is not technologically feasible to use the nuclear reactors aboard the ships to provide power for the grid because most of that power goes directly to the propulsion systems Even to capture power not used for propulsion would require extensive construction on shore and retrofitting aboard ship officials said Also using ships to provide onshore power could disrupt training and deployment schedules

RudolphHOUEES on AM Susan J NRON AM Power Concern Offers California a Secret Deal By JEFF GERTH and LOWELL BERGMAN Duke Energy a powergenerating company accused of overcharging customers millions of dollars during Californias yearold energy crisis has secretly offered Gov Gray Davis a deal that it hopes will solve its legal problems while helping to calm the states chaotic electricity markets The proposed settlement outlined in documents prepared in March by Dukes lawyers calls for an end to various state investigations private lawsuits and state complaints to federal authorities accusing Duke of overcharging In return Duke would make an unspecified appropriate payment but admit no wrongdoing Duke is committed to sharing pain and expediting highlevel confidential discussions that would embrace the governors political and public relations needs according to the documents which were given to The New York Times by someone who wanted the issue aired publicly Governor Davis acknowledged the secret discussions in an interview in San Francisco yesterday and said he hoped to meet with more generators soon But he insisted that none of the companies would escape a substantial payment because he said they have penalized the state with excessive prices My general approach to the energy companies is that you have already charged the utilities a percent credit penalty for the power they were buying from you Mr Davis said so youre going to have to have a very substantial reduction in what the companies are owed Mr Davis said Duke had walked in with a number of demands including an end to state inquiries but that that was not likely to happen Were not about to call off the dogs said the governor a Democrat who will seek reelection next year Duke based in Charlotte NC is a major investor in Californias wholesale electricity market having spent more than billion since the state opened its generating plants to outside operators in It is also near the top of the list of companies accused of overcharging Duke has been ordered by federal regulators to justify or refund million in disputed charges this year an amount that is thirdhighest among federally regulated companies in the California market By entering secret negotiations with Mr Davis and being the first generator to settle Duke could gain a publicrelations advantage in much the same way that the Liggett Group donned a white hat by being the first company to open talks with the state governments in the tobaccolitigation wars Weve just simply tried to be part of the solution Richard B Priory Dukes chairman and chief executive said in an interview adding that the company was offering ideas and throwing in suggestions Publicly Mr Davis has disparaged outofstate electricity generators before and after he began talking with them privately In an interview two weeks ago with The Los Angeles Times he called the generators the biggest snakes on the planet Earth for their pricing practices Californias electricity costs have risen to about billion last year from billion in By some estimates they could approach billion this year for every resident The state has stepped in to buy power for financially crippled utilities including Pacific Gas and Electric which is now in bankruptcy court The Davis administration has struck power deals with companies like Duke in hopes of securing a stable and affordable source of power To pay those bills Mr Davis is seeking the largest municipal bond issue in American history billion although some state officials privately estimate that the final amount will be higher The governor hopes the bond issue will eventually take the states taxpayers off the hook But how those costs are allocated among ratepayers utilities and generators and whether the bond issue can even succeed remain unanswered questions A major impediment to resolving the electricity crisis according to state officials utility executives and economists is the secrecy surrounding the administrations negotiations Several Republicans have sued the Davis administration to learn the terms of specific contracts entered into by the state On Monday the administration released a page financial analysis including its most detailed disclosure about the overall costs of state electricity contracts Last week Republicans blocked legislation that Mr Davis says he needs to pass the bond issue The bill could come up for a vote later this week The thing that has hindered Governor Davis the most among the legislative ranks is the demand for secrecy over the negotiations and the agreements that have been reached said Senator Joseph L Dunn a Democrat from Santa Ana and the chairman of a select committee investigating the price spikes Mr Davis in the interview said there were legitimate commercial reasons for keeping contract terms confidential The political uncertainty has spilled over into the markets where the bonds would have to be sold The states credit rating while still solid is slipping Already companies that do business with California like Duke are citing the states creditworthiness as a reason for charging higher prices in their dealing with the state though the state has stepped in as buyer since February The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission recently ordered generators to justify high prices in California this year or pay million in refunds The companies including Duke Reliant Energy Dynegy Inc and the Williams Company deny any wrongdoing and cite the states credit situation as one reason for the high prices Mr Priory the Duke chairman said that resolution of credit issues would lead his company to drop the socalled credit premium it now charges on power sales As of March Duke was owed more than million by the states power managers documents show In its confidential submission to Mr Davis and his aides Duke said it would forgive an appropriate amount of certain receivables or make an appropriate payment based upon a methodology that fairly represents its share of alleged overcharges The documents do not give an amount but Dukes annual report shows that its wholesale energy division had written off million for power sales to California that had not been collected Even with that writeoff the units profits before taxes doubled from to and quadrupled for the first quarter of this year Dukes preliminary global settlement template of March goes on Duke is committed to sharing pain with state and others on a fair and equitable basis without admitting legal liability because Duke has done nothing illegal Duke says that much of its California power was sold last year on the forward markets not the more volatile and higherpriced spot markets But Mr Priory also noted in his interview that at least percent was sold for whatever the market price is On March Dukes lawyer at the request of Mr Daviss legal affairs secretary forwarded to the governors office additional information about pending litigation involving Duke and its power sales in California The documents show that a top Duke priority is the prompt suspension of state investigations lowering of rhetoric and stay of state litigation as well as the withdrawal of staterelated claims at the federal energy commission Also in March the operators of the states power grid told the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that wholesale electricity prices in California were more than billion above competitive prices over the previous months Duke has questioned the methodology of that submission and wants the claim withdrawn The inquiries of concern to Duke include those being conducted by the office of the attorney general William Lockyer and the California Public Utilities Commission Barry P Goode the governors legal affairs secretary says he subsequently referred Dukes lawyer to the attorney generals office The two state agencies say that their inquiries are continuing Sandra Michioku a spokeswoman for Mr Lockyer said Our investigation is ongoing Loretta Lynch the president of the utility commission said in a telephone interview yesterday The public utilities commission has not been involved in any settlement discussions with generators and our investigations into overcharges and withholding are ongoing and strong The Duke documents say the company should be given preferential treatment for its conciliatory stance Other generators said they were not involved in settlement discussions with Mr Davis nationalDAVIhtmlexDeiD enD cbdddf Visit NYTimescom for complete access to the most

Date April To Jan SmutnyJones Steven Kelly Katie Kaplan Cc IEP Board Members From Julee MalinowskiBall Re Legislative Status Report Week Ending RECENT EVENTS Rule Never assume an issue is done until the ink is dry from the Governors signature and even then you never know The Senate Republicans agreed late this week to oppose SB x Sher which makes several IEPsponsored proposals to the siting process due to a controversial provision added in the Assembly Appropriations Committee regarding unemployment compensation Assembly Republicans let it slide on process because CMTA and the Chambers objections to the egregious language was so last minute Senate Republicans had more time to look at the issue and agreed not to let it go forward Since they control of the final vote in a bill requiring twothirds their united opposition stopped the bill one vote shy The author was granted reconsideration and discussions will be ongoing over the next week on how to proceed The bestcase scenario at this point is getting one Republican to drop from the ranks Worstcase scenario is the bill dies and our language gets picked up in another vehicle starting the whole process all over again The more likely scenario however lies somewhere in between Parties will agree to some compromise language send the bill back to the Assembly to make the appropriate changes then bring it back to the Senate for a clean vote Longterm contracting was moved to the front burner this week by Asm Wright AB and Senator Morrow SB both with different results Both measures which are almost identical set forth a criteria which if followed by an IOU when signing a longterm contract with an energy supplier would eliminate the need for a reasonableness review by the CPUC AB passed out of the Assembly Utilities and Commerce committee with little discussion and a few technical amendments SB faced a longer more difficult hearing in front of Senator Bowens Energy Committee IEP along with the three IOUs testified in support of the measure while TURN expressed great concerns with the concept of leaving the CPUC out of the picture In the end the Senate committee agreed to put the bill off for further discussions passed a motion in support of getting the appropriate rule waver so the bill can be heard again after Fridays policy committee deadline and scheduled a stakeholder meeting for Thursday morning Senator Burton announced on the Senate Floor Thursday morning however that all requests for rule wavers would be denied AB appears to be the only active vehicle on this issue and IEP will be at the negotiating table providing input on the language as it moves forward AB x is scheduled for hearing next week in the Senate Energy Committee IEP met with committee staff this week which revealed some possible latitude in amending the bill IEP and other member company lobbyists will be pushing hard for an opposed position from the rest of the committee before the hearing Tuesday afternoon At this time however we do not have any alternative language for the bill After further review by some IEP member companies the previously drafted amendments appear unworkable and were withdrawn from consideration We anticipate on waiting to see where the committee on Tuesday takes the issue before another attempt at drafting alternative language SB x SotoScott was amended this week before its hearing in the Senate Appropriations committee next week The new language finds a backdoor to the price cap issue by imposing a percent tax on the sale of electric power that exceeds a base price of per MWhr CMTA the Chamber and CalTax will be coordinating strategy for the hearing with IEP and the generators but despite the bills multiple constitutional and legal problems most admit the measure will move forward with little trouble A new player on the scene will probably provide the most noteworthy testimony InterGen North America which is developing a MW power plant in Palm Springs plans on testifying that if this measure is signed by the Governor they will absolutely pull the project and go to Oklahoma Newly amended this week is AB x Cardoza which now makes it a felony for a corporation that sells electricity or natural gas at unjust or unreasonable rates Sponsored by Lt Governor Bustamante the measure establishes stiff fines and possible jail time that could be subject to the states three strikes law AB x has already generated opposition from Republicans and constitutional questions from legal experts Although Cardoza noted that several aspects of the bill are unresolved and could change the intent will remain the same and he insists that energy companies that take advantage of Californians will still face significant penalties SB x Burton which establishes

J NRON cc Subject CA Legislative Committee Hearing on California Border Gas Prices FYI This is the presentation that the Brattle Groupa consulting group that Edison has long used on gas issues in Californiagave last week to t he legislative committee investigating wholesale gas prices at the California Border The day following this presentation which was followed by a presentation by the California PUCs FERC lawyer the committee called El Paso and Dynegy to respond to Brattles and the CPUC FERC lawyers presentations Also attached is the best synopsis of the hearing that Ive seen in the press Best Jeff Competing evidence clouds Calif investigation Prompted in part by the California Public Utilities Commission the California Assembly has been scrutinizing the role that interstate pipelines have played in the states current energy crisis In the efforts to find a smoking gun legislators have leane d heavily on a report prepared by The Brattle Group a consultancy commissioned by utility Southern California Edison to dig up evidence of market power abuse But the states biggest transporter of gas to California El Paso Natu ral Gas is not ready to take the rap The pipeline has commissioned its own study which i t recently presented as evidence that it has not circumvented any laws or regulation As reported in both the trade press and national media SoCal Ed and the CP UC are pointing the finger of blame at El Paso for alleged manipulation of California borde r prices through affiliate deals and capacity hoarding And exhibit A in their case against El Paso is The Brattle Groups study of the California market Richard Zeiger a spokesman for Assembly Member Darrell Steinberg chairman of the California Assembly Judiciary Committee told Gas Daily that The Brattle Groups market study proved that the surge in gas prices at the California border was not caused by normal market forces GD His remarks followed an oversight hearing during which Assembly members questioned Dynegy and El Paso officials about their involvement in the California market El Paso presented a different version of events to the Assembly In a repor t presented to legislators a research group hired by El Paso concluded that a convergence of factors not a conspiracy caused the price runup Lukens Consulting Group a Houstonbased consultancy was retained by El Pa so to conduct work on several fronts In its study of the California market Lukens concluded that the increasing convergence of the gas and electricity businesses was one of the main culprits in the California gas price imbroglio Assemblyman John Campbell a Republican member of the oversight committee said he didnt see any smoking gun in either report We had our committee hearing and we certainly had a lot on the Brattle Study and a little on the Lukens study To some degree Im not sure that the California legislature is the best place to adjudicate the differences between these two studies Campbell said I believe FERC is looking at this situation and it would seem to me that thats the appropriate place Campbell said that the CPUC had been prodding the California legislature to give support to its claims of market power abuse by pipelines Its being pushed basically by the Public Utilities Commission here which believes that there was collusion by pipeline companies to push up gas prices in California he said The CPUC Campbell suggested sought satisfaction before the California assembly when it had failed on the federal level Theres a concerted effort not jus t on natural gas but on other things here in California for entities and organizations here to point the finger elsewhere for the problems that were having in this state and I think youre seein g some of that with the public utilities commission Whether either report wins over the public incensed by high natural gas prices is a different matter entirely In the meanwhile the dueling California market studies se em to have taken on a life of their own The Brattle Group Study for instance has become the center of a heavily litigated effort to force FERC to compel the release of market data by California market participants Following on a request by SoCal Ed which said it needed additional data to round out The Brattle Group report FERC Chief ALJ Curtis Wagner issued subpoenas to the other three major pipelines that serve the state as well as to Sempra Energy Trading Several parties resisted FERCs call for market information saying the requested data contained commercially sensitive information FERC allowed the discovery process to move forward but only after attaching strict data protection rules restricting access to evidence GD Critics of the pipeline industry have already suffered one setback in their case The commission recently dismissed the CPUCs claim that El Paso rigged the auction of a large block of pipeline capacity in favor of affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy In addressing the California Assembly representatives of Dynegy said that FERCs recent ruling on th e California border controversy obviated the need for more investigation The controversy however is far from over FERC last month also ordered a hearing into whether El Paso Natural Gas and its affiliates manipulated capacity to driv e up the price of gas delivered into California GD That hearing is

to billion The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission orders generators who have so ld electricity to the state to share power purchase information with the feder al agency which will then supply the

state legislators and energy experts after Gov Gray Davis announcement of a billion deal to buy Southern California Edisons transmission lines The deal was reached Monday three days after Pacific Gas Electric Co balked at selling its power lines to the state and filed for bankruptcy Davis and Democratic legislators have pushed to purchase the whole transmission system owned by the states debtsaddled private utilities They reason that by owning the highway that electricity must travel to reach homes and businessesa mile web of wire that is the worlds fifthlargest coordinated power gridthe state would gain a negotiating advantage with the companies that produce the power If Californias transmission grid were entirely owned by the public political leaders believe the state could gain jurisdiction over key electricity issues now decided by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which has been reluctant to intervene in the energy crisis The state not the commission could then set its own transmission fees and control the flow of electricity across the grid Transmission charges bring in roughly billion a year for the three utilities With that money the state could not only repay itself for the purchase of the power lines but also fund system upgrades to unclog electricity bottlenecks that contribute to blackouts Owning the wires is a business and this business operates at a profit said Assemblyman Roderick Wright DLos Angeles who will head a series of committee hearings on the plan to buy the Edison lines Were not going into their yards and buying old trucks or something we are buying a vital piece of their electrical system However now that Pacific Gas Electric has opted to try to find a solution to its debt problem in Bankruptcy Court rather than continue negotiations with the state the prospects of California acquiring the entire system appear uncertain at best That is generating concern about what California is getting for its moneyand whether the state stands a chance of gaining any independence from federal regulatorsif it buys only the lines of Edison and San Diego Gas Electric The Edison deal which needs legislative approval is unlikely to garner a single vote from RepublicansAssembly Republican leader Dave Cox RFair Oaks calls the grid purchase a socialistic idea The plan may also encounter some Democratic opposition It was a tough sell to begin with and I think if you are going to only buy part it becomes a tougher sell said Assemblyman Dean Florez DShafter And some utility experts say California gains little if anything unless it acquires the whole system The motivating factor for buying the grid as opposed to hydroelectric power plants is because it addressed the central problem facing California The federal government is unwilling to crack down on the generators that are ripping us off and we need to take back control said UC Irvine professor Peter Navarro If you only buy of the system you might as well have nothing California would not be able to make some of the most critical upgrades needed to improve the flow of electricity if it did not acquire PGEs portion of the system The worst energy bottleneck in California is the notorious Path a series of highvoltage lines that move power between Southern and Northern California Path lies largely in PGEs territory Davis and some state legislators say California still has a chance to buy the entire grid Some in fact believe that the utilitys bankruptcy increases the likelihood of a deal Talks between Davis and PGE had faltered in recent weeks and a judge may have better luck bridging their differences Negotiations between the state and San Diego Gas Electric continue leaving the possibility of a deal with that utility But acquiring PGEs portion the largest and most important by far now requires the approval of a federal Bankruptcy Court judge And in that arena the state may have to compete with private companies for the lines TransElect a Washington company that wants to create a national network of independently owned transmission lines has offered to buy and operate the grids of Edison and PGE for a total of billion The company has also been in contact with the Davis administration on the possibility of leasing the lines from California if they are bought by the state For the state to buy any of the systems it needs approval from FERCfar from a sure thing The commission in recent years has encouraged states to put management of large sections of the nations transmission grid into private hands to achieve more efficient electricity flow Even if the commission approved the purchase the state may not receive any increased powers FERC would like to see one large regional transmission system in the West said David Clement a transmission expert with Cambridge Energy Research Associates If FERC were to unconditionally approve the sale then the transmission system owned by Edison would leave FERC authority However FERC could easily condition the sale such that the transmission grid remains under their authority Copyright Los Angeles Times

each state Louisiana on verge of power crisis they say I think I might move to Nebraska Heres an attachment for easy distribution Heres the full article for quick scanning Monday April PM ET Power Situation by State By The Associated Press A statebystate look at the electric power situation for summer Alabama Blackouts and rolling brownouts are unlikely as utilities are required to maintain a reserve percent above what is needed to meet peak demand Residential and business customers will pay rates about percent above a year ago Alaska Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely Hydroelectric power is plentiful and generating systems are not being taxed Electric bills are expected to fall slightly Arizona There is little likelihood of a power interruption Utilities are prepared to handle the summer electricity demand and price caps prevent the major utilities from increasing rates Arkansas Blackouts and rolling brownouts are highly unlikely Electric bills are expected to rise percent as increased fuel costs are passed on to customers and because the summer is expected to be even hotter than a year ago when readings topped out at degrees in Little Rock California Forecasts of tight power supplies throughout the West have energy experts in California warning of statewide rolling blackouts this summer Power grid managers say concerted conservation efforts accelerated construction of new power plants and a bit of luck could help avoid blackouts Grid managers have already ordered rotating blackouts on four days since January Los Angeles will most likely be spared because the LA Department of Water and Power provides its own generation and isnt connected with the states grid Colorado The state is unlikely to experience blackouts or brownouts as percent of its power comes from coalfired plants Because of fixed longterm contracts for coal producers do not anticipate any fuel cost adjustments Connecticut No brownouts or blackouts are anticipated Brownouts are possible though if there is a prolonged spike in usage while power plants are down Utilities are under a mandatory price rate cap Delaware Enough power is available to avoid blackouts or brownouts but questions linger about whether utilities can deliver it Power is undergoing deregulation in Delaware and officials are concerned over the possibility of increased costs However under a deregulation law the cost of electricity is temporarily capped Florida Power outages are unlikely this summer as the state has reserves of about percent Utility companies have already increased their rates to cover higher fuel costs Unless coal and oil wholesale prices increase sharply consumers should not expect major rate increases Georgia Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely in the state because a forprofit regulatory system gives suppliers an incentive to build more generating plants Rising costs for natural gas which fuels almost all new electric plants could increase residential electric bills by percent Hawaii There is little likelihood of blackouts rolling brownouts or price spikes As an island state Hawaiis electricity system is not connected with that of other states Each island has its own generation system and supply is sufficient to meet demand Idaho There is little chance of blackouts or rolling brownouts but bills are rising The states largest utility wants a percent increase in residential rates Illinois Blackouts and rolling brownouts are unexpected as generating has been increased with a number of small peaker plants Homeowners shouldnt see a rate increase either electricity rates are locked in through under the states deregulation plan Indiana There is no expectation of blackouts or brownouts unless there are weeks of very hot weather or a power plant stops operating Utility companies are urging consumers to conserve energy and believe that will maintain the remaining state energy surpluses which have decreased from percent to percent over the past decade Iowa While the state does not expect blackouts this summer problems could occur as early as with serious capacity problems by Only singledigit price increases are expected this summer Kansas Blackouts and rolling brownouts are unlikely Kansas has never had a regional transmission blackout The size of electric bills will depend on how hot it gets and how much power customers use for air conditioning State law prohibits price spikes by regulated utilities which supply percent of residential customers Kentucky Electricity rates in the state are among the lowest in the nation but will likely rise between percent and percent by largely due to pollution control equipment upgrades There is adequate supply to avoid brownouts and blackouts this summer Louisiana No blackouts are expected this summer but utility officials say the state is on the verge of a power crisis unless more plants are built Consumer advocates say bills are likely to increase by as much as percent with very high natural gas prices and a hot summer in the forecast Maine Five new natural gasfired power plants are on line or coming on line soon reducing the prospect of any rolling blackouts No consumer rate increases are expected Maryland The Public Service Commission does not expect any service interruptions and believes electricity rates will not rise An electric deregulation plan implemented last year reduced and then froze rates for homes and businesses Massachusetts Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely because New England has added a half dozen new power plants in the past months enough supply to outpace demand surges Residents will likely see hefty rate hikes in the winter including as much as percent for some consumers Michigan Under a state law signed last year that will deregulate the electricity industry in utilities cut rates by percent and must cap those rates for five years Although demand for electricity is growing between percent and percent annually utilities say they have enough supply to meet demand Minnesota No blackouts or rolling brownouts are likely unless there is an extended heat wave or a power plant failure Electricity costs are expected to remain steady Many customers however will spend the summer months paying off natural gas and electricity bills from the long cold winter Mississippi Blackouts this summer are unlikely The two main power suppliers are taking measures to boost their reserves during peak summer months and new independent generating plants also are available Mississippi Power expects bills for customers to be percent to percent higher this summer Entergy another supplier has not filed its summer rate plan yet Missouri Utilities have plenty of generating capacity and supply contracts so service interruptions arent expected The state Public Service Commission says three large utilities are bringing new or expanded generating plants on line State law bars rate spikes by PSCregulated utilities so customer bills shouldnt reflect higher generating costs Montana Blackouts and rolling brownouts are not expected Montana Power customers will not see price increases this summer because the company is under a virtual rate freeze until July Flathead Electrics rates rose percent on April and an additional percent increase is possible this fall The two companies serve more than half of the customers in Montana Nebraska No rolling blackouts are expected Electric bills are not expected to increase since the states largest utility already increased its rates by percent to percent Nevada Major utilities are not expecting blackouts or rolling brownouts but monthly electricity bills for two power companies will go up percent to percent a month through September based on alreadyauthorized incremental rate increases State lawmakers reacting to Californias energy crisis are processing measures that would block deregulation from taking effect Gov Kenny Guinn also has said he will not let deregulation take effect under and laws unless hes confident consumers wont be harmed New Hampshire Blackouts are unlikely but customers may have to conserve power on very hot days As part of deregulation rates will drop about percent for customers of the states largest electric utility But rates could rise percent to percent for customers of the secondlargest utility New Jersey Blackouts are unlikely because of protections included in a yearold energy deregulation law Rates are capped until However regulators allowed utilities to raise natural gas rates over the summer percent a month through July to make up for money lost over the winter to skyrocketing fuel prices New Mexico Most of the state will escape power outages and rate increases during the summer months New York To head off potential power shortfalls in New York City the New York Power Authority is rushing to finish construction of small natural gas turbines Upstate New Yorks largest utility says it has enough power to avoid blackouts and brownouts during the summer Rates are regulated across much of the state but in New York City customers pay market prices North Carolina No blackouts or rolling brownouts are expected No major rate cases are pending in the state among the large regulated utilities North Dakota The state exports about percent of the electricity produced from seven coalfired power plants and is facing no power shortages this summer Electricity bills to power air conditioners are not expected to double from the previous summer the way natural gas bills doubled in the winter Ohio No blackouts or rolling brownouts are expected unless there is a long heat wave Prices for residential customers will remain flat for the next five years as part of a deregulation plan that took effect Jan Oklahoma There is little likelihood of blackouts or rolling brownouts between May and September but Oklahoma Gas Electric which has customers in the state and northwestern Arkansas expects electricity bills to be percent to percent above last summer Oregon Some extraordinary measures may be needed to ensure there are no rolling blackouts or brownouts this summer The measures could include curtailing hydroelectric programs that help salmon Price spikes could occur Pennsylvania No blackouts or brownouts are expected The state is a net exporter of power and has more than enough supply to meet demand Electricity bills will not rise this summer because power companies agreed to cap their rates in come cases through Rhode Island Blackouts are unlikely partly because of power plants built in New England in recent years Businesses could see electric rates rise as much as percent South Carolina With reserves of about percent there is very little chance of power interruption in the state Two major utilities have obtained rate increases of about percent to reflect higher fuel costs Increased demand from summer air conditioning normally pushes summer bills up percent by July South Dakota The majority of power comes from dams or coalfired generating plants rather than natural gas There is little chance of power shortages this summer and rates should remain stable Tennessee Tennessee Valley Authority electric rates were last raised in and should remain steady through the summer No blackouts or brownouts are expected Texas Additional transmission lines should reduce the likelihood of blackouts or rolling brownouts Certain fuel surcharges related to natural gas prices may cause higher electricity bills Utah Officials are counting on Californians to cut their energy use and free more power for use on the Western electricity grid to avoid blackouts or brownouts Utah power has received a percent interim rate increase and has percent rate increase awaiting approval Vermont Chances of blackouts or brownouts are low Much of Vermonts electricity is imported from Quebec though the state is also dependent on the regional power grid that serves New England Electric rates are regulated Virginia Blackouts and brownouts are highly unlikely because of an increase in the generating capacity of the states largest utility The size of electric bills will be determined by the weather and consumption not any change in rates which are capped through Washington Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely although utilities will have a razorthin power margin that would not withstand the loss of a power plant or transmission line Electricity largely comes from dams and a severe drought is reducing the water supply and raising prices Industrial and residential customers of public utility districts have already seen rate increases Rates could rise percent to percent this year West Virginia Generating capacity is sufficient to meet peak air conditioning needs None of the four major utilities has requested a rate increase Wisconsin Electric bills could run as much as percent higher this summer because of surcharges to cover rising prices for natural gas which fuels many plants State officials ordered utilities in December to increase their reserves from percent to percent to bolster reliability during the summer Wyoming Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely but could occur because the state grid is intertwined with other systems that could experience shortages Xcel Energy serving Cheyenne has applied for a percent price increase Similar filings are expected from other suppliers
