today Thursday and Friday to get you caught up on what has been happening in the Curricular Review Task Force meetings then approximately one report per week thereafter If you do not wish to receive these reports just send a return email and Ill take you off the mailing list Thanks Deborah Report from Curriculum Review Task Force First Report to the Faculty November The Curriculum Review Task Force has been meeting on a regular basis from August After receiving a written charge from President Giese and Dean Arnold the Task Force was provided with a detailed conceptual frame work by Dean Arnold and a position paper written by Raj Ambrose on the Process and Some Possibilities The task force has also been reading a bunch of relevant literature including several articles and book excerpts published by national organizations like the Association of American Colleges and Universities Council of Independent Colleges and American Council of Education Several issues were discussed during our early meetings I will not attempt to summarize them here The minutes of these meetings have been posted in one of the Public Folders To access this folder please go to Public Folders All Public Folders Documents College Curricular Review Task Force As a first step it was decided to look into the strengths and weaknesses of our academic program Professor Lee McGaan was invited to attend our meetings on October and and he reviewed with us what has been learned about our academic curriculum through the assessment program The group also discussed with Professor McGaan and Dean Condon the results of ACT Student Opinion Survey the ACT Alumni Survey and a detailed analysis of the Transcript Reflection Survey It is good to have the current chairs of the Curriculum Committee the FIDC and the Faculty Senate as members of the task force The Curriculum Committee has conveyed to the task force some of its concerns and ideas regarding our current curriculum We are now discussing the structure delivery and effectiveness of our general education program The task force invites input from all the faculty members at any point of our discussions If you have any thoughts or concerns about our academic program please share them with me or any member of our task force We will keep you informed as we proceed with this important task Raj Ambrose Chair Curriculum Review Task Force Curriculum Review Task Force Second Report to the Faculty December Since my first report last month the Curriculum Review Task Force could meet only twice because of the Thanksgiving break During our November th meeting we had extensive discussions with Dr Jeanne Narum Director of Independent Colleges Office in Washington and the highly successful Project Kaleidoscope Because of her extensive background as a grants officer a Vice President for College Relations and ICO Director we could talk to Dr Narum as a general consultant for our curricular review She indicated that we are moving in the right direction and gave some valuable suggestions The November th meeting focused primarily on the implications of the Teagle grant for our curricular initiative We are working on the type of regional consultants see below we want to bring and their time schedule The Task Force is also planning to meet with our new faculty members those who have joined us in the past few years soon We are currently discussing the strengths and weaknesses of our academic program We value your input in this matter so far we have received only one response to our request in this regard The Curricular Review Task Force has stressed from its inception the need for working closely with the faculty and the rest of the campus community We see the Teagle grant as a great opportunity for faculty development and as an important avenue for continued interaction with the whole faculty as we move forward with our curricular initiative The Teagle proposal has three major phases Organizational Phase Planning Phase and Implementation Phase We are currently in the organizational phase when the Task Force meets on a regular basis through the academic year In February and March we will bring three regional consultants for oneday visits In late May and early June the Task Force will work intensively for days when we will have a nationally recognized consultant with us for of those days After this session the Task Force chair will prepare a report to the faculty with recommendations on how to proceed This report will include a summary of the work done till then general areas of curriculumprogramming to be explored the methodology to examine promising approaches feasibility of adopting Abest practices currently implemented in peer institutions and a mechanism for assessing curricular effectiveness in terms of institutional goals The Planning Phase and Implementation Phase will provide ample opportunities for faculty input and interaction Funds are available during each phase to send member teams of faculty members and administrators to national conferences and peer institutions The peer institutions will be chosen on the basis of their being similar to Monmouth College and of their having implemented significant curricular initiatives in recent years In this connection it should be noted that the Association of American Colleges Universities will be naming Leadership Institutions this Fall from a pool of applicants which are representative of a wide range of institutional types and of a rich variety of successful curricular innovations These institutions would form a Consortium of Quality Education and host a series of Abest practice seminars comprising a Forum of st Century Liberal Arts Education We will send our member teams to some of these seminars if they are relevant to us We are also planning to get a list of these applicants who want to become Leadership Institutions Over the course of the Planning and Implementation phases Round Tables will be arranged during each phase In these Round Tables those who attended conferences and peer institutions will share with their colleagues their experiences and findings Further during Summer and Summer two carefully planned day workshops will be arranged to which nationally recognized consultants will be invited to work with the participants Stipends will be available to all the participants The Final Proposal is expected to be submitted for faculty approval in early Fall If we make good progress according to the proposed plan then stipends each will be available to faculty members during Summer to work intensively on course enhancement and design The Faculty Senate has been briefed on the implications of the Teagle grant and each Senator has been given a copy of the full proposal submitted to the Teagle Foundation The Curricular Review Task Force looks forward to working with you on this exciting and challenging project Thanks Raj Ambrose Chair

basis After Dr Ambrose recovered from the shock he asked me to let you know that future reports will be sent to you monthly My apologies to you and Dr Ambrose Thanks Deborah Curriculum Review Task Force Third Report to the Faculty February The Task Force has summarized the perceived strengths and weaknesses of our current academic program on the basis of written comments from its members as well as a couple of other faculty members copy attached I would like to emphasize that at this point these are just considerations This led to a drawing up of a list of goals and aspirations for our curriculum The Task Force has proposed the following activities for this semester Our college has hired new faculty members over the past four years including the current year Many of these folks have rich experiences from other institutions We have planned to meet with them on February A small subgroup consisting of Arnold Judy Peterson Sorenson Watson and Ambrose have planned this meeting A list of ten questions has been sent to the new faculty to help them come prepared for this meeting A copy of the list of questions is herewith attached The Teagle Grant provides for three Regional Consultants to be invited to the campus this semester After considerable discussion the Task Force is considering the following approach in the selection of these consultants We would like to bring a demographer who can discuss with us the population trends and the type of students we may attract in the coming years The second regional consultant will be a cognitive psychologist who can talk to us about the metacognitive learning process In a recent book suggested by Jeanne Narum titled How People Learn John Bradford et al point out that AThe revolution in the study of the mind that has occurred in the last three or four decades has important implications for education As we illustrate a new theory of learning is coming into focus that leads to very different approaches to the design of curriculum teaching and assessment than those often found in schools today p The third consultant will be from an institution like Evergreen State College in Washington which has successfully introduced a highly acclaimed and innovative curriculum in recent years These regional consultants will pay oneday visits and the faculty and staff will be invited to participate Please let me know if you have any suggestions for the choice of regional consultants By the end of the semester we hope to have some clear idea about the process and possibilities for our curricular initiative Soon after commencement we are planning to have a retreat for the faculty and staff during which time with the help of a wellknown facilitator we will try to formulate a taskoriented academic vision for this college This will be followed by a threeday May consultation with a nationally recognized academic leader For these types of consultants the calendar fills up fast I am happy to announce that Dr Andrea Leskes Vice President for Education and Quality Initiatives at The Association of American Colleges and Universities has already agreed to be with us for three days from May She comes with excellent credentials to guide us in this great task I will give you more details in my next report Raj Ambrose Chair Curriculum Review Task Force Report to the Faculty March The Task force met with the new faculty on February Only a couple of the new faculty members invited could not come and we had excellent discussions We have kept detailed notes of the discussion which was reviewed at the next meeting of the Task Force on Feb The Biology consultant Dr Judith Dilts has a good background in the modern methods of teaching Science and Math through the Project Kaleidoscope PKAL and the Task Force had a good discussion with her on Feb I shall take this opportunity to brief you on some important activities we have planned for this semester On April George Dehne a nationally recognized authority on student demographics will be in our campus for the dual purpose of conducting an Admission Audit and serving as a consultant for our Curriculum Review George Dehne President of George Dehne and Associates was one of the major speakers at the meeting of the Chief Academic Officers arranged by the Council of Independent Colleges in Tampa FL last November Dean Arnold was very impressed by this presentation Dehne will address the faculty on Tuesday April around or pm and will have a detailed discussion with the Curriculum Review Task Force at pm the following day As per the notice I sent to you earlier there will be a Faculty Conference on May and with Dr Ronald Purser serving as the facilitator Two of the eight Huseman questions we had discussed in the midnineties are still significant for our Curricular Review The first question is AWhich students should we serve What has been our traditional student profile and what should be the future student profile The discussion with George Dehne should help us to find more up to date answers to this question The other important question we have been discussing for a while is AWhat is our unique identity and market niche In broader terms this could define our academic vision and set the goals of liberal education at Monmouth College We as a community will work on this and Ron Purser will be able to help us to arrive at some decisions Dean Arnold and I had a long discussion with Ron Purser last week He will go through a series of group exercises on May and and those who attend the conference need to make a commitment to participate for both days Ron thinks that his methodology will be most productive for a group not exceeding to members If you are planning to participate please respond to my notice sent through Leah McLaren We are also trying to bring a cognitive psychologist as a consultant on the student learning process We have contacted a Professor at the Columbia University Teachers College If you know a good person in this field do let me know Thanks Raj Ambrose Chair
<4793136.1075860207237.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,dkdavis@monm.edu,2001-05-03 05:50:00,Attachment to Curricular Review Task Force Report Cc Summary of the Written Comments from our Members and A Couple of Faculty Members General Education Structure The fouryear program with its existing rubricscheme seems to make sense as long as it is an integrated coherent and distinctive program The relation between the general education and majors needs to be examined and an authoritative body should be charged with the responsibility of continuously reviewing all programs and the curriculum There is a suggestion that Sophomore and Junior level Seminars should be introduced According to our catalog p the requirements of a Monmouth College degree involves Four years of academic work earning at least semester hours Completion of Freshman Seminar Completion of a major program and Completion of the five components of the general education program Language The Physical Universe and its Life Forms Beauty and Meaning in the Works of Art Human Societies and Issues and Ideas One comment is that the present rubric scheme is woefully inadequate to the understanding of the Self for which we need to address metaphysical issues epistemological questions and issues of God spirit and man Freshman Seminar Monmouth College introduced this course in the early eighties and several schools have added similar courses to their curriculum in subsequent years There seems to be a strong commitment among the faculty and administration to continue to develop and teach this course The following are some of the comments and suggestions It is very resource intensive is trying to do too many things in one semester and is quite regimented in its organization and delivery Instructors need some flexibility after establishment of clear limited and common goals for the course We should commit more resources to this venture and a greater proportion of senior faculty should teach this course More stipends andor release times are needed for the faculty to continue the development of this course and to provide shadowing experience to new faculty members who are interested in teaching it Language This component generally makes sense keep strengthen and change it There is a suggestion to reduce the foreign language requirement and to introduce more courses on foreign cultures and traditions There is an almost universal agreement that our graduates need more experience in writing in its several forms composition creative writing technical writing etc We think our task force needs to examine carefully possibly with a consultant the concept of Awriting across the curriculum and find ways of incorporating it in our academic program There is also a suggestion that we should require composition courses at the Junior and Senior levels Beauty and Meaning in the Works of Art This component seems to work well There is a call for a wider range of choice of courses in this rubric Perhaps we should consider some courses on aesthetics Physical Universe and its Life Forms This component also seems to be working well The assessment of this rubric last semester did not call for any radical changes The Assessment Committee is satisfied with the goals concept and delivery of this component Some questions were raised on the understanding of the scientific method by our students Scientific literacy is very important in this technological age Do students understand the relation between science and technology There is a call for courses on History or Philosophy of Science and Science Society offered by HT folks Human Societies There is much dissatisfaction with the menu of courses offered beyond Comparative Societies This smorgasbord of courses can be replaced by a slate of to courses with multiple sections which address spirituality in different ways Another suggestion is to limit this menu to a set of Introduction to Social Sciences courses and to make Comparative Societies valuebased It should be noted that our assessment program indicates that our fifth purpose of exploring Athe spiritual dimension of human existence and the relationship between faith and knowledge is not being addressed by our academic curriculum Issues and Ideas This course is supposed to provide the culminating experience in our general education program It seems to be working well Can we develop some common goals for the to courses offered under this rubric Should we go back to the twocourse Systems of Thought and Belief mode Majors We should plan to review all the current majors We should strive to provide a state of the art emphasis in most majors eg Molecular Biology Computational Dimension in Natural Sciences Media Concentration Public Relations Sports Management etc According to AACU there is a Amuddle in the middle in most major programs Is there coherence and integration within the disciplines How do the majors relate to the general education We are expected to make recommendations for adding modifying and eliminating course offerings and programs May be when more majors become attractive and cutting edge they will stem the tide towards Business and Education Further Suggestions There is wide support for introducing a Quantitative Reasoning requirement in our curriculum There is a relevant article in our red folder We may have to look at Abest practices in peer institutions and work with a regional consultant to see how this can be implemented How do we educate our students to make valuebased decisions in this fastchanging and complex world Many schools have introduced Ethical InquiryMoral Reasoning requirement in their curriculum There are two relevant articles in our red folder Again we may want to look at Abest practices in peer institutions or work with a regional consultant to see how this can be implemented We need to introduce course requirements under the broad category of Internationalization Globalization and Cultural Diversity in our curriculum Do we need to develop courses that explicitly deal with Modes of Inquiry Critical Thinking Logical Reasoning Problem Solving etc Other General Considerations Related to Curricular Review The six questions Dean Arnold has raised on the articulation of our curricular goals understanding the needs of our students and the world they are entering into and the allocation of resources The implications of the Teagle grant Adoing nothing is not a viable option and if we come up with strong initiatives management support may be forthcoming Simplify the process for curricular initiatives streamline the budget process and review our style of management There is no ongoing support for Instruction Technology and our current policies and procedures continue to frustrate folks especially some of our newer faculty Our semester schedule is anathema to aims of a serious liberal arts education the semester system breeds fragmentation superficiality freneticism hyperactivity and resentment We need to continue to address the work load issue

the last faculty meeting the CRTF has held two meetings and a subgroup of the CRTF met once We are making careful preparations for our April meetings with the ConsultantDemographer George Dehne as these events have strong curricular implications On March President Giese Dean Arnold and I had a lengthy conference call with George Dehne This call was very helpful in setting the stage for his visit At our request he suggested a couple of research articles for us to read The CRTF found the following two articles very useful and discussed them in detail at one of its meetings and later at the meeting of the subgroup Another Look at the Future of the Private College The New Student Generation Are We Ready Do We Care These articles are available in his firms website If you would like to read them please go to wwwgdaiscom and access the link News and Research George Dehne will make a presentation to the faculty on Tuesday April at pm in the Highlander Room The Planning Group has asked him to address some specific issues as part of his presentation A copy of my letter to him in this regard is attached herewith The Task Force will discuss the implications of his presentation at two subsequent meetings with him As you know Dr Ronald Purser a nationally recognized consultant facilitator will work with us on May and to help us make some strategic decisions regarding the future of our college He will be using a sophisticated approach on which he has coauthored a book under the title The Search Conference A Powerful Method for Planning Organizational Change and Community Action He has already sent us a copy of this book and more articles are in the mail We will share the relevant material with you We are pleased to announce that a fivemember team from our college has been selected to attend an Institute on Campus Leadership for Sustainable Innovation on July in Leesburg VA It is being conducted by the Association of American Colleges and Universities with the support of the Carnegie Corporation of New York Forty institutions from all over the country are expected to participate in this Institute About half of them were invited as Leadership Institutions Hence there was stiff competition for the remaining positions and our team consisting of Haq McGaan Watson Arnold and Ambrose was selected on the basis of a fivepage narrative we wrote The Institute besides helping us become a strong learningcentered institution should be very valuable for our Curricular Review The Institute will also give us an opportunity to interact with some of the leading colleges and universities which have successfully implemented innovative academic programs Our team will share their experiences with the campus community through a Fall Round Table Thanks Raj Ambrose Chair Attachment to Report Mr George C Dehne President GDA Integrated Services Dear George Preparations are underway for your visit both by the Office of Admissions and the Curricular Review Task Force The Task Force read your research articles carefully and had a detailed discussion on several aspects of them in their meeting on March A subgroup of the Task Force is planning the details of our meetings with you We all feel that these events are very important for our curricular initiative We thought that we should let you know some of our thoughts in relation to your research articles so that you can possibly address them in your presentations and informal discussions A very important question for the Monmouth College community is how do we position ourselves in the st century taking into account awhat the students are looking for these days bwhat the employers are expecting from college graduates and cwhat are the realistic market forces and thereby develop a strategy to balance these important factors with the liberal arts tradition and mission of our College As you know Monmouth College belongs to the consortium Associated Colleges of the Midwest Among the ACM Colleges there are colleges like Carleton in which you have served before and Grinnell who do not offer a Business program or prepare students for Teaching Certification However in Monmouth about twothirds of our students are in the Business and Education programs We do try to teach our Business Accounting and Education courses from the liberal arts perspective Yet we cannot deny the fact that these disciplines are more professionoriented than other disciplines like the hard sciences philosophy classics etc None of us wants Monmouth College to become another vocational school The realities college finances student base infrastructures etc are such that we cannot be a classic liberal arts institution either like Carleton Grinnell and Macalaster Hence the crucial question for us is how do we position ourselves in this spectrum of ACM and other nearby schools and develop a unique identity or niche for ourselves In abstract terms we want to be a true liberal arts college that is sensitive to the market forces What are your thoughts on this important question On a less philosophical level it will be helpful if you can develop for us the demographics and student characteristics for Illinois separately and for Illinois and its contiguous states We are also interested in metropolitan areas such as Chicago where we have a strong student base and American minorities like Hispanics as well as Internationals Who are the emerging minorities in our region and what are their academic interests How do we attract the Asian population with their attraction for Sciences and big name schools When we look for outofstate students how does financial aid plays into the admissioncurriculum dynamics As we build the curriculum for the future we wonder what kind of academic program will help us to attract and retain students If we assume no serious change in the student profile in the next years how should we conceptualize our curriculum If we assume continued changes in the student profile of our region how dynamic and flexible our curriculum should be to stay relevant in this fast changing world Your outstanding articles on Another Look at the Future of the Private College and The New Student Generation Are we Ready Do we Care Have given us much to think about In the first article you are talking about five kinds of small American Colleges pp Monmouth College seems to fall in the fourth group Is this good or bad What group should we ideally aim for given our circumstances We have all these exciting questions to some extent triggered by your thoughtful articles We hope you can help us to find some answers I will check with Marybeth regarding the material she is sending to you We shall send you a distribution of our majors We will also send a copy of the recent issue of our quarterly Scotsnewse which has a coverpage article on our Curriculum Initiative Please let us know if you need anything else We look forward to your visit Sincerely Rajkumar Ambrose Associate Dean of the Faculty Chair Curriculum Review Task Force Curriculum Review Task Force CRTF Report to the Faculty May Last Friday April during the presentation of the approved budget for year Dean Arnold announced that three tenuretrack positions will be available for the new curricular initiatives that may come out of our current comprehensive curricular review This commitment has been made by the college administration on the assumption that we continue to maintain our current enrollment and financial status This is a tremendous encouragement for our academic enterprise and on behalf of the CRTF I would like to thank President Giese the Presidents council and the FIDC for their continued support and encouragement for our Curricular Review Since our last faculty meeting the CRTF has held two meetings Its planning subgroups also met twice In addition the CRTF had two lengthy meetings with George Dehne besides participating in his presentation to the full faculty The discussions with George Dehne helped us to understand to some extent the demographics of our region what the present day students parents and employers are looking for in college education the type of market forces we have to deal with and future societal trends It is very gratifying to note that liberal education will continue to be in demand in order to meet the needs of our fast changing world The work load issue also came up in our discussions Dehne further pointed out that the two semesters calendar is not congenial for introducing curricular innovations We also got some insight into how other colleges are dealing with these issues We are now getting ready for the twoday conference May with Dr Ronald Purser We have already sent him plenty of material connected with our curricular review which he has read diligently In the meantime he has sent us his book The Search Conference A Powerful Method for Planning Organizational Change and Community Action and other articles Last Wednesday President Giese Dean Arnold and I had a detailed phone conversation with Dr Purser He mentioned that he is quite impressed by the curricular review material we have sent him and the progress we have made so far As ours is one of the biggest groups he has worked with he is bringing an Associate Dr Adrienne Gans who is a clinical psychologist She got her doctorate from University of California Berkeley and taught for a while in New York University before getting into the business world Both have considerable experience in working with a variety of organizations that are planning to make significant changes in their communal enterprise The cover sheet of Pursers book states that The Search Conference is not just another management tool but a participative approach to planned change that engages the collective learning and creativity of large groups inspiring people to find common ground around new strategies future directions and joint actions The process combines the best practices associated with strategic planning systems thinking and effective group communications enabling participants to take part fully rise above selfinterest and make decisions for the common good This is exactly what we would like to do soon after commencement Raj Ambrose Chair CRTF

October was a very busy and productive month for the Curriculum Review Task Force We had intensive threehour meetings on October and which were followed by routine meetings on October and On the th three CRTF members George Arnold Craig Watson and Raj Ambrose participated in a meeting of the Academic Affairs Committee of the Trustees which was devoted entirely to the Curriculum Review As explained in my last report the CRTF obtained unanimous agreement on the five Educational Goals A Critical Thinking B Communication C Values Inquiry and Exploration D Variety of Human Experience and E Depth of Knowledge and Integration of Learning with an addendum on WellnessHealth Cocurriculum The Task Force then used an intensive work session to brain storm on the operational ends of these goals Further discussion and some pruning led to or operational ends for each goal Two members of the Task Force wrote the descriptive statements for each goal and its operational ends These were then reviewed by the full Task Force and with another member contributing the preamble the draft statement on Educational Goals copy attached was ready for presentation to the faculty At the request of the CRTF the Faculty Senate reviewed these educational goals and decided to send them for a ACommittee of the Whole discussion at the ensuing faculty meeting We would like to point out that the CRTF looked at several models from other schools in preparing the Educational Goals Some of these schools are very similar to Monmouth College The ten trustees who were present at the Academic Affairs Committee meeting had a preview of the draft educational goals The trustees received them very well and made some valuable suggestions The CRTF has spent considerable time discussing how these goals can be achieved through a wellplanned fouryear integrated curriculum The workload calendar departmental structure general education models and available resources are some of the major issues that are being considered in relation to the achievement of these educational goals Dr Tom Sienkewicz brought to our attention that Dr Gregory Dougherty who gave the recent Bernice L Fox Classics Lecture is a member of the Curriculum Review Task Force at Randolph Macon College which is also in the midst of a major Curricular Review As part of this process they had studied the Educational Programs of about half a dozen colleges which are similar to Randolph Macon and our college happened to be one of them We invited Dr Dougherty to the meeting of our Task Force on October and had a very fruitful discussion with him Of particular interest to us is Randolph Macons new first year program which uses a threecourse sequence of ALearning Communities developed and taught by all their faculty taking turns We decided to keep in touch Raj Ambrose Chair Draft Educational Goals The AEducational Goals listed and briefly described below represent consensus of the Curriculum Review Task Force about intended outcomes and experiences of the academic program that should guide review and revision of the Monmouth College curriculum especially with reference to Areinvesting in pedagogy and reimagining design to enhance student learning We are confident that this list summarizes educational goals central to the liberal arts philosophy of higher education We also understand that these educational goals affirm and clarify elements of the Mission Statement of the college and those Apurposes derived from the Mission that directly address the academic program Having spent considerable time articulating these goals we are keenly aware that agreement about the language we use to describe them is both important for subsequent stages in the review process and achievable only through discussion and mutual compromise Our aim then in the ACommittee of the Whole discussion upcoming at the November th Faculty meeting is to present this statement for your review explain what we mean by the language we have used listen to your responses and if necessary make changes What will we do if and when we win your agreement to this or a revised version of AEducational Goals We will decide questions we have already begun to discuss AGiven these goals how best may we enable students to achieve them in four years of undergraduate education Specifically does our present array and structure of disciplines optimally promote achievement Our calendar Our workload Our general education program Our pedagogical approaches in classroom settings Our extracurricular curricular programming residence education internships offcampus opportunities etc In light of this critique which in the coming months will itself sponsor more frequent discussions of possible proposals for change in calendar workload General Education etc we will attempt to map and model then four years of undergraduate education ideally designed to achieve our educational goals In this phase of the process especially we will involve faculty as researchers resources and planners to a understand our student clientele and their typical cognitive development b revise our current curriculum and c enhance pedagogy and clarify assessment strategies pertinent to our educational goals With approval of AEducational Goals we imagine spending the next five to seven months on stages and with the understanding that it may be possible to pass new initiatives and proposals for revision incrementally along the way Furthermore given the scope of our Areview it may well be necessary to imagine a multiyear schedule of planning and phased implementation that extends well beyond the term of the current task forces assignment It should be noted that competencies like critical thinking and rhetoric though presented conceptually as separate entities under different goals will actually be interwoven throughout the curriculum and work interactively with other competencies and goals A Critical Thinking Critical thinking is an acquired intellectual process through which students are able to analyze carefully and critically all ideas and information by distinguishing fact from fallacy questioning assumptions synthesizing knowledge and arriving at logical conclusions This competency is demonstrated by the ability of students to understand the logic validity and relevance of their own arguments and the information and ideas they observe and work with pose and solve complex problems and make informed decisions understand and apply the scientific method where the concerned discipline requires such an approach and work with numerical data and apply quantitative reasoning in processing such data B Communication Communication is a foundational competency which the students absolutely need and continue to learn across the curriculum with a conscious effort to improve their reading writing speaking listening and information literacy skills This competency is demonstrated by the ability of students to use effectively and grammatically a broad English vocabulary in speaking and writing through accomplished rhetorical strategies access evaluate select interpret and incorporate information and media sources in their studies and to be productive in the modern technological world have a basic understanding of another language besides English and its cultural background and interact with others with empathy and understanding and collaborate effectively in group settings C Values Inquiry and Exploration It is the ability of students to explore the nature and scope of the human condition through specific modes of inquiry and to develop a system of values that would help them make real choices and assume responsibility for their actions This competency is demonstrated by the ability of students to address thoughtfully the basic question Awho am I and develop a clear Aknowledge of the self and understand how it motivates all their actions understand and explore the concept that religion is basically a system of beliefs and activities that responds to the transforming power of the sacred or ultimate as perceived by a particular community of people develop a Acode of conduct or Arules for living based on the highest ethical ideals so that they can think and act through principled moral reasoning learn the values of social responsibility and the importance of being an honest and true citizen and observe appreciate and experience the beauty and art in the creation of this moral universe D Variety of Human Experience Students today are constantly reminded that they indeed live in a global society It is critical that they understand that there are many ways of being human and that the world is rich with a variety of cultural perspectives In order to prepare students for their future careers and personal lives in this environment students should be able to develop global awareness have a basic understanding of another language besides English and its cultural background understand that there is a variety of cultural perspectives that exists in this world and develop the analytical skill to interpret these perspectives and establish a historical sense and perspective that help them comprehend past events and frame in a broader perspective different worldwide events that influence their daily lives E Depth of Knowledge and Integration of Learning An important component of liberal education is to study in depth a discipline or group of disciplines and see the connections within the discipline and with other areas of study thereby leading to a collaborative and integrated learning experience The students thus develop an intellectual depth to grasp major concepts understand the limits of a discipline and its linkages and the ability to use such knowledge in their field of work an appreciation and understanding of interdisciplinary studies laboratory expertise and field experience in their chosen fields and the competence to pursue scholarly research as a culminating experience in their field of study Addendum WellnessHealth Cocurriculum It is important that we offer learning environments for our students that reflect recent research findings that explore the connections between our physical and mental capacities Therefore we should provide our students with learning opportunities that integrate the philosophies of sound mind and sound body Students would learn about and participate in activities that will improve their health and overall quality of life This goal is demonstrated by the ability of students to participate in physical fitness activities develop an ability to establish wellness of mind and understand the importance of a healthy environment for healthy living Note After considerable discussion it was decided at least for now to keep AHaving a basic understanding of another language under both B ACommunication and D AVariety of Human Experience

the last faculty meeting the CRTF has held two meetings and a subgroup of the CRTF met once We are making careful preparations for our April meetings with the ConsultantDemographer George Dehne as these events have strong curricular implications On March President Giese Dean Arnold and I had a lengthy conference call with George Dehne This call was very helpful in setting the stage for his visit At our request he suggested a couple of research articles for us to read The CRTF found the following two articles very useful and discussed them in detail at one of its meetings and later at the meeting of the subgroup Another Look at the Future of the Private College The New Student Generation Are We Ready Do We Care These articles are available in his firms website If you would like to read them please go to wwwgdaiscom and access the link News and Research George Dehne will make a presentation to the faculty on Tuesday April at pm in the Highlander Room The Planning Group has asked him to address some specific issues as part of his presentation A copy of my letter to him in this regard is attached herewith The Task Force will discuss the implications of his presentation at two subsequent meetings with him As you know Dr Ronald Purser a nationally recognized consultant facilitator will work with us on May and to help us make some strategic decisions regarding the future of our college He will be using a sophisticated approach on which he has coauthored a book under the title The Search Conference A Powerful Method for Planning Organizational Change and Community Action He has already sent us a copy of this book and more articles are in the mail We will share the relevant material with you We are pleased to announce that a fivemember team from our college has been selected to attend an Institute on Campus Leadership for Sustainable Innovation on July in Leesburg VA It is being conducted by the Association of American Colleges and Universities with the support of the Carnegie Corporation of New York Forty institutions from all over the country are expected to participate in this Institute About half of them were invited as Leadership Institutions Hence there was stiff competition for the remaining positions and our team consisting of Haq McGaan Watson Arnold and Ambrose was selected on the basis of a fivepage narrative we wrote The Institute besides helping us become a strong learningcentered institution should be very valuable for our Curricular Review The Institute will also give us an opportunity to interact with some of the leading colleges and universities which have successfully implemented innovative academic programs Our team will share their experiences with the campus community through a Fall Round Table Thanks Raj Ambrose Chair Attachment to Report Mr George C Dehne President GDA Integrated Services Dear George Preparations are underway for your visit both by the Office of Admissions and the Curricular Review Task Force The Task Force read your research articles carefully and had a detailed discussion on several aspects of them in their meeting on March A subgroup of the Task Force is planning the details of our meetings with you We all feel that these events are very important for our curricular initiative We thought that we should let you know some of our thoughts in relation to your research articles so that you can possibly address them in your presentations and informal discussions A very important question for the Monmouth College community is how do we position ourselves in the st century taking into account awhat the students are looking for these days bwhat the employers are expecting from college graduates and cwhat are the realistic market forces and thereby develop a strategy to balance these important factors with the liberal arts tradition and mission of our College As you know Monmouth College belongs to the consortium Associated Colleges of the Midwest Among the ACM Colleges there are colleges like Carleton in which you have served before and Grinnell who do not offer a Business program or prepare students for Teaching Certification However in Monmouth about twothirds of our students are in the Business and Education programs We do try to teach our Business Accounting and Education courses from the liberal arts perspective Yet we cannot deny the fact that these disciplines are more professionoriented than other disciplines like the hard sciences philosophy classics etc None of us wants Monmouth College to become another vocational school The realities college finances student base infrastructures etc are such that we cannot be a classic liberal arts institution either like Carleton Grinnell and Macalaster Hence the crucial question for us is how do we position ourselves in this spectrum of ACM and other nearby schools and develop a unique identity or niche for ourselves In abstract terms we want to be a true liberal arts college that is sensitive to the market forces What are your thoughts on this important question On a less philosophical level it will be helpful if you can develop for us the demographics and student characteristics for Illinois separately and for Illinois and its contiguous states We are also interested in metropolitan areas such as Chicago where we have a strong student base and American minorities like Hispanics as well as Internationals Who are the emerging minorities in our region and what are their academic interests How do we attract the Asian population with their attraction for Sciences and big name schools When we look for outofstate students how does financial aid plays into the admissioncurriculum dynamics As we build the curriculum for the future we wonder what kind of academic program will help us to attract and retain students If we assume no serious change in the student profile in the next years how should we conceptualize our curriculum If we assume continued changes in the student profile of our region how dynamic and flexible our curriculum should be to stay relevant in this fast changing world Your outstanding articles on Another Look at the Future of the Private College and The New Student Generation Are we Ready Do we Care Have given us much to think about In the first article you are talking about five kinds of small American Colleges pp Monmouth College seems to fall in the fourth group Is this good or bad What group should we ideally aim for given our circumstances We have all these exciting questions to some extent triggered by your thoughtful articles We hope you can help us to find some answers I will check with Marybeth regarding the material she is sending to you We shall send you a distribution of our majors We will also send a copy of the recent issue of our quarterly Scotsnewse which has a coverpage article on our Curriculum Initiative Please let us know if you need anything else We look forward to your visit Sincerely Rajkumar Ambrose Associate Dean of the Faculty Chair Curriculum Review Task Force Curriculum Review Task Force CRTF Report to the Faculty May Last Friday April during the presentation of the approved budget for year Dean Arnold announced that three tenuretrack positions will be available for the new curricular initiatives that may come out of our current comprehensive curricular review This commitment has been made by the college administration on the assumption that we continue to maintain our current enrollment and financial status This is a tremendous encouragement for our academic enterprise and on behalf of the CRTF I would like to thank President Giese the Presidents council and the FIDC for their continued support and encouragement for our Curricular Review Since our last faculty meeting the CRTF has held two meetings Its planning subgroups also met twice In addition the CRTF had two lengthy meetings with George Dehne besides participating in his presentation to the full faculty The discussions with George Dehne helped us to understand to some extent the demographics of our region what the present day students parents and employers are looking for in college education the type of market forces we have to deal with and future societal trends It is very gratifying to note that liberal education will continue to be in demand in order to meet the needs of our fast changing world The work load issue also came up in our discussions Dehne further pointed out that the two semesters calendar is not congenial for introducing curricular innovations We also got some insight into how other colleges are dealing with these issues We are now getting ready for the twoday conference May with Dr Ronald Purser We have already sent him plenty of material connected with our curricular review which he has read diligently In the meantime he has sent us his book The Search Conference A Powerful Method for Planning Organizational Change and Community Action and other articles Last Wednesday President Giese Dean Arnold and I had a detailed phone conversation with Dr Purser He mentioned that he is quite impressed by the curricular review material we have sent him and the progress we have made so far As ours is one of the biggest groups he has worked with he is bringing an Associate Dr Adrienne Gans who is a clinical psychologist She got her doctorate from University of California Berkeley and taught for a while in New York University before getting into the business world Both have considerable experience in working with a variety of organizations that are planning to make significant changes in their communal enterprise The cover sheet of Pursers book states that The Search Conference is not just another management tool but a participative approach to planned change that engages the collective learning and creativity of large groups inspiring people to find common ground around new strategies future directions and joint actions The process combines the best practices associated with strategic planning systems thinking and effective group communications enabling participants to take part fully rise above selfinterest and make decisions for the common good This is exactly what we would like to do soon after commencement Raj Ambrose Chair CRTF

Faculty Members General Education Structure The fouryear program with its existing rubricscheme seems to make sense as long as it is an integrated coherent and distinctive program The relation between the general education and majors needs to be examined and an authoritative body should be charged with the responsibility of continuously reviewing all programs and the curriculum There is a suggestion that Sophomore and Junior level Seminars should be introduced According to our catalog p the requirements of a Monmouth College degree involves Four years of academic work earning at least semester hours Completion of Freshman Seminar Completion of a major program and Completion of the five components of the general education program Language The Physical Universe and its Life Forms Beauty and Meaning in the Works of Art Human Societies and Issues and Ideas One comment is that the present rubric scheme is woefully inadequate to the understanding of the Self for which we need to address metaphysical issues epistemological questions and issues of God spirit and man Freshman Seminar Monmouth College introduced this course in the early eighties and several schools have added similar courses to their curriculum in subsequent years There seems to be a strong commitment among the faculty and administration to continue to develop and teach this course The following are some of the comments and suggestions It is very resource intensive is trying to do too many things in one semester and is quite regimented in its organization and delivery Instructors need some flexibility after establishment of clear limited and common goals for the course We should commit more resources to this venture and a greater proportion of senior faculty should teach this course More stipends andor release times are needed for the faculty to continue the development of this course and to provide shadowing experience to new faculty members who are interested in teaching it Language This component generally makes sense keep strengthen and change it There is a suggestion to reduce the foreign language requirement and to introduce more courses on foreign cultures and traditions There is an almost universal agreement that our graduates need more experience in writing in its several forms composition creative writing technical writing etc We think our task force needs to examine carefully possibly with a consultant the concept of Awriting across the curriculum and find ways of incorporating it in our academic program There is also a suggestion that we should require composition courses at the Junior and Senior levels Beauty and Meaning in the Works of Art This component seems to work well There is a call for a wider range of choice of courses in this rubric Perhaps we should consider some courses on aesthetics Physical Universe and its Life Forms This component also seems to be working well The assessment of this rubric last semester did not call for any radical changes The Assessment Committee is satisfied with the goals concept and delivery of this component Some questions were raised on the understanding of the scientific method by our students Scientific literacy is very important in this technological age Do students understand the relation between science and technology There is a call for courses on History or Philosophy of Science and Science Society offered by HT folks Human Societies There is much dissatisfaction with the menu of courses offered beyond Comparative Societies This smorgasbord of courses can be replaced by a slate of to courses with multiple sections which address spirituality in different ways Another suggestion is to limit this menu to a set of Introduction to Social Sciences courses and to make Comparative Societies valuebased It should be noted that our assessment program indicates that our fifth purpose of exploring Athe spiritual dimension of human existence and the relationship between faith and knowledge is not being addressed by our academic curriculum Issues and Ideas This course is supposed to provide the culminating experience in our general education program It seems to be working well Can we develop some common goals for the to courses offered under this rubric Should we go back to the twocourse Systems of Thought and Belief mode Majors We should plan to review all the current majors We should strive to provide a state of the art emphasis in most majors eg Molecular Biology Computational Dimension in Natural Sciences Media Concentration Public Relations Sports Management etc According to AACU there is a Amuddle in the middle in most major programs Is there coherence and integration within the disciplines How do the majors relate to the general education We are expected to make recommendations for adding modifying and eliminating course offerings and programs May be when more majors become attractive and cutting edge they will stem the tide towards Business and Education Further Suggestions There is wide support for introducing a Quantitative Reasoning requirement in our curriculum There is a relevant article in our red folder We may have to look at Abest practices in peer institutions and work with a regional consultant to see how this can be implemented How do we educate our students to make valuebased decisions in this fastchanging and complex world Many schools have introduced Ethical InquiryMoral Reasoning requirement in their curriculum There are two relevant articles in our red folder Again we may want to look at Abest practices in peer institutions or work with a regional consultant to see how this can be implemented We need to introduce course requirements under the broad category of Internationalization Globalization and Cultural Diversity in our curriculum Do we need to develop courses that explicitly deal with Modes of Inquiry Critical Thinking Logical Reasoning Problem Solving etc Other General Considerations Related to Curricular Review The six questions Dean Arnold has raised on the articulation of our curricular goals understanding the needs of our students and the world they are entering into and the allocation of resources The implications of the Teagle grant Adoing nothing is not a viable option and if we come up with strong initiatives management support may be forthcoming Simplify the process for curricular initiatives streamline the budget process and review our style of management There is no ongoing support for Instruction Technology and our current policies and procedures continue to frustrate folks especially some of our newer faculty Our semester schedule is anathema to aims of a serious liberal arts education the semester system breeds fragmentation superficiality freneticism hyperactivity and resentment We need to continue to address the work load issue

basis After Dr Ambrose recovered from the shock he asked me to let you know that future reports will be sent to you monthly My apologies to you and Dr Ambrose Thanks Deborah Curriculum Review Task Force Third Report to the Faculty February The Task Force has summarized the perceived strengths and weaknesses of our current academic program on the basis of written comments from its members as well as a couple of other faculty members copy attached I would like to emphasize that at this point these are just considerations This led to a drawing up of a list of goals and aspirations for our curriculum The Task Force has proposed the following activities for this semester Our college has hired new faculty members over the past four years including the current year Many of these folks have rich experiences from other institutions We have planned to meet with them on February A small subgroup consisting of Arnold Judy Peterson Sorenson Watson and Ambrose have planned this meeting A list of ten questions has been sent to the new faculty to help them come prepared for this meeting A copy of the list of questions is herewith attached The Teagle Grant provides for three Regional Consultants to be invited to the campus this semester After considerable discussion the Task Force is considering the following approach in the selection of these consultants We would like to bring a demographer who can discuss with us the population trends and the type of students we may attract in the coming years The second regional consultant will be a cognitive psychologist who can talk to us about the metacognitive learning process In a recent book suggested by Jeanne Narum titled How People Learn John Bradford et al point out that AThe revolution in the study of the mind that has occurred in the last three or four decades has important implications for education As we illustrate a new theory of learning is coming into focus that leads to very different approaches to the design of curriculum teaching and assessment than those often found in schools today p The third consultant will be from an institution like Evergreen State College in Washington which has successfully introduced a highly acclaimed and innovative curriculum in recent years These regional consultants will pay oneday visits and the faculty and staff will be invited to participate Please let me know if you have any suggestions for the choice of regional consultants By the end of the semester we hope to have some clear idea about the process and possibilities for our curricular initiative Soon after commencement we are planning to have a retreat for the faculty and staff during which time with the help of a wellknown facilitator we will try to formulate a taskoriented academic vision for this college This will be followed by a threeday May consultation with a nationally recognized academic leader For these types of consultants the calendar fills up fast I am happy to announce that Dr Andrea Leskes Vice President for Education and Quality Initiatives at The Association of American Colleges and Universities has already agreed to be with us for three days from May She comes with excellent credentials to guide us in this great task I will give you more details in my next report Raj Ambrose Chair Curriculum Review Task Force Report to the Faculty March The Task force met with the new faculty on February Only a couple of the new faculty members invited could not come and we had excellent discussions We have kept detailed notes of the discussion which was reviewed at the next meeting of the Task Force on Feb The Biology consultant Dr Judith Dilts has a good background in the modern methods of teaching Science and Math through the Project Kaleidoscope PKAL and the Task Force had a good discussion with her on Feb I shall take this opportunity to brief you on some important activities we have planned for this semester On April George Dehne a nationally recognized authority on student demographics will be in our campus for the dual purpose of conducting an Admission Audit and serving as a consultant for our Curriculum Review George Dehne President of George Dehne and Associates was one of the major speakers at the meeting of the Chief Academic Officers arranged by the Council of Independent Colleges in Tampa FL last November Dean Arnold was very impressed by this presentation Dehne will address the faculty on Tuesday April around or pm and will have a detailed discussion with the Curriculum Review Task Force at pm the following day As per the notice I sent to you earlier there will be a Faculty Conference on May and with Dr Ronald Purser serving as the facilitator Two of the eight Huseman questions we had discussed in the midnineties are still significant for our Curricular Review The first question is AWhich students should we serve What has been our traditional student profile and what should be the future student profile The discussion with George Dehne should help us to find more up to date answers to this question The other important question we have been discussing for a while is AWhat is our unique identity and market niche In broader terms this could define our academic vision and set the goals of liberal education at Monmouth College We as a community will work on this and Ron Purser will be able to help us to arrive at some decisions Dean Arnold and I had a long discussion with Ron Purser last week He will go through a series of group exercises on May and and those who attend the conference need to make a commitment to participate for both days Ron thinks that his methodology will be most productive for a group not exceeding to members If you are planning to participate please respond to my notice sent through Leah McLaren We are also trying to bring a cognitive psychologist as a consultant on the student learning process We have contacted a Professor at the Columbia University Teachers College If you know a good person in this field do let me know Thanks Raj Ambrose Chair

during our early meetings I will not attempt to summarize them here The minutes of these meetings have been posted in one of the Public Folders To access this folder please go to Public Folders All Public Folders Documents College Curricular Review Task Force As a first step it was decided to look into the strengths and weaknesses of our academic program Professor Lee McGaan was invited to attend our meetings on October and and he reviewed with us what has been learned about our academic curriculum through the assessment program The group also discussed with Professor McGaan and Dean Condon the results of ACT Student Opinion Survey the ACT Alumni Survey and a detailed analysis of the Transcript Reflection Survey It is good to have the current chairs of the Curriculum Committee the FIDC and the Faculty Senate as members of the task force The Curriculum Committee has conveyed to the task force some of its concerns and ideas regarding our current curriculum We are now discussing the structure delivery and effectiveness of our general education program The task force invites input from all the faculty members at any point of our discussions If you have any thoughts or concerns about our academic program please share them with me or any member of our task force We will keep you informed as we proceed with this important task Raj Ambrose Chair Curriculum Review Task Force Curriculum Review Task Force Second Report to the Faculty December Since my first report last month the Curriculum Review Task Force could meet only twice because of the Thanksgiving break During our November th meeting we had extensive discussions with Dr Jeanne Narum Director of Independent Colleges Office in Washington and the highly successful Project Kaleidoscope Because of her extensive background as a grants officer a Vice President for College Relations and ICO Director we could talk to Dr Narum as a general consultant for our curricular review She indicated that we are moving in the right direction and gave some valuable suggestions The November th meeting focused primarily on the implications of the Teagle grant for our curricular initiative We are working on the type of regional consultants see below we want to bring and their time schedule The Task Force is also planning to meet with our new faculty members those who have joined us in the past few years soon We are currently discussing the strengths and weaknesses of our academic program We value your input in this matter so far we have received only one response to our request in this regard The Curricular Review Task Force has stressed from its inception the need for working closely with the faculty and the rest of the campus community We see the Teagle grant as a great opportunity for faculty development and as an important avenue for continued interaction with the whole faculty as we move forward with our curricular initiative The Teagle proposal has three major phases Organizational Phase Planning Phase and Implementation Phase We are currently in the organizational phase when the Task Force meets on a regular basis through the academic year In February and March we will bring three regional consultants for oneday visits In late May and early June the Task Force will work intensively for days when we will have a nationally recognized consultant with us for of those days After this session the Task Force chair will prepare a report to the faculty with recommendations on how to proceed This report will include a summary of the work done till then general areas of curriculumprogramming to be explored the methodology to examine promising approaches feasibility of adopting Abest practices currently implemented in peer institutions and a mechanism for assessing curricular effectiveness in terms of institutional goals The Planning Phase and Implementation Phase will provide ample opportunities for faculty input and interaction Funds are available during each phase to send member teams of faculty members and administrators to national conferences and peer institutions The peer institutions will be chosen on the basis of their being similar to Monmouth College and of their having implemented significant curricular initiatives in recent years In this connection it should be noted that the Association of American Colleges Universities will be naming Leadership Institutions this Fall from a pool of applicants which are representative of a wide range of institutional types and of a rich variety of successful curricular innovations These institutions would form a Consortium of Quality Education and host a series of Abest practice seminars comprising a Forum of st Century Liberal Arts Education We will send our member teams to some of these seminars if they are relevant to us We are also planning to get a list of these applicants who want to become Leadership Institutions Over the course of the Planning and Implementation phases Round Tables will be arranged during each phase In these Round Tables those who attended conferences and peer institutions will share with their colleagues their experiences and findings Further during Summer and Summer two carefully planned day workshops will be arranged to which nationally recognized consultants will be invited to work with the participants Stipends will be available to all the participants The Final Proposal is expected to be submitted for faculty approval in early Fall If we make good progress according to the proposed plan then stipends each will be available to faculty members during Summer to work intensively on course enhancement and design The Faculty Senate has been briefed on the implications of the Teagle grant and each Senator has been given a copy of the full proposal submitted to the Teagle Foundation The Curricular Review Task Force looks forward to working with you on this exciting and challenging project Thanks Raj Ambrose Chair
