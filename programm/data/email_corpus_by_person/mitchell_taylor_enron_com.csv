Comprehensive Energy Plan Also attached is the filing with exhibits Let me know if you need anything else Thanks Vicki Erickson applicationpdfpdf planpdfpdf appendixapdfpdf appendixbpdfpdf appendixcpdfpdf appendixdpdfpdf appendixepdfpdf Sierra Pacific Nevada Power Offer Emergency Plan to Assure Reliable Reasonably Priced Electricity for Nevadans Warning that Nevada must take rapid and dramatic action to avoid being engulfed by the financial and operational chaos of the California energy market Sierra Pacific and Nevada Power CEO Walt Higgins today outlined an emergency package of proposed longterm contracts tiered price increases low income assistance and conservation programs to stabilize the energy markets in the state In the plan filed today with the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada PUCN the companies are proposing shortterm emergency price increases ranging from zero for certain lowusage customers to as much as percent for the states largest energy users to correct serious imbalances between the cost of wholesale power and retail prices The average increase is percent The same imbalance bringing the near collapse of the California power system is sweeping the Western US and prompting nearly every other utility to take similar measures to assure reliable utility service Nevada despite a good energy policy is not immune from what is happening in California said Higgins at a news conference today in Las Vegas This situation is unprecedented unanticipated and potentially disastrous for Nevadans if we do not exercise the leadership it takes now to correct these imbalances in supply and demand and between cost and price No business can continue selling a product for less than it costs them to buy it on the wholesale market We know any rate increase is painful but there is no escaping the fact that the consequences of inaction are much more severe to the residents and businesses of this state as California clearly shows Nevadans simply cannot let the lights go out with the kind of irresponsible inaction weve witnessed over the hill Even with this increase our rates will still be lower than in California Moreover as part of the plan we propose programs to help lowincome customers and to help residents and businesses manage their total energy bills In the plan filed today the companies map out an emergency comprehensive plan to meet the states short and longterm energy needs focusing on new mechanisms to recover the skyrocketing cost of wholesale power and including automatic price reductions as wholesale prices eventually fall The plan also calls for accelerated approval of new longterm power contracts and encourages new power plant development Higgins said the plan also voices agreement with Nevadas goslow approach to electricity deregulation The Nevada legislature and commission have shown a lot of foresight in how to handle energy deregulation in the state and there is no reason to go backward said Higgins What we need is to continue forward but in a way that clearly anticipates the impact of market forces in the state Higgins noted that the pending sale of generation assets required as part of the merger of Sierra Pacific Resources and Nevada Power will allow the companies to buy power from the new plant owners at discounted prices for two years However he said the California turmoil has slowed the sales and put at risk these protective contracts Sierra Pacific and Nevada Power are proposing that the new mechanism take effect on March They propose that it be adjusted on March or sooner as wholesale prices fall and if divestiture of the utilities Nevada power plants is completed and contracts are in place that guarantee the company can purchase power from those plants for two years at prices Nevada Power customers who use kilowatt hours kWh of electricity or less per month and Sierra Pacific customers who use kWh of electricity or less per month would not see this increase in their power bills due to the tiered rate The proposal represents an overall increase in rates of approximately percent Higgins said that even with the July Global Settlement which requires Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific to file monthly rate adjustments for fuel and purchased power the FPP Rider the utilities have lost over million on fuel and purchased power transactions We are losing millions and millions of dollars now and it will get much worse if this plan is not adopted Higgins said We stand to lose hundreds of millions more because the caps on price increases are keeping rates artificially low When the settlement was negotiated no one expected prices for fuel and purchased power would continue to skyrocket to unheard of levels Higgins said Weve saved over million in operating efficiencies since the Sierra Pacific Nevada Power merger but we simply do not have the same ability to control billion annually of fuel and purchased power expenses in an energy marketplace thats gone haywire In todays filing the utilities state they will continue to make the monthly fuel and purchased power FPP filings which are scheduled to expire on March Both the FPP Rider and the new emergency Comprehensive Energy Plan CEP Rider proposed in the plan represent dollarfordollar pass through of wholesale costs If approved the CEP Rider will result in a monthly power bill increase of approximately for a typical Sierra Pacific residential customer using kilowatt hours kWh of electricity per month and approximately for a typical Nevada Power residential customer using kWh of electricity Up to million in revenue generated by the CEP Rider would be provided to the State of Nevada to be used at the states discretion to fund conservation and lowincome protection programs The proposed tiered rate offers protection for residents with low electricity usage and encourages consumers to be energy efficient Residential CEP Rider rates are based on electricity usage as follows Nevada Power First kWh per month No charge Next kWh per month per kWh Above kWh per month per kWh Sierra Pacific Power First kWh per month No charge Next kWh per month per kWh Above kWh per month per kWh applicationpdfpdf

appendixcpdfpdf appendixdpdfpdf appendixepdfpdf Sierra Pacific Nevada Power Offer Emergency Plan to Assure Reliable Reasonably Priced Electricity for Nevadans Warning that Nevada must take rapid and dramatic action to avoid being engulfed by the financial and operational chaos of the California energy market Sierra Pacific and Nevada Power CEO Walt Higgins today outlined an emergency package of proposed longterm contracts tiered price increases low income assistance and conservation programs to stabilize the energy markets in the state In the plan filed today with the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada PUCN the companies are proposing shortterm emergency price increases ranging from zero for certain lowusage customers to as much as percent for the states largest energy users to correct serious imbalances between the cost of wholesale power and retail prices The average increase is percent The same imbalance bringing the near collapse of the California power system is sweeping the Western US and prompting nearly every other utility to take similar measures to assure reliable utility service Nevada despite a good energy policy is not immune from what is happening in California said Higgins at a news conference today in Las Vegas This situation is unprecedented unanticipated and potentially disastrous for Nevadans if we do not exercise the leadership it takes now to correct these imbalances in supply and demand and between cost and price No business can continue selling a product for less than it costs them to buy it on the wholesale market We know any rate increase is painful but there is no escaping the fact that the consequences of inaction are much more severe to the residents and businesses of this state as California clearly shows Nevadans simply cannot let the lights go out with the kind of irresponsible inaction weve witnessed over the hill Even with this increase our rates will still be lower than in California Moreover as part of the plan we propose programs to help lowincome customers and to help residents and businesses manage their total energy bills In the plan filed today the companies map out an emergency comprehensive plan to meet the states short and longterm energy needs focusing on new mechanisms to recover the skyrocketing cost of wholesale power and including automatic price reductions as wholesale prices eventually fall The plan also calls for accelerated approval of new longterm power contracts and encourages new power plant development Higgins said the plan also voices agreement with Nevadas goslow approach to electricity deregulation The Nevada legislature and commission have shown a lot of foresight in how to handle energy deregulation in the state and there is no reason to go backward said Higgins What we need is to continue forward but in a way that clearly anticipates the impact of market forces in the state Higgins noted that the pending sale of generation assets required as part of the merger of Sierra Pacific Resources and Nevada Power will allow the companies to buy power from the new plant owners at discounted prices for two years However he said the California turmoil has slowed the sales and put at risk these protective contracts Sierra Pacific and Nevada Power are proposing that the new mechanism take effect on March They propose that it be adjusted on March or sooner as wholesale prices fall and if divestiture of the utilities Nevada power plants is completed and contracts are in place that guarantee the company can purchase power from those plants for two years at prices Nevada Power customers who use kilowatt hours kWh of electricity or less per month and Sierra Pacific customers who use kWh of electricity or less per month would not see this increase in their power bills due to the tiered rate The proposal represents an overall increase in rates of approximately percent Higgins said that even with the July Global Settlement which requires Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific to file monthly rate adjustments for fuel and purchased power the FPP Rider the utilities have lost over million on fuel and purchased power transactions We are losing millions and millions of dollars now and it will get much worse if this plan is not adopted Higgins said We stand to lose hundreds of millions more because the caps on price increases are keeping rates artificially low When the settlement was negotiated no one expected prices for fuel and purchased power would continue to skyrocket to unheard of levels Higgins said Weve saved over million in operating efficiencies since the Sierra Pacific Nevada Power merger but we simply do not have the same ability to control billion annually of fuel and purchased power expenses in an energy marketplace thats gone haywire In todays filing the utilities state they will continue to make the monthly fuel and purchased power FPP filings which are scheduled to expire on March Both the FPP Rider and the new emergency Comprehensive Energy Plan CEP Rider proposed in the plan represent dollarfordollar pass through of wholesale costs If approved the CEP Rider will result in a monthly power bill increase of approximately for a typical Sierra Pacific residential customer using kilowatt hours kWh of electricity per month and approximately for a typical Nevada Power residential customer using kWh of electricity Up to million in revenue generated by the CEP Rider would be provided to the State of Nevada to be used at the states discretion to fund conservation and lowincome protection programs The proposed tiered rate offers protection for residents with low electricity usage and encourages consumers to be energy efficient Residential CEP Rider rates are based on electricity usage as follows Nevada Power First kWh per month No charge Next kWh per month per kWh Above kWh per month per kWh Sierra Pacific Power First kWh per month No charge Next kWh per month per kWh Above kWh per month per kWh applicationpdfpdf
