Treasury oversee the US Antiboycott Program Each agency has different policy interests and thus while there is a lot of regulatory overlap bewteen the two agengies rules there are also places where the same incident is treated differently depending on which agency is involved VE have confirmed with the US Dept of Commerce that there would be no violation if we left the Voyage Charter prohibition on trading into Israel in the document although I believe OLNG have agreed to delete it and there is also no independent reporting obligation under Commerce Dept regs on Enron As is frequently done in regulatory practice VE provided a copy of the relevant Voyage Charter clause to Commerce Dept on behalf of an anonymous client VE previously advised that this type of prohibition is expressly allowed

Greta I just realized that the emails I sent from London over the past few days have not gone through due to system acess problems sorry for the apparent disappearing act Im still in Enrons London offices but will be back in Houston late Wednesday afternoon Im attaching a copy of the proposed Voyage Charter Party between Enron LNG Marketing LLC an indirectly wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Corp and Oman LNG LLC which is majority owned by the Omani government with additional foreign investment from Shell Total and others The reference to Charterers agreement that it will not order the vessel to call on any port in Israel is found in Part II Clause Safe Berth on page We confirmed that the language was inserted by STASCO a privatelyheld Shell marine transportation affiliate who is a contract operator of Oman LNGs vessels Apparently STASCOs concern was to restrict Charterers Enrons ability to direct the vessel to any potential risk area due to political instability or actual hostilities It is true that the cost and continued availability of vessels marine insurances are largely influenced by whether she is trading into unsafe ports and it appears that STASCO produced the list of prohibited countriesports in Clause which includes among others Israel on the basis that they as worldwide operators of Shells fleet believe such countriesports to be unsafe for marine trade The commercial representatives of Oman LNG were not aware of the language that STASCO inserted and indicated that they did not intend to create any potential antiboycott problems for Enron or any of the other bidders When we discussed the issue Oman LNG promptly agreed to the deletion of the references to Israel and will rely instead on the general language which prohibits Charterer from ordering the vesel to any unsafe port Thus it looks like we just need to determine whether under the circumstances Enron has any reporting obligation under either the Treasury Regs or Commerce Dept Regs as a result of receiving this request with the original Clause references to a prohibition on trading the vessel into Israel I hope this information helps Please let me know if you need anything further I
