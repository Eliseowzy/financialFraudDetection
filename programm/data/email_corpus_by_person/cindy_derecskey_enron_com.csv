PM To Cindy nron cc Subject DJ Enron Powerex Investigated For Alberta Price Fixing New York By Cheryl Devoe Kim Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES TORONTO Dow JonesCanadas Competition Bureau raided the offices of Enron Canada Corp in Calgary and Powerex Corp in Vancouver earlier this year as part of an investigation into suspected electricity price fixing by the two companies according to documents obtained by Dow Jones Newswires Bureau investigator David Bloom alleges in an application for a warrant he used to gain access to the offices that in the summer of Powerex and Enron were coordinating bid restatements and inflating the price each received for electricity as they traded on the Power Pool of Alberta The investigation hasnt yet produced any charges against either of the companies according to Enron The Competition Bureau declined to comment on the status of the case Both Enron Corp ENE which owns Enron Canada and Powerex a unit of provincially owned British Columbia Hydro Power Authority XBCH deny breaking any rules or laws From Powerexs point of view Albertans are looking for someone to blame for high power prices which have become a political issue in the province They just find it easy to blame us for what are pretty fundamental market design flaws Powerex president and chief executive Ken Peterson told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview Deregulation Spurs Search For Someone To Blame The search for someone to blame has repeated itself across every deregulating market Enron has participated in Enron Corp spokesman Mark Palmer said Almost every time that either power markets or natural gas markets or even oil markets or gasoline markets have experienced any kind of price volatility there have been investigations done Palmer said Enron has been scrutinized before as part of wider energy markets investigations he said but never found to be breaking the rules This is the first such investigation into Powerexs actions Peterson said The Competition Bureau based in Ottawa wont say whether the investigaion is ongoing citing disclosure rules under the Competition Act The companies themselves said theyre not sure of the investigations status Their seized files were returned several months ago but Powerex hasnt heard from the Bureau since then Enron did receive a call from the Bureau last week with a question according to Enron Corp spokesman Eric Thode The investigation began when the Power Pool of Albertas system controllers noticed the clearing price for a megawatt of electricity was topping C with unusual frequency The Pools price is set by participants submitting bids to buy or sell power for the following day Until Oct a bidder could restate the amount of power in a bid or offer an unlimited number of times until minutes before the hour of transmission The price paid for every megawatt of power needed by the Pool in a given hour is set by the most expensive unit needed to meet demand Alleged Bid Rigging Methods Detailed According to the Competition Bureau search warrant application Powerex and Enron were rigging their bids in the following manner Powerex would lower the volume of an existing offer As little as two minutes later Enron would increase its offer for the same period by the same volume but at a significantly higher price according to the warrant application Sometimes Enron would increase its offer even before Powerex had dropped its offer Power Pool market analyst Owen Craig who once worked in Enron Canadas gas trading group found that as a result of restatements involving mostly Powerex and Enron the Pool price was raised once to CMWh four times to between C and C three times to between C and C and times to between C and C Based on the restatement patterns Craig and then the Bureaus Bloom concluded that no new energy was being offered to the Pool They believed the power was just being transferred from Powerex to Enron and then offered at the higher price according to the warrant application By cutting the volume offered by Powerex the more expensive power offered by Enron would likely be needed and every participant would get the higher price Powerexs Peterson doesnt take issue with the trade history as detailed by the Bureau but denies that the companys traders were doing anything wrong or that the two companies had some sort of arrangement And were adamant about that Peterson said There was no deal with Enron There was no expectation about what their behavior would lead to in terms of a change in prices or anything like that Powerex traders were merely locking in their price cutting the companys risk which Enron agreed to take on by buying the power at a fixed price Peterson said Whenever Enrons offer of highpriced energy was declined within moments of Enron being advised by the Pool that their energy would not be required Powerex would restate an identical volume of energy back into its lower priced unit according to the warrant application Petersons response Were operating in a very tight market there and we felt an obligation to make sure the power got delivered into Alberta Enron also denies it broke any Power Pool rules or Canadian laws It boils down to we were offered power at a price lower than we thought we could sell it at Enrons Thode said And thats what Enron and every other company does thats in the business of trading The May search warrant covers the companies actions between June and Oct On Oct the Pool changed its restatement rules essentially closing the loophole though it did so without ever making public its investigation into Powerex and Enron Power Pool spokesman Wayne St Amour declined to discuss details of the investigation Market surveillance is in place to among other things protect the interests and activities of market participants he said Those convicted under Canadian law for bidrigging can be fined an amount at the courts discretion andor jailed up to five years A conviction wouldnt likely affect Powerexs ability to trade in the US Peterson said In Canada there would have to have some followon action by the Alberta parties to inhibit that And so far they still like to get our power Companies Concerned About Reputations The bigger problem Peterson said is what the case will do to the Powerex reputation Essentially both companies are concerned about it because we have a lot at stake from a reputational point of view Peterson said Both companies I believe conduct themselves in the highest possible standard But these are difficult times in the business with prices going crazy in Alberta and California and people looking for somebody to blame Theres always a possibility of collateral damage when politics gets involved Powerex parent company BC Hydro is also suspected by the Power Pool of Alberta of unfairly providing access to transmission through British Columbia linking Washington with Alberta as detailed in an Oct Power Pool market surveillance report

column in todays LA Times but he makes some good arguments JAMES FLANIGAN Simple Steps May Ease SelfInflicted Electricity Woes Los Angeles Times August Return to Headlines Publication Date Friday August Page C Los Angeles Times Home Edition Copyright The Times Mirror Company By JAMES FLANIGAN Lets be clear the fact that the state botched the job of deregulation to begin with is one reason Californias electricity market is such a mess But failure to build a single new power plant in the state even as Californias economy expanded its use of electricity is the basic cause of todays shortages and soaring prices in San Diego Orange County and other areas Still some simple steps can be taken by regulators legislators and Gov Gray Davis to provide immediate relief The states major utilities should be free to buy power wherever they can get it They should not have to buy exclusively from the Power Exchange the Pasadenabased power pool that was set up by the deregulation to achieve auctionbased prices for roughly of the states electricity Approval should be expedited for adding smaller generating plants that supply power at times of peak demand That could alleviate a tight supplydemand situation over the next year or two while larger plants are built Long term the state needs to speed up the approval process for building new electricity plants The state also should force utilities to invest in the stillregulated system of power transmission lines which now has weaknesses in the San Diego and San Francisco areas Perhaps the most glaring fact about Californias electricity problem is how few companies have stepped up to supply power to this enormous market the nations biggest Only or so suppliers including federal agencies the states own utilities municipal companies and private generating firms supply power to Californias system By contrast Pennsylvania which has an electricity market less than the size of Californias has separate suppliers of electricity today reports John Quain chairman of that states Public Utility Commission Its no coincidence that Pennsylvania has seen monthly electric bills drop on average since deregulation Its worked out terrifically Quain says What did California do wrong It allowed the states major utilitiesPacific Gas Electric Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas Electricto recover of their unrecovered or stranded costs for nuclear and hydroelectric plants and for past power purchase schemes mandated by the California legislature to encourage alternative sources of energy Then Californias legislators told the utilities to sell their conventional power plants to private generating companies all of which would sell their power to a central Power Exchange The California scheme was flawed at once overregulated and yet commercially clueless in not foreseeing trouble from a single power pool fed by only a handful of suppliers How did Pennsylvania do it It allowed the states utilities to recover no more than of their stranded costs for nuclear plantsreasoning that company shareholders should accept some of the risk of their investments And rather than set up a central power exchange the state allowed its utilities and newcomers to the states electric system to compete for business Competition after all is what deregulation is supposed to encourage And competition is not happening in California It should be noted that the summer is relatively cool in the East this year and extraordinarily hot throughout the West All the Western states are suffering electricity problems Thats another reason for Californias trouble Normally of Californias electricity comes from US and Canadian government systems and from utilities in Oregon and Washington Nevada and Arizona But this year because of lower hydroelectric supplies and higher demand from booming economies in those other states power for California is in shorter supply and more expensive when the state can get it Now there are accusations that some suppliers to California have taken advantage of their market leverage to extract premium prices for power Theres nothing illegal in angling for a better price or in using futures markets and other trading techniques as some generators may have done If any stepped over the line to illegal collusion federal and other investigations will determine the facts But who gave the generators the market leverage to exploit us The California regulators legislators and utilities did Told to sell their generating plants in the utilities sold dozens of plants in package deals of two and three to single buyers They received premium prices from buyers such as AES Corp Duke Energy Southern Co Reliant Energy Dynegy and NRG The premiums were paid for the market leverage that multiple plants afforded the buyers Nobody in the utilities reckoned that they were handing market leverage to potential commercial adversaries Nobody in the Legislature or the regulatory staffs reckoned that the central Power Exchange could be held up by market leverage As outsiders often say about Californians Maybe its the sunshine makes them slow END EDT August Copyright Times Mirror Company

ENRONONLINESTYLE TRADING PLATFORMS COULD HARM MARKET ALTRA OFFICIAL SAYS Mark Davidson Lincolnshire Ill Inside FERCs Gas Market Report Copyright McGrawHill Inc Officials from the two predominant electronic gas trading systems squared off this week after the head of gas trading for Altra Energy Technologies Inc accused proprietary systems such as EnronOnline of being potentially dangerous to the longterm health of the industry Scott Coleman Altras director of naturalgas trading systems told Interchange Energy Groups LDC Forum in Lincolnshire Ill that proprietary systems those run by market participants have the potential for shortterm price manipulation by the operators which typically set the bidask spreads and are on either the buy or sell side of every deal And because those systems dont provide anonymity the operator knows the counterpartys identity as soon as a deal is consummated they allow the operator to gain market intelligence by monitoring the trading patterns and market positions of its competitors Coleman asserted While acknowledging that he is slightly biased toward independent systems such as his companys Altrade Coleman said he fears that if one proprietary system gains too big a share of the electronic trading market I think you can draw the conclusion that they will be able to control markets short term However long term the market always corrects itself Coleman did not assail EnronOnline specifically although he did note that Enron Corps eightmonthold trading platform is by far the largest proprietary system and is growing rapidly mainly because its free of charge and simple to use with its oneclick approach to price discovery and spot dealmaking Coleman argued that independent electronic platforms such as Altrade most of which charge a transaction fee are more reliable because they essentially act as thirdparty brokers matching up anonymous traders that set the bidask spreads themselves Altrade unlike EnronOnline does not take a market position or assume title to gas traded on its system EnronOnline Director Bob Shults rebutted Colemans assertions regarding proprietary systems We provide liquidity in the marketplace I dont think its detrimental to the gas business at all he insisted I dont think Enron has the ability to move markets you dont have the market manipulation that Coleman alludes to Shults maintained that if competitors thought price manipulation was occurring they would bail out immediately Instead competitors use of EnronOnline is soaring the system now performs about billionday in transactions much of it in the gas and power sectors We put the bidask spread out there and if you like it you can use it If you dont like it you dont Shults added Asked if EnronOnline tracks its competitors trading patterns in order to gain an upper hand in the market Shults simply answered No Dennis Cornwell senior vice president of risk management and trading for Conoco Gas and Power Marketing said his company which now does about of its gas deals electronically welcomes both proprietary and independent systems and spreads out its trading activity among EnronOnline Altrade and other platforms Cornwell however acknowledged that Conoco limits the number of deals it does on any proprietary exchange in part because of the concerns Coleman expressed Meanwhile Coleman asserted that a third type of ecommerce platform consortium exchanges arent likely to succeed in the gas and power industries because of regulatory concerns about antitrust violations and because similar multifirm exchanges in other industries have failed to materialize after being announced Also Coleman cited the difficulty of several large companies agreeing on how to operate Several consortium systems have been proposed in North America including IntercontinentalExchange an Internet trading platform founded by BP Royal DutchShell Group Totalfina Elf Group and four financial investment firms and subsequently joined by six major gas and electricity marketers IFGMR Aug As for electronic trading as a whole Shults Cornwell and Coleman all agreed that while it wont entirely replace conventional methods it will become the dominant way of buying and selling gas and electricity within a few years Coleman said electronic trading ultimately results in saved time lower prices better price discovery and just plain competition for the traders attention span Its going to be tougher to get a trader on the phone This may depersonalize the business a little bit but that is the way its going to go But Coleman added that the proliferation of electronic energy commerce will create a whole new set of job opportunities The human being will be what holds all of this online trading together he said The speakers also agreed that most of the or so electronic platforms operating or in development arent likely to survive the intense competition and will either go out of business or be absorbed by another company

column in todays LA Times but he makes some good arguments JAMES FLANIGAN Simple Steps May Ease SelfInflicted Electricity Woes Los Angeles Times August Return to Headlines Publication Date Friday August Page C Los Angeles Times Home Edition Copyright The Times Mirror Company By JAMES FLANIGAN Lets be clear the fact that the state botched the job of deregulation to begin with is one reason Californias electricity market is such a mess But failure to build a single new power plant in the state even as Californias economy expanded its use of electricity is the basic cause of todays shortages and soaring prices in San Diego Orange County and other areas Still some simple steps can be taken by regulators legislators and Gov Gray Davis to provide immediate relief The states major utilities should be free to buy power wherever they can get it They should not have to buy exclusively from the Power Exchange the Pasadenabased power pool that was set up by the deregulation to achieve auctionbased prices for roughly of the states electricity Approval should be expedited for adding smaller generating plants that supply power at times of peak demand That could alleviate a tight supplydemand situation over the next year or two while larger plants are built Long term the state needs to speed up the approval process for building new electricity plants The state also should force utilities to invest in the stillregulated system of power transmission lines which now has weaknesses in the San Diego and San Francisco areas Perhaps the most glaring fact about Californias electricity problem is how few companies have stepped up to supply power to this enormous market the nations biggest Only or so suppliers including federal agencies the states own utilities municipal companies and private generating firms supply power to Californias system By contrast Pennsylvania which has an electricity market less than the size of Californias has separate suppliers of electricity today reports John Quain chairman of that states Public Utility Commission Its no coincidence that Pennsylvania has seen monthly electric bills drop on average since deregulation Its worked out terrifically Quain says What did California do wrong It allowed the states major utilitiesPacific Gas Electric Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas Electricto recover of their unrecovered or stranded costs for nuclear and hydroelectric plants and for past power purchase schemes mandated by the California legislature to encourage alternative sources of energy Then Californias legislators told the utilities to sell their conventional power plants to private generating companies all of which would sell their power to a central Power Exchange The California scheme was flawed at once overregulated and yet commercially clueless in not foreseeing trouble from a single power pool fed by only a handful of suppliers How did Pennsylvania do it It allowed the states utilities to recover no more than of their stranded costs for nuclear plantsreasoning that company shareholders should accept some of the risk of their investments And rather than set up a central power exchange the state allowed its utilities and newcomers to the states electric system to compete for business Competition after all is what deregulation is supposed to encourage And competition is not happening in California It should be noted that the summer is relatively cool in the East this year and extraordinarily hot throughout the West All the Western states are suffering electricity problems Thats another reason for Californias trouble Normally of Californias electricity comes from US and Canadian government systems and from utilities in Oregon and Washington Nevada and Arizona But this year because of lower hydroelectric supplies and higher demand from booming economies in those other states power for California is in shorter supply and more expensive when the state can get it Now there are accusations that some suppliers to California have taken advantage of their market leverage to extract premium prices for power Theres nothing illegal in angling for a better price or in using futures markets and other trading techniques as some generators may have done If any stepped over the line to illegal collusion federal and other investigations will determine the facts But who gave the generators the market leverage to exploit us The California regulators legislators and utilities did Told to sell their generating plants in the utilities sold dozens of plants in package deals of two and three to single buyers They received premium prices from buyers such as AES Corp Duke Energy Southern Co Reliant Energy Dynegy and NRG The premiums were paid for the market leverage that multiple plants afforded the buyers Nobody in the utilities reckoned that they were handing market leverage to potential commercial adversaries Nobody in the Legislature or the regulatory staffs reckoned that the central Power Exchange could be held up by market leverage As outsiders often say about Californians Maybe its the sunshine makes them slow END EDT August Copyright Times Mirror Company

ENRONONLINESTYLE TRADING PLATFORMS COULD HARM MARKET ALTRA OFFICIAL SAYS Mark Davidson Lincolnshire Ill Inside FERCs Gas Market Report Copyright McGrawHill Inc Officials from the two predominant electronic gas trading systems squared off this week after the head of gas trading for Altra Energy Technologies Inc accused proprietary systems such as EnronOnline of being potentially dangerous to the longterm health of the industry Scott Coleman Altras director of naturalgas trading systems told Interchange Energy Groups LDC Forum in Lincolnshire Ill that proprietary systems those run by market participants have the potential for shortterm price manipulation by the operators which typically set the bidask spreads and are on either the buy or sell side of every deal And because those systems dont provide anonymity the operator knows the counterpartys identity as soon as a deal is consummated they allow the operator to gain market intelligence by monitoring the trading patterns and market positions of its competitors Coleman asserted While acknowledging that he is slightly biased toward independent systems such as his companys Altrade Coleman said he fears that if one proprietary system gains too big a share of the electronic trading market I think you can draw the conclusion that they will be able to control markets short term However long term the market always corrects itself Coleman did not assail EnronOnline specifically although he did note that Enron Corps eightmonthold trading platform is by far the largest proprietary system and is growing rapidly mainly because its free of charge and simple to use with its oneclick approach to price discovery and spot dealmaking Coleman argued that independent electronic platforms such as Altrade most of which charge a transaction fee are more reliable because they essentially act as thirdparty brokers matching up anonymous traders that set the bidask spreads themselves Altrade unlike EnronOnline does not take a market position or assume title to gas traded on its system EnronOnline Director Bob Shults rebutted Colemans assertions regarding proprietary systems We provide liquidity in the marketplace I dont think its detrimental to the gas business at all he insisted I dont think Enron has the ability to move markets you dont have the market manipulation that Coleman alludes to Shults maintained that if competitors thought price manipulation was occurring they would bail out immediately Instead competitors use of EnronOnline is soaring the system now performs about billionday in transactions much of it in the gas and power sectors We put the bidask spread out there and if you like it you can use it If you dont like it you dont Shults added Asked if EnronOnline tracks its competitors trading patterns in order to gain an upper hand in the market Shults simply answered No Dennis Cornwell senior vice president of risk management and trading for Conoco Gas and Power Marketing said his company which now does about of its gas deals electronically welcomes both proprietary and independent systems and spreads out its trading activity among EnronOnline Altrade and other platforms Cornwell however acknowledged that Conoco limits the number of deals it does on any proprietary exchange in part because of the concerns Coleman expressed Meanwhile Coleman asserted that a third type of ecommerce platform consortium exchanges arent likely to succeed in the gas and power industries because of regulatory concerns about antitrust violations and because similar multifirm exchanges in other industries have failed to materialize after being announced Also Coleman cited the difficulty of several large companies agreeing on how to operate Several consortium systems have been proposed in North America including IntercontinentalExchange an Internet trading platform founded by BP Royal DutchShell Group Totalfina Elf Group and four financial investment firms and subsequently joined by six major gas and electricity marketers IFGMR Aug As for electronic trading as a whole Shults Cornwell and Coleman all agreed that while it wont entirely replace conventional methods it will become the dominant way of buying and selling gas and electricity within a few years Coleman said electronic trading ultimately results in saved time lower prices better price discovery and just plain competition for the traders attention span Its going to be tougher to get a trader on the phone This may depersonalize the business a little bit but that is the way its going to go But Coleman added that the proliferation of electronic energy commerce will create a whole new set of job opportunities The human being will be what holds all of this online trading together he said The speakers also agreed that most of the or so electronic platforms operating or in development arent likely to survive the intense competition and will either go out of business or be absorbed by another company

August Page C Los Angeles Times Home Edition Copyright The Times Mirror Company By JAMES FLANIGAN Lets be clear the fact that the state botched the job of deregulation to begin with is one reason Californias electricity market is such a mess But failure to build a single new power plant in the state even as Californias economy expanded its use of electricity is the basic cause of todays shortages and soaring prices in San Diego Orange County and other areas Still some simple steps can be taken by regulators legislators and Gov Gray Davis to provide immediate relief The states major utilities should be free to buy power wherever they can get it They should not have to buy exclusively from the Power Exchange the Pasadenabased power pool that was set up by the deregulation to achieve auctionbased prices for roughly of the states electricity Approval should be expedited for adding smaller generating plants that supply power at times of peak demand That could alleviate a tight supplydemand situation over the next year or two while larger plants are built Long term the state needs to speed up the approval process for building new electricity plants The state also should force utilities to invest in the stillregulated system of power transmission lines which now has weaknesses in the San Diego and San Francisco areas Perhaps the most glaring fact about Californias electricity problem is how few companies have stepped up to supply power to this enormous market the nations biggest Only or so suppliers including federal agencies the states own utilities municipal companies and private generating firms supply power to Californias system By contrast Pennsylvania which has an electricity market less than the size of Californias has separate suppliers of electricity today reports John Quain chairman of that states Public Utility Commission Its no coincidence that Pennsylvania has seen monthly electric bills drop on average since deregulation Its worked out terrifically Quain says What did California do wrong It allowed the states major utilitiesPacific Gas Electric Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas Electricto recover of their unrecovered or stranded costs for nuclear and hydroelectric plants and for past power purchase schemes mandated by the California legislature to encourage alternative sources of energy Then Californias legislators told the utilities to sell their conventional power plants to private generating companies all of which would sell their power to a central Power Exchange The California scheme was flawed at once overregulated and yet commercially clueless in not foreseeing trouble from a single power pool fed by only a handful of suppliers How did Pennsylvania do it It allowed the states utilities to recover no more than of their stranded costs for nuclear plantsreasoning that company shareholders should accept some of the risk of their investments And rather than set up a central power exchange the state allowed its utilities and newcomers to the states electric system to compete for business Competition after all is what deregulation is supposed to encourage And competition is not happening in California It should be noted that the summer is relatively cool in the East this year and extraordinarily hot throughout the West All the Western states are suffering electricity problems Thats another reason for Californias trouble Normally of Californias electricity comes from US and Canadian government systems and from utilities in Oregon and Washington Nevada and Arizona But this year because of lower hydroelectric supplies and higher demand from booming economies in those other states power for California is in shorter supply and more expensive when the state can get it Now there are accusations that some suppliers to California have taken advantage of their market leverage to extract premium prices for power Theres nothing illegal in angling for a better price or in using futures markets and other trading techniques as some generators may have done If any stepped over the line to illegal collusion federal and other investigations will determine the facts But who gave the generators the market leverage to exploit us The California regulators legislators and utilities did Told to sell their generating plants in the utilities sold dozens of plants in package deals of two and three to single buyers They received premium prices from buyers such as AES Corp Duke Energy Southern Co Reliant Energy Dynegy and NRG The premiums were paid for the market leverage that multiple plants afforded the buyers Nobody in the utilities reckoned that they were handing market leverage to potential commercial adversaries Nobody in the Legislature or the regulatory staffs reckoned that the central Power Exchange could be held up by market leverage As outsiders often say about Californians Maybe its the sunshine makes them slow END EDT August Copyright Times Mirror Company

DerecskeyCorpEnron on PM Kal CT AM To Mark Palmer Karen NRON Meredith NRON cc Subject EnronOnline ENRONONLINESTYLE TRADING PLATFORMS COULD HARM MARKET ALTRA OFFICIAL SAYS fyi Kal ELECTRONIC TRADING ENRONONLINESTYLE TRADING PLATFORMS COULD HARM MARKET ALTRA OFFICIAL SAYS Mark Davidson Lincolnshire Ill Inside FERCs Gas Market Report Copyright McGrawHill Inc Officials from the two predominant electronic gas trading systems squared off this week after the head of gas trading for Altra Energy Technologies Inc accused proprietary systems such as EnronOnline of being potentially dangerous to the longterm health of the industry Scott Coleman Altras director of naturalgas trading systems told Interchange Energy Groups LDC Forum in Lincolnshire Ill that proprietary systems those run by market participants have the potential for shortterm price manipulation by the operators which typically set the bidask spreads and are on either the buy or sell side of every deal And because those systems dont provide anonymity the operator knows the counterpartys identity as soon as a deal is consummated they allow the operator to gain market intelligence by monitoring the trading patterns and market positions of its competitors Coleman asserted While acknowledging that he is slightly biased toward independent systems such as his companys Altrade Coleman said he fears that if one proprietary system gains too big a share of the electronic trading market I think you can draw the conclusion that they will be able to control markets short term However long term the market always corrects itself Coleman did not assail EnronOnline specifically although he did note that Enron Corps eightmonthold trading platform is by far the largest proprietary system and is growing rapidly mainly because its free of charge and simple to use with its oneclick approach to price discovery and spot dealmaking Coleman argued that independent electronic platforms such as Altrade most of which charge a transaction fee are more reliable because they essentially act as thirdparty brokers matching up anonymous traders that set the bidask spreads themselves Altrade unlike EnronOnline does not take a market position or assume title to gas traded on its system EnronOnline Director Bob Shults rebutted Colemans assertions regarding proprietary systems We provide liquidity in the marketplace I dont think its detrimental to the gas business at all he insisted I dont think Enron has the ability to move markets you dont have the market manipulation that Coleman alludes to Shults maintained that if competitors thought price manipulation was occurring they would bail out immediately Instead competitors use of EnronOnline is soaring the system now performs about billionday in transactions much of it in the gas and power sectors We put the bidask spread out there and if you like it you can use it If you dont like it you dont Shults added Asked if EnronOnline tracks its competitors trading patterns in order to gain an upper hand in the market Shults simply answered No Dennis Cornwell senior vice president of risk management and trading for Conoco Gas and Power Marketing said his company which now does about of its gas deals electronically welcomes both proprietary and independent systems and spreads out its trading activity among EnronOnline Altrade and other platforms Cornwell however acknowledged that Conoco limits the number of deals it does on any proprietary exchange in part because of the concerns Coleman expressed Meanwhile Coleman asserted that a third type of ecommerce platform consortium exchanges arent likely to succeed in the gas and power industries because of regulatory concerns about antitrust violations and because similar multifirm exchanges in other industries have failed to materialize after being announced Also Coleman cited the difficulty of several large companies agreeing on how to operate Several consortium systems have been proposed in North America including IntercontinentalExchange an Internet trading platform founded by BP Royal DutchShell Group Totalfina Elf Group and four financial investment firms and subsequently joined by six major gas and electricity marketers IFGMR Aug As for electronic trading as a whole Shults Cornwell and Coleman all agreed that while it wont entirely replace conventional methods it will become the dominant way of buying and selling gas and electricity within a few years Coleman said electronic trading ultimately results in saved time lower prices better price discovery and just plain competition for the traders attention span Its going to be tougher to get a trader on the phone This may depersonalize the business a little bit but that is the way its going to go But Coleman added that the proliferation of electronic energy commerce will create a whole new set of job opportunities The human being will be what holds all of this online trading together he said The speakers also agreed that most of the or so electronic platforms operating or in development arent likely to survive the intense competition and will either go out of business or be absorbed by another company

ENRONONLINESTYLE TRADING PLATFORMS COULD HARM MARKET ALTRA OFFICIAL SAYS Mark Davidson Lincolnshire Ill Inside FERCs Gas Market Report Copyright McGrawHill Inc Officials from the two predominant electronic gas trading systems squared off this week after the head of gas trading for Altra Energy Technologies Inc accused proprietary systems such as EnronOnline of being potentially dangerous to the longterm health of the industry Scott Coleman Altras director of naturalgas trading systems told Interchange Energy Groups LDC Forum in Lincolnshire Ill that proprietary systems those run by market participants have the potential for shortterm price manipulation by the operators which typically set the bidask spreads and are on either the buy or sell side of every deal And because those systems dont provide anonymity the operator knows the counterpartys identity as soon as a deal is consummated they allow the operator to gain market intelligence by monitoring the trading patterns and market positions of its competitors Coleman asserted While acknowledging that he is slightly biased toward independent systems such as his companys Altrade Coleman said he fears that if one proprietary system gains too big a share of the electronic trading market I think you can draw the conclusion that they will be able to control markets short term However long term the market always corrects itself Coleman did not assail EnronOnline specifically although he did note that Enron Corps eightmonthold trading platform is by far the largest proprietary system and is growing rapidly mainly because its free of charge and simple to use with its oneclick approach to price discovery and spot dealmaking Coleman argued that independent electronic platforms such as Altrade most of which charge a transaction fee are more reliable because they essentially act as thirdparty brokers matching up anonymous traders that set the bidask spreads themselves Altrade unlike EnronOnline does not take a market position or assume title to gas traded on its system EnronOnline Director Bob Shults rebutted Colemans assertions regarding proprietary systems We provide liquidity in the marketplace I dont think its detrimental to the gas business at all he insisted I dont think Enron has the ability to move markets you dont have the market manipulation that Coleman alludes to Shults maintained that if competitors thought price manipulation was occurring they would bail out immediately Instead competitors use of EnronOnline is soaring the system now performs about billionday in transactions much of it in the gas and power sectors We put the bidask spread out there and if you like it you can use it If you dont like it you dont Shults added Asked if EnronOnline tracks its competitors trading patterns in order to gain an upper hand in the market Shults simply answered No Dennis Cornwell senior vice president of risk management and trading for Conoco Gas and Power Marketing said his company which now does about of its gas deals electronically welcomes both proprietary and independent systems and spreads out its trading activity among EnronOnline Altrade and other platforms Cornwell however acknowledged that Conoco limits the number of deals it does on any proprietary exchange in part because of the concerns Coleman expressed Meanwhile Coleman asserted that a third type of ecommerce platform consortium exchanges arent likely to succeed in the gas and power industries because of regulatory concerns about antitrust violations and because similar multifirm exchanges in other industries have failed to materialize after being announced Also Coleman cited the difficulty of several large companies agreeing on how to operate Several consortium systems have been proposed in North America including IntercontinentalExchange an Internet trading platform founded by BP Royal DutchShell Group Totalfina Elf Group and four financial investment firms and subsequently joined by six major gas and electricity marketers IFGMR Aug As for electronic trading as a whole Shults Cornwell and Coleman all agreed that while it wont entirely replace conventional methods it will become the dominant way of buying and selling gas and electricity within a few years Coleman said electronic trading ultimately results in saved time lower prices better price discovery and just plain competition for the traders attention span Its going to be tougher to get a trader on the phone This may depersonalize the business a little bit but that is the way its going to go But Coleman added that the proliferation of electronic energy commerce will create a whole new set of job opportunities The human being will be what holds all of this online trading together he said The speakers also agreed that most of the or so electronic platforms operating or in development arent likely to survive the intense competition and will either go out of business or be absorbed by another company

column in todays LA Times but he makes some good arguments JAMES FLANIGAN Simple Steps May Ease SelfInflicted Electricity Woes Los Angeles Times August Return to Headlines Publication Date Friday August Page C Los Angeles Times Home Edition Copyright The Times Mirror Company By JAMES FLANIGAN Lets be clear the fact that the state botched the job of deregulation to begin with is one reason Californias electricity market is such a mess But failure to build a single new power plant in the state even as Californias economy expanded its use of electricity is the basic cause of todays shortages and soaring prices in San Diego Orange County and other areas Still some simple steps can be taken by regulators legislators and Gov Gray Davis to provide immediate relief The states major utilities should be free to buy power wherever they can get it They should not have to buy exclusively from the Power Exchange the Pasadenabased power pool that was set up by the deregulation to achieve auctionbased prices for roughly of the states electricity Approval should be expedited for adding smaller generating plants that supply power at times of peak demand That could alleviate a tight supplydemand situation over the next year or two while larger plants are built Long term the state needs to speed up the approval process for building new electricity plants The state also should force utilities to invest in the stillregulated system of power transmission lines which now has weaknesses in the San Diego and San Francisco areas Perhaps the most glaring fact about Californias electricity problem is how few companies have stepped up to supply power to this enormous market the nations biggest Only or so suppliers including federal agencies the states own utilities municipal companies and private generating firms supply power to Californias system By contrast Pennsylvania which has an electricity market less than the size of Californias has separate suppliers of electricity today reports John Quain chairman of that states Public Utility Commission Its no coincidence that Pennsylvania has seen monthly electric bills drop on average since deregulation Its worked out terrifically Quain says What did California do wrong It allowed the states major utilitiesPacific Gas Electric Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas Electricto recover of their unrecovered or stranded costs for nuclear and hydroelectric plants and for past power purchase schemes mandated by the California legislature to encourage alternative sources of energy Then Californias legislators told the utilities to sell their conventional power plants to private generating companies all of which would sell their power to a central Power Exchange The California scheme was flawed at once overregulated and yet commercially clueless in not foreseeing trouble from a single power pool fed by only a handful of suppliers How did Pennsylvania do it It allowed the states utilities to recover no more than of their stranded costs for nuclear plantsreasoning that company shareholders should accept some of the risk of their investments And rather than set up a central power exchange the state allowed its utilities and newcomers to the states electric system to compete for business Competition after all is what deregulation is supposed to encourage And competition is not happening in California It should be noted that the summer is relatively cool in the East this year and extraordinarily hot throughout the West All the Western states are suffering electricity problems Thats another reason for Californias trouble Normally of Californias electricity comes from US and Canadian government systems and from utilities in Oregon and Washington Nevada and Arizona But this year because of lower hydroelectric supplies and higher demand from booming economies in those other states power for California is in shorter supply and more

PM To Cindy nron cc Subject DJ Enron Powerex Investigated For Alberta Price Fixing New York By Cheryl Devoe Kim Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES TORONTO Dow JonesCanadas Competition Bureau raided the offices of Enron Canada Corp in Calgary and Powerex Corp in Vancouver earlier this year as part of an investigation into suspected electricity price fixing by the two companies according to documents obtained by Dow Jones Newswires Bureau investigator David Bloom alleges in an application for a warrant he used to gain access to the offices that in the summer of Powerex and Enron were coordinating bid restatements and inflating the price each received for electricity as they traded on the Power Pool of Alberta The investigation hasnt yet produced any charges against either of the companies according to Enron The Competition Bureau declined to comment on the status of the case Both Enron Corp ENE which owns Enron Canada and Powerex a unit of provincially owned British Columbia Hydro Power Authority XBCH deny breaking any rules or laws From Powerexs point of view Albertans are looking for someone to blame for high power prices which have become a political issue in the province They just find it easy to blame us for what are pretty fundamental market design flaws Powerex president and chief executive Ken Peterson told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview Deregulation Spurs Search For Someone To Blame The search for someone to blame has repeated itself across every deregulating market Enron has participated in Enron Corp spokesman Mark Palmer said Almost every time that either power markets or natural gas markets or even oil markets or gasoline markets have experienced any kind of price volatility there have been investigations done Palmer said Enron has been scrutinized before as part of wider energy markets investigations he said but never found to be breaking the rules This is the first such investigation into Powerexs actions Peterson said The Competition Bureau based in Ottawa wont say whether the investigaion is ongoing citing disclosure rules under the Competition Act The companies themselves said theyre not sure of the investigations status Their seized files were returned several months ago but Powerex hasnt heard from the Bureau since then Enron did receive a call from the Bureau last week with a question according to Enron Corp spokesman Eric Thode The investigation began when the Power Pool of Albertas system controllers noticed the clearing price for a megawatt of electricity was topping C with unusual frequency The Pools price is set by participants submitting bids to buy or sell power for the following day Until Oct a bidder could restate the amount of power in a bid or offer an unlimited number of times until minutes before the hour of transmission The price paid for every megawatt of power needed by the Pool in a given hour is set by the most expensive unit needed to meet demand Alleged Bid Rigging Methods Detailed According to the Competition Bureau search warrant application Powerex and Enron were rigging their bids in the following manner Powerex would lower the volume of an existing offer As little as two minutes later Enron would increase its offer for the same period by the same volume but at a significantly higher price according to the warrant application Sometimes Enron would increase its offer even before Powerex had dropped its offer Power Pool market analyst Owen Craig who once worked in Enron Canadas gas trading group found that as a result of restatements involving mostly Powerex and Enron the Pool price was raised once to CMWh four times to between C and C three times to between C and C and times to between C and C Based on the restatement patterns Craig and then the Bureaus Bloom concluded that no new energy was being offered to the Pool They believed the power was just being transferred from Powerex to Enron and then offered at the higher price according to the warrant application By cutting the volume offered by Powerex the more expensive power offered by Enron would likely be needed and every participant would get the higher price Powerexs Peterson doesnt take issue with the trade history as detailed by the Bureau but denies that the companys traders were doing anything wrong or that the two companies had some sort of arrangement And were adamant about that Peterson said There was no deal with Enron There was no expectation about what their behavior would lead to in terms of a change in prices or anything like that Powerex traders were merely locking in their price cutting the companys risk which Enron agreed to take on by buying the power at a fixed price Peterson said Whenever Enrons offer of highpriced energy was declined within moments of Enron being advised by the Pool that their energy would not be required Powerex would restate an identical volume of energy back into its lower priced unit according to the warrant application Petersons response Were operating in a very tight market there and we felt an obligation to make sure the power got delivered into Alberta Enron also denies it broke any Power Pool rules or Canadian laws It boils down to we were offered power at a price lower than we thought we could sell it at Enrons Thode said And thats what Enron and every other company does thats in the business of trading The May search warrant covers the companies actions between June and Oct On Oct the Pool changed its restatement rules essentially closing the loophole though it did so without ever making public its investigation into Powerex and Enron Power Pool spokesman Wayne St Amour declined to discuss details of the investigation Market surveillance is in place to among other things protect the interests and activities of market participants he said Those convicted under Canadian law for bidrigging can be fined an amount at the courts discretion andor jailed up to five years A conviction wouldnt likely affect Powerexs ability to trade in the US Peterson said In Canada there would have to have some followon action by the Alberta parties to inhibit that And so far they still like to get our power Companies Concerned About Reputations The bigger problem Peterson said is what the case will do to the Powerex reputation Essentially both companies are concerned about it because we have a lot at stake from a reputational point of view Peterson said Both companies I believe conduct themselves in the highest possible standard But these are difficult times in the business with prices going crazy in Alberta and California and people looking for somebody to blame Theres always a possibility of collateral damage when politics gets involved Powerex parent company BC Hydro is also suspected by the Power Pool of Alberta of unfairly providing access to transmission through British Columbia linking Washington with Alberta as detailed in an Oct Power Pool market surveillance report

nron cc Lora NRON Subject Washington Post articles Per the request of Linda Robertson attached please find the following Midterm Jitters in the House By David S Broder Wednesday May Page A President Bush may not be a scholar but he is an avid student of politics For understandable reasons he has given especially close scrutiny to the lessons of his fathers presidency and what went wrong to deny him a second term in The results can be seen in the current chief executives adamant support of the large tax cut on which he campaigned he knows that his dads retreat from his no new taxes pledge cost him vital conservative support The younger Bush is also the opposite of the elder in emphasizing education Bush I did little or nothing to change the schools Bush II put them at the top of his agenda just as the voters persistently do But the most costly error in political terms that Bush I made was refusing to consider any shortterm fixes for the economic slump that began in the third year of his presidency When the jobless rate began to edge up Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady counseled Bush against any stimulus measures saying that market forces would be enough by themselves to keep the recession short Bradys advice brought no comfort to the Republican politicians on Capitol Hill who were picking up bad vibes from their constituents Vice President Dan Quayle who was on the GOP fundraising circuit in expressed his frustration that Brady was blocking even modest shortterm measures History has recorded that Brady was right The recession was short and recovery as measured by the statisticians actually began before the election But that did not spare the incumbent president from charges of indifference to persisting unemployment and Bill Clinton was elected on a promise to pep up the economy The current Bush has accepted congressional changes in his tax plan that will apply shortterm stimulus to a sluggish economy But on the energy problems that began on the West Coast and have swept across the country Bush II is as scornful of shortterm fixes as his father was a decade ago This week the administration is releasing its energy plan crafted by a task force under Vice President Dick Cheney in an atmosphere of growing crisis Even before summer has arrived California is experiencing rolling blackouts Oregon and Washington have sacrificed the salmon runs to save river water for hydroelectric power Midwest gasoline prices have surged past a gallon And natural gas prices are skyhigh everywhere When I spent a weekend at Rocky Mountain College in Montana earlier this month I was astonished to learn that even in that energyexporting state the first phase of deregulation has sent prices soaring and made energy the hottest issue In the face of all this Cheney and Bush have refused to consider temporary price caps on electric power or any other shortterm fix that violates freemarket principles The complex of production incentives and conservation measures that make up the energy strategy is designed to bring supply and demand into balance over the next several years not to provide immediate relief That may be sound economics but it leaves congressional Republicans as nervous as their counterparts were years ago Rep Tom Davis the able Virginian who heads the National Republican Congressional Committee told me last week that he is hearing more worries from his colleagues about energy prices than about the overall economy We can stand one bad summer Davis said but if were facing the same thing next summer weve got problems Davis said he had communicated his partys concerns to the White House Do they get the message I asked No he said They think in fouryear terms we think in two That comment reflects a reality that few politicians are as candid as Davis in acknowledging Much as the members of one partys congressional wing may hope for a president of their own party who will sign the bills they pass and help them raise money for their own campaigns owning the White House creates dilemmas The basic political strategy is always set by the presidents people and naturally enough they think about creating favorable conditions for the year in which he will run for reelection They can be more patient and more oblivious to shortterm problems than those who are focused on the battle for the House and Senate Republicans like Tom Davis remember that eight years ago when the Democrats controlled both the White House and Congress it was Clintons policy decisions on taxes trade guns and health care that left his party so vulnerable that Democrats lost both the House and Senate in Thats the risk Republicans are facing now And thats why theyre nervous The Washington Post Company More Than Californias Problem By Gray Davis Wednesday May Page A SACRAMENTO As President Bush this week rolls out his new energy policy I once again urge him to confront the energy elephant in the middle of the room the outofcontrol wholesale prices of electricity in California and across the West In California ventured headlong into a flawed scheme to deregulate electricity Although Californians were promised lower rates and plentiful supply both predictions have turned out to be disastrously wrong We have now seen our first statewide rolling blackouts since World War II Unheardof wholesale prices for power have bankrupted our largest utility threaten to bankrupt the second largest and have begun to seriously affect our economy If we dont get the situation under control it could quickly threaten our national economy California bears some fault for the current situation In addition to the botched deregulation plan centermost was our failure for the years before I took office to build any major power plants But my administration has moved quickly to remedy that by streamlining the permitting process for generating facilities In the past two years my energy commission has licensed new major power plants nine are under construction and four will be on line this summer or fall Nearly a dozen more are in the pipeline In addition weve approved six new peaker plants to meet this summers demand Were moving at unprecedented speed to deal with the supply problem The state however has absolutely no jurisdiction over the wholesale prices being charged by the unregulated mostly outofstate generators that purchased the utilities power plants as part of deregulation Since the Federal Power Act was passed in price regulation has been the exclusive domain of the federal government But the Bush administration and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission have consistently refused to carry out their statutory obligation to ensure energy prices are just and reasonable To the contrary the freemarket ideologues in the administration argue that uncontrolled market prices are needed in order to increase the supply of electricity In other words if we dont allow power generators to shoot the moon on prices they wont have sufficient incentive to build additional supply Thats as ridiculous as saying we need to pay dairies a gallon to motivate them to produce milk In fact I have joined my fellow governors in Oregon and Washington in proposing temporary costbased pricing that would still allow generators and marketers a healthy profit but without bankrupting the system Last week however Vice President Dick Cheney told the Los Angeles Times that he would remain philosophically opposed to any federal intervention on wholesale power prices even if it threatened the national economy With all due respect to the vice president that is one of the most irresponsible statements Ive ever heard Here is the eyepopping result of the federal governments rigid stance In the spring of a megawatt of electricity in California cost an average of By last December after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission precipitously removed the hard price cap of per megawatt hour that been in effect the spotmarket price shot up to for the same megawatt of power Just last week we paid an astounding permegawatt record of to Houstonbased Reliant Energy for the last megawatts of power we needed to keep the lights on The macro result of this unconscionable price gouging is predictable and scary In California power users paid approximately billion for all electricity consumed Last year that figure shot up to billion This year estimates are that total spending on electrical power may hit billion to billion The California Independent System Operator the states electric grid manager has estimated in a report to the federal energy commission that electricity overcharges during the past year have totaled more than billion Even the federal commission itself has formally ruled that the electricity market in California is dysfunctional and that prices charged have been unjust and unreasonable Where is that money going Simply put into the pockets of the generators and marketers almost all of them in the South and many of them located in Texas It is one of the most massive transfers of wealth from the consumers of one state to companies located in another region of the country in our nations history But other than ordering a pittance in limited refunds none of which has yet been returned to the state the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has stood fast in its opposition to real price caps The day before President Bush was sworn in he stated on national television that the energy problem here was Californias to solve Well we are moving aggressively to do our part to get it under control on both the generation and conservation fronts But without just and reasonable prices for wholesale power the crisis inevitably will spill over and damage the alreadysluggish national economy That Mr President not only will be your problem it will affect every one of us Californians are demanding action We are doing our part leading the nation in building power plants and in aggressive conservation The federal government must do its part to temporarily control runaway energy prices in the West until we can bring on line the major new power plants

nron cc Lora NRON Subject Washington Post articles Per the request of Linda Robertson attached please find the following Midterm Jitters in the House By David S Broder Wednesday May Page A President Bush may not be a scholar but he is an avid student of politics For understandable reasons he has given especially close scrutiny to the lessons of his fathers presidency and what went wrong to deny him a second term in The results can be seen in the current chief executives adamant support of the large tax cut on which he campaigned he knows that his dads retreat from his no new taxes pledge cost him vital conservative support The younger Bush is also the opposite of the elder in emphasizing education Bush I did little or nothing to change the schools Bush II put them at the top of his agenda just as the voters persistently do But the most costly error in political terms that Bush I made was refusing to consider any shortterm fixes for the economic slump that began in the third year of his presidency When the jobless rate began to edge up Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady counseled Bush against any stimulus measures saying that market forces would be enough by themselves to keep the recession short Bradys advice brought no comfort to the Republican politicians on Capitol Hill who were picking up bad vibes from their constituents Vice President Dan Quayle who was on the GOP fundraising circuit in expressed his frustration that Brady was blocking even modest shortterm measures History has recorded that Brady was right The recession was short and recovery as measured by the statisticians actually began before the election But that did not spare the incumbent president from charges of indifference to persisting unemployment and Bill Clinton was elected on a promise to pep up the economy The current Bush has accepted congressional changes in his tax plan that will apply shortterm stimulus to a sluggish economy But on the energy problems that began on the West Coast and have swept across the country Bush II is as scornful of shortterm fixes as his father was a decade ago This week the administration is releasing its energy plan crafted by a task force under Vice President Dick Cheney in an atmosphere of growing crisis Even before summer has arrived California is experiencing rolling blackouts Oregon and Washington have sacrificed the salmon runs to save river water for hydroelectric power Midwest gasoline prices have surged past a gallon And natural gas prices are skyhigh everywhere When I spent a weekend at Rocky Mountain College in Montana earlier this month I was astonished to learn that even in that energyexporting state the first phase of deregulation has sent prices soaring and made energy the hottest issue In the face of all this Cheney and Bush have refused to consider temporary price caps on electric power or any other shortterm fix that violates freemarket principles The complex of production incentives and conservation measures that make up the energy strategy is designed to bring supply and demand into balance over the next several years not to provide immediate relief That may be sound economics but it leaves congressional Republicans as nervous as their counterparts were years ago Rep Tom Davis the able Virginian who heads the National Republican Congressional Committee told me last week that he is hearing more worries from his colleagues about energy prices than about the overall economy We can stand one bad summer Davis said but if were facing the same thing next summer weve got problems Davis said he had communicated his partys concerns to the White House Do they get the message I asked No he said They think in fouryear terms we think in two That comment reflects a reality that few politicians are as candid as Davis in acknowledging Much as the members of one partys congressional wing may hope for a president of their own party who will sign the bills they pass and help them raise money for their own campaigns owning the White House creates dilemmas The basic political strategy is always set by the presidents people and naturally enough they think about creating favorable conditions for the year in which he will run for reelection They can be more patient and more oblivious to shortterm problems than those who are focused on the battle for the House and Senate Republicans like Tom Davis remember that eight years ago when the Democrats controlled both the White House and Congress it was Clintons policy decisions on taxes trade guns and health care that left his party so vulnerable that Democrats lost both the House and Senate in Thats the risk Republicans are facing now And thats why theyre nervous The Washington Post Company More Than Californias Problem By Gray Davis Wednesday May Page A SACRAMENTO As President Bush this week rolls out his new energy policy I once again urge him to confront the energy elephant in the middle of the room the outofcontrol wholesale prices of electricity in California and across the West In California ventured headlong into a flawed scheme to deregulate electricity Although Californians were promised lower rates and plentiful supply both predictions have turned out to be disastrously wrong We have now seen our first statewide rolling blackouts since World War II Unheardof wholesale prices for power have bankrupted our largest utility threaten to bankrupt the second largest and have begun to seriously affect our economy If we dont get the situation under control it could quickly threaten our national economy California bears some fault for the current situation In addition to the botched deregulation plan centermost was our failure for the years before I took office to build any major power plants But my administration has moved quickly to remedy that by streamlining the permitting process for generating facilities In the past two years my energy commission has licensed new major power plants nine are under construction and four will be on line this summer or fall Nearly a dozen more are in the pipeline In addition weve approved six new peaker plants to meet this summers demand Were moving at unprecedented speed to deal with the supply problem The state however has absolutely no jurisdiction over the wholesale prices being charged by the unregulated mostly outofstate generators that purchased the utilities power plants as part of deregulation Since the Federal Power Act was passed in price regulation has been the exclusive domain of the federal government But the Bush administration and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission have consistently refused to carry out their statutory obligation to ensure energy prices are just and reasonable To the contrary the freemarket ideologues in the administration argue that uncontrolled market prices are needed in order to increase the supply of electricity In other words if we dont allow power generators to shoot the moon on prices they wont have sufficient incentive to build additional supply Thats as ridiculous as saying we need to pay dairies a gallon to motivate them to produce milk In fact I have joined my fellow governors in Oregon and Washington in proposing temporary costbased pricing that would still allow generators and marketers a healthy profit but without bankrupting the system Last week however Vice President Dick Cheney told the Los Angeles Times that he would remain philosophically opposed to any federal intervention on wholesale power prices even if it threatened the national economy With all due respect to the vice president that is one of the most irresponsible statements Ive ever heard Here is the eyepopping result of the federal governments rigid stance In the spring of a megawatt of electricity in California cost an average of By last December after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission precipitously removed the hard price cap of per megawatt hour that been in effect the spotmarket price shot up to for the same megawatt of power Just last week we paid an astounding permegawatt record of to Houstonbased Reliant Energy for the last megawatts of power we needed to keep the lights on The macro result of this unconscionable price gouging is predictable and scary In California power users paid approximately billion for all electricity consumed Last year that figure shot up to billion This year estimates are that total spending on electrical power may hit billion to billion The California Independent System Operator the states electric grid manager has estimated in a report to the federal energy commission that electricity overcharges during the past year have totaled more than billion Even the federal commission itself has formally ruled that the electricity market in California is dysfunctional and that prices charged have been unjust and unreasonable Where is that money going Simply put into the pockets of the generators and marketers almost all of them in the South and many of them located in Texas It is one of the most massive transfers of wealth from the consumers of one state to companies located in another region of the country in our nations history But other than ordering a pittance in limited refunds none of which has yet been returned to the state the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has stood fast in its opposition to real price caps The day before President Bush was sworn in he stated on national television that the energy problem here was Californias to solve Well we are moving aggressively to do our part to get it under control on both the generation and conservation fronts But without just and reasonable prices for wholesale power the crisis inevitably will spill over and damage the alreadysluggish national economy That Mr President not only will be your problem it will affect every one of us Californians are demanding action We are doing our part leading the nation in building power plants and in aggressive conservation The federal government must do its part to temporarily control runaway energy prices in the West until we can bring on line the major new power plants California has approved The writer a Democrat is governor of California The Washington Post Company

Enron Canada Corp in Calgary and Powerex Corp in Vancouver earlier this year as part of an investigation into suspected electricity price fixing by the two companies according to documents obtained by Dow Jones Newswires Bureau investigator David Bloom alleges in an application for a warrant he used to gain access to the offices that in the summer of Powerex and Enron were coordinating bid restatements and inflating the price each received for electricity as they traded on the Power Pool of Alberta The investigation hasnt yet produced any charges against either of the companies according to Enron The Competition Bureau declined to comment on the status of the case Both Enron Corp ENE which owns Enron Canada and Powerex a unit of provincially owned British Columbia Hydro Power Authority XBCH deny breaking any rules or laws From Powerexs point of view Albertans are looking for someone to blame for high power prices which have become a political issue in the province They just find it easy to blame us for what are pretty fundamental market design flaws Powerex president and chief executive Ken Peterson told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview Deregulation Spurs Search For Someone To Blame The search for someone to blame has repeated itself across every deregulating market Enron has participated in Enron Corp spokesman Mark Palmer said Almost every time that either power markets or natural gas markets or even oil markets or gasoline markets have experienced any kind of price volatility there have been investigations done Palmer said Enron has been scrutinized before as part of wider energy markets investigations he said but never found to be breaking the rules This is the first such investigation into Powerexs actions Peterson said The Competition Bureau based in Ottawa wont say whether the investigaion is ongoing citing disclosure rules under the Competition Act The companies themselves said theyre not sure of the investigations status Their seized files were returned several months ago but Powerex hasnt heard from the Bureau since then Enron did receive a call from the Bureau last week with a question according to Enron Corp spokesman Eric Thode The investigation began when the Power Pool of Albertas system controllers noticed the clearing price for a megawatt of electricity was topping C with unusual frequency The Pools price is set by participants submitting bids to buy or sell power for the following day Until Oct a bidder could restate the amount of power in a bid or offer an unlimited number of times until minutes before the hour of transmission The price paid for every megawatt of power needed by the Pool in a given hour is set by the most expensive unit needed to meet demand Alleged Bid Rigging Methods Detailed According to the Competition Bureau search warrant application Powerex and Enron were rigging their bids in the following manner Powerex would lower the volume of an existing offer As little as two minutes later Enron would increase its offer for the same period by the same volume but at a significantly higher price according to the warrant application Sometimes Enron would increase its offer even before Powerex had dropped its offer Power Pool market analyst Owen Craig who once worked in Enron Canadas gas trading group found that as a result of restatements involving mostly Powerex and Enron the Pool price was raised once to CMWh four times to between C and C three times to between C and C and times to between C and C Based on the restatement patterns Craig and then the Bureaus Bloom concluded that no new energy was being offered to the Pool They believed the power was just being transferred from Powerex to Enron and then offered at the higher price according to the warrant application By cutting the volume offered by Powerex the more expensive power offered by Enron would likely be needed and every participant would get the higher price Powerexs Peterson doesnt take issue with the trade history as detailed by the Bureau but denies that the companys traders were doing anything wrong or that the two companies had some sort of arrangement And were adamant about that Peterson said There was no deal with Enron There was no expectation about what their behavior would lead to in terms of a change in prices or anything like that Powerex traders were merely locking in their price cutting the companys risk which Enron agreed to take on by buying the power at a fixed price Peterson said Whenever Enrons offer of highpriced energy was declined within moments of Enron being advised by the Pool that their energy would not be required Powerex would restate an identical volume of energy back into its lower priced unit according to the warrant application Petersons response Were operating in a very tight market there and we felt an obligation to make sure the power got delivered into Alberta Enron also denies it broke any Power Pool rules or Canadian laws It boils down to we were offered power at a price lower than we thought we could sell it at Enrons Thode said And thats what Enron and every other company does thats in the business of trading The May search warrant covers the companies actions between June and Oct On Oct the Pool changed its restatement rules essentially closing the loophole though it did so without ever making public its investigation into Powerex and Enron Power Pool spokesman Wayne St Amour declined to discuss details of the investigation Market surveillance is in place to among other things protect the interests and activities of market participants he said Those convicted under Canadian law for bidrigging can be fined an amount at the courts discretion andor jailed up to five years A conviction wouldnt likely affect Powerexs ability to trade in the US Peterson said In Canada there would have to have some followon action by the Alberta parties to inhibit that And so far they still like to get our power Companies Concerned About Reputations The bigger problem Peterson said is what the case will do to the Powerex reputation Essentially both companies are concerned about it because we have a lot at stake from a reputational point of view Peterson said Both companies I believe conduct themselves in the highest possible standard But these are difficult times in the business with prices going crazy in Alberta and California and people looking for somebody to blame Theres always a possibility of collateral damage when politics gets involved Powerex parent company BC Hydro is also

PM To Cindy nron cc Subject DJ Enron Powerex Investigated For Alberta Price Fixing New York By Cheryl Devoe Kim Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES TORONTO Dow JonesCanadas Competition Bureau raided the offices of Enron Canada Corp in Calgary and Powerex Corp in Vancouver earlier this year as part of an investigation into suspected electricity price fixing by the two companies according to documents obtained by Dow Jones Newswires Bureau investigator David Bloom alleges in an application for a warrant he used to gain access to the offices that in the summer of Powerex and Enron were coordinating bid restatements and inflating the price each received for electricity as they traded on the Power Pool of Alberta The investigation hasnt yet produced any charges against either of the companies according to Enron The Competition Bureau declined to comment on the status of the case Both Enron Corp ENE which owns Enron Canada and Powerex a unit of provincially owned British Columbia Hydro Power Authority XBCH deny breaking any rules or laws From Powerexs point of view Albertans are looking for someone to blame for high power prices which have become a political issue in the province They just find it easy to blame us for what are pretty fundamental market design flaws Powerex president and chief executive Ken Peterson told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview Deregulation Spurs Search For Someone To Blame The search for someone to blame has repeated itself across every deregulating market Enron has participated in Enron Corp spokesman Mark Palmer said Almost every time that either power markets or natural gas markets or even oil markets or gasoline markets have experienced any kind of price volatility there have been investigations done Palmer said Enron has been scrutinized before as part of wider energy markets investigations he said but never found to be breaking the rules This is the first such investigation into Powerexs actions Peterson said The Competition Bureau based in Ottawa wont say whether the investigaion is ongoing citing disclosure rules under the Competition Act The companies themselves said theyre not sure of the investigations status Their seized files were returned several months ago but Powerex hasnt heard from the Bureau since then Enron did receive a call from the Bureau last week with a question according to Enron Corp spokesman Eric Thode The investigation began when the Power Pool of Albertas system controllers noticed the clearing price for a megawatt of electricity was topping C with unusual frequency The Pools price is set by participants submitting bids to buy or sell power for the following day Until Oct a bidder could restate the amount of power in a bid or offer an unlimited number of times until minutes before the hour of transmission The price paid for every megawatt of power needed by the Pool in a given hour is set by the most expensive unit needed to meet demand Alleged Bid Rigging Methods Detailed According to the Competition Bureau search warrant application Powerex and Enron were rigging their bids in the following manner Powerex would lower the volume of an existing offer As little as two minutes later Enron would increase its offer for the same period by the same volume but at a significantly higher price according to the warrant application Sometimes Enron would increase its offer even before Powerex had dropped its offer Power Pool market analyst Owen Craig who once worked in Enron Canadas gas trading group found that as a result of restatements involving mostly Powerex and Enron the Pool price was raised once to CMWh four times to between C and C three times to between C and C and times to between C and C Based on the restatement patterns Craig and then the Bureaus Bloom concluded that no new energy was being offered to the Pool They believed the power was just being transferred from Powerex to Enron and then offered at the higher price according to the warrant application By cutting the volume offered by Powerex the more expensive power offered by Enron would likely be needed and every participant would get the higher price Powerexs Peterson doesnt take issue with the trade history as detailed by the Bureau but denies that the companys traders were doing anything wrong or that the two companies had some sort of arrangement And were adamant about that Peterson said There was no deal with Enron There was no expectation about what their behavior would lead to in terms of a change in prices or anything like that Powerex traders were merely locking in their price cutting the companys risk which Enron agreed to take on by buying the power at a fixed price Peterson said Whenever Enrons offer of highpriced energy was declined within moments of Enron being advised by the Pool that their energy would not be required Powerex would restate an identical volume of energy back into its lower priced unit according to the warrant application Petersons response Were operating in a very tight market there and we felt an obligation to make sure the power got delivered into Alberta Enron also denies it broke any Power Pool rules or Canadian laws It boils down to we were offered power at a price lower than we thought we could sell it at Enrons Thode said And thats what Enron and every other company does thats in the business of trading The May search warrant covers the companies actions between June and Oct On Oct the Pool changed its restatement rules essentially closing the loophole though it did so without ever making
