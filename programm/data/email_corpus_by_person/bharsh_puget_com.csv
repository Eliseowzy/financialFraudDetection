what I think you describe here sounds like NERCs functional model or what came out of the CACTF work In that model they said that checkout was only between GCAs and LCAs intermediate CAs balancing authorities would not need to know of the wheel throughs However the TP functions from source to sink would need to see the tag to manage their respective transmission assets I hope that what is described here is not NERCs functional model My control area too is not prepared to change checkout and accounting procedures suggested in the CACTFs work Perhaps embedded in the registry tables there are pointers tofrom TPs tofrom CAs and this is why intermediate CAs are optional in OATIs tag agent However as you point out there is not a onetoone correspondence of TP to CA or viceversa within the WSCC I hope that there are experts out there that can answer this item and tell us every thing is going to be all right Items seem to touch on a current debate going on in the NERC IS and TISWG email forums on extensions of tags From those discussions one thing seems to be clear once a tag reaches its stop hour and that transaction ends it is considered finished or in speak Dead It can not be restarted or extended However when where how much an extension be for is still be debated Hope the answers come soon seems a bit late in the game to have so much uncertainty out there Robert Harshbarger Puget Sound Energy OASIS Trading Manager desk cell mailto From RAYMOND VOJDANISMTP Sent Monday January PM To Interchange Scheduling Accounting Subcommittee ISAS Subject Re ETag Test Procedure Hi Steve As we approach the impending implementation of ETag we have begun reviewing and studying the new features of the Tag Services interface as explained at the NERC Workshops and as developed by our vendor OATI The implementation of the ETag Specifications has raised some questions On the section of the tag where the PSE creates the Physical Path for the transaction there are required fields for the Generating Control Area the Load Control Area and the intermediate Transmission Providers There is not a requirement to document the intermediate Control Areas there is a location to include them as Scheduling Entities but those fields are optional This would seem to be a significant obstacle to providing all Control Areas the information they need to perform hourly schedule checks with their neighboring Control Areas Also in WSCC where certain Control Areas are responsible for managing constrained paths this would be an obstacle in determining scheduled flows across the constrained paths It is possible even likely to create tags where the Control Area would not see the tag because the transmission used is owned by Transmission Providers other than the Control Area Was it the intent of the NERC ETag Specification to remove intermediate Control Areas from visibility and approval of the tags Once an ETag has been approved and has achieved the Implement state it appears to have immortality Even when the final hour of the current version of the tag has passed the tag does not appear to be inactive it is available for the creating PSE to access and extend by an Adjust request This feature could potentially bog our system down with numerous tags that are presently inactive but always available for adjusting Did the NERC specifications intend for an Implemented tag to eventually become inactive and unavailable for adjustment A related concern to tag Adjustment Requests under ETag a PSE may now create a tag and accomplish ongoing scheduling through the Extension of the tag by adjusting oh boy account number scheduling has returned At the NERC ETag Training Workshop the Timing Requirement for Profile Changes WSCC is minutes to evaluate any early notice This could be a significant business change the PSE can accomplish preschedule functions by requesting tag extensions minutes evaluation time rather than creating new tags hour evaluation time The clear distinction between Next Day schedules and Real Time schedules is being lost Perhaps the evaluation time of an any Profile Change Request could be linked directly to the impact time of that change request similar to the timing requirements for submission and evaluation of New Tag Requests Considering the above shortcomings especially item it is impossible for us to move toward implementation of ETag for we will not be able to check out the net interchange with our neighboring control areas or be able to manage the constrained paths in our control area Please give me a call should you have any question or if you want to discuss this further Thanks Raymond Raymond R Vojdani PE Transmission Scheduling and Security Manager Rocky Mountain Region Western Area

been already addressed What was said at the Jan th meeting of the ESWG was I Bob Harshbarger was not prepared to address the issues surrounding voting membership etc at that meeting ESWG will have to adopt some form of structure if we are to proceed as quickly as the ESC The ESWG was formed at the direction of the Joint Guidance Committee We have been asked to consider formalized or structure membership based on the same guidelines that ISAS has been given The intent is not to leave anyone out but to ensure we can address issues in a timely manner There is no perfect solution A weighted sector voting structure does appear to give broader voice to the masses yet even within a single sector the participants can opposing view points and still feel under represented What the ESWG adopts is to be seen Robert Harshbarger Puget Sound Energy OASIS Trading Manager desk cell mailto cc ESWG From Grinberg RaySMTPRay acifiCorpcom Sent Thursday January AM To Interchange Scheduling Accounting Subcommittee ISAS Subject RE ISAS Meeting Agenda Steve I share Bob Winns concerns regarding the administration and governance of the ISAS committee Ive attended numerous meetings of the ISAS on behalf of Pinnacle West and now PacifiCorp Power Marketing I never knew there was a formal requirement for membership If anything I thought that only Transmission providers were the actual voting members I believe this was how it was explained by mark hackney during one of last years meetings As a marketer and now a generation owner too this was never and issue for me However your membership list which I dont know where it came from belies my understanding What exactly are the requirements to be a voting member of ISAS If I am going to be excluded from active participation I request that PacifiCorp Power Marketing PPMI be added as a member of the ISAS and I as its representative PPMI is a separate legal entity from PacifiCorp the utility I dont want to get bogged down in the governance issues that dominated the ESC meeting in Las Vegas but I agree with Bob that there needs to be some known rules about membership and participation But something along the ESCs membership requirements and voting structure may be appropriate Especially if the OC is concerned about the effectiveness of the ISAS committee I understand the OCs desire for the ISAS to be more effective but it shouldnt come at the cost of denying participation to interested and affected parties I request that we add this issue to the February Meeting Agenda I realize this could take up quite a bit of time but I think its worth an hours discussion I think you should be aware that at the meeting of the EWG at the Las Vegas Airport on Jan the group decided to operate without a formal membership requirement and to allow all parties to participate and vote Thanks for listening Ray Grinberg PacifCorp Power Marketing Inc NE Holladay Suite Portland OR Original Message From mailto Sent Wednesday January PM To Cc Ray acifiCorpcom Subject RE ISAS Meeting Agenda Bob I appreciate your input The OC Steering Committee has asked us to become more effective We need to do our best to satisfy their request Our goal is to ensure we get the best product in the most efficient manner we can ISAS has always had voting members These members have determined the outcome of issues that the group is responsible for I believe the current voting structure of ISAS is typical of the Operations Committee and the Subcommittees reporting to the OC An OC member has the ability to appoint one representative from hisher company In at least one case in the WSCC an individual company has two OC members One member represents the transmissionreliability side and one member represents the merchant side Diverse opinions often lead to the best decisions The intent of focusing on the voting members is to make the most of the limited time we have to make decisions Nonvoting members will still have the ability to take the floor to voice their views However the discussion will be limited so that we can complete our business I suggest that we see how the February meeting goes We can discuss proposed changes to the format prior to the next meeting However these changes must still comply with WSCC guidelines and OC direction The Joint Guidance Committee is currently revising the Guidelines For Administering the Membership of WSCC Subcommittees Work Groups And Task Forces The proposed revision is attached Thanks Original Message From Winn Robert mailto Sent Wednesday January PM To ISAS Correspondents Subject RE ISAS Meeting Agenda Steve We have some concerns regarding the format you suggest for the upcoming ISAS meeting which consists of the agenda and discussion being driven primarily by the voting member As you know in PNMs case and others we have only one WSCC membership Our Merchant and Reliability functions are still under the same company as required by current laws and regulations We do however operate as totally independent shops thus having different tasks issues insights and etc Neither shop is able to sufficiently represent the issues of the other We are concerned that by limiting discussions to only the voting member much insight will be lost We would be interested in hearing from both sides of a company on issues I would suggest this committee consider structuring discussion and voting privileges along the lines of those being set up in other industry forums ESC GISB NAERO NAESB and etc where a company represented in WSCC would have votingdiscussion privileges for representatives from each business sector In WSCC that should include at least a Reliability andor a Merchant repif applicable even if the company holds only one WSCC membership I do understand and support the need to control the size of this meeting and would not want to see decisions made strictly from votes by those in attendance We feel it very important to have fair representation in the subcommittee of all concerned entities I have been trying to find someone at WSCC who is involved with revision of the document titled Guidelines For Administering the Membership of WSCC Subcommittees Work Groups And Task Forces which you indicated was being revised I have not been able to find out who this person is and am unable to find anything about it on the WSCC web sitecould you provide a name As you know this document has not been modified since We would like to make sure the revisions reflect the needs of all the industry as we know it today We have some thoughts and concerns which we would like

<7833509.1075840029025.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,bharsh@puget.com,2001-10-08 13:53:15,RE WSCC Tagging practices Cc clarify my earlier email and answer your questions The transmissionless transactions that we developed business practice around are CA to CA interchanges Historically participants at the MIDC would track purchases and sales of energy between each other as scheduled interchange between their control areas The participants all have owned andor contracted transmission tofrom their systems When tagging came along authoring PSEs for these MIDC deals just wanted to do a tag with one source control area and once sink control area with no transmission segments There could be a dozen marketers thus a dozen title transfers in the chain but the tag would not indicate transmission just interchange between source and sink CAs limited to CA participants at the MIDC At some point or ETag required a tag to contain at least one transmission segment The WSCC approached the IS to allow for no transmission segments in a tag We were told no So the business practice of picking the source or the sink CAs TP to provide a MIDCMIDC transmission segment was adopted Hope answers your question Bob Harshbarger From Rodriquez AndySMTP Sent Monday October AM To Harshbarger Robert Subject RE WSCC Tagging practices Robert With regard to item solution C was to communicate that WSCC could explore any number of other options and propose them to either its members or to the IS For example TOs could be granted allocations of rights sold through a single virtual Tariff Administrator I guess the real goal was to pull the IS out of the decision making process and give the control to the WSCC and if the WSCC said we are going to do option a or b then that would be fine provided that a CONCRETE practice was defined so that everybody in the WSCC did it the same Item will be a problem in ETag because of how it deals with the relationship between TPs and CAs In a CA can exist independent of a TP hence the simple fix of adding a single dummy TP Under a CA cannot exist without a parent TP I think this will cause problems Theoretically it is the same answer as is used in but I think it may be much more confusing to many I would propose a formal practice registered in Policy or some other document that indicates how this is done for example create a virtual TP called WSCC Title Transfer and have WSCC entities use that specific TP or something like that This would go a long way to reducing confusion about how each CA does business I have been told it varies form company to company and even sometimes from shift to shift In your example you indicate that fake transmission is being used You also indicate that there is no CA to CA interchange occurring What is indicated by going from the PSEI control area to the PCW control area If this is a title transfer then it has been tagged incorrectly The only other interpretation I can make is that the energy is moving from the PSEI control area to the PCW control area You previous discussion seems to support this also I am not sure how dynamic schedules or grandfather transmission relate as those are required to be tagged also as they should be using transmission service I know the WSCC has been violating that practice and recently sought an exemption form the IS but at this point the exemption has been denied I would appreciate an explanation as I am unsure I yet understand what is happening Is it a title transfer or is it interchange Andy Rodriquez Regulatory Affairs Enron Corp Original Message From Harshbarger Robert mailto Sent Monday October AM To Rodriquez Andy Subject RE WSCC Tagging practices Comments were inserted in your letter contained in the body of your original email Ive copied and pasted that

a willing TP on the second line with the same PSE as on the first line and the words Single Bus in the OASIS reservation field and F as the Product Guess we need to understand what it is about that prevents someone from creating a tag for these types of transactions A related issue to this is there CAs that are not registered as TPs So when Seattle City Light sells to Chelan PUD at the MIDC who

Energy OASIS Trading Manager desk cell From Rodriquez AndySMTP Sent Friday October AM To Subject WSCC Tagging practices Please review this letter and make sure it is correct These issues were brought up in our Phoenix tag training I will plan on sending to the IS Monday morning Members of the IS In our recent ETag Training sessions we had two common issues brought up regarding the way tags are handled in the WSCC We would like your guidance and assistance in regard to these issues Jointly owned transmission In the west several jointly owned transmission facilities exist In these situations one particular line or path is managed by operated within a single control area but has several different Transmission Owners In the East I believe that we address this situation by having one entity administer a single OATT and the TOs receive transmission revenues as distributions from the administrator of the OATT much the way that SPP or MAPP distribute regional tariff revenues to their members In the west they have taken a somewhat different approach In this case each TO administers their own tariff So it is possible that a transaction could utilize more than one TP on the same transmission segment In such a situation and common practice for a tag to be written that could stacks TPs So we might see in a tag a three transmission providers all flowing on the same path within the same Control Area CA TP OASIS PATH AAA AAA POINTAPOINTB AAA BBB POINTAPOINTB AAA CCC POINTAPOINTB Is this representation of the transactions physical segment valid We perceive several potential have two solutions a Tag as above for convenience b Tag as a separate tag for each TP c Indicate to WSCC that process is invalid and let them determine their own solution note there are only two possibilities here Solution c suggests a PSE can not buy transmission from multiple providers for the same path Some concerns have been raised by some WSCC members that solution a is might be difficult during curtailment processing as it is hard to determine which cuts should be made at what points However other entities point out that the tag does represent energy flow along a single contract path and the stacking really only identifies contractual relationships and as such should be allowed Regardless of how the issue is resolved we encourage the development of a standard method for handling this situation and believe that standard should be developed by either the WSCC or the IS Control Area Bus Transfers note Im not sure we can include this second issue because of the size and scope of the issues surrounding it has required a minimum of one transmission segment in the tag and the WSCC worked around this requirement by using fake PTP transmission segments The same should probably work for In the west there is the practice of moving energy to different Control Area entities at a bus In the east I we accommodate this through title transfers and consider it a market mechanism rather than an operations mechanism For example Merchant MMMMMM Generates MW in Control Area AAAA Marketer NNNNNN buys at the bus and sells to OOOOOO Marketer OOOOOO buys at the bus and sells to PPPPPP Marketer PPPPPP buys at the bus and wheels from AAAA to BBBB In the WSCC such transactions are tagged in a different manner note MIDC is not tagged like this everyone is a PSE except for the CA generating and the CA sinking or wheeling away from the MIDC There is not any CA to CA to CA to CA interchanges as long as the energy doesnt leave the bus More typical are direct transactions specifying fake transmission especially realtime CA TP PSE OASIS PATH INFO PSEI PSEMKT IDC PCW PCW PAC NOR MIDC L The WSCC practice is not currently supported by ETag The structure of ETag is predicated on the fact that energy cannot move between Control Areas without use of transmission Historically participants at the generator bus have found it more efficient to track these energy exchanges at the bus as scheduled interchange between their respective control areas In addition they typically have owned transmission andor longterm grandfather transmission rights to move energy tofrom the jointly owned bus to their systems via dynamic schedules This issue has recently been discussed by the IS with regard to such situations where transactions use NO transmission ie energy moves between CAs across bus with no transmission service If I remember correctly the IS discussed several different issues How can a single bus be simultaneously metered in several different Control Areas If no physical movement of power occurs why are these transactions tagged If the power DOES move even across a bus then shouldnt that movement be accomplished under a tariff As I remember the IS resolution it was decided that such transactions should indicate the use of PTP transmission if indeed power is moving between Control Areas Otherwise the market turn approach used in the East illustrated in the first example should be utilized This specifically becomes an issue as ETag would allow the current WSCC practice and will not We would encourage the IS to make sure WSCC is fully prepared for this situation and has WSCC practices in place that address this issue Andy Rodriquez Regulatory Affairs Enron Corp This email is the property of Enron Corp andor its relevant

getting deeper as I go Two issues putting multiple transmission providers on the same path on a tag stacking of parallel providers and transmissionless interchange business practice Number dont we in the WSCC want the ability to have tags that can contain multiple transmission providers on the same path For example PSEI PGE and BPAT are all TPs offering JohndayCOB service There could be a transaction that would utilize a reservation with each provider and it would be most convenient to stack all that information in one tag Andy suggests the WSCC might want to comeup with an alternative such as one administrator TP for the whole path Sounds like an RTO So if we have a choice we prefer the ability to stack providers on a tag yes Number the transmissionless interchange I have been suggesting that we will continue on with our practice just using the TP that belongs to source or sink as stated in BP Andy doesnt think thatll fly in What really concerns me is his statement that Under a CA cannot exist without a parent TP Funny I always looked at it the other way around I dont know what that means to SCL CHPD and other CAs who up till now have not registered as TPs My example was a MIDC CA to CA transaction that has historically been at the bus without transmission The participants have traditionally used their interchange accounting systems to record these deals as scheduled interchange with another CA Transmission was not taken into consideration since the participants had owned andor contract rights from MIDC to their systems In addition it has been an easy way to pathitout by sinking it then creating separate transaction source at the same place I did feel that this issue shouldnt be brought to ISs attention that we would just work it out with our

if it has been already addressed What was said at the Jan th meeting of the ESWG was I Bob Harshbarger was not prepared to address the issues surrounding voting membership etc at that meeting ESWG will have to adopt some form of structure if we are to proceed as quickly as the ESC The ESWG was formed at the direction of the Joint Guidance Committee We have been asked to consider formalized or structure membership based on the same guidelines that ISAS has been given The intent is not to leave anyone out but to ensure we can address issues in a timely manner There is no perfect solution A weighted sector voting structure does appear to give broader voice to the masses yet even within a single sector the participants can opposing view points and still feel under represented What the ESWG adopts is to be seen Robert Harshbarger Puget Sound Energy OASIS Trading Manager desk cell mailto cc ESWG From Grinberg RaySMTPRay acifiCorpcom Sent Thursday January AM To Interchange Scheduling Accounting Subcommittee ISAS Subject RE ISAS Meeting Agenda Steve I share Bob Winns concerns regarding the administration and governance of the ISAS committee Ive attended numerous meetings of the ISAS on behalf of Pinnacle West and now PacifiCorp Power Marketing I never knew there was a formal requirement for membership If anything I thought that only Transmission providers were the actual voting members I believe this was how it was explained by mark hackney during one of last years meetings As a marketer and now a generation owner too this was never and issue for me However your membership list which I dont know where it came from belies my understanding What exactly are the requirements to be a voting member of ISAS If I am going to be excluded from active participation I request that PacifiCorp Power Marketing PPMI be added as a member of the ISAS and I as its representative PPMI is a separate legal entity from PacifiCorp the utility I dont want to get bogged down in the governance issues that dominated the ESC meeting in Las Vegas but I agree with Bob that there needs to be some known rules about membership and participation But something along the ESCs membership requirements and voting structure may be appropriate Especially if the OC is concerned about the effectiveness of the ISAS committee I understand the OCs desire for the ISAS to be more effective but it shouldnt come at the cost of denying participation to interested and affected parties I request that we add this issue to the February Meeting Agenda I realize this could take up quite a bit of time but I think its worth an hours discussion I think you should be aware that at the meeting of the EWG at the Las Vegas Airport on Jan the group decided to operate without a formal membership requirement and to allow all parties to participate and vote Thanks for listening Ray Grinberg PacifCorp Power Marketing Inc NE Holladay Suite Portland OR Original Message From mailto Sent Wednesday January PM To Cc Ray acifiCorpcom Subject RE ISAS Meeting Agenda Bob I appreciate your input The OC Steering Committee has asked us to become more effective We need to do our best to satisfy their request Our goal is to ensure we get the best product in the most efficient manner we can ISAS has always had voting members These members have determined the outcome of issues that the group is responsible for I believe the current voting structure of ISAS is typical of the Operations Committee and the Subcommittees reporting to the OC An OC member has the ability to appoint one representative from hisher company In at least one case in the WSCC an individual company has two OC members One member represents the transmissionreliability side and one member represents the merchant side Diverse opinions often lead to the best decisions The intent of focusing on the voting members is to make the most of the limited time we have to make decisions Nonvoting members will still have the ability to take the floor to voice their views However the discussion will be limited so that we can complete our business I suggest that we see how the February meeting goes We can discuss proposed changes to the format prior to the next meeting However these changes must still comply with WSCC guidelines and OC direction The Joint Guidance Committee is currently revising the Guidelines For Administering the Membership of WSCC Subcommittees Work Groups And Task Forces The proposed revision is attached Thanks Original Message From Winn Robert mailto Sent Wednesday January PM To ISAS Correspondents Subject RE ISAS Meeting Agenda Steve We have some concerns regarding the format you suggest for the upcoming ISAS meeting which consists of the agenda and discussion being driven primarily by the voting member As you know in PNMs case and others we have only one WSCC membership Our Merchant and Reliability functions are still under the same company as required by current laws and regulations We do however operate as totally independent shops thus having different tasks issues insights and etc Neither shop is able to sufficiently represent the issues of the other We are concerned that by limiting discussions to only the voting member much insight will be lost We would be interested in hearing from both sides of a company on issues I would suggest this committee consider structuring discussion and voting privileges along the lines of those being set up in other industry forums ESC GISB NAERO NAESB and etc where a company represented in WSCC would have votingdiscussion privileges for representatives from each business sector In WSCC that should include at least a Reliability andor a Merchant repif applicable even if the company holds only one WSCC membership I do understand and support the need to control the size of this meeting and would not want to see decisions made strictly from votes by those in attendance We feel it very important to have fair representation in the subcommittee of all concerned entities I have been trying to find someone at WSCC who is involved with revision of the document titled Guidelines For Administering the Membership of WSCC Subcommittees Work Groups And Task Forces which you indicated was being revised I have not been able to find out who this person is and am unable to find anything about it on

<18115730.1075863313386.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,bharsh@puget.com,2001-07-03 16:19:19,Ad Hoc Timeline Review Team Cc Bill NonPrivilegedpst Mark The ad hoc teams product is attached It is a suggested revision to the NERC AA time table for the WSCC Some basic points are Elimination of manually setting the WSCC preschedule flag The table provides rules for the etag software to automatically set the flag The majority of our efforts were focussed on creating an incentive mechanism to encourage timely tag submission and assessment The team agreed that the best incentive mechanism would be a financial one ie tags submitted close to the deadline would pay a high submittal fee tags submitted early in the hour would pay little or no submittal fee approval entities would receive compensation for assessingapproving late tags etc But a financial mechanism would have to go through a cumbersome reviewapproval process which would be too inflexible for the fast paced world of ETag and NERCs electronic scheduling So the suggested incentive process increases the risk of a tag not being approved the closer the submittal time is to the start time To do this we considered three parameters the assessment window deferred denial and the default composite status The assessment window is a period time that the ETag Authority Service gives the Approval Services to assess a submitted tag Each Approval Service is to check the tag for various things and respond with a approved or denied vote back to Authority service who then set the final composite status Deferred denial is when a entity denies a tag the composite status does not immediately become Denied but instead waits until the end of the assessment window to set the composite status This allows the denying approval entity time to reconsider their vote and change it if appropriate The default composite status is a final stated reached at the end of the assessment window when one or more approval entities fails to actively approve or deny a tag Currently tags submitted before a certain deadline will have their final composite status default to Approved Tags submitted after a certain deadline will have their final composite status default to Denied For realtime tagging we cite the hourahead business where Purchasingselling entities trade products for delivery in the next hour Tags submitted in the first half of the hourahead referred to to past will have a minute assessment window are subjected to deferred denial and will default to ApprovedConditional Tags submitted from to past will have a minute assessment window are not subjected to deferred denial can be called instant denial and but will still default to ApprovedConditional Tags submitted in the after past will have a minute assessment window are not subjected to deferred denial can be called instant denial and will default to Denied thus assigned a composite status of Late The table references specific times in the submittal and assessment process which should all reference a consistent time zone standard The team was divided on the best approach Some suggested all times on the table be the prevailing time for the LCA This would require each CA to include in the etag registry their time zone Some suggested all times on the table be in Pacific Prevailing Time And some suggested that all times on the table be in Pacific Standard Time The conclusion is that a white paper would be produced prior to the July ISAS meeting discussing the pros and cons of each suggestion The group does not recommend basing submittal time on the tag agents time clock submittal time should stay with the authority service Heres a big one because the timing table allows for later submittal times the tag assessment process is encroaching on the start of the WSCC standard ramp ie currently starts at minutes before the hour We are recommending that ISAS request the OC to study the feasibility of moving the WSCC standard ramp from a twenty minute duration straddling the hour to minute duration straddling the hour ie starts at and ends at Such a change would align the WSCC with the Eastern Interconnection and relieve some of the issues surrounding late tag submittals There was some discussion on establishing a new regional practice for the tariff deadline for schedule changes most are set to before the start It was felt that there is little chance at getting all entities to change their tariffs in a coordinated and timely manner The team did not want to address at this time issues concerning multiple preschedule days and how they are not recognized in Policy or the ETag specifications Finally the team can not stress enough that a composite status of Late should not and does not mean automatic denial The Late
