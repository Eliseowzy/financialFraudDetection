Pacific NW Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc WASHINGTON Dow Jones The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shouldnt order refunds for power sales in the Pacific Northwest a FERC administrative law judge told the commission Monday I recommend that the commission not order refunds in this case because the prices werent unreasonable and unlike California the market is a competitive market concluded Carmen Cintron the FERC judge presiding over the case The spiraling prices in Californias dysfunctional power market were only one of many factors contributing to the regions high electricity prices which were primarily the result of a supply shortage as the hydropowerdependent region experienced a drought the judge said Spot market bilateral sales constituted only a small percentage of the total volume of transactions in the region because forward contracts are heavily relied on Cintron said Overruling the finding of FERC trial staff Cintron found there was no evidence that sellers exercised market power in the region The prices were agreed to by willing buyers and sellers the judge said The judge urged FERC to grant a motion by Puget Energy Inc PSD and dismiss the case At issue were refund claims totaling more than billion with threequarters of that amount claimed by California on behalf of the states Department of Water Resources for purchases in the refund period of Dec to June In July FERC set the case for an expedited hearing before Cintron after separating the Pacific Northwest claims from a larger refund proceeding involving power sales in California from Oct through June The administrative law judge is scheduled to forward an initial decision to the commission in the California refund case in December Unlike California the Northwest had a vibrant and functional competitive market and ordering refunds for the minority of those in the proceeding making claims would have detrimental effects on the market Cintron told the commission Evidence of record indicates that refunds would have a negative impact to the Pacific Northwest market Cintron concluded This business relies on finality of deals and reliance on your trading partner Balancing the shortterm benefit of refunds to a few market participants against the immediate and longterm damage to the market and to future investment decisions it is impossible to reconcile refunds with the overall publicinterest standard Cintron said California sought billion of the nearly billion in total claims The remainder was claimed by municipally owned utilities in Seattle million Tacoma Wash million Clark Wash million Eugene Ore million Sacramento Calif million and Northern Wasco County Ore million Also the Port of Seattle sought million in refunds Cintron was persuaded by the ripple claims arguments of the majority opposing refunds They argued that awarding the claims of the few seeking refunds would destabilize the overall market since most sellers themselves would then stake claims for refunds Unraveling these transactions is to be mildly stated a complex task Cintron said The immense number of potential ripple claims is directly related to the highly active nature of the Pacific Northwest wholesale electricity market the judge said Given the sheer magnitude of contracts that would have to be rewritten as a result of ordering refunds it would be impossible to unwind the chain of transactions that resulted in a single bilateral sale she said The commission may either accept or reject Cintrons recommendations which were intended to form the basis for whether FERC should order a more expansive hearing to determine refund amounts owed In the event FERC does move to order refunds Cintron offered her conclusions on what constitutes a spotmarket sale in the regions bilateral contracts market While power marketers had argued for a strict definition sales of no more than hours duration those seeking refunds had argued that refunds should apply to sales for periods of up to a year or longer particularly if they were indexed to spotmarket prices Cintron accepted the middleofthe road recommendation of the Bonneville Power Administration to conclude that spotmarket sales should include transactions of up to onemonth duration By Bryan Lee Dow Jones Newswires

Wednesday September PM To Kean Steven J Shapiro Richard Steffes James D Sanders Richard B Denne Karen Palmer Mark A PR Mara Susan Kaufman Paul Belden Tim Subject Dunn and Davis Searching for a New Scapegoat Probing the palace coup Electricity A panel focuses on price hikes and the actions of the ISO president September By KIMBERLY KINDY The Orange County Register SACRAMENTOA state Senate committee is set today to start serving subpoenas on electricity producers and officials who manage Californias energy grid to determine whether they acted in concert to manipulate energy prices The investigative committee headed by state Sen Joe Dunn DSanta Ana is focusing on a series of events last fall filled with enough Shakespearean plot twists and intrigue that it has earned a name around the Capitol the palace coup Lawmakers and consumer groups allege that the events directed by the man who heads the states energy grid fueled the California energy crisis pushed the state into the powerbuying business and helped make billions of dollars for power producers The central question behind the palace coup is whether Terry Winter the president of the Independent System Operator acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge Winter defied his own board and Gov Gray Davis when he filed a page request to remove the caps records and interviews show I dont know how these events could have taken place without some concerted effort said Dunn The subpoenas will force those involved including Winter to provide sworn testimony about the events to the committee and to turn over emails personal calendars and memos Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor felt betrayed by the actions of Winter The governor believes it was the defining moment when what was a mounting problem turned into an instant crisis Maviglio said Winter refused comment referring all questions to the public relations office ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said Dunns committee will find no criminal conduct The decision was made by ISO upper management with one goal in mind to keep the lights on At the time generators were refusing to sell power in California because of the price caps It was an emergency Fishman said We had to take action What became known as the palace coup began on Oct when ISO board members voted for severe restrictions on the amount of money electricity producers could charge for power The restrictions would drive prices as low as per megawatt nearly times below the per megawatt limits of seven months earlier They electricity generators grinned and beared the price cap but this new plan by ISO was too much said Dunn whose committee has been investigating since March All hell broke loose Records show that on Oct power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission demanding that the new plan be killed The letters six in all were sent within two hours of each other and represented dozens of power generators If not removed immediately the ISO price cap will sow confusion in the market threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity read one letter written by Duke Energy Vice President William Hall III Although there is nothing illegal about the generators acting together to lobby against price caps Dunn believes the letters and other actions around the same time showed clear coordination among energy officials He said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to fix prices which would violate federal trade laws In the Oct letters electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps werent removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market The generators got their way The next day the federal commission killed the new pricing plan What was left in place was a price cap established five months earlier Power producers then turned their attention toward killing that cap saying they couldnt make a profit even under these constraints They began to withhold power from California and on Dec the ISO declared its first Stage emergency and braced for blackouts which were narrowly averted What followed the next day is considered by the governor and Dunn to be the pivotal moment of the energy crisis Winter who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the ISO submitted a page emergency request asking federal officials to abolish the price cap Final authority over lifting the cap rested with the federal government Neither the ISO board which had established the price cap nor the governor learned of Winters actions until the cap had been removed In fact the attorney who helped draft the emergency request Charles Robinson was in a meeting with representatives of the governor and ISO board members just hours before the filing was made He didnt mention anything about it In retrospect we should have told them Robinson said With the price caps gone the generators filed paperwork with federal regulators justifying higher costs The ISO staff sat in a meeting with the governors key energy advisers with poker faces not saying a word about something that was going on at the exact same moment Maviglio said It was beyond belief that they failed to mention something so significant This action accelerated the utilities move toward bankruptcy and forced the governor to move the state into the powerbuying business Prices for electricity jumped from an average of a megawatt to a megawatt within three days ISO records show Dunn believes the resulting overcharges for electricity exceeded billion Robinson said the filing granted two hours after the request helped rather than hurt Californians Prices he said did not spike as a result Instead they followed the skyrocketing price of natural gas which is used to run power plants to generate electricity Robinson said the emergency order allowed the ISO to secure refunds should overcharges for electricity be proven to federal officials We believe the action we took addressed a severe concern Robinson said In our view we did not believe we changed or made worse the financial situation We felt we made it better because it introduced a process for review and refund Jan SmutneyJones who was the ISO board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represents power generators said Winter did not consult him about eliminating the price cap SmutneyJones also said he was unaware of anyone in the powergenerating community being consulted Terry did this by himself said SmutneyJones executive director of the Independent Energy Producers He did what he thought had to be done at the time to keep the power flowing The ISO board called an emergency meeting the next week demanding Winter explain his actions Some board members pushed to have Winter removed but there were concerns such action would lead to more chaos the governors spokesman Maviglio said James J Hoecker the former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman defended making the December decision and also defended Winter They filed an emergency motion and we were not about to let California go dark Hoecker said They ISO management did what any independent system operator would do What Dunns committee hopes to learn is why all these events transpired He believes memos and emails around the time of Winters Dec actions should provide vital clues We dont know why he did what he did but we are eager to find out Dunn said Terry said he made that filing in the interest of Californians but I find that argument has no basis in fact

Senate committee investigating price gouging in Californias wholesale electricity market subpoenaed Enrons documents in April seeking records of electricity sales bidding strategies prices and outofstate transactions The company refused to make the documents available without a court order protecting the confidentiality of the records Enron sued July and on Thursday Sacramento County Superior Court Judge Charles C Kobayashi granted the companys request for a protective order The judge noted in his order that Enron is a business competitor of the California Department of Water Resources which began buying electricity on behalf of the states two largest utilities last January Although the committee argues that the Senate is not in competition with plaintiff wrote Kobayashi the functions of the Senate and the Department of Water Resources are intertwined in so many ways that there is no doubt that not only may there be appearances of conflict actual conflicts can arise Kobayashis order is a reversal of an earlier tentative ruling in which he concluded that imposing a protective order for Enron would be an unacceptable intrusion by the courts into the internal operations of the Legislature Karen Denne a spokeswoman for the Houstonbased company described executives as very pleased with the court ruling Turning over the documents was never the issue she said The issue was always protecting our rights Enron officials will work with committee Chairman Sen Joe Dunn DSanta Ana to craft an agreement that details which documents will be reviewed by the eight lawmakers and their aides Denne said Reliant Energy of Houston another company that resisted demands for business records on Wednesday signed a confidentiality agreement with Dunns committee and will

ENE must comply with a legislative subpoena of financial documents but reversed an earlier decision and granted the company a protective order of the documents according to a copy of the ruling seen by Dow Jones Newswires Enron said the ruling was a victory as the company has always maintained it would be happy to comply with the subpoena by the state Senate committee as long as the company received a protective order We are obviously very happy with the ruling and look forward to working with the committee to come up with a protective order that truly protects our proprietary information said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer The Senate Select Committee To Investigate Market Manipulation has already cited Enron and Reliant Energy Inc REI with contempt for refusing to provide documents a charge for which the companies could be fined Once Enron and the committee draft a protective order and the judge agrees to it the company will hand over any documents that the committee wants Palmer said However an attorney for the committee expressed skepticism that the company would actually follow through We have no indication from Enron that they would agree to produce the documents weve requested even with the confidentiality order said Larry Drivon special counsel to the committee He added that he could not speculate if the committee would drop its contempt charge if Enron did produce all requested documents In his decision granting the protective order Judge Charles Kobayashi wrote that he was not convinced the committee has solid standards in place to ensure Enrons protection It is clear that there are no standards for determining what are the available protections no procedure for determining what is a legitimately confidential privileged proprietary matter no procedure for oversight and no prescribed remedy for Enron for any unauthorized disclosures Kobayashi wrote Last week a San Francisco Superior Court judge granted Enron a protective order in a separate investigation by the state attorney general By Jessica Berthold Dow Jones Newswires Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved USA Enron must give documents to Calif lawmakersjudge Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited SAN FRANCISCO Sept Reuters Enron Corp must turn over sensitive financial documents to a state Senate committee probing charges of price gouging during the states energy crisis a California judge ruled on Thursday But Sacramento Superior Court Judge Charles Kobayashi also ruled lawmakers must provide Enron with a confidentiality agreement saying he was not convinced the committee would respect the firms right to maintain proprietary secrets If the committee could take the requested action in the name of the public interest then the committee ostensibly could require newspapers to surrender their confidentiality rights attorneys to surrender their attorneyclient privilege and psychiatrists to surrender their privileges the judge wrote The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation has subpoenaed documents from a number of energy firms to probe accusations California power agencies and utilities were overcharged some billion for wholesale electricity during the states energy crisis which saw power prices in the state soar tenfold Independent energy merchants have blamed the price spike on the states poorly designed electricity deregulation law and a failure to build enough power plants to meet the growing needs of its million residents and its industries An Enron spokeswoman said on Thursday the firm has already turned over tens of thousands of documents but wanted assurances that certain sensitive documents containing proprietary trade secrets for example would be protected under a confidentiality agreement The firm will now work with the committee to hammer out the specifics of such an agreement said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne We are pleased with the judges order in that he agreed that our constitutional right would be protected Denne said The issue has always been protecting the confidential documents The committee has already asked the full Senate to cite Enron as well as Reliant Energy Inc for contempt for failing to comply with a subpoena seeking confidential documents It would be the first such citation imposed by the state Senate since but has not yet come up for a vote Atlantabased Mirant Corp however avoided the contempt threat by agreeing with legislators demands to sign confidentiality agreements open a document depository close to Sacramento and begin placing documents there relating to the companys recent business in California Sacramento judge says committee must protect Enron documents By JENNIFER COLEMAN Associated Press Writer Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved SACRAMENTO AP Enron Corp must turn over sensitive financial documents to a state Senate committee investigating possible price manipulation of wholesale energy prices a judge ruled Thursday but the state must give the energy company a confidentiality agreement Sacramento Superior Court Judge Charles Kobayashi said in his ruling that he wasnt convinced that the Senate committee will be able to maintain the petitioners right to confidentiality The Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation in the Wholesale Energy Market subpoenaed documents from six energy companies as they investigated last years price spikes in the wholesale electricity market If the committee went forward without a confidentiality agreement Kobayashi said it could then require the same of newspapers attorneys or psychiatrists Enrons motion to quash the subpoenas were dismissed last week and the judge reaffirmed that ruling Thursday Another Enron motion seeking an injunction against the committee will be heard Wednesday Company spokeswoman Karen Denne called the protective order ruling a victory This gives us the confidentiality agreement weve been seeking The orders specifics will be worked out with Sen Joe Dunn DSanta Ana the committee chairman It will then be signed by a judge once both sides agree Enron officials have offered to turn over documents that were already in California but refused to comply with the rest of the subpoena The committee found Enron in contempt for not turning over all the requested documents A full report on the contempt finding has been sent to the full Senate which has not voted on it A contempt report on Reliant Energy has also been sent to the Senate A contempt finding against Mirant Corp was later reversed when the company opened a document depository in Sacramento for the committees investigators If the full Senate imposes sanctions against Reliant or Enron it will be the first time since when the Senate voted to jail reluctant witnesses during a committee investigation of price fixing and price gouging involving cement sales to the state Enron Wins

Order Articles California Metro Desk The State Enron Records to Stay Secret Court A judge orders confidentiality for the power firms documents A Senate panel probing electricity price gouging has subpoenaed them NANCY VOGEL TIMES STAFF WRITER Los Angeles Times Home Edition B Copyright The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO Enron Corp the giant Texasbased seller of electric power won a court ruling Thursday in its quest to guarantee the secrecy of hundreds of thousands of internal business documents sought by state lawmakers A Senate committee investigating price gouging in Californias wholesale electricity market subpoenaed Enrons documents in April seeking records of electricity sales bidding strategies prices and outofstate transactions The company refused to make the documents available without a court order protecting the confidentiality of the records Enron sued July and on Thursday Sacramento County Superior Court Judge Charles C Kobayashi granted the companys request for a protective order The judge noted in his order that Enron is a business competitor of the California Department of Water Resources which began buying electricity on behalf of the states two largest utilities last January Although the committee argues that the Senate is not in competition with plaintiff wrote Kobayashi the functions of the Senate and the Department of Water Resources are intertwined in so many ways that there is no doubt that not only may there be appearances of conflict actual conflicts can arise Kobayashis order is a reversal of an earlier tentative ruling in which he concluded that imposing a protective order for Enron would be an unacceptable intrusion by the courts into the internal operations of the Legislature Karen Denne a spokeswoman for the Houstonbased company described executives as very pleased with the court ruling Turning over the documents was never the issue she said The issue was always protecting our rights Enron officials will work with committee Chairman Sen Joe Dunn DSanta Ana to craft an agreement that details which documents will be reviewed by the eight lawmakers and their aides Denne said Reliant Energy of Houston another company that resisted demands for business records on Wednesday signed a confidentiality agreement with Dunns committee and will begin bringing documents to a depository in Sacramento said Reliant spokesman Marty Wilson Dunn said other companies have begun to deliver documents to Sacramento but not all are fully complying with subpoenas There are some major holes that have to be plugged by the market participants he said On July the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market voted to recommend that Enron be cited for contempt for not turning over its documents The full Senate has yet to vote on that recommendation The committee which the Senate created in March has focused its investigation on the private companies that purchased power plants after California moved to deregulate its electricity market in Copyright A Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved Sept Briefs City State California judge says no to Enron subpoena SACRAMENTO Calif Enron Corp received a protective order Thursday for documents subpoenaed by a California state Senate committee Sacramento Superior Court Judge Charles Kobayashi ruled that Houstonbased Enron can prevent the legislative panel from sharing information in the thousands of documents relating to energy trading in California Once the confidential information is disclosed no amount of sanctions will be able to rectify the damage that might be caused Kobayashi wrote in his order The Senate committee requested documents including emails phone logs financial records and records of any Enron trading strategies The panel is probing whether generators manipulated the power market Enron Wins Document Protection Order From Calif Judge By Jessica Berthold Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow Jones A Sacramento Superior Court judge Thursday ruled that Enron Corp ENE must comply with a legislative subpoena of financial documents but reversed an earlier decision and granted the company a protective order of the documents according to a copy of the ruling seen by Dow Jones Newswires Enron said the ruling was a victory as the company has always maintained it would be happy to comply with the subpoena by the state Senate committee as long as the company received a protective order We are obviously very happy with the ruling and look forward to working with the committee to come up with a protective order that truly protects our proprietary information said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer The Senate Select Committee To Investigate Market Manipulation has already cited Enron and Reliant Energy Inc REI with contempt for refusing to provide documents a charge for which the companies could be fined Once Enron and the committee draft a protective order and the judge agrees to it the company will hand over any documents that the committee wants Palmer said However an attorney for the committee expressed skepticism that the company would actually follow through We have no indication from Enron that they would agree to produce the documents weve requested even with the confidentiality order said Larry Drivon special counsel to the committee He added that he could not speculate if the committee would drop its contempt charge if Enron did produce all requested documents In his decision granting the protective order Judge Charles Kobayashi wrote that he was not convinced the committee has solid standards in place to ensure Enrons protection It is clear that there are no standards for determining what are the available protections no procedure for determining what is a legitimately confidential privileged proprietary matter no procedure for oversight and no prescribed remedy for Enron for any unauthorized disclosures Kobayashi wrote Last week a San Francisco Superior Court judge granted Enron a protective order in a separate investigation by the state attorney general By Jessica Berthold Dow Jones Newswires Copyright A Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved USA Enron must give documents to Calif lawmakersjudge Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited SAN FRANCISCO Sept Reuters Enron Corp must turn over sensitive financial documents to a state Senate committee probing charges of price gouging during the states energy crisis a California judge ruled on Thursday But Sacramento Superior Court Judge Charles Kobayashi also ruled lawmakers must provide Enron with a confidentiality agreement saying he was not convinced the committee would respect the firms right to maintain proprietary secrets If the committee could take the requested action in the name of the public interest then the committee ostensibly could require newspapers to surrender their confidentiality rights attorneys to surrender their attorneyclient privilege and psychiatrists to surrender their privileges the judge wrote The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation has subpoenaed documents from a number of energy firms to probe accusations California power agencies and utilities were overcharged some billion for wholesale electricity during the states energy crisis which saw power prices in the state soar tenfold Independent energy merchants have blamed the price spike on the states poorly designed electricity deregulation law and a failure to build enough power plants to meet the growing needs of its million residents and its industries An Enron spokeswoman said on Thursday the firm has already turned over tens of thousands of documents but wanted assurances that certain sensitive documents containing proprietary trade secrets for example would be protected under a confidentiality agreement The firm will now work with the committee to hammer out the specifics of such an agreement said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne We are pleased with the judges order in that he agreed that our constitutional right would be protected Denne said The issue has always been protecting the confidential documents The committee has already asked the full Senate to cite Enron as well as Reliant Energy Inc for contempt for failing to comply with a subpoena seeking confidential documents It would be the first such citation imposed by the state Senate since but has not yet come up for a vote Atlantabased Mirant Corp however avoided the contempt threat by agreeing with legislators demands to sign confidentiality agreements open a document depository close to Sacramento and begin placing documents there relating to the companys recent business

SACRAMENTO AP Enron Corp must turn over sensitive financial documents to a state Senate committee investigating possible price manipulation of wholesale energy prices a judge ruled Thursday but the state must give the energy company a confidentiality agreement Sacramento Superior Court Judge Charles Kobayashi said in his ruling that he wasnt convinced that the Senate committee will be able to maintain the petitioners right to confidentiality The Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation in the Wholesale Energy Market subpoenaed documents from six energy companies as they investigated last years price spikes in the wholesale electricity market If the committee went forward without a confidentiality agreement Kobayashi said it could then require the same of newspapers attorneys or psychiatrists Enrons motion to quash the subpoenas were dismissed last week and the judge reaffirmed that ruling Thursday Another Enron motion seeking an injunction against the committee will be heard Wednesday Company spokeswoman Karen Denne called the protective order ruling a victory This gives us the confidentiality agreement weve been seeking The orders specifics will be worked out with Sen Joe Dunn DSanta Ana the committee chairman It will then be signed by a judge once both sides agree Enron officials have offered to turn over documents that were already in California but refused to comply with the rest of the subpoena The committee found Enron in contempt for not turning over all the requested documents A full report on the contempt finding has been sent to the full Senate which has not voted on it A contempt report on Reliant Energy has also been sent to the Senate A contempt finding against Mirant Corp was later reversed when the company opened a document depository in Sacramento for the committees investigators If the full Senate imposes sanctions against Reliant or Enron it will be the first time since when the Senate voted to jail reluctant

of the disclosure for whic h you are responsible for inclusion in the third quarter Form Q A lso please let me know if there are any new items that should be considere d Please respond no later than Monday October Thanks Gary Litigation and Other Contingencies Litigation Enron is a party to various claims and litigation the significant items of which are discussed below Although no assurances can be given Enron believes based on its experience to date and after considering appropriate reserves that have been established that the ultimate resolution of such items individually or in the aggregate will not have a material adverse i mpact on Enrons financial position or results of operations In several parties the Plaintiffs filed suit in Harris County Di strict Court in Houston Texas against Intratex Gas Company Intratex Ho uston Pipe Line Company and Panhandle Gas Company collectively the Enron Defendants each of which is a whollyowned subsidiary of Enron The Plai ntiffs were either sellers or royalty owners under numerous gas purchase co ntracts with Intratex many of which have terminated Early in the c ase was severed by the Court into two matters to be tried or otherwise res olved separately In the first matter the Plaintiffs alleged that the En ron Defendants committed fraud and negligent misrepresentation in connectio n with the Panhandle program a special marketing program established in the early s This case was tried in October and resulted in a ver dict for the Enron Defendants In the second matter the Plaintiffs allege that the Enron Defendants violated state regulatory requirements and certa in gas purchase contracts by failing to take the Plaintiffs gas ratably wi th other producers gas at certain times between and The trial court certified a class action with respect to ratability claims On March the Texas Supreme Court ruled that the trial courts class certif ication was improper and remanded the case to the trial court The Enron D efendants deny the Plaintiffs claims and have asserted various affirmative defenses including the statute of limitations The Enron Defendants beli eve that they have strong legal and factual defenses and intend to vigorou sly contest the claims Although no assurances can be given Enron believe s that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material ad verse effect on its financial position or results of operations On November an explosion occurred in the Humberto Vidal Buildi ng in San Juan Puerto Rico The explosion resulted in fatalities bodily injuries and damage to the building and surrounding property San Juan Gas Company Inc San Juan Gas an Enron affiliate operated a propaneair d istribution system in the vicinity but did not provide service to the buil ding Enron San Juan Gas four affiliates and their insurance carriers wer e named as defendants along with several third parties including The Puer to Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority Puerto Rico Telephone Company Heath Consultants Incorporated Humberto Vidal Inc and their insurance carriers in numerous lawsuits filed in US District Court for the District of Pue rto Rico and the Superior Court of Puerto Rico These suits seek damages f or wrongful death personal injury business interruption and property dama ge allegedly caused by the explosion After nearly four years without dete rmining the cause of the explosion all parties agreed not to litigate furt her that issue but to move these suits toward settlements or trials to det ermine whether each plaintiff was injured as a result of the explosion and if so the lawful damages attributable to such injury The defendants agre ed on a fund for settlements or final awards Numerous claims have been set tled and ten cases involving plaintiffs are scheduled for trial in the U nited States District Court beginning on December No cases have yet been scheduled for trial in the Superior Court Although no assurances can be given Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or resul ts of operations Trojan Investment Recovery In early Portland General Electric P GE ceased commercial operation of the Trojan nuclear power generating faci lity The Oregon Public Utility Commission OPUC granted PGE through a g eneral rate order recovery of and a return on percent of its remainin g investment in Trojan The OPUCs general rate order related to Trojan has been subject to liti gation in various state courts including rulings by the Oregon Court of Ap peals and petitions to the Oregon Supreme Court filed by parties opposed to the OPUCs order including the Utility Reform ProjectURP and the Citize ns Utility Board CUB In August PGE entered into agreements with the CUB and the staff o f the OPUC to settle the litigation related to PGEs recovery of its invest ment in the Trojan plant Under the agreements the CUB agreed to withdraw from the litigation and to support the settlement as the means to resolve the Trojan litigation The OPUC approved the accounting and ratemaking ele ments of the settlement on September As a result of these approv als PGEs investment in Trojan is no longer included in rates charged to c ustomers either through a return on or a return of that investment Colle ction of ongoing decommissioning costs at Trojan is not affected by the set tlement agreements or the September OPUC order With the CUBs wi thdrawal the URP is the one remaining significant adverse party in the lit igation The URP has indicated that it plans to continue to challenge the settlement and the original OPUC order allowing PGE recovery of and a retur n on its investment in Trojan Enron cannot predict the outcome of these actions Although no assuranc es can be given Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matte rs will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or res ults of operations Other Contingencies Environmental Matters Enron is subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and regulations These laws and regulations requ ire expenditures in connection with the construction of new facilities the operation of existing facilities and for remediation at various operating sites The implementation of the Clean Air Act Amendments is expected to r esult in increased operating expenses These increased operating expenses are not expected to have a material impact on Enrons financial position or results of operations Enrons natural gas pipeline companies conduct soil and groundwater reme diation on a number of their facilities Enron does not expect to incur ma terial expenditures in connection with soil and groundwater remediation Developments in the California Power Market During prices for wh olesale electricity in California significantly increased as a result of a combination of factors including higher natural gas prices reduction in a vailable hydroelectric generation resources increased demand overrelianc e on the spot market for electricity and limitations on supply California s regulatory regime instituted in permitted wholesale price increases but froze retail prices below market levels The resulting disparity betw een costs of supply and customer revenues caused two of Californias public utilities Pacific Gas Electric Company PGE and Southern California E dison Company SCE to accrue substantial unrecovered wholesale power cost s and certain obligations related to the difference between third party pow er purchase costs and frozen rates charged to retail customers PGE and S CE have defaulted on or are challenging payments owed for certain outstandi ng obligations including wholesale power purchased through the California Power Exchange the Power Exchange from the California Independent System Operator the Independent System Operator and from qualifying facilities In addition PGE and the Power Exchange each have filed a voluntary pet ition for bankruptcy Various legislative regulatory and legal remedies to the energy situati on in California have been implemented or are being pursued and may result in restructuring of markets in California and elsewhere Additional initi atives are likely at the Federal state and local level but it is not poss ible to predict their outcome at this time Enron has entered into a variety of transactions with California utiliti es the Power Exchange the Independent System Operator end users of energ y in California and other third parties and is owed amounts by certain of these entities Enron has established reserves related to such activities and believes that the combination of such reserves in accounts receivables and other credit offsets with such parties are adequate to cover its expos ure to developments in the California power market Due to the uncertainti es involved the ultimate outcome of the California power situation cannot be predicted but Enron believes these matters will not have a material adv erse impact on Enrons financial condition or results of operations India Enron indirectly owns of the net voting interest in Dabhol P ower Company Dabhol which owns a megawatt power plant and is constru cting an additional megawatt power plant together with an LNG regasif ication facility collectively Phase II in India Enron accounts for its investment in Dabhol under the equity method and the debt of Dabhol is non recourse to Enron Dabhol has been in dispute with the Maharashtra State E lectricity Board MSEB the purchaser of power from Dabhol and the Govern ment of Maharashtra GOM and the federal government of India GOI the gu arantors of payments by the MSEB pursuant to the terms and conditions of th e power purchase agreements PPA and the other project documents The con tract disputes relate principally to a the failure by the MSEB to pay cer tain capacity and energy payments under the PPA and the failure of the GOM and GOI to satisfy certain guarantee obligations under the project documen ts and b MSEBs statements that MSEB has rescinded the PPA and MSEB is therefore no longer bound by the PPA As a result of such disputes the Ph ase II lenders have stopped funding the continued construction of Phase II and the construction contractors have terminated the construction contracts for nonpayment There is no assurance that Dabhol will be able to resolv e such disputes to its favor and to successfully collect on and to enforce any judgment or settlement However Dabhol believes that the MSEBs actio ns are in clear violation of the terms of the PPA and Dabhol intends to pu rsue all available legal remedies under the project documents As a result of these disputes the megawatt power plant is not being dispatched by MSEB Further Dabhol has suspended construction activity on Phase II E nron does not believe that any contract dispute related to Dabhol will have a material adverse impact on Enrons financial condition or results of ope rations

From BDavid Lund Sent Wednesday August PM To BGalen Torneby Cc BBob Black BDon Campbell BGreg Tardanico BMike Ranz BDaniel Haas BDavid Hattery Seth Price Subject RE Foster Wheeler suggested language for delay damages ATTORNEYCLIENT COMMUNICATION PRIVELEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL Galen I dont have the full history of dealing on this purchase order with FWL but my instincts say we dont have to accept material changes to the terms on the eve of signing a PO FWLs attempt to adjust significant delay risk at the eleventh hour constitutes a breach of good faith and fair dealing It is as if we were to sign the PO based on weeks of review of a firm and final price but mark down the price a few million on the final draft because we felt we were taken to the cleaners on a previous job they sold to us FWL needs to be instructed to accept the PO without the proposed changes If they refuse we have and we must tell them the choice to contract with another party and hold them liable for the extra cost of another supplier to make the schedule required This liability is based on breach of an implied contract and FWL faces damages for detrimental reliance that would be the incremental cost above FWLs firm price charged by the replacement vendor The reliance argument is that we excused other bidders weeks ago and chose to exclusively deal with FWL based on agreement reliance of terms and conditions presented in earlier drafts of the PO or referred to in previous PO documents The detriment argument is FWL knew they had us captive to them on this deal By going forward without other bidders we lost price protection and commitment for schedule by other bidders therefore we are at a detriment without market forces In the best world our purchasing activities need to keep proposals competitive by not dropping back to one supplier for critical path equipment I mentioned a choice here the other choice is to continue to deal with FWL and accept their additional terms because the risk of changing horses and being successful on a lawsuit based on implied contract and detrimental reliance outweighs the risk and cost of having to mitigate the effect of LDs on FWL if critical path work is not impacted or hard to document and prove it was impacted and whether our obligations were fulfilled in this respect Since FWL has now opened the door to change material terms on the eve of signing we have the opportunity to do the same with them but that doesnt help if the parties continue to go in opposite directions while your end date stays the same I would say they know this is a dilemma to us and are betting we will deal with them on these new firsttime material changes to the PO terms If we go with the second choice I would encourage NEPCO and Enron to take FWL off any preferred bidders list In addition I thought I heard from the folks who attended the Linden settlement meeting a week ago that the parties said they would not let the litigation on Linden effect our other ongoing deals Apparently FWL is taking their issues on Linden over to other deals We may want to do the same Stepping back a bit unless our documents and witnesses are crystal clear on the implied contract theory and we have a clear fact pattern for detrimental reliance I wouldnt lick our chops and be confident that we got them on this liability I am willing to advance an argument for posture purposes in order to force some conclusion on the PO terms that they have attempted to open up And with what little I know thus far I would encourage we try to strike a deal in lieu of another lawsuit David H Lund Jr

J Gilbertsmith Doug Sanders Richard B Edison Andrew Holman Kelly Turner Nancy Subject California Update EXECUTIVE SUMMARY SoCal Conference Call Highlights SoCal Conference Call The following comments are notes from the SoCal conference call for defaulted debt holders held pm PDT July Ted Kravner the SoCal spokesperson indicated that there are a lot of bills floating around Theres not a lot for us to say at this point After such a long delay he stated that We are encouraged to see real action at the legislative level Also the company could not comment as to whether the plans made the utility creditworthy We are evaluating that with Senate and Assembly leaders The spokesperson stated that on Monday the company will make a regular interest payments on the notes totaling less than M The company will also make payments on its other notes the total amount to be paid will be to M Yesterday the CPUC granted the companys motion on the QF fixed rate agreement with the gas cogen and renewable QFs The spokesperson stated that the PUC said SoCal can recover all costs associated with its payments to these QFs Appalucia Management Questions to SoCal Q Will SCE defer payment on the quids notes which are backed by a trust that has bonds issued against it A Under the terms of the notes SoCal is allowed to defer payment for up to quarters Q Would the CPUC after providing for the DWR to be reimbursed for purchasing power through the California Procurement Adjustment or CPA leave enough revenue for SoCal to remain solvent This was based on reports in the press recently that the DWR had requested a rate increase A These reports were speculation and were based on numbers that DWR had submitted several weeks ago SoCal stated that DWR must update these numbers therefore no formal CPUC decision on reimbursing SoCal visvis DWR can be made at this time SoCal indicated that these numbers would be updated in a few weeks Prudential Questions to SoCal Q What bills are currently in process dealing with the MOU A There is the Polanco bill which is the original MOU the Assembly Hertzberg bill AB XX which uses the Polanco bill as its foundation and a Senate bill crafted around Byron Shers proposals SoCal stated that the Sher bill was less a matter of using Polanco and approaches the MOU from a different direction SoCal indicated that people are currently studying the Hertzberg will to see what the components are Q What is your SoCals reaction to the negative article in the LA Times today regarding the legislatures perception of the MOU A SoCal responded that the LA Times sees the glass as halfempty By my comments I see the glass as halffull We are optimistic because there something tangible that people are working on The fact that Hertzbergs bill uses the governors MOU as a foundation provides us with a level of optimism However he emphasized that the company was not in a position to say whether any of the bills would make the utility creditworthy Q Can the governor keep the legislature from recessing in order to force them to pass an MOU A SoCal responded yes I understand that he does have that power We are running out of days The situation is becoming more critical We are on borrowed time from our creditors now Anything that moves us toward creditworthiness we support NOTE In actuality the Governor can order legislators to the floor for a vote but they do not have to comply As Burton said in the press today Only the legislature can force the legislature to stay Deutsche Bank Questions to SoCal Q Is the transmission asset sale off the table or not A The sale is in the Assembly bill but we think its more of an option in the Senate bill like it was in the San Diego deal Q What are your SoCals thoughts on how the California Procurement Adjustment CPA mechanism could be constructed to keep SoCal solvent and if a change in the mechanism for reimbursing the DWR would be needed A We are highly focused on this The spokesperson stated that if revenue is distributed in a manner that puts the utility in a deteriorating balance sheet situation this will be seen as a very serious situation This would be unacceptable Our cash position is currently stable These changes this would be a very serious event Q Has SoCal reached an agreement on paying the nonrenewables or gasfired QFs of what they are owed A SoCal indicated that it is still in negotiations with of the larger gasfired QFs IEP Projects SoCal indicated that it would make its payments once the PUC order to pay is final a day appeal period is still in effect according to SoCal

yet read The issue of ENAs liability is as you would guess complicated Are we still on tra ck for a short meeting to discuss Original Message From Peng Gary SentThursday July AM ToRogers Rex Sanders Richard B Eickenroht Robert SubjectRE Second Quarter Q Litigation Disclosure Richard see below RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Developments in the California Power Market During prices for wholesale electricity in California significantly increased as a result of a combination of factors including higher natural gas prices reduction in available hydroelectric generation resources increased demand overreliance on the spot market for electricity and limitations on supply Californias regulatory regime instituted in permitted wholesale price increases but froze retail prices below market levels The resulting disparity between costs of supply and customer revenues caused two of Californias public utilities Pacific Gas Electric Company PGE and Southern California Edison Company SCE to accrue substantial unrecovered wholesale power costs and certain obligations related to the difference between third party power purchase costs and frozen rates charged to retail customers PGE and SCE have defaulted on or are challenging payments owed for certain outstanding obligations including wholesale power purchased through the California Power Exchange the Power Exchange from the California Independent System Operator the Independent System Operator and from qualifying facilities In addition PGE and the Power Exchange each have filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy Various legislative regulatory and legal remedies to the energy situation in California have been implemented or are being pursued and may result in restructuring of markets in California and elsewhere Additional initiatives are likely at the Federal state and local level but it is not possible to predict their outcome at this time Enron has entered into a variety of transactions with California utilities the Power Exchange the Independent System Operator end users of energy in California and other third parties and is owed amounts by certain of these entities Enron has established reserves related to such activities and believes that the combination of such reserves in accounts receivables and price risk management assets and other credit offsets with such parties are adequate to cover its exposure to developments in the California power market Due to the uncertainties involved the ultimate outcome of the California power situation cannot be predicted but Enron believes these matters will not have a material adverse impact on Enrons financial condition or results of operations India Enron indirectly owns of the net voting interest in Dabhol Power Company Dabhol which owns a megawatt power plant and is developing an additional megawatt power plant together with an LNG regasification facility in India Enron accounts for its investment in Dabhol under the equity methodand the debt of Dabhol is non recourse to Enron Dabhol has been in dispute with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB the purchaser of power from Dabhol and the Government of Maharashtra GOM and the federal government of India GOI the guarantors of payments by the MSEB pursuant to the terms and conditions of the power purchase agreements PPA and the other project documents The contract disputes relate principally to the failure by the MSEB to pay certain capacity and energy payments under the PPA and the failure of the GOM and GOI to satisfy certain guarantee obligations under the project documents There is no assurance that Dabhol will be able to resolve such disputes to its favor and to successfully collect on and to enforce any judgment or settlement However Dabhol believes that the MSEBs actions are in clear violation of the terms of the PPA and Dabhol intends to pursue all available legal remedies under the project documents Accordingly Enron does not believe that any contract dispute related to Dabhol would have a material adverse impact on Enrons financial condition or results of operations Termination of Portland General Sales Agreement On April Enron announced that the previously disclosed agreement to sell Portland General to Sierra Pacific Resources had been terminated by the mutual consent of both parties because the effect of developments in California and Nevada on the purchaser had made completion of the transaction impractical Original Message From Rogers Rex SentThursday July AM ToPeng Gary Sanders Richard B Eickenroht Robert SubjectRE Second

Trojan Investment Recovery In early Portland General Electric PGE ceased commercial operation of the Trojan nuclear power generating facility The Oregon Public Utility Commission OPUC granted PGE through a genera l rate order recovery of and a return on percent of its remaining inv estment in Trojan The OPUCs general rate order related to Trojan has been subject to litigat ion in various state courts including rulings by the Oregon Court of Appea ls and petitions to the Oregon Supreme Court filed by parties opposed to th e OPUCs order including the Utility Reform ProjectURP and the Citizens Utility Board CUB In August PGE entered into agreements with the CUB and the staff of t he OPUC to settle the litigation related to PGEs recovery of its investmen t in the Trojan plant Under the agreements the CUB agreed to withdraw fro m the litigation and to support the settlement as the means to resolve the Trojan litigation The OPUC approved the accounting and ratemaking elements of the settlement on September As a result of these approvals P GEs investment in Trojan is no longer included in rates charged to custome rs either through a return on or a return of that investment Collection o f ongoing decommissioning costs at Trojan is not affected by the settlement agreements or the September OPUC order With the CUBs withdrawal the URP is the one remaining significant adverse party in the litigation The URP has indicated that it plans to continue to challenge the OPUC orde r allowing PGE recovery of and a return on its investment in Trojan Enron cannot predict the

Paso responds MIMEVersion ContentType textplain charsetDusascii ContentDisposition inline El Paso Corporation Responds to Mischaracterizations and Inaccurate Reports Of FERC Hearing HOUSTON Aug PRNewswire El Paso Corporation NYSE EPG news bel ieves that it is necessary to respond to continuing mischaracterizations an d inaccurate press reports regarding the recently completed Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC hearing in which it participated This distort ed coverage has fostered unwarranted fears in the marketplace fueled by mis understandings about the nature of the FERC proceeding the testimony and e vidence presented and the applicable regulatory standards I am very concerned that the investing public has been misled by recent r eports describing the current state of a FERC proceeding and quoting commen ts made by the presiding FERC administrative law judge said William A W ise chairman president and chief executive officer of El Paso Corporatio n These reports have seriously mischaracterized El Pasos actions and th e legal standards by which those actions must be measured I am confident t hat once the facts are fairly evaluated and the appropriate legal standards are applied El Paso will be vindicated Despite the heated rhetoric by th e complaining parties and comments by the administrative law judge himself El Paso believes as a matter of law and fact that the complaining parties have not met their burden of proof and no burdens of proof have shifted No other legally sustainable conclusion can be reached The following facts are necessary to a complete and accurate understanding of this administrative proceeding In April the California Public Uti lities Commission CPUC filed a complaint with the FERC alleging that El Paso Natural Gas Company EPNG improperly awarded capacity on its pipeline to an affiliated energy marketing company El Paso Merchant Energy EPME It was also alleged that EPME had improperly been granted a discount on th e Mojave pipeline system in violation of the FERCs marketing affiliate rul es and had unlawfully exercised market power For almost a year thereafter FERC reviewed and evaluated comments submitted by all parties and extensiv e evidence and documents that El Paso produced On March the FERC issued an order based on this evidence that addressed all three issues With respect to the CPUCs allegations regarding violations of the affiliat e regulations FERC ruled in an unanimous decision that The current El Paso contracts were awarded following an open season that was conducted in accordance with Commission rules and policies The Commission finds no merit in the allegations that the bidding process was skewed to favor El Paso Merchant and that El Paso Merchant possessed certain information concerning a discount that was not available to other bidders Further the Commission has examined the evidence and does not find a violation of the Standards of Conduct for Interstate Pipelines with Marketing Affiliates That same order specifically discussed the very telephone transcripts that have been the subject of recent press coverage Notwithstanding certain pub lic observations of the administrative law judge in the current hearing th e Commission unanimously concluded that the transcripts do not indicate t hat Mojaves Transportation Marketing Negotiator agreed to the tiered arran gement sought by El Paso Merchant Energy That order unequivocally held t hat the conversation reported in the transcripts is not an affiliate standa rd violation concluding that under the marketing affiliate regulations Mojave was under no obligation to post affiliate discount information until the time at which gas first flowed under the transaction The market power issues were set for an evidentiary hearing which commence d on May and concluded in June On June the FERC granted rehearing of its March decision solely t o resolve any factual issues raised by the allegations of the CPUCs compla int concerning affiliate abuse and violation of the FERCs Standards of Con duct That hearing commenced on August and concluded on August EPNG E PME and the CPUC each called one witness to testify on these issues The C PUC presented no new facts or evidence and relied solely on the same docume nts that the unanimous Commission had ruled failed to prove any of the alle ged affiliate violations Since the FERCs unanimous March decision was rendered on the basis of t he same facts that are now a part of the evidentiary record before the judg e there should be no legal basis for the Commission to change that decisio n when the case returns to it Contrary to press reports El Pasos senior executives did not refuse to appear at the hearing said Mr Wise The judge requested that some exe cutives be available to answer his questions and El Paso made them availab le for that purpose At the appropriate time El Paso raised several legal objections to any further El Paso witnesses being required to testify Cont rary to press reports the judge agreed with El Pasos arguments and there was no further questioning of the executives The hearing then concluded The evidence in the hearing also establishes that there is no basis for the allegations of market power abuse During the period from June to Mar ch when the price of natural gas in California was sharply increasing pipeline capacity was plainly not being withheld from the marketplace In stead the evidence demonstrates that during this crucial period percen t of the available capacity on EPNGs pipeline was being utilized In fact on many days utilization by EPNGs customers amounted to percent of th e pipelines available capacity During the same period EPNGs customers u tilized approximately percent of the pipelines available capacity into southern California the region where the complaining parties allege that p rices were significantly higher than in the rest of California Thus the o bjective data conclusively demonstrate that at the times when the complaini ng parties allege that pipeline capacity was used to manipulate natural gas prices the capacity on EPNGs pipeline was not being withheld and that t he high natural gas prices were clearly caused by other factors now widely recognized to be responsible for the shortages experienced All briefs in the proceeding must be filed by September and the ju dge has stated he will issue his proposed decision by October In t he event that the judge reaches a decision adverse to El Paso on the market power issue or reaches a different conclusion on the affiliate issues tha n was reached by the full Commission in March El Paso will appeal the decision to the full Commission and if necessary thereafter the courts I am confident that when appropriate legal standards are applied to this case we will be vindicated The law and the facts are on our side said Mr Wise El Paso Corporation is committed to meeting energy needs throughout

Message From Cigarroa Gabriella Sent Monday August PM To Sanders Richard B Subject FW Review of Electronic Documents Importance High Richard Peter Meringolo from Brobeck has requested copies of email files and documents be made for review at the Brobeck offices My recommendation is that the review be made at the Enron offices and that only those files that pertain to the case be copied or printed to take to Brobecks offices Id like to minimize the amount of nonpertinent information that leaves our control Attached is the message I sent to Dave on this issue If you feel it is most appropriate to give them copies of everything I understand I just wanted to convey the risks and obtain your acceptance The office manager in San Francisco has had arrangements in place for the last month so that Brobeck could review the documents in the San Francisco office I understand from Peter that they are getting much closer to needing to complete the review so if you can let me know what route you decide on that would be great THanks gabriella Director Business Controls Security Original Message From Cigarroa Gabriella Sent Tuesday July PM To Parquet David Subject FW Review of Electronic Documents Dave Peter Meringolo from Brobek has sent me a request to create copies of Sue Maras Mike McDonalds and your email files and documents so that they can be reviewed at Brobecks offices I recommend that the email files and documents be reviewed at your offices and if necessary only those messages and documents responsive to the subpoena be copied electronically for use at the Brobeck offices The issue with making electronic copies of material is that once it is out of our control we will no longer have any idea of how many copies were made who had access to the material or know how it was stored and protected Therefore it is in our best interest to reduce the information copied electronically to only what is essential If printing is adequate then I would recommend that Brobeck print the documents that are responsive to the subpoena April has set up appropriate access to the system and files so that they can be reviewed in your office spaces I have spoken with Peter and promised that I would get your input as well as Richard Sanders on the issue Please give me a call if you have any questions Best regards gabriella PS I have placed some comments in red next to each of Peters points Original Message From Meringolo Peter mailto Sent Thursday July PM To Cigarroa Gabriella Subject Review of Electronic Documents Gabriella Thank you for taking the time to discuss the copying of email and electronic documents in the possession of certain employees in Enrons San Francisco office As we discussed this email sets forth our request and our reasons this request I truly appreciate you discussing this issue with Richard Sanders and Dave Parquet REQUEST We request that Enron copy onto CDs certain electronic documents and emails in the possession of Dave Parquet Sue Mara and Mike McDonald Thereafter we will review these documents and produce only those documents and emails that are responsive to subpoenas from the California Senate and the California Attorney General The documents and emails we request to be copied likely contain documents and emails not responsive to these two outstanding subpoenas REASONS FOR REQUEST You raise valid concerns with our proposal insofar as we ask for copies of documents and emails that are not responsive to the subpoenas We believe our proposal is the best approach for following reasons We can accurately keep control of what we have reviewed what we have deemed responsive and what we have deemed privileged Folders can be set up for filing and tracking these documents gc We can rereview materials in the likely event of further subpoenas or documents requests All documents and emails are to be retained so that they will be available for future reviews gc We can review the materials in the least disruptive manner possible on our own computers and in our offices Operating from your office may be an inconvenience but it minimizes the risk of losing control of sensitive documents that have no bearing on the case gc We can review at the pace dictated by the litigation which is unpredictable to say the least As long as access to your office spaces and the system is made available this should not be an issue gc Concerns about security and confidentiality are common in all litigation and document review We always take these concerns seriously We will restrict access to these documents to only those persons involved with reviewing and organizing the documents We will work with you to ensure that these documents will remain in strict confidence Again I truly appreciate your taking the time to

some unlawful bargaining tactics on our Lakeworth FL project More of the drama is outlined below No need for action here David H Lund Jr Assistant General Counsel National Energy Production

BDavid Hattery Seth Price Subject RE Foster Wheeler suggested language for delay damages ATTORNEYCLIENT COMMUNICATION PRIVELEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL Galen I dont have the full history of dealing on this purchase order with FWL but my instincts say we dont have to accept material changes to the terms on the eve of signing a PO FWLs attempt to adjust significant delay risk at the eleventh hour constitutes a breach of good faith and fair dealing It is as if we were to sign the PO based on weeks of review of a firm and final price but mark down the price a few million on the final draft because we felt we were taken to the cleaners on a previous job they sold to us FWL needs to be instructed to accept the PO without the proposed changes If they refuse we have and we must tell them the choice to contract with another party and hold them liable for the extra cost of another supplier to make the schedule required This liability is based on breach of an implied contract and FWL faces damages for detrimental reliance that would be the incremental cost above FWLs firm price charged by the replacement vendor The reliance argument is that we excused other bidders weeks ago and chose to exclusively deal with FWL based on agreement reliance of terms and conditions presented in earlier drafts of the PO or referred to in previous PO documents The detriment argument is FWL knew they had us captive to them on this deal By going forward without other bidders we lost price protection and commitment for schedule by other bidders therefore we are at a detriment without market forces In the best world our purchasing activities need to keep proposals competitive by not dropping back to one supplier for critical path equipment I mentioned a choice here the other choice is to continue to deal with FWL and accept their additional terms because the risk of changing horses and being successful on a lawsuit based on implied contract and detrimental reliance outweighs the risk and cost of having to mitigate the effect of LDs on FWL if critical path work is not impacted or hard to document and prove it was impacted and whether our obligations were fulfilled in this respect Since FWL has now opened the door to change material terms on the eve of signing we have the opportunity to do the same with them but that doesnt help if the parties continue to go in opposite directions while your end date stays the same I would say they know this is a dilemma to us and are betting we will deal with them on these new firsttime material changes to the PO terms If we go with the second choice I would encourage NEPCO and Enron to take FWL off any preferred bidders list In addition I thought I heard from the folks who attended the Linden settlement meeting a week ago that the parties said they would not let the litigation on Linden effect our other ongoing deals Apparently FWL is taking their issues on Linden over to other deals We may want to do the same Stepping back a bit unless our documents and witnesses are crystal clear on the implied contract theory and we have a clear fact pattern for detrimental reliance I wouldnt lick our chops and be confident that we got them on this liability I am willing to advance an argument for posture purposes in order to force some conclusion on the PO terms that they have attempted to open up And with what little I know thus far I would encourage we try to strike a deal in lieu of another lawsuit David H Lund Jr Assistant General Counsel National Energy Production Corporation North Creek Parkway N Bothell WA Fax or

Service ContentType multipartmixedboundaryDDNextPartC DC JOINT DEFENSE I spoke today with Sweetwaters counsel Rob Hanna of Best Best Krieger Two items to report Judge Sammartino Hanna alerted me to an article in the recent San Diego Lawyer see attached The article concerns the M for Motherhood Group a group of San Diego women lawyers that have met twice a week for the past years Judge Sammartino is a member of the group as are two lawyers in Hannas firm Arelene Prater and Tina Dyer Hanna said he wanted defendants to be aware the relationship between the BB K lawyers and Sammartino Hanna said he has no plans to challenge Judge Sammartino but wanted defense lawyers to be alerted to the issue Unless someone has a different suggestion lets factor this into the mix when we revisit the coordination issues next week Case Management Hearing Hanna reported that his office had contacted Judge Hayes clerk to ask whether the CMC hearing set for i n Sweetwater would be going forward Hannas office was told the CMC would remain on calendar Hanna and I jointly called Judge Hayes Court Clerk David Lim to follow up Mr Lim confirmed that notwithstanding the assignment order to Judge Sammartino Judge Hayes wants the parties to provide a status report at the CMC He confirmed that the Court wants the parties to file CMC questionnaires although he suggested that the Court is probably most interested in the coordination status The CMC questionnaire is due Friday Sept although Mr Lim said we could filed anytime prior to Thursday noon Sept Given that Judge Hayes appreciates strict compliance with the local rules I suggest we file this Friday We will prepare a proposed joint CMC statement for all defendants and circulate the same tomorrow The M Grouppdf CONFIDENTIAL Luce Forward
