reportsFSUSWealthInStocks Market Watch This section of the Daily Reckoning is written by Eric Fry editor of Grantsinvestorcom You can watch Eric on TV this week hes the guest host on CNNFN EST My notes and letter follow as usual From Eric The consumer is OK so far The Conference Boards consumer confidence index jumped to in May from in April The University of Michigan index went the same way from to In keeping with the upbeat mood Americans spent more than they earned in April Spending on goods and services grew in April slightly higher than the months personal income growth So Americans are still living beyond their means But despite the encouraging news most stocks lost ground yesterday In particular the NASDAQ fell more than points Blame Goldman Sachs analyst Laura Conigliaro Before the market opened Ms Conigliaro issued some unflattering comments about Sun Microsystems and data storage company EMC Citing fierce price competition in the datastorage business she reduced her earnings estimates for both companies Someone needs to take Ms Conigliaro aside and explain how the game is played Shares of the two tech companies stumbled from the opening bell and dragged the NASDAQ down with them Goldman cant earn much money that way The Dow Jones Industrials bucked the trend with a point gain Most of the visiting onair commentators I encountered at the CNN studios yesterday expressed optimism that the US economy and stock market are recovering thanks to the indefatigable American consumer We consumers will keep spending the optimists say even if we must borrow to do it and yes even if were losing our jobs Well Im a consumer and Im not buying that prophecy Allow me to offer a different one the rising unemployment trend is unfortunately just beginning And those without jobs and those who fear losing their jobs will not be visiting shopping malls in their spare time no matter how many credit cards Capital One tries to give them Remember the wealth effect Stocks went up and people felt richer Their portfolio statements told them they were richer So they spent more money and invested more freely But what would happen when stocks went down Would there be a poverty effect Alan Greenspan wondered the same thing So he pulled together a panel of economists to study it Well it turned out that the wealth effect was highly concentrated among guess whothe wealthy They were the ones who owned the stocks that went up And when stocks went down the wealthy didnt exactly begin to scrimp and save But they did cut back which is why you can get a beach house in the Hamptons for less this year than last year even though most consumer spending remained unchanged But the study also found that while most consumers had never benefited from the wealth effect they still acted as if they had They stopped saving and went further into debt Now half of all US households have less than in financial assets Those in the middle income range have only enough financial reserves to sustain spending for months And the bottom of households have NO RESERVES whatsoever If these people lose a job or even overtime pay they must cut back on spending The US economy at the moment is like the economists who plunges one hand into ice water and the other hand into boiling water and proclaims On average the water is warm Although US GDP registered a tepid growth rate in the first quarter our economy contains elements that are both redhot and stone cold Moodys reports An index of lumber product prices recently posted stunning gains of for todate and yearoveryear But at the same time Moodys observes Aprils record monthly decline in semiconductor equipment bookings broke the previous record drop of set just two months earlier Semiconductor equipment bookings have dropped yearoveryear thus far in Warmon average Despite the rate cuts by the Federal Reserve we are in the middle of what the folks at International Strategies and Investments ISI term an economic head fake ISIs research uncovered two such head fakes in the last years The economy firmed briefly in the middle of the recession and similarly strengthened briefly before heading into the recession The US economy may be doing a touch better ISI concludes but we seriously doubt its about to take off because its facing a number of headwinds including Declining corporate profits Declining employment Collapsing tech activity An overextended consumer as to much spending too much debt negative savings rate Slowing global economic activity A weakening California economy And a few notes from Bill The second half recovery that investors have been talking about so eagerly is now only a month away Will it arrive on schedule As Eric points out above if unemployment continues to rise consumers will be forced to cut back their spending And if they cut back the recovery will have to wait maybe for years But what would make unemployment increase A slowdown in consumer spending of course HmmmIll have to look at this more closelyIm not getting anywhere More tomorrow Despite its point loss for the week last week the Dow has risen from its March low of write Blue Teamers Addison

years ago said Colonel Flamm Dee Harper USAF Ret France is a beautiful countryas beautiful now as I remember it Except you dont have to worry about running into a German patrol around every bend in the road Col Harper a small handsome man of years stood on the hillside speaking into a microphone to a crowd of about people At his right was a young lieutenant the USAF attache from Paris who served as his interpreter Further down the hill a group of about a dozen French officers were formed up into a square starched and gravewith enough gold braid to back a currency On his left were two flags hoisted on recently implanted poles the Stars and Stripes and the French drapeau and a marching band of about pieces resplendent in dark blue suits with white insignia They were the municipal band of little Montmorillon the sous prefecture about minutes away from my house Montmorillon was celebrating the return of Col Harper an American pilot who crashlanded in this field in In front of me a blonde woman had tears in her eyes She looked as though she was about years old I did the math twice to make sure she had to be at least I want to thank Jacqueline Thomas who saved my life said Col Harper For more than half a century Jacqueline Thomas who stood before me had wondered whatever happened to the young flyer she found in her grandfathers vineyard in It was the vineyard as much as Jacqueline who saved him Born in Albion Idaho Harper was years old when America entered WWII Like so many pilots he was fascinated by machines and speed And when a group of P s flew over Utah in Harper saw them and knew what he wanted to do He enlisted in the air force and was sent to flight school A few months later he was already flying his th mission over France His target was the German ammunition depot at Sillars about miles from here But something went wrong A timedelay bomb went off and ignited the powder magazine just as he was passing overhead at an altitude of only a hundred feet The debris hit the aircraft putting one engine out of action and damaging the other Worse Harper had been struck in the head by flying glass So much blood streamed down his face that he could no longer see Smoke filled the cockpit Harper undid his harness and started to bail out Then he realized that the ground was only about feet below So he sat back down in his seat and prepared to crash Seeing the field again for the first time since the event Harper turned to me I dont know how I survived A P cant glide at less than say miles per hour I should have been killed But the wires that held up the grapevines slowed the plane Harper jumped out of the cockpit with no further injury At first Jacqueline Thomas thought he must be a German She started to run away Then by some instinct she decided to go to his aid His face was covered with blood And the Germans could arrive at any minute She led him to her grandfathers house No one was home She tended his head wound in the only manner she knew dousing it with eau de vie strong spirits that hurt so much that Col Harper recalls the pain to this day Not long after Jacquelines father arrived He had seen the plane go down and was concerned for his daughter Taking command of the situation he had Harper take off his clothes and dressed him as local farmer The two grabbed fishing poles and went down to the river where pretending to fish they made their way to a cave where Harper was hidden Eventually Resistance leaders were contacted Harper was driven to a farm where another woman took charge of him Denise LaBrousse She was there yesterday too Nothing seemed to have changed Harper was vigorous with a sense of humor and a friendly smile Jacqueline still seemed like the teenaged girl who found him in the field And Madame LaBrousse looked like shes probably always looked She looked like she could make a good omelet which is just what she did for Harper As the story was told each of these people made their way up to take their places alongside Col Harper Denise LaBrousse walking with difficulty with the aid of a cane And there they stood The mayor of Montmorillon had invited me to the ceremony as a representative of the local American community I not only represent it I explained to Col Harper I am it Apart from my family there are no other Americans in the area and as an interpreter He now presented Col Harper with a medal from the town A representative of the French Air Force gave him another medal a set of wings The band struck up the Star Spangled Bannerand then the Marseillaise Tears welled up in many eyes Many of those present had fought in the war Others had vivid memories of it My friend Gilbert Mining was there He had made his way to North Africa to join the Free French Forces of de Gaulle Hed made friends with an American soldierwhom he has never seen again Another old soldier sat next to me at the dinner following the ceremonies in the field He had been with the French army at the Maginot Line They were driven back by the Germans and finally pinned against the Loire River I asked my commander for permission to desert said the retired schoolteacher He told me to go ahead So I swam across the river Then I fought in North Africaand then back to France Harper meanwhile went on to glory He joined the local SAS forces Britains underground operation that coordinated resistance activity throughout the war John Fielding an Englishman who was part of the local unit was also at yesterdays ceremony Together with the local French resistance they blew up train lines to keep the Germans from moving troops from the south of France to the front in Normandy But Harper did not remain on the ground or under it for long Scarcely three weeks after the local paper in Utah reported him missing in action he was back in England and back in the cockpit on various missions Later in Korea he was shot down again His ribs were broken but he managed to kill two North Korean soldiers with a handgun and was rescued by helicopter He became the only pilot to get shot down in two wars and keep on flying But the most remarkable phase of his career was probably during the period following his rescue in North Korea While he was recovering from his injuries Harper directed the activities of his unit of flyers One of his pilots reported a massive buildup of supply trains in the sector Harper was unable to get permission for an attack but ordered it anyway The pilots went to work They discovered that the boxcars were loaded with ammunition The whole sky lit up brightened by the explosions Encouraged they just kept hitting the train which just kept blowing up Some military historians believe this attack was the key to ending the war The ammunitions train was meant to supply a massive millionman Chinese army Without supplies the offensive was called off and the North Koreans decided to resort to the bargaining table But world politics were a long way away from the thoughts of those assembled here in Montmorillon this weekend Im just glad to be alive said Harper Your correspondent Bill Bonner Advertisement Insider Secrets Put MORE MONEY In Your Pocket How do

yesterday The Nasdaq was down Consumers are still spendingbut a closer look at the numbers reveals the weakness Half of Aprils increase in consumer spending is attributable to higher prices And earnings too reduced for inflation rose at only during the month Looking more carefully at how consumers were spending their money we find that they were still buying bread and beer but not big ticket items such as cars and homes Bankruptcy filings rose to a new record for a first quarter Scylla and Charybdis must be closing in Will lower stock prices further reduce consumer spending The ups and downs of the stock market reports the Wall Street Journal summarizing a Fed study dont foreshadow where the economy is headed They drive it directly Lower stock prices less consumer spending Less consumer spending less business investment and lower profits Lower profits low stock prices Were a long way from a major buying opportunity opines Daniel Turov in Barrons The Dow first reached the

for last week Keep your financial advice to yourself advised the stars If only I had listened I would not now be in the embarrassing position of trying to explain the depressing fall in gold prices down yesterday alone And the euro At cents it only has a few mills to go before it hits a new all time low But what can you expect from the euro I dubbed it the Esperanto currency when it came out Backed by neither a single government nor by gold the euro is a monetary curiosity a money based on good intentionswishful thinkingand who knows what else And as James Grant points out it is a paper currency that isnt even available on paper They dont release the actual bills until next year So far it is just electronic ether Perhaps as Grant suggests I should do what Wall Street analysts doand change my buy recommendation for the euro to a hold or a market perform And maybe gold should become an accumulate rather than an un hedged long position Maybe I should just give up and admit that the gold and the euro may someday be decent places for your moneybut their time has not yet come But whats the point You dont cancel a life insurance program just because you arent dead yet The median corporate bond rating stands at BBB or weak investment grade reports Grant in Forbes the lowest since the first year for which statistics are available Also just of the junkbond universe holds the top

painting shutters on Sunday afternoon Painting is not my favorite pasttime dear reader It is tedious and repetitive But it has one virtue it lends itself to conversation If I have any advice to give to the families of America it is this throw out the television and pick up painting brushes The family that paints together sticks together Well at least their hair sticks together Jules Maria and Sophia each had an answer for Benoit But none could offer a convincing explanation of why or how the two countries differ All agreed however that America is a freer place Even the Frenchman Alexis de Tocqueville noticed it early in the th century Americans were unrestrained bound neither by law custom taste or dignity The frontier was especially wild he noted as uncivilized as the people who inhabited it Since Tocqueville took his famous tour of America much has changed The frontier has been tamed So have its inhabitants As noted here many times since America gained its freedom from Britain Americas citizens have become the serfs of their own government Americans worked from January st until January th each year roughly to pay their obligations to George rd Today successful Americans work from January st to June st to pay their tribute to George Ws government Still my children as well as most of the worlds people are convinced that America remains a freer place than France An article in Forbes reports that it takes just days to start a business in the US but days in France In its ranking of the best places in the world to start a business Forbes places the US as France is Ive begun businesses in both countries The numbers may be technically correct but they focus on the wrong part of the story The big difference between France and America is not the difficulty of starting a business but the trouble of getting out of an unsuccessful one Marks and Spencers the British retailer with a store around the corner from my office decided to close its doors in France after losing money for years Uhnot so fast The employees kicked up a fuss and a French court ordered MS to stay in business until a settlement was reached Operating stores reduced hours and empty shelves has added millions to the firms losses Several investment strategists including our own Steve Sjuggerud and Steve Hanke conclude that you should always invest in countries that are moving towards more commercial liberty But if you followed that advice literally you would have taken your money out of the US years ago And you would miss the benefits of investing in socialism France is a more demanding and unforgiving place than America The schools are harder Teachers do not worry about a childs selfesteem If wrong answers are given or untidy work is handed in the poor children are scolded and often insulted Children are expected to stand up straight look guests in the eye and offer their cheeks for a kiss People are expected to dress properly when they go out and always move to the right hand lane when drivingleaving the left lanes open for speeders Husbands may have mistresses but they are expected to be discreet about it Rigidity is not without its benefits Women are prettier and the food is generally better In the business world it is hard to get started eliminating the casual entrepreneurs but once you are established government regulations raise up behind you like a drawbridge to block potential competitors Conduct your affairs in the proper way and all of French society will conspire to keep you in business France is a socialist country with a very expensive national health care system subsidized transportation and regulations governing almost every aspect of life just like America Workers enjoy a hour work weekwith weeks of vacation But this puts pressure on enterprises to make sure their employees are productive And while French workers tend to work fewer hours no one works as many hours as Americans it is rare to find workers as incompetent as those you routinely encounter in the US But the real difference between the US and France observed one of the attendees at Mark Skousens lecture last night is that the intellectual tradition of economic liberty never really caught on in France In AngloSaxon countries Adam Smith popularized the notion of an invisible hand guiding individual market transactions for the benefit of all How come those ideas never took root in France Neither Mark nor any of the attendees had a good answer In fact the discussion merely deepened the mystery Because it was in France that the idea of laissezfaire economics was first developed Montesquieu Say Tocqueville Bastiat they elaborated the ideas of financial liberty long before Ayn Rand or Milton Friedman In fact added Henri Lepage host of last nights meeting Bastiat anticipated what is now known as public choice theory long before James Buchanan was born But what happened They died said one attendee A similar phenomenon occurred in

show that appears three times over the weekend Saturday at AM PM and Sunday at AM I am told it appears in the same time slots in each time zone across the country The stock market correction has been overdone Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Robert McTeer pronounced yesterday And we are darn glad to know it Unfortunately McTeer provided no specific stock picks or model portfolio by which to profit from the anticipated rally As if in reaction to McTeers call the stock market rallied a bit yesterday The NASDAQ Composite gained points or Even after Thursdays token bounce the NASDAQ sits about below the level it achieved last week And lest we forget the struggling index is still below last years alltime high Lately the news issuing from the technology sector has been so grim that not even diehard bulls can ignore it Surprising is the word appearing very often in the latest batch of earnings warnings and cautionary comments from Wall Street analysts In particular Sun Microsystems surprised Wall Street earlier this week by warning that its earnings for the current quarter would be less than half what most folks had been expecting But the most surprising thing about Sun Microsystems announcement was that it surprised anybody Suns very own CEO Scott McNealy has been complaining for several weeks about the poor earnings visibility at his company Investors simply ignored him As High Tech Strategist editor Fred Hickey wrote two months ago While most market strategists chart technicians and analysts are proclaiming in unison that they see a bottom the CEOs mostused phrase today is no visibility The only bottom they see is the bottomless pit into which they are staring The Dow Jones Industrials gained points yesterday to within hailing distance of the emotionally significant but fundamentally irrelevant level McTeers comment about the stock market selloff being overdone typifies the new and improved Federal Reserve that has emerged during Chairman Greenspans reign The Greenspan Fed is not as focused on the stability of the banking system or the strength of the currency as its predecessors have been Rather Greenspans gang devote themselves to micromanaging and cheerleading the economy And why not The Fed did such a good job of protecting the value of the dollar only down since the Fed took up its mission who is better qualified to manage the economy Would a national Chapter filing be patriotic McTeers hope for economic growth via debtdriven consumption sounds more idiotic than patriotic Mitchell Securities bank analyst Charlie Peabody points out that even though the Fed is cutting rates not all interest rates headed lower Yields are rising for debt maturities that are longer than two years This state of affairs affects different types of borrowers differently and the news is not all good For example people wishing to take out a new year mortgage on their home will find that rates are higher now not lower than when Alan Greenspan begun cutting rates in January Furthermore even when applying for mortgages that are tied to oneyear rates which are lower than they were months ago consumers usually must qualify for these kinds of mortgages based on what their monthly payments would be on a year fixed rate mortgage Therefore Peabody concludes For every notch that rates rise some tier of consumer wont qualify for access to credit some tier of consumer will buckle under the weight of their rising debt service burdens and the affordability of housing as well as the ability to leverage against the value of this asset will deteriorate The bottom line is that the consumers ability to sustain this economic expansion is in the process being cut out from underneath him The hapless euro fell against the dollar again yesterday So unrelenting is the euros decline that it is becoming monotonous Financial commentators are running out of reasons to explain its weakness By the end of the New York trading session the euro had reached a new low for the year of cents BCA Research believes that the euros weakness stems directly from the fact that the investment capital flowing out of the eurozone is much greater than that flowing in I get it people are buying the dollar and selling the euro I guess that explains it We mentioned a couple days ago in the DR that thanks to our unofficial recession travel bargains abound The reason for the deals is that folks arent traveling To judge from recent stats compiled by Dennis Gartmans eponymous Gartman Letter most families will spend their summer vacation in their own backyard running through the sprinklers and grilling hot dogs Gartman states that this spring of the top travel markets in the US report marked declines in hotel occupancy rates compared to last year In New York occupancy fell to from one year ago San Francisco Bay at even worse last years occupancy rates fell sharply to this year Not even the Happiest Place on Earth could buck the trend DisneyWorld occupancy rate fell to from last year Greg Weldon editor of Weldons Money Monitor who brought the Gartman data to our attention also provided a firsthand report from DisneyWorld I can say in no uncertain terms that while I was there last week hotels in Orlando were very aggressively advertising discounted rates for the Memorial Day weekend spacewith neon signs billboard ads and repeated radio ads Tellingly Dennis Gartman notes one bright spot budget hotel occupancy rates rose percent compared to a decline in luxury hotel occupancy Consumer where art thou How about this for a

to a subject Well today I have gotten out a spray rig with a wide nozzle Using this heavy equipment I intend to put a thin gloss over years of western history in less time that it would take a Republic congressman to sound out the word so lidarity The question on the floor still lying on the carpet like a smear of cheese dip after last nights party is this why has the idea of laissezfaire economics taken hold in Anglosaxon countries but not in the country of its birth Yesterday I reported that French workers were entitled to weeks vacation I was wrong In in the name of solidarite the Mitterand government decreed that henceforth every French worker would have the right to weeks of paid vacation There is no word in English that conveys the sense of the French word solidarite Socialists and agitprop demonstrators occasionally try to use an anglicized version of it solidarity but the word has neither meaning nor emotional power in English Solidarite means nothing in French either explained a very bourgeois dinner companion a few months ago But it is like the word racism in English It is used to shut people up No politician in France wants to risk being contre solidarite What a wonderful world we live in dear reader So full of intricate subtle meaning So marvelously complexand so entertaining There is no better place for an American to enjoy this fascinating world than in France You dont have to listen to people charging one another with being racist a pre occupation of American politics Instead you listen to arguments about solidarite and you are amused The French still imagine that they are one people with one language inhabiting one distinct place They may have competing ideasbut their interests are in harmony Whats good for the truck drivers is good for all Frenchmen When the drivers went on strike blocking major highways and causing a mile traffic jam people were overwhelmingly sympathetic They felt the need to stay in solidarite with the drivers America is different It is a collection of different peoples We recognize that different groups not only have different ideas but different interests that compete with one another Many people might be sympathetic to truckers but few would feel they had a right to snarl up the entire nations highway system If they have a beef it is with their employers not with the rest of us Let them sort it out themselves Laissez faire Why has the laissez faire concept been lost in France Mark Skousen asked his audience Perhaps it is a question of faith he wondered aloud Adam Smiths idea was that things would work themselves out for the public good guided by an invisible hand Smith was a moral philosopher He saw the invisible hand as the hand of God America has more churchgoers than any other developed nation It always has had higher levels of religious participation Looking around the US region by region the higher the level of church attendance the more likely the voters are to favor the invisible hand of the free market over the iron fist of government It is rural areas and especially the evangelical superchurch regions of the south and southwest that vote for the freemarket With little faith in the invisible hand the Chardonnay drinkers of Manhattan and latte swillers north the Housatonic look for the hands of Hillary and Jeffords to set their vacation policies Before Ceasar the Roman Republic was a bit like the American Republic before Roosevelt People took their vacations according to tradition consensus the giveand take of the market family obligations and so forth But when the Republic gave way to an empire the operating principle changed too Emperors began to determine the character of life by decree Power shifted from the clans and families of Republican Rome to the tyrants of Imperial Rome Neither the Frankish kings Richelieu nor Napoleon could resist the lure of Roman power Once a Roman territory France became a kingdom a republic an empire Napoleon actually crowned himself Emperor in a moment of unparalleled absurdity and then a republic again Whatever it called itself France has always continued in the tradition of Imperial Rome Paris is the center of power as was ancient Rome from which laws and roads radiate outward All over France mothers rock their infants to sleep hoping that their children will do well in school and make it into the few grand ecoles in Paris and thence into a government ministry Perhaps they will help set interest ratesor rig bids for Air France contractsor determine vacation policies However much they might retard progress they will earn a good living and enjoy the feeling of superiority that you get from being inside the beltway at the center of power In America things are not so different But at least we all know the regulators are morons And women do not wish a bureaucratic job upon their infants Instead they imagine them as respectable professionals lawyers doctors or university professors or if they cant make it into the professions as successful businessmen Yet in America the idea of an invisible hand is widely known and widely accepted This is not because more people have read Adam Smith it is because the intellectual traditions of the US are different While Nero and Caligula were proclaiming holidays persecuting enemies murdering relatives and destroying the economyproviding bread and circuses to the Roman mobsand otherwise acting like modern American democrats the Saxon tribes on the north cost of Germany were already developing a system of evolved rules which would become know as common law Rather than relying upon a written legal code such as the Roman lawwhich was the basis for the Napoleonic Code common law was an attempt by judges and juries to find the essential principles that allowed people to go about their business without doing too much harm to one another Once a principle was discovered subsequent judges would continue to refine it and apply it until it was replaced by a better one No decrees or edictsno centers of powerno bureaucrats were necessary This common law tradition in which people decide for themselves when to work and when to take a holiday or how much to charge for a pound of potatoes or how high short term interest rates should be was exported to America as well as to the other AngloSaxon colonies Tis a pity it exists in todays

him out of his misery Mr Deshais had remarked last week Somehow the duckling survived at least while it was enclosed in a protected space But now it is out in the fowl yard with about other ducks none of whom have ever heard the parable of the Good Samaritan nor ever seen a handicap parking space The deformed duckling was still alive when we left last night But nature will take her course There are also four little pigs in the sty We bought them at a neighbors farm just after they were old enough to be separated from their mother They were cute too rooting around in the yard Of course adult animals can be attractive too with the right sauce Pierre spent Sunday afternoon fixing his hay rake Every year it is the same thing he told me I drive along then I hear a clacking noise It is not too bad at first so I wait But it gets worse and worse Then by the time I decide to stop the tractor and check the noise ceases So I dont worry about it Of course then I notice that the rake isnt working

of that With all this racket how will we know when the economy is really breaking down It is hard enough to see what is in front of our very eyes let alone what is coming around the bend Is the

going towards the clear skies of economic growth full employment and per year stock market growth No need to consult a map nor even to look out the window Alan Greenspan is at the throttle Hes wearing

is no need to alarm the passengers This train is bound for glory after all Get on board nowor youll be left behind With effortless adjustments to shortterm interest rates so the thinking goes as Doug Noland put it in a recent bulletin central bankers have both the skill and capacity to orchestrate positive and enduring effects to financial markets while stimulating just the right amount of additional demand to perpetuate a noninflationary US economic boom With the Fed able and more than willing to ward off any financial difficulty or economic slowdown the only thing to fear is fear itself It is too late for business Already fearful business is cutting back Employees are being laid off New projects are being shelved at least until excess inventories are sold off Thank God for the consumer With industry already in a slump explains an article at SF Gate the only thing that that has kept the nation out of recession has been the willingness of consumers to dig into their pockets

can handle Amid the clatter of news and facts is a whisper of what is being called consumer stress Credit counselors report a increase in business this year over last Bankruptcies are increasing as noted above Consumers seem to be maxing out their ability to borrow and spend In April for example people spent billion more than they earned How long can this go on What the Fed cant do it wont do It cant erase inventories or turn a bad business into a good one Nor can it wave a wand and make consumers debt balances disappear What the Fed can do lower the Fed funds rateand increase liquidity it can be counted on to do The funds rate can go to zero and in real terms below zero Will a funds rate of zero prevent stocks from regressing to the mean Will it light a fire under productivity and GDP growth Who knows But in Japan it had no such effects And liquidity It has to go somewhere is the popular expression But it might well go to rebuilding consumer savings accountsor offsetting deflationary consequences of a stock market meltdownor yes dear reader even to increasing the price of bread houses and movie tickets There were those many and famous who urged investors to buy tech stocks and dotcoms a year ago But only half the population the upper half by income got to take advantage of this advice Consumers with more modest incomes or perhaps better sense did not get a chance

cannot do might nevertheless happen Alan Greenspan if nothing else is famously lucky It was his great luck to step onto the Engine at the Fed reserve switchyard after Paul Volcker had sharply raised

lottery numbers were being handed out couldnt you have gotten out of it Didnt you have polio or something Stanley had had polio as a child and walked with a limp Hell no I didnt tell them about the polio Besides I didnt want to be sitting around here with my thumbs up my bleep while everybody else was getting their themselves shot up Of course it was different back then I walked along the beach where Stanley must have come ashore I tried to imagine what it was like The Germans reinforced concrete bunkers are still there They still look massive impregnable and unassailable How could anyone have gotten to safety across the open beach and up the sandy bluff And yet they did By the end of the day on June there were troops on the continent As Hitler remarked The God of War has gone over to the other side The God of War had indeed changed allegiance Rommel in charge of the German defense west of the Seine committed suicide His successor Kluge followed in his footsteps shooting himself a few months later Less obedient to the God of War was von Choltitz in charge of the German garrison in Paris Hitler ordered him to destroy the city But von Choltitz may have been in Paris too long He disobeyed orders He surrendered Paris intact The American cemetery at Omaha Beach is the setting of the first and last scenes of Saving Private Ryan As in the film there were a number of WWII vets wandering among the crosses and stars of David Like the father in the Rockwell painting they wore baseball caps often with indicators of their military affiliations and bore the creases of age and hardship Accompanied by younger relatives they walked slowly reverentially Most were very friendly and open relaxed as Americans tend to be One older guy seemed to be stunned though It was as though he was trying so hard to recall something that he had forgotten where he was and what he was doing I wondered what they were thinkingand what memories they brought with them And how things could have changed so muchso that even though these events happened during their lifetimes it is as if they happened a thousand years ago I thought too about how all the great changes and challenges of our

What could be simpler to understand or more elegantly stated And yet dear reader that is how the world works simply elegantly and incomprehensibly As inferred from my notes above Elizabeth has joined

culture and beauty We make such a perfect teamas if designed to fit together by natureor God himself Elizabeth chose a play for us last night God Only Knows written by a fellow named Whitemore which promised cultural and intellectual enrichment The play opens with a discussion of the LTCM hedge fund debacle of the late s You will recall that LTCM blew up after its Nobel prize winners miscalculated the odds on certain very risky investment strategies Things that were supposed to once inabillionyears events actually happened within a couple years after the hedge fund began operating People just want to believe that they can do the impossible explains one of the characters on stage They want to feel they can do what youre not supposed to be able to do The two couples relaxing one evening while on vacation in Italy are interrupted by the arrival of another Englishmana man on the run Who is he What is he running from What has he done It develops that the man is a scholar Humphry Biddulph who has been working on some old documents in Rome Into his hands has come a particularly explosive piece of paper a letter from a Roman senator written years AD The letter whose authenticity is uncertain reveals that the Senators grandfather had participated in what if true would have been the biggest con of all time He claims that the Romans staged the resurrection of Jesus by getting a lookalike to pose as the Nazarene after the crucifixion Why would the Romans do such a thing Because they found it difficult to keep their subject populations Jews Gauls Britons Levantines Aramatheans under control To a group of people who were the enemy of so many other groups Love Thine Enemy had an appealing ring And so according to the letter writer the Romans conspired to pull off the greatest scam in history creating a phony resurrection for the man who preached turning the other cheek And what a spectacular success The martyred Jesus was a big hit bigger than Che or Abraham Lincoln Within a few centuries Constantine made Christianity the religion of the Empire Now the sandal was on the other foot For the Holy Roman Catholic church to which your editor pretends membership then began to persecute nonbelievers and suppress contrary opinion But what does this have to do with youwhat are you afraid of asks one of the vacationers Ah glad you asked I made the nearly fatal mistake explained the man on the run of revealing the letter to a Roman Catholic priest Dont you see he continues If the letter is authentic no resurrection No resurrection and the whole of Christianity rests on a lie The owner of the letter died in a mysterious car crash days later And now they are out to get our hero Humphry Biddulph Dont you see dear reader Whitmore spends the second half of the play telling us that Christianity is all a big lie And that the Roman Catholic church has been ruthlessly suppressing the truth for years Jesus could not have been born when they say he was born explains Biddulp and there is no historical evidence for the massacre of the innocents Besides Herod was dead years before Jesus was supposedly born And the Virgin Birth Completely made up The word used in the original testaments meant young woman which was mistranslated into Greek as virgin And the doctrine of transubstantiation and the Holy Trinity celibacy and Papal Infallibility all of it invented by the Roman Catholic Churchand all of it nonsense Faith he continues spitting out the words is just an excuse for cowardice and irresponsibility People dont want to face up to the truth If only The Truth were so easily faced Blabbery Trotskyites and selfassured playwrites could produce reams of it enough to overwhelm whatever secrets might be hidden in Vatican vaults But truth is as hard to suppress as it is to disclose Even in the st Century truth does not expose herself readily She hides as easily in a mountain of information as a desert of ignorance Even in this Information Age dear reader there are questions for which the World Wide Web hath no answers and problems for which not even the worlds best known public servant since Pilate hath no solutions And for every tiny fragment of truth some bloody fool went bankrupt and madwas crucified by his own hand and now rants in some particularly sweaty corner of Hell The vacationers offer only token resistance Religion is very useful says one without it there would be moral anarchy I dont care what you say says another I still believe What a pity It would have been such a better play if the others had put up a good fight Catholic scholars and bible thumpers alike have been arguing with these points for centuries Theyve become very good at it What that play needs is a good Jesuit Elizabeth remarked More tomorrowon God

because I know it interests you as it does me If stocks do not have to fall in price we could buy the big names of the SP even at times earnings Maybe they would rise higherand stay higherforever Stock prices rise from time to time as if on an irregular unpredictable ocean tide Waves of bullishness rise upbetween troughs of despairand crash into the rocky shoreline No matter how high the waves nor how low the tide might ebb sooner or later as Jeremy Grantham reminds us stock prices regress to sea level The memory of man runneth not to the contrary Theory confirms experience in this case as in others After all Why should investors be willing to pay more for a dollar of earnings this year than they were years ago Why would they settle for a return of on one investment when they could get on another Stocks are nothing more than partial ownership of businesses People rarely buy businesses for fun They buy them for the income they will produce and let the price of shares rise and fall along with business earnings Over time share prices tend to risebut only in line with increased and accumulated earnings If there were no competition and no alternatives businesses might increase profit margins year after year But that would be a different world than the one we live in Without alternatives there would be no stock market and no decisions for an investor to make As it is competition holds profits down and directs investors money so as force all investment profits down to the same sea level of returns adjusted for risk and other variables Over time an article in this

<25754021.1075845229835.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,stkscape@agoramail.net,2001-06-08 13:05:16,Volatile Vulnerable Volcanic AND VALUABLEHpst By following these recent option plays YOU could have pocketed sweet profits like in weeks with Microsoft calls in months with Comex calls And in weeks with NASDAQ Internet Index calls Or on Swiss francs in only weeks You could have done even better with these stock picks in months on Ballard Power in four months with Ashton Mining In the coming months youll have a chance to make even more Much more Dear Daily Reckoning Reader Bluntly speaking in the next two years more people are going to get killed in the market than are going to make a killing If youve spent any time in the market you know it has changed dramatically since and right now its super volatile The US economy is vulnerable Many investors are frightened They are retreating to Tbills CDs and cash Frankly for many investors thats not a bad move Theyll do better than the folks who stick with the index funds and the typical mutual funds But for those who understand what the market is doing where the smart money is going what sectors will remain strong no matter what the economy does have longstanding heavyhitting industry contacts and have experience at making profits in a bear market the next couple of years could be the most profitable ever Im writing to you today to help you join a small group of investors who recently took advantage of a serious bottleneck in the oil services sector to position themselves for a profit in just days And they expect to make even more Another strategy they used grabbed profits in seven months on a power company in three months on a burgeoning mining company in six months on an oil gas pick in four months on a diamond company and more You see long before the bear started mauling the NASDAQ it tore up mining oil and other real assets Resource stocks got killed But thats over now The bear has moved out And now that were seeing instability in the US economy massive layoffs and diminishing confidence in the dollar hard assets are making an impressive rebound A cursory look at the headlines of your local paper tells the story Fact is were sitting on the cusp of a major longterm bull move in resources and assets with no end in sight Fortunately because of the damage over the last few years these stocks are still at bargain prices Experienced investors who get the market right and pick the winning companies can make more money faster in this sector than any other All while the average portfolio gets gutted like a house on the tail end of a fouralarm blaze Last year a wellknown mining company was selling for over That company owns of a rich property a deposit that contains almost million ounces of gold and billion pounds of copper But right now nobody cares The stock is selling for about two bucks But get this it has more than of cash a share in the bank and thats on top of the mineral assets People were willing to pay a year ago for a company that didnt have the assets it now has for Most investors still are more interested in tech stocks with no assets Amazing isnt it If you buy this company now while this sector is on the way back up you get it at a discount to the cash on hand and they practically throw the mine in for free The way I see it you cant go wrong If somebody wants to give me a gold mine Ill take it And obviously I think that you should too But almost nobody is paying much attention to this gold mine giveaway As usual the Wall Street analysts ignore these tiny undervalued gems until they really take off But what do we care We get there first while no one is watching And pick up the profits With mining shares now at mere fractions of their highs and at even smaller fractions of what most analysts would consider fair value you have a chance to reap huge returns But and this part is crucial you have to get in right away because the bull market in natural resources is taking off now Were seeing a longterm bull market for natural resources ahead Some of these stocks will easily go up even in a few weeks sometimes in a few days Extraordinary Buying Opportunities While you may recognize me and my advisory service Outstanding Investments from comments Bill Bonner has made in The Daily Reckoning Im writing to tell you about an entirely different and unique companion service Ive developed one that could be especially valuable to you in the volatile months ahead its called the Resource Trader Alert The Resource Trader Alert is an exceptional email and fax service specifically designed for investors who want to take advantage of fastmoving opportunities and more speculative investments And because they move fast and are a little riskier they are potentially much more profitable Let me give you an example In the early s Canadas Northwest Territories experienced a tremendous rush of diamond explorers Many of them were hoping to cash in on a few area plays on the heels of an earlier major discovery in the region Predictably a few years later most of the excesses were gone This left Resource Trader Alert subscribers with an opportunity to buy up Ashton Mining at bargain prices It began when we sent a team out to complete a technical review of Ashtons initial exploration and discovery results in northern Alberta We liked what we saw Though the company still had a lot of drilling to do and a little more to prove before we considered mentioning the stock in Outstanding Investments we felt comfortable enough to recommend Ashton as a speculative buy to Resource Trader Alert subscribers at a share Four months later Ashtons share price topped out at over a share an increase of But the key was getting in at a good price Taking a position in a stock at its earliest most speculative stage can only be accomplished with a service like Resource Trader Alert Some Have Called Me A Teen Stock Geek Not that I mind This volatile market has thrown many investors for a loop Even the pros Mutual funds have hit the toilet but of course many of them are run by yearold geniuses These guys cant even see a bear when it bites them and believe me theyve been bitten I like to think Im of a different breed of analyst altogether I was investing in the market when most kids were collecting s or baseball cards My father CV Myers was one of the original gold bugs he taught me the difficult lessons of investing the ones most investors never learn before I even learned to drive On one score I bought gold bullion at an ounce That was back in By the time it hit in I was dying to sell I had already tripled my investment But dad said No It was a fundamental rule you dont sell if the fundamentals that made you money are still intact By the time Id made five times my investment the profits were practically burning a hole in my pocket I wanted to sell My had become a fortune at the time Especially for an eager young buck like me But ol CV said to hold on You never know the ultimate top of a stock until its past And that means you have to sell below that peak when the investment begins to fall The loss from the summit is often a pittance compared to the gains earned during a long ascent Still I was dying to sell at in fact all the way up And by gold peaked at over But honestly there was no way to tell whether this was the top or not Like today the US economy was in a quagmire Fed chief Paul Volker decided it was time to shore up the weak dollar Gold slipped and failed to make a new high By the time it hit my dad issued an allout sell signal and cashed in I used the tidy fortune to buy a house with my fiance Angie And learned a powerful lesson about investing Its even more important to know when to sell than it is when to buy Experience Pays Off In a market where most fund managers tend to be under and have never seen a bear market or recession before I bring to the table over years of experience This is a definite plus to investors who seek to turn their hardearned dollars into moneymaking opportunities fast Whats more living across the border in Canada gives me a unique insiders insight into the US market and allows me to keep close contacts with the companies in the natural resource sector that is so dominant in Canada the second benefit I bring to readers of The Daily Reckoning and subscribers of the Resource Trader Alert In the market I see impressive opportunities in small and micro cap stocks some call them penny shares and also in stock options Both offer the aggressive investor a shot at making big returns QUICKLY You Could Have Made In Two Weeks When news breaks it can make you money fast if you know how to play it On Nov I issued an alert with news of the United Nations agreeing to pay Iraq for oil in euros instead of dollars That coupled with the presidential stalemate signaled an end to the greenbacks hegemony over energy I smelled an opportunity to cash in on the weakness in the dollar I offered Resource Trader Alert readers a way to harness this trend for quick gains I wont go into all the details here but simply put readers jumped on an easy way to do a bull call option spread with the dollar against the Swiss franc Dont worry if youre not an expert on options While this may sound like a complicated speculation that only huge investment houses and central bankers make it couldnt be more straightforward Ive reduced it to a simple call to your broker But for now all you need to know is that this picks limited our subscribers risk and offered possible
