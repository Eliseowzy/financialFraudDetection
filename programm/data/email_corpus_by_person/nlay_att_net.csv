Sent Friday October AM Subject Fw Personal Testimony of George Bush Personal Testimony of George Bush From George W Bush Actually the seeds of my decision had been planted the year before by the Reverend Billy Graham He visited my family for a summer weekend in MaineI saw him preach at the small summer church St Anns by the Sea We all had lunch on the patio overlooking the ocean One evening my dad asked Billy to answer questions from a big group of family gathered for the weekend He sat by the fire and talked And what he said sparked a change in my heart I dont remember the exact words It was more the power of his example The Lord was so clearly reflected in his gentle and loving demeanor The next day we walked and talked at Walkers Point and I knew I was in the presence of a great man He was like a magnet I felt drawn to seek something different He didnt lecture or admonish he shared warmth and concern Billy Graham didnt make you feel guilty he made you feel loved Over the course of that weekend Reverend Graham planted a mustard seed in my soul a seed that grew over the next year He led me to the path and I began walking It was the beginning of a change in my life I had always been a religious person had regularly attended church even taught Sunday School and served as an altar boy But that weekend my faith took on a new meaning It was the beginning of a new walk where I would commit my heart to Jesus Christ I was humbled to learn that God sent His Son to die for a sinner like me I was comforted to know that through the Son I could find Gods amazing grace a grace that crosses every border every barrier and is open to everyone Through the love of Christs life I could understand the life changing powers of faith When I returned to Midland I began reading the Bible regularly Don Evans talked me into joining him and another friend Don Jones at a mens community Bible study The group had first assembled the year before in Spring of at the beginning of the downturn in the energy industry Midland was hurting A lot of people were looking for comfort and strength and direction A couple of men started the Bible study as a support group and it grew By the time I began attending in the fall of almost men would gather We met in small discussion groups of ten or twelve then joined the larger group for full meetings Don Jones picked me up every week for the meetings I remember looking forward to them My interest in reading the Bible grew stronger and stronger and the words became clearer and more meaningful We studied Acts the story of the Apostles building the Christian Church and next year the Gospel of Luke The preparation for each meeting took several hours reading the Scripture passages and thinking through responses to discussion questions I took it seriously with my usual touch of humor Laura and I were active members of the First Methodist Church of Midland and we participated in many family programs including James Dobsons Focus on the Family series on raising children As I studied and learned Scripture took on greater meaning and gained confidence and understanding in my faith I read the Bible regularly Don Evans gave me the oneyear Bible a Bible divided into daily readings each one including a section from the New Testament the Old Testament Psalms and Proverbs I read through that Bible every other year During the years in between I pick different chapters to study at different times I have also learned the power of prayer I pray for guidance I do not pray for earthly things but for heavenly things for wisdom and patience and understanding My faith gives me focus and perspective It teaches humility But I also recognize that faith can be misinterpreted in the political process Faith is an important part of my life I believe it is important so I live my faith not flaunt it America is a great country because of our religious freedoms It is important for any leader to respect the faith of others That point was driven home when Laura and I visited Israel in We had traveled to Rome to spend Thanksgiving with our daughter who was attending a school program there and spent three days in Israel on the way home It was an incredible experience I remember waking up at the Jerusalem Hilton and opening the curtains and seeing the Old City before us the Jerusalem stone glowing gold We visited the Western Wall and the Church of the Holy Sepulcher And we went to the Sea of Galilee and stood atop the hill where Jesus delivered the Sermon on the Mount It was an overwhelming feeling to stand in the spot where the most famous speech in the history of the world was delivered the spot where Jesus outlined the character and conduct of a believer and gave his disciples and the world the beatitudes the golden rule and the Lords Prayer Our delegation included four gentile governorsone Methodist two Catholics and a Mormon and several JewishAmerican friends Someone suggested we read Scripture I chose to read Amazing Grace my favorite hymn Later that night we all gathered at a restaurant in Tel Aviv for dinner before we boarded our middleofnight flight back to America We talked about the wonderful experiences and thanked the guides and government officials who had introduced us to their country And toward the end of the meal one of our friends rose to share a story to tell us how he a gentile and his friend a Jew had unbeknownst to the rest of us walked down to the Sea of Galilee joined hands underwater and prayed together on bended knee Then out of his mouth came a hymn he had known as a child a hymn he hadnt thought about in years He got every word rightNow is the time approaching by prophets long foretold when all shall dwell together One Shepherd and one fold Now Jew and gentile meeting from many a distant shore around an altar kneeling one common Lord adore Faith changes lives I know because faith has changed mine I could not be governor if I did not believe in a divine plan that supersedes all human plans Politics is a fickle business Polls change Todays friend is tomorrows adversary People lavish praise and attention Many times it is genuine sometimes it is not Yet I build my life on a foundation that will not shift My faith frees me Frees me to put the problem of the moment in proper perspective Frees me to make decisions that others might not like Frees me to try to do the right thing even though it may not poll well The death penalty is a difficult issue for supporters as well as its opponents I have a reverence for life my faith teaches that life is a gift from our Creator In a perfect world life is given by God and only taken by God I hope someday our society will respect life the full spectrum of life from the unborn to the elderly I hope someday unborn children will be protected by law and welcomed in life I support the death penalty because I believe if administered swiftly and justly capital punishment is a deterrent against future violence and will save other innocent lives Some advocates of life will challenge why I oppose abortion yet support the death penalty To me its the difference between innocence and guilt Today two weeks after Jebs inauguration in my church in downtown Austin Pastor Mark Craig was telling me that my reelection was the first Governor to win backtoback fouryear terms in the history of the State of Texas It was a beginning not an end People are starved for faithfulness He talked of the need for honesty in government He warned that leaders who cheat on their wives will cheat their country will cheat their colleagues will cheat themselves Pastor Craig said that America is starved for honest leaders He told the story of Moses asked by God to lead his people to a land of milk and honey Moses had a lot of reasons to shirk the task As the Pastor told it Moses basic reaction was Sorry God Im busy Ive got a family Ive got sheep to tend Ive got a life Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the sons of Israel out of Egypt The people wont believe me he protested Im not a very good speaker Oh my Lord send I pray some other person Moses pleaded But God did not and Moses ultimately did His bidding leading his people through forty years of wilderness and wandering relying on God for strength and direction and inspiration People are starved for leadership Pastor Craig said starved for leaders who have ethical and moral courage It is not enough to have an ethical compass to know right from wrong he argued America needs leaders who have the moral courage to do what is right for the right reason Its not always easy or convenient for leaders to step forward he acknowledged Remember even Moses had doubts He was talking to you my mother later said The pastor was of course talking to all of us challenging each one of us to make the most of our lives to assume the mantle of leadership and responsibility wherever we find it He was calling on us to use whatever power we have in business in politics in our communities and in our families to do good for the right reason And his sermon spoke directly to my heart and my life There was no magic moment of decision After talking with my family during the Christmas holidays then hearing this rousing sermon to make most of every moment during my inaugural church service I gradually felt more comfortable with the prospect of a presidential campaign My family would love me my faith would sustain me no matter what During the more than half century of my life we have seen an unprecedented decay in our American culture a decay that has eroded the foundations of our collective values and moral standards of conduct Our sense of personal responsibility has declined dramatically just as the role and responsibility of the federal government have increased The changing culture blurred the sharp contrast between right and wrong and created a new standard of conduct If it feels good do it and If youve got a problem blame somebody else Individuals are not responsible for their actions the new culture has said We are all victims of forces beyond our control We have gone from a culture of sacrifice and saving to a culture obsessed with grabbing all the gusto We went from accepting responsibility to assigning blame As government did more and more individuals were required to do less and less The new culture said if people were poor the government should feed them If someone had no house the government should provide one If criminals are not responsible for their acts then the answers are not prisons but social programs For our culture to change it must change one heart one soul and one conscience at a time Government can spend money but it cannot put hope in our hearts or a sense of purpose in our livesBut government should welcome the active involvement of people who are following a religious imperative to love their neighbors through after school programs child care drug treatment maternity group homes and a range of other services Supporting these men and women the soldiers in the armies of compassion is the next bold step of welfare reform because I know that changing hearts will change our entire society During the opening months of my presidential campaign I have traveled our country and my heart has been warmed My experiences have reinvigorated my faith in the greatness of Americans They have reminded me that societies are renewed from the bottom up not the top down Everywhere I go I see people of love and faith taking time to help a neighbor in need These people and thousands like them are the heart and soul and greatness of America And I want to do my part I am running for President because I believe America must seize this moment America must lead We must give our prosperity a greater purpose a purpose of peace and freedom and hope We are a great nation of good and loving people And together we have a charge to keep Please Spread this around on the Internet it will never be published by the biased news media The Internet serves notice that the fourth estate no longer has an exclusive control over what is published for the people to see and hear Steve
