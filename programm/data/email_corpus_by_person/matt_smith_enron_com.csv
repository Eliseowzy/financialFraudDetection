<5316140.1075844014254.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,matt.smith@enron.com,2001-01-17 11:19:00,Synthetic StorageIm building a sheet for each person specifically for financial hedging Each day it will pull in the previous days position and previous day price curve to calculate the mark to market Then that days transactions can be entered to calculate the P L of transactions which close out previous positions as well as to calculate the new open positions Initially I thought that daily PL could be calculated by simply adjusting the PL whenever a transaction was made by the difference between the bidoffer of the closed out position by the offerbid of the new position of course time value and storage costs would be included However this only works if the person is hedged meaning they do not have any open positions which require marking As the seller of synthetic storage utilizing hedging I should be able to do this except for the fact that I will have size limits on transactions that will probably leave me open here and there The main question I have is simply Should I be calculating the PL for each persons storage book for open and closed positions Then beyond that if we do calculate the PLs from the buyer side it seems that if their storage is not hedged I will have to develop the market value of the storage in the ground and the remaining capacity to mark to market it So I guess I could apply the model for that purpose Does this make sense to you Any comments are appreciated Thanks Mat

<1918783.1075844004936.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,matt.smith@enron.com,2001-01-17 11:19:00,Synthetic StorageIm building a sheet for each person specifically for financial hedging Each day it will pull in the previous days position and previous day price curve to calculate the mark to market Then that days transactions can be entered to calculate the P L of transactions which close out previous positions as well as to calculate the new open positions Initially I thought that daily PL could be calculated by simply adjusting the PL whenever a transaction was made by the difference between the bidoffer of the closed out position by the offerbid of the new position of course time value and storage costs would be included However this only works if the person is hedged meaning they do not have any open positions which require marking As the seller of synthetic storage utilizing hedging I should be able to do this except for the fact that I will have size limits on transactions that will probably leave me open here and there The main question I have is simply Should I be calculating the PL for each persons storage book for open and closed positions Then beyond that if we do calculate the PLs from the buyer side it seems that if their storage is not hedged I will have to develop the market value of the storage in the ground and the remaining capacity to mark to market it So I guess I could apply the model for that purpose Does this make sense to you Any comments are appreciated Thanks Mat
