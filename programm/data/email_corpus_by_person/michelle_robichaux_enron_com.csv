on AM James D ES AM To Jeff NRON cc Catherine ES Subject Re More Inquiries From CA PUC re Switching customers back to LDC Good Morning Jeff Catherine is out of the office until Tuesday Not wanting to keep you waiting for a reply I thought it best to give you some feedback immediately The great majority of CADs customers in CA are core CAD does not knowingly terminate any current customer prior to their expiration date The reasons why CADs customers are turned back to the utility are as follows Upon receiving renewal pricing from the CAD rep the customer chooses to return to the utility Understanding that the current minimum margin per meter for our customers is approximately those customers that have extremely low annual volumes are sent attrition letters and turned back to the LDC at the end of their contract We cannot competitively price this type of customer versus the utility and extract enough margin to support them Currently in the California markets PGE SDGE SOCAL there exists approximately customers that have usages so low that given current market conditions we will not choose to renew the contracts The expiration dates for these are between and The customer initiates a request for termination prior to the end of their contractual expiration date As we are all aware California customers specifically those with either an index or NYMEX product experienced a large swing in their pricing during the past few months CAD has been inundated with customers requesting to be returned to their LDC Although we seek to satisfy our customer to the best of our ability returning these customers to the utility is the LAST thing we want to do The steps we have taken to address this issue is to a work with customer servicecredit to offer extended payment options to ease the effect of the increase b offer to restructure the customers contract and reprice the customer on a fixed price product minimizing their risk going forward c explain to the customer in more detail the reasons why this has occurred and how going forward the indexNYMEX pricing has eased Should you have additional questions please reply or call Jim From Jeff NRON on PM CST Sent by

nronXGate Mike D ES Subject More Inquiries From CA PUC re Switching customers back to LDC Greetings Recall that about weeks we got a call from a CA PUC staffer asking whether wed switched a particular gas customer or two back to the LDC We looked into it and discovered that wed mistakenly switched the customer back due to a mix up about the fact that the customer had two active meters behind two different utilities We informed the PUC staffer of the mixup and explained that the situation would be resolved The questions from the staffer arose because the CA PUC made a bad decision a couple of months ago When gas prices ran up at the California border a lot of large noncore customers attempted to switch back to the utility tariff in the hope of lowering gas costs In response SoCalGas filed with the Commission asking the PUC to prohibit customers from switching back The Commission agreed and put the prohibition in place The Commission is now concerned that if suppliers terminate their contracts with customers for whatever reason or choose not to renew the contracts when they expire customers wont have the option of returning to LDC service Today I received a letter from the President of the Commission asking me to respond to the following Have you stopped selling and delivering natural gas to any noncore customers with whom you have an existing procurement contract ornotified any of your noncore customers that you do not intend to renew an existing natural gas commodity procurement contract If your company has stopped or intends to stop serving noncore customers the CPUC also needs to know how many contracts you have terminated or expect to terminate the natural gas volumes involved the location of the noncore customers the reasons your company intends or has already acted to terminate those contracts Theres a good chance that the letter from the President of the Commission is linked to the fact that weve recently switched our electricity customers back to utility service in California Prior to deciding whether and how to respond to the Commissioner Im trying to get handle on whether were resourcing any gas retail customers to the utility prior to expiration choosing not to renew contracts once theyve expired etc Catherine or Jim Foster can you help out Thanks Best Jeff
