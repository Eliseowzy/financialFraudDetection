Rasmussen Dale Thompson Peter J Subject RE LV Cogen Turbine Contracts Jim Lisas point is valid It was confusing to get everything other than technical information for the bo contract coordinated Others had that responsibility Be that as it may her questions set before you in her e mail need to be answered Peter Thompson should get responses to those questions to coordinate and amend into the GE BO contract as should Lisa Bills Her general comments that follow below are comments that Peter Thompson can incorporate now Im not sure if thats clear to everyone But that is the case I called Lisa to ask And Id also like to propose that any revision to the BO contract going forward be clearly defined and tracked with a rev number and datetime so that no confusion exists as to what version is going around I would also suggest that each revision carry a description of what was added and where the add or change originated I apologize if it sounds like Im telling people how to do their job

Kay nron Subject LV Cogen Turbine Contract Rose and I have reviewed the contract Peter sent to us yesterday the draft distributed on April Rose has already provided our comments to Peter on the Override Letter which accompanies the contract I have one big issue which the lawyers cant answer as it is a business decision No one seems sure if Bill is the acting originator for this contract or not I leave it up to the LV Cogen Origination team to decide However until I receive word back from the appropriate person and see my changes reflected in the turbine contract Finance has not signed off on this agreement so it cannot be executed on ENexts behalf What is the per UNIT turbine purchase amount The Purchase Amount is a remaining total balance outstanding In Payment Schedule the payment amount is a lump sum However in the nd para of Cancellation and in Retention Letters of Credit for example each UNIT is discussed There needs to be an allocation of the Purchase Amount and Payment Amount on a per turbine basis so Finance can track these costs as such in case a change order is made to only one turbine or if a turbine is removed from ENext prior to all turbines being removed Also how does anyone know for when the last per Turbine is supposed to be paid so we can retain it Also I would appreciate receiving a clarification of why we dont define the Purchase Amount as the total and not just the balance remaining It could create discrepancies in the document and for anybody reading the document trying to understand how much each turbine costs ENext has already made the approx mm payments made todate However if someone were to pick up the document to find out how much they could buy the turbines for it would appear to be mm not the Maximum Liability Amount of mm nd para of refers to the portion of the Purchase Amount to be adjusted upon cancellation However Exhibit I Cancellation refers to the Unit Liability Amount as the basis for calculation this seems inconsistent to me Now for the general comments Section and need to change places to be alphabetically correct calls for a payment to be made on April Exhibit I Cancellation also has a line for cancellation between March and April This will need to be amended as this payment wasnt made given no contract execution yet As everyone knows also ENext must be the party to make this payment to insure the correct accounting treatment is another place where a per Unit price is discussed for increases or decreases How is this possible with an aggregate Purchase Amount In all Notice sections please delete co Las Vegas Cogeneration II LLC This project is not associated with the ENext financing Please underline Optional Delivery Point Please delete the in its after the proviso The timing of

Rasmussen Dale Thompson Peter J Subject RE LV Cogen Turbine Contracts Jim Lisas point is valid It was confusing to get everything other than technical information for the bo contract coordinated Others had that responsibility Be that as it may her questions set before you in her e mail need to be answered Peter Thompson should get responses to those questions to coordinate and amend into the GE BO contract as should Lisa Bills Her general comments that follow below are comments that Peter Thompson can incorporate now Im not sure if thats clear to everyone But that is the case I called Lisa to ask And Id also like to propose that any revision to the BO contract going forward be clearly defined and tracked with a rev number and datetime so that no confusion exists as to what version is going around I would also suggest that each revision carry a description of what was added and where the add or change originated I apologize if it sounds like Im telling people how to do their job

Kay nron Subject LV Cogen Turbine Contract Rose and I have reviewed the contract Peter sent to us yesterday the draft distributed on April Rose has already provided our comments to Peter on the Override Letter which accompanies the contract I have one big issue which the lawyers cant answer as it is a business decision No one seems sure if Bill is the acting originator for this contract or not I leave it up to the LV Cogen Origination team to decide However until I receive word back from the appropriate person and see my changes reflected in the turbine contract Finance has not signed off on this agreement so it cannot be executed on ENexts behalf What is the per UNIT turbine purchase amount The Purchase Amount is a remaining total balance outstanding In Payment Schedule the payment amount is a lump sum However in the nd para of Cancellation and in Retention Letters of Credit for example each UNIT is discussed There needs to be an allocation of the Purchase Amount and Payment Amount on a per turbine basis so Finance can track these costs as such in case a change order is made to only one turbine or if a turbine is removed from ENext prior to all turbines being removed Also how does anyone know for when the last per Turbine is supposed to be paid so we can retain it Also I would appreciate receiving a clarification of why we dont define the Purchase Amount as the total and not just the balance remaining It could create discrepancies in the document and for anybody reading the document trying to understand how much each turbine costs ENext has already made the approx mm payments made todate However if someone were to pick up the document to find out how much they could buy the turbines for it would appear to be mm not the Maximum Liability Amount of mm nd para of refers to the portion of the Purchase Amount to be adjusted upon cancellation However Exhibit I Cancellation refers to the Unit Liability Amount as the basis for calculation this seems inconsistent to me Now for the general comments Section and need to change places to be alphabetically correct calls for a payment to be made on April Exhibit I Cancellation also has a line for cancellation between March and April This will need to be amended as this payment wasnt made given no contract execution yet As everyone knows also ENext must be the party to make this payment to insure the correct accounting treatment is another place where a per Unit price is discussed for increases or decreases How is this possible with an aggregate Purchase Amount In all Notice sections please delete co Las Vegas Cogeneration II LLC This project is not associated with the ENext financing Please underline Optional Delivery Point Please delete the in its after the proviso The timing of
