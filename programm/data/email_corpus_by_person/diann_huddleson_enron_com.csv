office on Friday due to other issues at SCE Let me know if you thi nk I should go to San Francisco from here to meet with the lawyers Page m e if you need to visit FromRobert C nronXgate on PM ToJanet R ES Lamar ES Andrew WuHO ES James D nronXgate Kevin ES Rona ld ES ccVicki ES Richard B nronXgate Mark E H nronXGate Lisa nronXgate Michael Tribole nronXgate Wanda nronXgate Diann ES SubjectEES Billing Issues Privileged and Confidential AttorneyClient Communication This is to recap our discussion today about two billing issuesrecoupment of the PX Credit and the surcharge I would appreciate it if those of you with more firsthand information particularly Wanda and Diann correct or clarify anything Ive misstated Also please forward this to anyone e lse with an interest in this matter A Recoupment of the PX Credit also known as the Negative CTC Background The issue here relates to the fact that PGE and SCE are no longer reflecting credit balances on the bills for our customers P rior to our returning the customers to bundled service in March the bills would reflect the PX Credit as an offset to TD charges SCE and PGE have now removed the PX Credit from the bill and are attempting to charge us fo r TD despite the fact that they owe us hundreds of millions of dollars in PX Credits The PX credit has been replaced with the PE credit so we are receiving an energy credit just not calculated the same way as the PX This is potentially harmful particularly in view of the opinion of perhaps three of the Commissioners that the PX Credit can only be collected as a bi ll credit and not in cash Mike Day our regulatory lawyer expressed his strong opinion that removing the Credit from the bills was improper and t hat we should challenge the action by making a filing with the CPUC Note the PX Credit to which I am referring here is that which accrued to prior to December the utilities do not dispute that a PX Credit accrue d during that time frame and there is no dispute as to the proper methodol ogy for computing the PX Credit for that time frame Furthermore PGE and SCE are in virtual agreement with us as to the amount of the Credit that h ad accrued as of December Action ItemsIssues a With respect to SCE Legal is evaluatin g filing a suit in federal court versus filing at the CPUC The CPUC has a process whereby we could prevent the utilities from disconnecting our cust omers while the issue is being determined by depositing the payments in an interestbearing account controlled by the CPUC while there is no equiva lent procedure in federal court one can request that the court enter an in junction against the utilities disconnecting customers While the analysi s is worth doing I suspect that we will conclude that we have to go to the CPUC for relief b With respect to PGE the banruptcy team is evaluat ing whether to file at the CPUC or in bankruptcy court Timing Late fees will begin accruing August I will need to c onfirm when late fees will begin accruing SCE late charges are calcuated at of total owing The first disconnect notices would not be received until September Disconnect notices will be directed to Enron not the c ustomer PGE will begin demanding payment before SCE Effect on other CTC issues Pursuing action at the CPUC or in cour t to force the utilities to restore the PX Credit to our bills has no eff ect on the issues of how the CTC should be calculated postJanuary and prospectively Both utilities are providing a credit PE at this time I t is their methodology we are disputing B Surcharge Backgound Although when provisionally imposed in January the surcharge went to the utilities to keep them financially solvent when ma de permanent in March it became dedicated to defray the DWRs purchases of power on behalf of the utilities This evolution gives rise to two bases f or EES to argue that it should not bear the financial burden of the sur charge First since the surcharge is now dedicated to purchasing gene ration for bundled customers only and not direct access customers direct access should not have to pay it This is the same logic that caused the C PUC to exempt direct access customers from the surcharge Secondly if legitimately applied to direct access because it is of no dir ect benefit to direct access customers it arguably can only be viewed as a tax Under EESs contracts with its customers taxes assessed at the del ivery point are borne by the customer Note SCE unlike PGE may not im pose the surcharge on direct access customers according to a filing ma de at the staff level at the CPUC so this action may relate to PGE only SCE is NOT imposing the surcharge as it is credited back to us in the PE credit Action ItemsIssues a Regulatory Jim Steffes has the lead i n advising us about a challenge to the application of the surcharge to direct access customers at the CPUC It may be advisable for an industry g roup rather than Enron to make the filing b I would expect that we wou ld follow the same procedure outlined abovedepositing the payment with th e CPUCto prevent any customer from being disconnected In the interim we would likely bill the customer for the surcharge and promise a credit if o ur challenge to the application of the surcharge to DA customers is success ful c A decision will need to be made on how far we go backto July w hen the customers became DA again or to January when the surcharge was fi rst imposed Timing Same timeframe as with the Recoupment issue since we will need to have CPUC challenge on file to prevent late fees and disconnect no tices Effect on other CTC issues Regulatory Jim Steffes will analyze with the appropriate people the effect if any of taking this position on other CTC issues principally how CTC should be calculated postJanuary and prospectively CTCs have not been collected since the PX prices wen t out of control last year It is the Procured Energy Credit we need to ch allenge End
