for a good cause Finally your cancelled check to the National MS Society will serve as your tax receipt Please send me an email if you have any questions Below is my story if you wish to read more Prologue Should I do it or not This was a question that had to be answeredand soon This question had been lurking in the back of my mind since Id already seen some gnarly bike crashes before and Ive heard all the nasty stories about them So I was basically reluctant to do so but I was obviously curious about it and so I had mixed feeling altogether I jumped on the internet for some perspective and discovered the pros and cons I figured if I did happen to be involved in a pileup then Id be sorry In the end I did it In the tradition of cycling I decided to shave my legs Day One miles My alarm sounded off at and I jumped out of bed quickly dressed and threw my gear into my Jeep and hit the road The MS ride started at am And with riders participating my goal was to avoid as much traffic as possible Thankfully the team I rode with Sun Ski Sport started in the number two position bp the corporate sponsor started off the race It should be noted that my ride started at Tully Stadium Dairy AshfordI as opposed to Rhodes Stadium located in Katy and so an extra miles were immediately tacked on From my POV this days ride was no different from any other I did in the preceding weeks other than the fact that it was longer by about miles After the start and once the crowd thinned out I got into my groove after pulling over for a quick relief stop and stayed within my own and kept a moderate speed with a high cadence The sun was above the clouds but while en route a large dark menacing cloud seemed to head my direction but thankfully it amounted to nothing and the cloud cover remained most of the day I admit my goal was to get to LaGrange as soon as possible without exerting too much energy early on In order to do this I avoided the official reststops as much as possible When I did pull in for a snack or to refill my CamelBack with water it was a long wait as there were a few hundred people at each stop At my first stop I misplaced my cyclometer I removed it from my bike so that no one would steal it I got off my bike stretched my legs and loaded up on liquids and oranges On my way back to my bike I noticed my cyclometer was neither in my hand nor in my jersey So I went back to the food table and asked the volunteers if theyd seen it they had not and I looked in the nearby trashcans No luck Now I was disappointed but I put it behind me On my way back to my bike I SAW IT ON THE GROUND Whew So back on the road After a few more rest stops to stretch and liquidload and even more roadside relief stops I arrived in Bellville for lunch With my goal in mind I quickly ate and hit the road again The ride became more scenic but my body began to get restless namely my back neck and rear end The sun broke the through the clouds and I began to sweat profusely To wipe away the sweat I used my pedal partner bandana My partner is someone named Kathryn who has MS The point of the program is to get to know this person and let them know that I was able to do what they could not because of the disease There were lots of spectators in LaGrange and the campsite was not far the from city limits edge The crowds lined the road for a mile After I arrived at I checked in my bike went to the Sun Ski team tent got my clothes took a cool shower this was awesome ate lunch and waited for a massage I was obviously tired and tried to get a nap in but with the sun up it was difficult to do Eventually I pulled The Sun Also Rises from my bag and began to read randomly its one of my favorite books I woke up an hour later feeling much better By this time its around oclock and the sun is still up so I wandered the campgrounds ate some more and visited friends on other teams Once the DJ closed shop and the staff began to make room for people to sleep I setup camp in a quiet corner of the tent stretched as much as possible and went to sleep My times on this day from Houston to Bellville for lunch from Bellville to LaGrange Total time Day Two miles No alarm was necessary on this day because the portable generators all seemed to fire up around the same time It was hard to get out of bed but I eventually did I had to load my gear fill my CamelBack stretch and wait in line for the start By I was at the back of the pack and I did not like this From this vantage I would not leave Bellville until after oclock I followed a misfit gang that tried to go another route to exit the campgrounds but while doing so a pppsssttt sound came from my rear tire That sounds means only one thing a flat tire I went to the repair tent and found that the tire was slicedeither the tire was damaged or I walked over some glass The repair line was short and was the damage for a new tube and tire On the bright side I was closer to the start and got out on the road much earlier than I anticipated Overall my body wasnt too tired and my legs felt okay The night before I stretched frequently took gobs of Advil and rested as much as possible I feared day two the most because word was out that the route had lots of hills and miles is no easy task I deliberately started off slow just to get the blood flowing and to loosen up the muscles miles had past and I was fine I had to decide by mile whether to go the hilly route Bastrop State Park or bypass it entirely I talked to a few riders about it and chose to do the hills At mile was the entrance to the park and a rest area I loaded up on liquids and decided to get a quick massage at the medical tent A rider told me he did this the day before and felt much better afterwards And so I was on the park course and the hills were short and steep The reward for climbing these hill was a welldeserved coast on the other side Then another hill And anotheret cetera This was the case for about miles The last hill was the most difficult The burn in my thighs and rear was more evident but I kept going My goal for this segment was to not stop Many others did but I went to my lowest gear and grinded it out After the last hill was the home stretch Lunch was minutes away at Bastrop HS I was psychologically confident at this point since I only had miles left and the hard part was behind me Upon immediate and postrace reflection I determined that the ride through the state park was the best part of the ride It had everything shade cooler air no wind hills and a thinner road in which to maneuver It required me to focus relax and strategize on how to approach each hill Although I consider myself a beginner biker I think I graduated to the intermediate level after than experience I still felt okay after the hills since I stretched quite well during lunch But I was back on the road because Austin was not going to get any closer with me staying in LaGrange I stopped at one rest area and pulled over another time Soon afterward the Austin was in sight Only more miles I was at my own pace when a rather large peloton passed by I decided to get onboard and kept with it for about miles They were pedaling faster than I could keep up and I admit it took a lot out of me I knew the finish was near but my legs began to falter The final miles was made up of more hills but it was the final stretch Many bikers were in their lowest gear including myself The path narrowed to about since we were in the city and this made for dangerous conditions on the hills There is always a reckless biker who is interested in speed only and unfortunately there was one such person near me who would pass me on the downhill at high speed but I would pass him on the uphill Because of him I nearly had a spill He came a little too close on a downhill We exchanged a few words and I deliberately slowed to let him pass Jerk And the crowds were there in Austin cheering us on One more dip and hill and the finish line was near Could this be the end It was I took my final picture of the finish line and was thankful that I finished I rarely go to Austin but when I do its on a bike Funny huh Now Im hungry very hungry but I need to check in at the Sun Ski tent claim my luggage shower and then finally eat To do this took about hours because of the many other people wanting to do the same thing I probably ate too many cookies but my appetite was very strong and I didnt care what I ate at this point The Hooters chicken sandwich was not enough to satisfy my hunger but the two Shiners I had satisfied my thirst It was time to go home so I claimed my bus ticket loaded my bags and boarded the bus with my pillow The people on board had lots of enthusiasm as we exchanged stories and experiences This lasted for about an hour and we all seemed to fall asleep at the same time I woke up with lots of drool on my pillow and felt a little better Food was on my mind again and by this point I just wanted to be at home in my bed We pulled into Tully Stadium I claimed my bike drove home and went to sleep My times on this day from LaGrange to Bastrop for lunch from LaGrange to Austin Total time TOTAL BIKING TIME including lunches

for a good cause Finally your cancelled check to the National MS Society will serve as your tax receipt Please send me an email if you have any questions Below is my story if you wish to read more Prologue Should I do it or not This was a question that had to be answeredand soon This question had been lurking in the back of my mind since Id already seen some gnarly bike crashes before and Ive heard all the nasty stories about them So I was basically reluctant to do so but I was obviously curious about it and so I had mixed feeling altogether I jumped on the internet for some perspective and discovered the pros and cons I figured if I did happen to be involved in a pileup then Id be sorry In the end I did it In the tradition of cycling I decided to shave my legs Day One miles My alarm sounded off at and I jumped out of bed quickly dressed and threw my gear into my Jeep and hit the road The MS ride started at am And with riders participating my goal was to avoid as much traffic as possible Thankfully the team I rode with Sun Ski Sport started in the number two position bp the corporate sponsor started off the race It should be noted that my ride started at Tully Stadium Dairy AshfordI as opposed to Rhodes Stadium located in Katy and so an extra miles were immediately tacked on From my POV this days ride was no different from any other I did in the preceding weeks other than the fact that it was longer by about miles After the start and once the crowd thinned out I got into my groove after pulling over for a quick relief stop and stayed within my own and kept a moderate speed with a high cadence The sun was above the clouds but while en route a large dark menacing cloud seemed to head my direction but thankfully it amounted to nothing and the cloud cover remained most of the day I admit my goal was to get to LaGrange as soon as possible without exerting too much energy early on In order to do this I avoided the official reststops as much as possible When I did pull in for a snack or to refill my CamelBack with water it was a long wait as there were a few hundred people at each stop At my first stop I misplaced my cyclometer I removed it from my bike so that no one would steal it I got off my bike stretched my legs and loaded up on liquids and oranges On my way back to my bike I noticed my cyclometer was neither in my hand nor in my jersey So I went back to the food table and asked the volunteers if theyd seen it they had not and I looked in the nearby trashcans No luck Now I was disappointed but I put it behind me On my way back to my bike I SAW IT ON THE GROUND Whew So back on the road After a few more rest stops to stretch and liquidload and even more roadside relief stops I arrived in Bellville for lunch With my goal in mind I quickly ate and hit the road again The ride became more scenic but my body began to get restless namely my back neck and rear end The sun broke the through the clouds and I began to sweat profusely To wipe away the sweat I used my pedal partner bandana My partner is someone named Kathryn who has MS The point of the program is to get to know this person and let them know that I was able to do what they could not because of the disease There were lots of spectators in LaGrange and the campsite was not far the from city limits edge The crowds lined the road for a mile After I arrived at I checked in my bike went to the Sun Ski team tent got my clothes took a cool shower this was awesome ate lunch and waited for a massage I was obviously tired and tried to get a nap in but with the sun up it was difficult to do Eventually I pulled The Sun Also Rises from my bag and began to read randomly its one of my favorite books I woke up an hour later feeling much better By this time its around oclock and the sun is still up so I wandered the campgrounds ate some more and visited friends on other teams Once the DJ closed shop and the staff began to make room for people to sleep I setup camp in a quiet corner of the tent stretched as much as possible and went to sleep My times on this day from Houston to Bellville for lunch from Bellville to LaGrange Total time Day Two miles No alarm was necessary on this day because the portable generators all seemed to fire up around the same time It was hard to get out of bed but I eventually did I had to load my gear fill my CamelBack stretch and wait in line for the start By I was at the back of the pack and I did not like this From this vantage I would not leave Bellville until after oclock I followed a misfit gang that tried to go another route to exit the campgrounds but while doing so a pppsssttt sound came from my rear tire That sounds means only one thing a flat tire I went to the repair tent and found that the tire was slicedeither the tire was damaged or I walked over some glass The repair line was short and was the damage for a new tube and tire On the bright side I was closer to the start and got out on the road much earlier than I anticipated Overall my body wasnt too tired and my legs felt okay The night before I stretched frequently took gobs of Advil and rested as much as possible I feared day two the most because word was out that the route had lots of hills and miles is no easy task I deliberately started off slow just to get the blood flowing and to loosen up the muscles miles had past and I was fine I had to decide by mile whether to go the hilly route Bastrop State Park or bypass it entirely I talked to a few riders about it and chose to do the hills At mile was the entrance to the park and a rest area I loaded up on liquids and decided to get a quick massage at the medical tent A rider told me he did this the day before and felt much better afterwards And so I was on the park course and the hills were short and steep The reward for climbing these hill was a welldeserved coast on the other side Then another hill And anotheret cetera This was the case for about miles The last hill was the most difficult The burn in my thighs and rear was more evident but I kept going My goal for this segment was to not stop Many others did but I went to my lowest gear and grinded it out After the last hill was the home stretch Lunch was minutes away at Bastrop HS I was psychologically confident at this point since I only had miles left and the hard part was behind me Upon immediate and postrace reflection I determined that the ride through the state park was the best part of the ride It had everything shade cooler air no wind hills and a thinner road in which to maneuver It required me to focus relax and strategize on how to approach each hill Although I consider myself a beginner biker I think I graduated to the intermediate level after than experience I still felt okay after the hills since I stretched quite well during lunch But I was back on the road because Austin was not going to get any closer with me staying in LaGrange I stopped at one rest area and pulled over another time Soon afterward the Austin was in sight Only more miles I was at my own pace when a rather large peloton passed by I decided to get onboard and kept with it for about miles They were pedaling faster than I could keep up and I admit it took a lot out of me I knew the finish was near but my legs began to falter The final miles was made up of more hills but it was the final stretch Many bikers were in their lowest gear including myself The path narrowed to about since we were in the city and this made for dangerous conditions on the hills There is always a reckless biker who is interested in speed only and unfortunately there was one such person near me who would pass me on the downhill at high speed but I would pass him on the uphill Because of him I nearly had a spill He came a little too close on a downhill We exchanged a few words and I deliberately slowed to let him pass Jerk And the crowds were there in Austin cheering us on One more dip and hill and the finish line was near Could this be the end It was I took my final picture of the finish line and was thankful that I finished I rarely go to Austin but when I do its on a bike Funny huh Now Im hungry very hungry but I need to check in at the Sun Ski tent claim my luggage shower and then finally eat To do this took about hours because of the many other people wanting to do the same thing I probably ate too many cookies but my appetite was very strong and I didnt care what I ate at this point The Hooters chicken sandwich was not enough to satisfy my hunger but the two Shiners I had satisfied my thirst It was time to go home so I claimed my bus ticket loaded my bags and boarded the bus with my pillow The people on board had lots of enthusiasm as we exchanged stories and experiences This lasted for about an hour and we all seemed to fall asleep at the same time I woke up with lots of drool on my pillow and felt a little better Food was on my mind again and by this point I just wanted to be at home in my bed We pulled into Tully Stadium I claimed my bike drove home and went to sleep My times on this day from LaGrange to Bastrop for lunch from LaGrange to Austin Total time TOTAL BIKING TIME including lunches
