important issue for TWP I hope that Sarah can be there but if she cant is there another person in addition to yourself Assuming Prabat joins Shudeish we had anticipated this as the first step particularly because we would like to resolve this with the firstline regulators for longterm good relations Steve Burr will be cheering us on from the sidelines to the extent he is consulted If the first meeting is a stonewall we then have to go to Cathy and Nancy but lets make the first effort with Shudeish Prabat A couple of thoughts ADEQ was required to give a completeness notice within days of the application at the latest altho this time frame may not have been met it may have been because of followup questions on the netting calculation Also was there any discussion whether any of the following applied a Facility change allowed wo permit revision R b Minor permit revision RA which could shorten EPA review time and possibly avoid a public hearing c Accelerated processing RN These may have been hashed out in preapplication meetings and water under the bridge now particularly because it appears that ADEQ is viewing these as NEW permits compare the numbers on DEQs completeness determination letters with the numbers on the permit revision applications but the story of net benefits to air quality as well as the need to improve energy supply to California should be persuasive factors to get this back to head of the line as you had been told in the spring It may be that Shudeish and Prabat need to be reminded of the benign nature of this equipment changeover Bottom line I think you should go forward Thursday if that is the only day available this week It is important that TWP know what barriers stand in the way of prompt evaluation and that TWP offer what assistance it can in overcoming those barriers It is important also that ADEQ understand that there are a number of actions that TWP wants to initiate in order to meet the project schedule that it had developed last spring when it received initial assurances of prompt review can you send me that list If Shudeish and Prabat are to be barriers it is important to know as soon as possible so we can start moving up the chain There are in fact a number of energy projects gearing up in Arizona now and the Corporation Commissions Facility Siting Committee is taking a proenvironment bent following the Calif AQMDs

impossibility Can we take this to the next step then to carefully walk through the netting calculations Shudeish Prabhat are doing this to minimize the total emissions that can occur potential to emit at any one time The way I read the existing permits however is that allowable and unenforceable bec of grandfathering emissions are NOx is tpy and CO is tpy at each station which may mean that we can not characterize these as minor sources If the netting calculation is such that we can avoid New Source Review I believe this to be the case bec there is planned to be a new reduction we can do the construction activities and try to get a fasttrack permit approval I still do not whether as a technical matter the applications could qualify as minor revisions under RA which mean Do not violate any applicable requirement Do not involve substantive changes to existing monitoring reporting or recordkeeping requirements in the permit Do not require or change a casebycase determination of an emission limitation or other standard or a sourcespecific determination of ambient impacts or a visibility or increment analysis Do not seek to establish or change a permit condition for which there is no corresponding underlying applicable requirement and that the source has assumed in order to avoid an applicable requirement to which the source would otherwise be subject The terms and conditions include a A federally enforceable emissions cap that the source would assume to avoid classification as a modification under any provision of Title I of the Clean Air Act and b An alternative emisssions limit approved under regulations promulgated under CAA sec i Are not modifications under and provision of Title I of the CAA Are not changes in fuels not represented in the permit application or provided for in the permit The increase in the sources potential to emit is not significant tpy NOx etc not applicable to TWP bec net reduction Are not required to processed as a significant revision under R refers to signif change in existing monitoring terms or relaxation of reportingrecordkeeping or does not qualify as a minor permit revision If someone could make a hard analysis of the foregoing that might provide us additional strength Van Wolf PM Van the old units and new unit at each station cannot run simultaneously There is only so much gas in the line leading to each station and there is a limit to the discharge pressure If we tried to start the new unit with the old units running the suction pressure would decrease significantly and the discharge pressure would increase automatically shutting down all units rather quickly Even if it was physically possible we would be literally spinning our wheels with no benefit burning fuel with no increase in throughput Ill be happy to explain this to Ms Wrona tomorrow Thanks Jerry Original Message From Van Wolf ENRON mailtoIMCEANOTESVanWolfCvwolfswlawEcomE NRON com Sent Wednesday September PM To Eisenstein Arnold L Pribble Dan Martin Jerry D Shafer John Campbell Larry Soldano Louis Melton Richard Jensen Ruth Kendrick William Subject Red RockADEQ Nancy Wrona meeting I just met with Steve Burr ADEQ Special Counsel to discuss options and develop a strategy to rush the permit issuance schedule andor allow significant construction to begin before actual issuance of the permit He will attend the meeting tomorrow by teleconf because he thinks it would help if both of us attended as there are legal issues He spoke with Prabhat yesterday and both he and Prabhat believe this is a good project that should go forward expeditiously but ADEQ must stick with its rules and policy interpretations Nonetheless there appears to be a way to reinterpret the application possibly to be a minor revision The key will be assure that during the construction period and the transition period as well as operating procedures all of the equipment that could operate at the same time does not have the potential to emit contaminants in excess of tons per year tpy For the meeting with Nancy someone I assume it will be Larry will need to be acutely familiar with the details of the permits revisions applications to be able to walk this through with Prabhat Shudeish I can review this as well in order to discuss it with Steve but we will need to make sure we have our technical ducks all lined up In that sense the appropriate person should please review the Ariz air rules at RA minor revision to Class I source permit and R definition of major source esp subsec c to avoid new source review Let me know if I need to fax these to anyone but they may also be on the ADEQ website wwwadeqstateazus For policy reasons ADEQ needs to limit prepermit construction because otherwise it would be subject to political pressure from sources with sunk capital costs For TWPs purposes the key is to keep the total potential to emit at each station below tpy to avoid New Source Review I am out of my legal depth here and need technical assistance the permit applications seem to indicate an increase in NOx and CO as well as a decrease in the same section see sec on Nettingas well as being subject to New Source Review sec there may some language in the applications that is somewhat misleading the netting calculation is going to be important The concern will be whether the old reciprocating compressors and the new turbine can all operate at the same time so as to result in significantly excess emissions Are there operating end enforceable restrictions that would prohinbit operation of equipment that would cause emissions in excess of what currently allowed If the permit revisions can be recharacterized as minor either there are no restrictions on immediate commencement of all contruction only seven days notice required or the allowable construction is that set forth in Ariz law at ARS which would allow installation of building supports and foundations laying of underground pipework and construction of permanent storage structures It appears that sitedeliveries could occur but I am not sure about tieins I am somewhat skeptical that we can get a complete minor revision approach because I think this is a major source and the emissions limitations are significant We may with the netting be able to avoid NSR and get construction but we will need technical analysis to be creative as to how the revisions set up the equipment changes and in particular whether we can screw down the operating procedures and transition to limit the potential to emit Thus it will also be important to try to get a faster permit reviewapproval schedule We agreed that TWPs negotiating period will be quick EPA needs a day review but can we get submittals to EPA now these revisions are essentially the same as for Stations which EPA is about to approve and get a faster indication of no objections from EPA I sense Burr wants to help us come up with creative solutions and I believe this will be Nancys intent as well Please let me know what further I can do from this end to prepare for tomorrows meeting I will have the conference room ready for a premeeting strategy session Van

creative interpretations of the DEQ rules were not necessary as Jerry and Nancy hammered out a very datespecific sequence for the permit approval activities as well as clarifying the facilityrelated activities he can do before actual permit issueance Likely date for permit issuance is by Friday November but this will depend upon EPA cooperation in shortening its maximum time allowed for review and assuming no substantive public comments Following is first draft of thankyou letter to Nancy from Jerry edit freely HAND DELIVERY Nancy Wrona Director Air Quality Division North Central Avenue th floor Phoenix Arizona Re Transwestern Pipeline Permits No Schedule for Permits Issuance Dear Ms Wrona Thank you again for your significant assistance in detailing a specific strategy to complete the process to review and approve the two permit revisions for the Transwestern Pipeline compressor stations near Kingman and Flagstaff We were impressed with your willingness and ability to focus on the practical approach to improving Arizonas air quality as promptly as possible Working with you and your team of Cathy OConnell and Prabhat Barghava gave our team from Enron Transportation Services and Transwestern Pipeline Company TWP a strong sense of accomplishment and cooperation Following is the schedule that we detailed for subsequent activities By Friday morning October Prabhat and Shudeish Mahadev will have completed the draft permits on Friday afternoon October the ADEQ team including Prabhat and Cathy OConnell will conduct the internal review and the TSD by close of business Friday October ADEQ will email the draft permits revisions to the TWP team Bill Kendrick Larry Campbell and me our contact numbers and email addresses are listed on the attached sheet On Tuesday morning October at am Phoenix time there will be a callin conference call between the ADEQ and the TWP teams for final review negotiation and agreement on the terms and conditions of the draft permits revisions By Thursday October or Friday October ADEQ will do first publication in the daily newspapers in Mohave and Coconino Counties of the day public comment period and day notice of a public hearing at TWPs request for both permits revisions in Williams AZ Toward meeting the agreedupon permits revisions schedule TWP hereby requests a hearing on each revision pursuant to RE and asks that ADEQ include the required notices of hearing in all notices of the publics opportunity to comment pursuant to RC and ARS sec A Second publication will occur a week later We will research and confirm the mechanics for getting the notices published as soon as possible after the Tuesday October conference call ADEQ will promptly prepare the form of notice unless you wish TWP to do it On Tuesday November ADEQ will conduct the public hearing on the two permit revisions in Williams AZ We have found nothing in the statutes or rules that would prevent having backtoback hearings for the Kingman and Flagstaff facilities permits revisions in the same place Promptly after the October conference call that finalizes the draft permits revisions ADEQ will send the drafts to EPA Region IX to commence EPAs review TWP will confer with the EPA contacts to shorten the maximum days allowed so that EPA will complete its review on or before Thursday November EPA will promptly notify ADEQ of its approval On the assumption that neither the public hearing nor the EPA review generated any substantive comments that require further review ADEQ will issue the permits revisions by Friday November We recognize that the foregoing schedule will require significant cooperation among all parties as well as working closely with EPA but we are confident based upon yesterdays meeting that all of us from ADEQ and from TWP are committed to making this doable schedule work The TWP team will promptly convey to ADEQ all materials it receives relating to the EPA permits revisions for the Leupp and Klagetoh facilities We also appreciated your clarification of the facilitiesrelated activities that we can proceed with prior to final permits issuance Specifically since there will be no emissions impacts from the routine maintenance of replacing equipment and making the srubbers tieins TWP can proceed with those activities at the Kingman and Flagstaff sites Additionally we can proceed with the offsite fabrication of piping We also understand that at the time of the first newspaper notices we will post the appropriate signs at each facility duplicating the newspaper notices Again thank you very much for your assistance in setting up the foregoing schedule and procedures It is a real pleasure working together to improve Arizonas air quality Sincerely yours Jerry D Martin cc Cathy OConnell Prabhat Bhargava Steve Burr Van Wolf I will aim to get this letter out the door by midday Friday Van The information contained in this electronic mail message is confidential information intended only for the

important issue for TWP I hope that Sarah can be there but if she cant is there another person in addition to yourself Assuming Prabat joins Shudeish we had anticipated this as the first step particularly because we would like to resolve this with the firstline regulators for longterm good relations Steve Burr will be cheering us on from the sidelines to the extent he is consulted If the first meeting is a stonewall we then have to go to Cathy and Nancy but lets make the first effort with Shudeish Prabat A couple of thoughts ADEQ was required to give a completeness notice within days of the application at the latest altho this time frame may not have been met it may have been because of followup questions on the netting calculation Also was there any discussion whether any of the following applied a Facility change allowed wo permit revision R b Minor permit revision RA which could shorten EPA review time and possibly avoid a public hearing c Accelerated processing RN These may have been hashed out in preapplication meetings and water under the bridge now particularly because it appears that ADEQ is viewing these as NEW permits compare the numbers on DEQs completeness determination letters with the numbers on the permit revision applications but the story of net benefits to air quality as well as the need to improve energy supply to California should be persuasive factors to get this back to head of the line as you had been told in the spring It may be that Shudeish and Prabat need to be reminded of the benign nature of this equipment changeover Bottom line I think you should go forward Thursday if that is the only day available this week It is important that TWP know what barriers stand in the way of prompt evaluation and that TWP offer what assistance it can in overcoming those barriers It is important also that ADEQ understand that there are a number of actions that TWP wants to initiate in order to meet the project schedule that it had developed last spring when it received initial assurances of prompt review can you send me that list If Shudeish and Prabat are to be barriers it is important to know as soon as possible so we can start moving up the chain There are in fact a number of energy projects gearing up in Arizona now and the Corporation Commissions Facility Siting Committee is taking a proenvironment bent following the Calif AQMDs

impossibility Can we take this to the next step then to carefully walk through the netting calculations Shudeish Prabhat are doing this to minimize the total emissions that can occur potential to emit at any one time The way I read the existing permits however is that allowable and unenforceable bec of grandfathering emissions are NOx is tpy and CO is tpy at each station which may mean that we can not characterize these as minor sources If the netting calculation is such that we can avoid New Source Review I believe this to be the case bec there is planned to be a new reduction we can do the construction activities and try to get a fasttrack permit approval I still do not whether as a technical matter the applications could qualify as minor revisions under RA which mean Do not violate any applicable requirement Do not involve substantive changes to existing monitoring reporting or recordkeeping requirements in the permit Do not require or change a casebycase determination of an emission limitation or other standard or a sourcespecific determination of ambient impacts or a visibility or increment analysis Do not seek to establish or change a permit condition for which there is no corresponding underlying applicable requirement and that the source has assumed in order to avoid an applicable requirement to which the source would otherwise be subject The terms and conditions include a A federally enforceable emissions cap that the source would assume to avoid classification as a modification under any provision of Title I of the Clean Air Act and b An alternative emisssions limit approved under regulations promulgated under CAA sec i Are not modifications under and provision of Title I of the CAA Are not changes in fuels not represented in the permit application or provided for in the permit The increase in the sources potential to emit is not significant tpy NOx etc not applicable to TWP bec net reduction Are not required to processed as a significant revision under R refers to signif change in existing monitoring terms or relaxation of reportingrecordkeeping or does not qualify as a minor permit revision If someone could make a hard analysis of the foregoing that might provide us additional strength Van Wolf PM Van the old units and new unit at each station cannot run simultaneously There is only so much gas in the line leading to each station and there is a limit to the discharge pressure If we tried to start the new unit with the old units running the suction pressure would decrease significantly and the discharge pressure would increase automatically shutting down all units rather quickly Even if it was physically possible we would be literally spinning our wheels with no benefit burning fuel with no increase in throughput Ill be happy to explain this to Ms Wrona tomorrow Thanks Jerry Original Message From Van Wolf ENRON mailtoIMCEANOTESVanWolfCvwolfswlawEcomE NRON com Sent Wednesday September PM To Eisenstein Arnold L Pribble Dan Martin Jerry D Shafer John Campbell Larry Soldano Louis Melton Richard Jensen Ruth Kendrick William Subject Red RockADEQ Nancy Wrona meeting I just met with Steve Burr ADEQ Special Counsel to discuss options and develop a strategy to rush the permit issuance schedule andor allow significant construction to begin before actual issuance of the permit He will attend the meeting tomorrow by teleconf because he thinks it would help if both of us attended as there are legal issues He spoke with Prabhat yesterday and both he and Prabhat believe this is a good project that should go forward expeditiously but ADEQ must stick with its rules and policy interpretations Nonetheless there appears to be a way to reinterpret the application possibly to be a minor revision The key will be assure that during the construction period and the transition period as well as operating procedures all of the equipment that could operate at the same time does not have the potential to emit contaminants in excess of tons per year tpy For the meeting with Nancy someone I assume it will be Larry will need to be acutely familiar with the details of the permits revisions applications to be able to walk this through with Prabhat Shudeish I can review this as well in order to discuss it with Steve but we will need to make sure we have our technical ducks all lined up In that sense the appropriate person should please review the Ariz air rules at RA minor revision to Class I source permit and R definition of major source esp subsec c to avoid new source review Let me know if I need to fax these to anyone but they may also be on the ADEQ website wwwadeqstateazus For policy reasons ADEQ needs to limit prepermit construction because otherwise it would be subject to political pressure from sources with sunk capital costs For TWPs purposes the key is to keep the total potential to emit at each station below tpy to avoid New Source Review I am out of my legal depth here and need technical assistance the permit applications seem to indicate an increase in NOx and CO as well as a decrease in the same section see sec on Nettingas well as being subject to New Source Review sec there may some language in the applications that is somewhat misleading the netting calculation is going to be important The concern will be whether the old reciprocating compressors and the new turbine can all operate at the same time so as to result in significantly excess emissions Are there operating end enforceable restrictions that would prohinbit operation of equipment that would cause emissions in excess of what currently allowed If the permit revisions can be recharacterized as minor either there are no restrictions on immediate commencement of all contruction only seven days notice required or the allowable construction is that set forth in Ariz law at ARS which would allow installation of building supports and foundations laying of underground pipework and construction of permanent storage structures It appears that sitedeliveries could occur but I am not sure about tieins I am somewhat skeptical that we can get a complete minor revision approach because I think this is a major source and the emissions limitations are significant We may with the netting be able to avoid NSR and get construction but we will need technical analysis to be creative as to how the revisions set up the equipment changes and in particular whether we can screw down the operating procedures and transition to limit the potential to emit Thus it will also be important to try to get a faster permit reviewapproval schedule We agreed that TWPs negotiating period will be quick EPA needs a day review but can we get submittals to EPA now these revisions are essentially the same as for Stations which EPA is about to approve and get a faster indication of no objections from EPA I sense Burr wants to help us come up with creative solutions and I believe
