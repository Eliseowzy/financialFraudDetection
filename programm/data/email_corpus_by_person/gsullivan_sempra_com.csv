Industry Settlement To signatories to the Comprehensive Settlement ALJ Biren has given us until Friday of this week April to file errata to the Comprehensive Settlement So far I am planning to make the following nonsubstantive changes The table of contents was seriously messed up by an automatic update feature in Word just before we duplicated and filed I will be putting it back to the state you saw in the final draft On p section put a period at the end of the last sentence On p section two thirds of the way down the page I will be changing subject to adjustment annual by the base rate PBR formula to subject to adjustment annually by the base rate PBR formula On p section in the third full paragraph on the page I will be changing If only one customer has an OFO day to If only one customer class has an OFO day Also on p section bottom line on the page I will be filling in the blank with C so it reads Appendix C In the category of maybe substantive On p section three lines from the bottom of the page the date October would be changed to October This sentence refers to including the cost of backbone transmission for core customers buying gas from SoCalGas in the procurement rate Obviously our intent was to do that only once we had unbundled backbone transmission which happens on October In the category of substantive Our capacity term sheet had said that we would unbundled additional nonreliability storage for CTAs effective upon implementation of the settlement See p The filed settlement managed to drop the section that provided for this option for CTAs prior to the principal storage change on April The filed settlement is ok for the period starting April So to be consistent with the term sheet we need to insert something back into the settlement to allow CTAs to opt out of nonreliability storage in the period from the effective date days after approval to April Obviously this may not be a very long period John Leslie has suggested inserting at the very beginning of Section In the partial storage year beginning on the effective date of this Settlement Agreement andcontinue with current text We would need to cover as part of implementation filings the exact mechanismpricing for SoCalGas purchasing gas in storage owned by CTAs if they opt out of nonreliability storage prior to April SoCalGas and SDGE are ok with Johns language and want to make sure it is ok with other signatories If you have any problems with any of these changes please contact me or Brian Cherry by noon on Friday April My email is and my phone is Brians email is
