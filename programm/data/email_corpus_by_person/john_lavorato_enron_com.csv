close and when Original Message From Calger Christopher F Sent Monday June AM To Lavorato John Kitchen Louise Cc Hillis Kimberly Schoppe Tammie Subject West Power Orig Update Las Vegas Alleghenys bid was strong but required a financing out for days unacceptable Black Hills bid has a clean purchase and sale markup with a bid that implies a MM gain for ENA MM has to go to Calpers since they are an investor in LV They are going to their board Thursday and want to execute by early next week and close Aug We will try to get a higher bid from Northland this week MM gain They will require a twoweek financing out which they will secure with a MM nonrefundable deposit If we sign with Northland they can close in July In either case accounting may require us to recognize this income this quarter because Las Vegas is a fair market value investment RAC requires a DASH to sell an asset of this size we will circulate on Wednesday or Thursday One long shot deal we are proposing to Allegheny Tear up the existing year toll backed by the Las Vegas project Enter into a year firm energy sale from EPMI at Palo Verde The value of that deal may be in excess of MM since the market has fallen so much If we did that we would have a merchant asset that would have to be sold at or near cost this is achievable This would be significantly riskier than our current plan and would probably require board approval but the value makes it worth exploring AMPS We continue to push Geneva Steel and Oregon Steel for permitting info West power markets have fallen further so the economics are marginal at best Fridays curves suggested a value of MM vs a cost of MM An imperfect put swaption would cost MM further eroding the value I spoke to Brett Wiggs on Friday and forwarded him technical specs and reviewed different deal structures that might work DWR They announced Thursday that they have signed more definitive long term deals that they will honor approx MW long term The nonbinding agreements in principle will be renegotiated because prices have fallen so much DWR signed our Master Agreement for short term deals but Tim does not want to execute it because of litigation risk We will not do anything with them at this time Generator Tolls Interest has fallen off due to rapid drop in power prices We are still talking with parties but I dont think anything will get done soon Munis Mcdonald got a small term sale done at NP with city of Lassen Approx K of orig New Marketing Initiatives Negotiating generator service agreements Mostly small plants coming on line this year The entrepreneurs behind these deals are shell shocked by the low prices but many have already committed capital Montana State forced divestiture of generation Retail load is short starting July Governors office has asked us to bring a MW year solution They are willing to issue a MM bond to prepay and buydown part of the energy The basic play is to swap an EPMI MidC position for an instate position from PPL package that up with some renewables and sell to the state under a prepaid PPA Long shot but interesting CA Industrials A group of industrials want to buy up to MW NP delivered for years as part of a

this project Forwarded by John J LavoratoCorpEnron on PM Beth Perlman ECT AM To John J nron cc Subject Consolidated positions Issues To Do list John We are working with the traders and have pushed the responsibility for building consensus on Phillip Allen I just wanted to keep you in the loop Any assistance that you can offer is greatly appreciated Beth Forwarded by Beth PerlmanHOUECT on AM Richard Burchfield AM To Phillip K CT cc Beth CT Subject Consolidated positions Issues To Do list Phillip Below is the issues to do list as we go forward with documenting the requirements for consolidated physicalfinancial positions and transport trade capture What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allans list the need for a single set of requirements Although the meeting with Keith on Wednesday was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen will be extremely difficult and time consuming Throughout the meeting on Wednesday Keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking much like Excel What needs to happen on Monday from is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen this is critical This does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements Also to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project plan on consolidate physicalfinancial positions and transport trade capture The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to themselves and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this project I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been good I believe there has been good communication between the teams but now we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve Richard Forwarded by Richard BurchfieldHOUECT on AM Allan Severude PM To Richard CT cc Peggy CT Russ CT Scott CT Kenny CT Subject Consolidated positions Issues To Do list From our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated positions I think we still have the following issues We dont have a single point of contact from the trading group Weve had three meetings which brought out very different issues from different traders We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements Were getting hit with a lot of different requests many of which appear to be outside the scope of position consolidation Things left to do I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to make it as clear as possible what were trying to accomplish with this project Itll help determine which requests fall under the project scope Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this project and which fall out of scope For those in scope work to define relative importance priority of each and work with traders to define the exact requirements of each Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen main view and all drill downs Use the above to formulate a project plan Things requested thus far no particular order Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal ticker Customized rows and columns in the position manager ad hoc rowscolumns that add up existing position manager rowscolumns New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by physical transport swaps options Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the realtime values of all curves on which the desk has a position Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be shown directly above monthly positions Each grouped column in the top grid would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid Ability to properly show curve shift for floatforfloat deals determine the appropriate positions to show for each Gas Daily for monthly index Physical gas for Nymex Physical gas for Inside Ferc Physical gas for Mid market Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of using official valuations Position and PL aggregation across all gas desks Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS Inclusion of spread options in our systems Ability to handle volatility skew and correlations Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a gamma grid Valuation of Gas Daily options A new position screen for options months x strike x delta TBD Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position manager Ability to view change deal PL in the TDS deal ticker Show new deal terms prior deal terms and net PL affect of the change Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of individual deals on the position total in a grid cell Benchmark positions in TDS Deployment of TDS in Canada Currency and volume uom conversions Implicit and explicit position break out issues Allan PS Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for transport Hopefully well know much better where that part stands at that point

with the power port calc The same memory allocation issue which I discussed in the message below is not resolved we have had this problem for about four months now Due to business reasons we calculated the east power books on Monday Enron holiday We received all of the required data to calc by AM and should have been completely done by However the calc crashed six times and finally completed on the seventh try We were able to leave by The point I am trying to make is that I feel that we are at such a state that there is risk that we could not provide positions to the traders by the start of the next business day This could have a financial impact on our company Once again I am urgently and desperately asking for resolution of this problem Furthermore it came to my attention on Friday that EES is now using EnPower and the power port calc and they too are using the same server that we are I question this decision since we cannot seem to support the existing business that is using that server Per discussion with Kevin Presto the agreement made regarding EESs use of EnPower was there would be no expense or degradation to ENAs business process I think they need to move

with the power port calc The same memory allocation issue which I discussed in the message below is not resolved we have had this problem for about four months now Due to business reasons we calculated the east power books on Monday Enron holiday We received all of the required data to calc by AM and should have been completely done by However the calc crashed six times and finally completed on the seventh try We were able to leave by The point I am trying to make is that I feel that we are at such a state that there is risk that we could not provide positions to the traders by the start of the next business day This could have a financial impact on our company Once again I am urgently and desperately asking for resolution of this problem Furthermore it came to my attention on Friday that EES is now using EnPower and the power port calc and they too are using the same server that we are I question this decision since we cannot seem to support the existing business that is using that server Per discussion with Kevin Presto the agreement made regarding EESs use of EnPower was there would be no expense or degradation to ENAs business process I think they need to move to another server Please call to discuss when this will be resolved Thank You Kristin Albrecht Forwarded by Kristin AlbrechtHOUECT on AM Enron North America Corp From Kristin Albrecht AM To Beth CT

from us The east power calc crashed out of days last week We usually start calcing at about The calc time is now running at hours and we have about hours worth of work after the calcs successful completion So you do the math on what time my group leaves the building when the calc crashes at Furthermore the West power calc has crashed out of nights weekly for the last weeks This is not acceptable We are about to enter the busiest and most volatile time of the year and our system is not stable I feel like we have been very patient at the expense of many late nights I am going to

responsibility for building consensus on Phillip Allen I just wanted to keep you in the loop Any assistance that you can offer is greatly appreciated Beth Forwarded by Beth PerlmanHOUECT on AM Richard Burchfield AM To Phillip K CT cc Beth CT Subject Consolidated positions Issues To Do list Phillip Below is the issues to do list as we go forward with documenting the requirements for consolidated physicalfinancial positions and transport trade capture What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allans list the need for a single set of requirements Although the meeting with Keith on Wednesday was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen will be extremely difficult and time consuming Throughout the meeting on Wednesday Keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking much like Excel What needs to happen on Monday from is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen this is critical This does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements Also to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project plan on consolidate physicalfinancial positions and transport trade capture The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to themselves and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this project I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been good I believe there has been good communication between the teams but now we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve Richard Forwarded by Richard BurchfieldHOUECT on AM Allan Severude PM To Richard CT cc Peggy CT Russ CT Scott CT Kenny CT Subject Consolidated positions Issues To Do list From our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated positions I think we still have the following issues We dont have a single point of contact from the trading group Weve had three meetings which brought out very different issues from different traders We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements Were getting hit with a lot of different requests many of which appear to be outside the scope of position consolidation Things left to do I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to make it as clear as possible what were trying to accomplish with this project Itll help determine which requests fall under the project scope Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this project and which fall out of scope For those in scope work to define relative importance priority of each and work with traders to define the exact requirements of each Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen main view and all drill downs Use the above to formulate a project plan Things requested thus far no particular order Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal ticker Customized rows and columns in the position manager ad hoc rowscolumns that add up existing position manager rowscolumns New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by physical transport swaps options Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the realtime values of all curves on which the desk has a position Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be shown directly above monthly positions Each grouped column in the top grid would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid Ability to properly show curve shift for floatforfloat deals determine the appropriate positions to show for each Gas Daily for monthly index Physical gas for Nymex Physical gas for Inside Ferc Physical gas for Mid market Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of using official valuations Position and PL aggregation across all gas desks Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS Inclusion of spread options in our systems Ability to handle volatility skew and correlations Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a gamma grid Valuation of Gas Daily options A new position screen for options months x strike x delta TBD Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position manager Ability to view change deal PL in the TDS deal ticker Show new deal terms prior deal terms and net PL affect of the change Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of individual deals on the position total in a grid cell Benchmark positions in TDS Deployment of TDS in Canada Currency and volume uom conversions Implicit and explicit position break out issues Allan PS Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for transport Hopefully well know much better where that part stands at that point

we are also experiencing performance problems with the gas side of the business I met with Sally Becks controllers yesterday and we are putting a plan in place The increased trading volumes have

cannot fix a risk book calculation problem Furthermore how can we effectively grow our volumes and complexity of our power transactions when our back office risk books position management settlements is so unreliable from an IT standpoint In addition we will start losing all of our key people in this area because they are here until every night and pm on holidays This whole issue is a significant business risk for Enron and needs to be dealt with accordingly Please advise Thank you Forwarded by Kevin M PrestoHOUECT on PM Enron North America Corp From Kristin Albrecht AM To Beth CT Randy NRON Jarod CT Christine CT Zhiyong CT Ravi CT Stacey W CT Jenny CT Jenny nron cc Sally CT Kevin M CT Tim CT Subject Power Port Calc Issues The Power risk group continues to experience severe instability with the power port calc The same memory allocation issue which I discussed in the message below is not resolved we have had this problem for about four months now Due to business reasons we calculated the east power books on Monday Enron holiday We received all of the required data to calc by AM and should have been completely done by However the calc crashed six times and finally completed on the seventh try We were able to leave by The point I am trying to make is that I feel that we are at such a state that there is risk that we could not provide positions to the traders by the start of the next business day This could have a financial impact on our company Once again I am urgently and desperately asking for resolution of this problem Furthermore it came to my attention on Friday that EES is now using EnPower and the power port calc and they too are using the same server that we are I question this decision since we cannot seem to support the existing business that is using that server Per discussion with Kevin Presto the agreement made regarding EESs use of EnPower was there would be no expense or degradation to ENAs business process I think they need to move to another server Please call to discuss when this will be resolved Thank You Kristin Albrecht Forwarded by Kristin AlbrechtHOUECT on AM Enron North America Corp From Kristin Albrecht AM To Beth CT Randy NRON Jarod CT Christine CT Zhiyong CT Ravi CT Stacey W CT Jenny CT cc Subject athena vs quark With regards to the message below we must have athena server to run our nightly risk books for the power group We run one of our three east power calcs on this machine the second largest one Since an acceptable solution for the big power calc has not been provided to us athena CANNOT be taken away from us The east power calc crashed out of days last week We usually start calcing at about The calc time is now running at hours and we have about hours worth of work after the calcs successful completion So you do the math on what time my group leaves the building when the calc crashes at Furthermore the West power calc has crashed out of nights weekly for the last weeks This is not acceptable We are about to enter the busiest and most volatile time of the year and our system is not stable I feel like we have been very patient at the expense of many late nights I am going to speak to Kevin Presto and Tim Belden today about these problems I think we need to meet immediately about this problem and I am exhausted with the finger pointing between different IT groups Thanks

project Forwarded by John J LavoratoCorpEnron on PM Beth Perlman ECT AM To John J nron cc Subject Consolidated positions Issues To Do list John We are working with the traders and have pushed the responsibility for building consensus on Phillip Allen I just wanted to keep you in the loop Any assistance that you can offer is greatly appreciated Beth Forwarded by Beth PerlmanHOUECT on AM Richard Burchfield AM To Phillip K CT cc Beth CT Subject Consolidated positions Issues To Do list Phillip Below is the issues to do list as we go forward with documenting the requirements for consolidated physicalfinancial positions and transport trade capture What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allans list the need for a single set of requirements Although the meeting with Keith on Wednesday was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen will be extremely difficult and time consuming Throughout the meeting on Wednesday Keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking much like Excel What needs to happen on Monday from is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen this is critical This does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements Also to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project plan on consolidate physicalfinancial positions and transport trade capture The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to themselves and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this project I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been good I believe there has been good communication between the teams but now we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve Richard Forwarded by Richard BurchfieldHOUECT on AM Allan Severude PM To Richard CT cc Peggy CT Russ CT Scott CT Kenny CT Subject Consolidated positions Issues To Do list From our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated positions I think we still have the following issues We dont have a single point of contact from the trading group Weve had three meetings which brought out very different issues from different traders We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements Were getting hit with a lot of different requests many of which appear to be outside the scope of position consolidation Things left to do I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to make it as clear as possible what were trying to accomplish with this project Itll help determine which requests fall under the project scope Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this project and which fall out of scope For those in scope work to define relative importance priority of each and work with traders to define the exact requirements of each Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen main view and all drill downs Use the above to formulate a project plan Things requested thus far no particular order Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal ticker Customized rows and columns in the position manager ad hoc rowscolumns that add up existing position manager rowscolumns New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by physical transport swaps options Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the realtime values of all curves on which the desk has a position Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be shown directly above monthly positions Each grouped column in the top grid would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid Ability to properly show curve shift for floatforfloat deals determine the appropriate positions to show for each Gas Daily for monthly index Physical gas for Nymex Physical gas for Inside Ferc Physical gas for Mid market Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of using official valuations Position and PL aggregation across all gas desks Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS Inclusion of spread options in our systems Ability to handle volatility skew and correlations Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a gamma grid Valuation of Gas Daily options A new position screen for options months x strike x delta TBD Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position manager Ability to view change deal PL in the TDS deal ticker Show new deal terms prior deal terms and net PL affect of the change Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of individual deals on the position total in a grid cell Benchmark positions in TDS Deployment of TDS in Canada Currency and volume uom conversions Implicit and explicit position break out issues Allan PS Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for transport Hopefully well know much better where that part stands at that point

with the power port calc The same memory allocation issue which I discussed in the message below is not resolved we have had this problem for about four months now Due to business reasons we calculated the east power books on Monday Enron holiday We received all of the required data to calc by AM and should have been completely done by However the calc crashed six times and finally completed on the seventh try We were able to leave by The point I am trying to make is that I feel that we are at such a state that there is risk that we could not provide positions to the traders by the start of the next business day This could have a financial impact on our company Once again I am urgently and desperately asking for resolution of this problem Furthermore it came to my attention on Friday that EES is now using EnPower and the power port calc and they too are using the same server that we are I question this decision since we cannot seem to support the existing business that is using that server Per discussion with Kevin Presto the agreement made regarding EESs use of EnPower was there would be no expense or degradation to ENAs business process I think they need to move to another server Please call to discuss when this will be resolved Thank You Kristin Albrecht Forwarded by Kristin AlbrechtHOUECT on AM Enron North America Corp From Kristin Albrecht AM To Beth CT

from us The east power calc crashed out of days last week We usually start calcing at about The calc time is now running at hours and we have about hours worth of work after the calcs successful completion So you do the math on what time my group leaves the building when the calc crashes at Furthermore the West power calc has crashed out of nights weekly for the last weeks This is not acceptable We are about to enter the busiest and most volatile time of the year and our system is not stable I feel like we have been very patient at the expense of many late nights I am going to

responsibility for building consensus on Phillip Allen I just wanted to keep you in the loop Any assistance that you can offer is greatly appreciated Beth Forwarded by Beth PerlmanHOUECT on AM Richard Burchfield AM To Phillip K CT cc Beth CT Subject Consolidated positions Issues To Do list Phillip Below is the issues to do list as we go forward with documenting the requirements for consolidated physicalfinancial positions and transport trade capture What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allans list the need for a single set of requirements Although the meeting with Keith on Wednesday was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen will be extremely difficult and time consuming Throughout the meeting on Wednesday Keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking much like Excel What needs to happen on Monday from is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen this is critical This does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements Also to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project plan on consolidate physicalfinancial positions and transport trade capture The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to themselves and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this project I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been good I believe there has been good communication between the teams but now we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve Richard Forwarded by Richard BurchfieldHOUECT on AM Allan Severude PM To Richard CT cc Peggy CT Russ CT Scott CT Kenny CT Subject Consolidated positions Issues To Do list From our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated positions I think we still have the following issues We dont have a single point of contact from the trading group Weve had three meetings which brought out very different issues from different traders We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements Were getting hit with a lot of different requests many of which appear to be outside the scope of position consolidation Things left to do I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to make it as clear as possible what were trying to accomplish with this project Itll help determine which requests fall under the project scope Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this project and which fall out of scope For those in scope work to define relative importance priority of each and work with traders to define the exact requirements of each Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen main view and all drill downs Use the above to formulate a project plan Things requested thus far no particular order Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal ticker Customized rows and columns in the position manager ad hoc rowscolumns that add up existing position manager rowscolumns New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by physical transport swaps options Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the realtime values of all curves on which the desk has a position Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be shown directly above monthly positions Each grouped column in the top grid would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid Ability to properly show curve shift for floatforfloat deals determine the appropriate positions to show for each Gas Daily for monthly index Physical gas for Nymex Physical gas for Inside Ferc Physical gas for Mid market Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of using official valuations Position and PL aggregation across all gas desks Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS Inclusion of spread options in our systems Ability to handle volatility skew and correlations Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a gamma grid Valuation of Gas Daily options A new position screen for options months x strike x delta TBD Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position manager Ability to view change deal PL
