<267551.1075853102594.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,shanna.husser@enron.com,2001-08-20 13:21:00,Re Construction Interest moved from R to AI wasnt sure where A was going to fall out in the new world so update on R so some people will be in the know Per conversations with Carrie Chaffin I have learned that all construction interest has been moved off of R and onto A I have received detail of Rs interest income acct SAP The detail confirms that this activity is no longer on R On Rs return we reversed the construction interest income And we had to reduce the depreciation taken on these assets for tax We did this by depreciating the construction interest amount as a negative depreciation This was done to reduce the tax basis being depreciated by the construction interest not recognized for tax I am assuming that we will reverse the construction interest income on A since that is where it is being recorded Celeste you might want to see if you can find this on your SAP ledger for next close or leave a note to whoever is taking over A My questions is how are we going to handle the depreciation issue Because isnt it our understanding that the basis is still on R Also since we reversed the interest income on R in as a temporary item I guess we are going to have to transfer the tax balance associated with the M to A at some point So that it can be tracked to turn At what point it is appropriate to do that Thanks Shanna

wanted you to have an electronic copy of all of this information also so you can pass on to who ever takes this entity over Shanna Forwarded by Shanna HusserHOUEES on AM Enron Energy Services From Carrie Chaffin PM To Shanna ES cc Subject RE Tax related questions on R Heres my answers to your questions If you want to meet to discuss just let me know Forwarded by Carrie ChaffinHOUEES on AM Shanna Husser PM To Carrie ES cc Subject RE Tax related questions on R Carrie As you know I took over the tax work of this entity in June I am still trying to work out some details on this company and make sure I have a complete understanding of the GL in order to be better equipped to make tax decisions From looking at last years tax return it looks like there is some difference between how book and tax handles the the information being held in SAP account Interest Income Third party Can you please provide some type of schedule for that account that is comparable to what was provided last year Last year the account was broken out into parts interest income on assets owned by EES interest income on assets not owned by EES and interest on loansnotes I would be happy to fax you a copy of what I am looking at if it helps clear up any confusion I have attached a spreadsheet that details the current year activity in the interest income account Currently the only interest income following through R is Interest on our Owens Corning SaleLeaseback Interest on the TRW Credit Reimbursement and Interest on Excelsiors Capital Project Reimbursement essentially a loan There is no construction interest like there was last year this is all recorded on Company A I also have a note in the file saying that for the year books incorrectly booked the Quebecor million promotional fee as a loan and calculated interest income on this loan Was this error corrected in the year Or should I see interest income from this million Quebecor promotional fee in the breakout of the SAP account Interest Income Third party This error was corrected in The next issue is book amortization Where is this being recorded on the income statementIs it still in There seems to have been confusion about if this was going to change This is still recorded in account other COS We had tried to move it to amortization expense but Wade wanted it moved back above the line in COS This makes sense as really this amortization is a cost to the Deal Heres a schedule that details out the amortization activity for I have the following listed as companies that have separate amortization issues Browns Giants Owens Corning Advanced Glass Owens Canada Extended Promo License extension of Owens Corning Quebecor Giants Equipment I already have received completed book amortization schedules for the first three from you provided to Angie last year can you provide the amortization schedules for the rest It is my understanding that on the last no book amortization was recorded in and that the amount that should have been recorded in will be caught up along with the booking of the numbers Can you please verify that this is true and that the recording of the has occured Also could you please provide information for any other new deals that have occured in that books is calculating amortization for I am open to any suggestions that would make this easier to track The next major issue is deferred debits Can a get a detail of what makes up deferred debits as of Heres a breakout of deferred debits at One thing I know will change is the Owens Canada Promotional Payment should actually be charged against the Owens Corning deal This will be changed in July Can I also have a detailed breakdown of what is making up SAP acct Other Revenues Third Party While I was reviewing this account for I found quite a few errors in the account so I corrected these in July I think it would be easier for me to send you a schedule as of with the breakdown of this account I am working on this schedule this week and will forward it to you by Friday Would it be possible to get all of this information by the end of the month Please call me if you want to discuss or if it would be easier to just meet in person Thanks Shanna I found a few more accounts that I need detail for that explains the balances as of Deferred Asset Development Cost The eschedule should help you with this Basically this account was all of our deferred debit activity that was moved from the MSA system This month August we are actually going to move all construction costs to this account and leave all other deferred debit activity in See the above reconciliation this details both accounts Deferred RevenueGains This is where we record RemedialReplacement capital Currently we have replacement capital for Springs Simon Tyco Let me know if you need further explanation on replacement capital Deferred Credits Other there is only one entry in this account and SAP says it was made by you This is a deferred Liability relating to the Pilkington contract We have agreed to pay them mm through credits on their next invoices This was expensed in June and this liability was established The credits on the invoice will be debited against this liability Current Liabilities Other The balance is in this account represents our cost accruals for June Other Revenues Third Party See above If this is in eschedule form that is great Unfortunately I currently dont have access to the folder on the J drive where EES posts the eschedules I am trying to get access I have attached the eschedule
