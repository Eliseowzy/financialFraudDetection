second quarter and YTD gross margin numbers for Upstream and Bridgeline broken out by originator and project Please read the following bullet points that explain the derivation of gross margin and primary contributors to each JM Huber was a producer netback transaction which transported distressed Rockies gas and transported it on Medicine Bow and Trailblazer landing the gas at NGPLOK Gage This Gage gas was sold to the Central desk and the West desk kept the segmentation optionality associated with the transport The transaction was booked in fourth quarter and was attributed to Mark Whitt He received credit for this transaction in EOY PRC At the time of the transaction Mark reported to me I have this transaction because ENA acquired Trailblazer transport on behalf of JM Huber The FERC approval certificate for the Trailblazer transaction was not approved until second quarter The MM reflects the PL associated with just the assignment of the Trailblazer transport the remaining PL associated with this producer netback deal was captured last year Transmission Congestion Contract TCC is the right to collect or the obligation to pay the DayAhead Congestion Rents associated with one megawatt MW of transmission between a specified Point of Injection POI and specified Point of Withdrawal POW The DayAhead Congestion Rents are determined by the difference in the Congestion Component of the DayAhead Prices at the POW of the TCC and the Congestion Component of the DayAhead Prices at the POI of the TCC for each hour of the effective period I have this transaction because the Transmission Origination group reported to me last year The group was ultimately disbanded and reallocated Maria Tefel and Peter Bennett both analysts calculate the associated PL from these congestion contracts These contracts end in November NOTE All transactions in Executive are PL generated last year but for various reasons could not be declared I handle all the administrative and tracking to make sure that the PL shows up for ENAs behalf In addition the expected budget for Upstream Products of MM does not include Executive since that PL is almost guaranteed and their product success should be differentiated The Upstream Product budget goals are list below Storage MM ECS MM Wellhead Desk MM Producer Ecommerce MM Formosa Upstream Products partnered with Duke Energy Field Services DEFS to close a year NGL exchange and transportation deal with Formosa Hydrocarbons and Williams Energy Field Services to handle raw make product from the Williams Markham plant Formosa Hydrocarbons is building a BPD fractionator to handle this and other Gulf Coast NGL production The accompanying pipeline will be known as the Seabreeze pipeline system and will be constructed by DEFS Texas Brine LLC will provide NGL storage services for Formosa Hydrocarbons on this system Primary production for this system is coming from the Boomvang Nansen field in the deepwater GOM and will be the first deepwater GOM production to come onshore in Texas Upstream Products has also worked to arrange a year transportation lease agreement on the Dean Pipeline owned by TEPPCO for refinery grade propylene service to be utilized by Formosa Plastics Coupled with this transaction Enron Clean Fuels has entered into a propylene storage agreement with Formosa Plastics to utilize ECFs Mt Belvieu storage facilities In addition Enron Global Markets has been able to amend its current transportation agreement with TEPPCO to prematurely terminate a takeorpay obligation and realize additional transportation revenues from interim NGL production coming from the Williams Markham to be delivered to Mt Belvieu Upon close Upstream Products was monetized out of its initial position by DEFS and retained a riskfree net profits position on the Seabreeze Pipeline going forward for an additional BPD of excess capacity on the system Bieniawski negotiated with Hilgert for of the gross margin associated with Formosa Bieniawski negotiated with Texas Brine to provide the NGL storage services for Formosa Hydrocarbons This storage capacity was key to Formosa Hydrocarbons to handle the NGL production expected and anticipated from the GOM Since John Goodpasture ECF refused to acknowledged any value associated with the propylene storage agreement they entered into with Formosa Plastics negotiated by Hilgert Bilberry I granted out K in origination from Executive which was dispensed ECS and Storage Based on conservative assumptions I expect this transaction to generate a minimum of MM PV for ECF Theoretically the MM next to Chris Hilgerts name should be shared with Mike Bilberry but since the Enron value associated with Formosa was much greater than the PL reflected in Upstream Products please keep this in mind Hubbard was a compression transaction closed in The MTM value recognized upfront for this transaction was based on minimum guaranteed load profiles for the electric horsepower With this compression transaction there is significant accrual earnings potential if the electric compressor is run at a higher load profile because the shippers pay in mmbtu to the compressor owner who then gives the natural gas to ECS LLC where it is monetized Mark Knippa closed this transaction and is responsible for coordinating with Carol Carter the accrual opportunities for ENA Pluto MEGS When I was examining my capital charges for I assigned Lisa Druzbik to analyze all accounting cashflows and capital charges associated with this project Although the gross margin associated with this transaction is not originated she did a great job creating the project proforma and helping me reassign this deal to ECR Mariner Tennessee Gas Pipeline was the virtual compression deal closed at the end of second quarter by Chris Meyer A virtual compression deal maintains the contractual obligation to fulfill the physical delivery of molecules and circumvents the need for running compression The Wellhead desk sold BCF to Tennessee and will deliver it into a storage facility providing adequate pressure not to run their expensive electric compression during the summer for storage withdrawals ENA captured value by selling gas above market and also received intramonth flexibility for the delivery of the gas into storage You have already received a memorandum from John Grass to me discussing his accomplishments YTD for the Wellhead desk and Producer Ecommerce If you need further clarification please let me know I know this email is long but the devil is in the details I will discuss the MM in origination associated with BHLP as well as my accomplishments in a follow up email Mrha I

will have much to talk about and I will compensate by talking very fast Upstream Products I am meeting today with Scott Josey regarding PlutoMEGS John Lavorato asked me revisit with him regarding this residual position from Production Offshore and did not want me to assume that although ECR is responsible for restructuring Mariner that Josey would also take on the PL responsibility associated with this project Depending on the outcome of the meeting will determine whether or not PlutoMEGS ends up in the new Principal Investments headed by Kevin Garland or ECR Personally the PlutoMEGS transaction should be valued and restructured with all of Mariner and should be redeployed to ECR Principal Investments does not have the expertise or connections to evaluate this transaction Most of the individuals have been redeployed in Production Offshore with the exception of Lisa Druzbik Tom Byargeon has decided to work with Randy Maffett over at EGM I am sure that you are disappointed by his decision and I tried my best to keep him within ENA Tom wants to do asset based finance and was not interested in leading the Producer Ecommerce group I spoke with Dave Duran and impressed upon him how we both wanted to retain Tom within ENA and that his organizations could be a good fit with his background Tom met with Duran once and Duran had one followup phone call with him I briefly saw Dave in the lobby after their meeting and I impressed upon Dave that I wanted Tom to choose an opportunity that best fit his background and interests and hoped that he would stay within ENA To no avail Kevin Miller is going to lead Producer Ecommerce with Ken Loch I am very excited by this staffing and feel that within the week of their focus they have accomplished much We are going to cold call Producers with market caps of less than billion I have been very disappointed by the lack of flow from our Producer Originators and am not going to wait any longer Kevin is also addressing the need to have a sales agreement with HMS and as well as a need to offer crude outsourcing to the Producer segment I am very happy that I moved John down to to be closer to the logistics organization It has improved the efficiencies and the PL associated with his Wellhead portfolio However I would like his group to be more concentrated together and not spread out amongst Natural Gas Structuring I would like for the Wellhead desk to have the seats that are currently being used by IT to support the Fundamentals group I think that the success of the Wellhead desk is more important than having IT to support the Fundamentals portal In addition Ed McMichael has taken over the management role of making the Wellhead deals currently flowing to the Regional Physical desks and incorporating them into the Wellhead desk Although I appreciate his interest the desks need to properly rebook these transactions since they are often in the system incorrectly and John should not have to inherit these deals at mid In addition John and his employees are working very hard to move forward with the rollover of these deals but the desks need to move forward with the rebooking of these transactions in the system If they are not interested Ed McMichael should not blame John I will be attending the next meeting scheduled by Ed to move forward on this effort In addition I have received no comments or inquiries regarding the Hotlist Update from Upstream Products that I gave to all regional heads of origination When we begin to cold call on the producer segment for the Producer One effort we will disburse a list to the Producer Originators Bridgeline I have been doing much thinking about Randys motivation not to sign the proposed BHLP Compensation Plan resolved by the board As a Texaco employee under contract Randys contract has a change of control provision which can be triggered during any time two years after Chevron successfully purchases Texaco Triggering this change of control would be the result of not being offered the same pay in the past FTC telling Chevron to liquidate BHLP highly unlikely or job responsibilities change Hence if we try to sell our interest in BHLP Randy could argue that his job responsibilities have changed since BHLP would be owned by a different parent firm If that happens Robyn Davis told me that he is entitled to X his highest bonus That would be quite substantial considering what he got paid last year We will get the highest EBITDA multiple only by selling our interest with ChevronTexaco Because of the change of control provisions with a two year time frame Chevron will not be motivated to consider outside third party bids Hugh Connett VP is under contract as well As such Brian and I are going to meet next week with Robyn and Jack to encourage all seconded employees from Enron and Texaco become BHLP workers Besides nullifying any change of control provision existing for Texaco contracted employees this action would alleviate many of the HR issues that occurred when we sold HPL to AEP More importantly the employees of BHLP would be aligned with Bridgeline not their parent companies We will not get a higher EBITDA for a tradingmarketing organization if all existing employees want to go back to their parent firms I am sure that we are going to get much resistance from the Texaco board members Last but not least I heard that Lavorato is considering moving the responsibility of HMS and BHLP to Principal Investments under Garland I am disappointed by this action on many levels HMS is part of the value chain for Producer One metering and monitoring and impacts our Producer ecommerce business In addition Brian and I have the history and understanding of BHLP to extract the most value for Enron I do not relish my role as a board member for BHLP but I wonder why Lavorato has not considered my input when making this decision The attached worksheet has updated PL accrual other and origination from January May May accrual and cost centers were closed yesterday Regards Mrha
