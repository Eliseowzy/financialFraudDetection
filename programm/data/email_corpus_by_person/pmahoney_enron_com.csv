discussed please let me know if you think the reporter would benefit from a followup conversation with Scott Gahn commodity market expert Thanks Peggy Mona L NRON PM To Peggy ES cc Susan J NRON Sandra nron Joseph NRON Marcie NRON Paul Kaufman Lysa CT Mary CT Alan Comnes Harry nron Subject FW Interview wLA TimesEdelman PR Contact ListTomorrow Consume r Advocates Announce Their Energy Plan I participated in a call with Nancy Vogel energy reporter from the LA Times today and other ARM members Peter Bray The New Power Company and Rick Counihan Green Mountain The conversation was mostly to provide background on retail issues I emphasized that Peter and Rick were the spokespeople for the coalition and I was there for background purposes only She was very receptive and seemed to grasp the importance of developing a retail market We discussed how AB was mostly geared toward developing a competitive wholesale market and provided very little guidance about retail market structure We discussed that during the rate freeze there was no impetus for consumers to shop so long as they were insulated from market prices We also stated that the transition period was used more for ensuring stranded cost recovery and not for developing a retail market structure We said that we have been raising the lack of retail market structure in various proceedings at the CPUC Now that deregulation is center stage in the administration and likely the legislature we feel it is important to include retail competition as a solution to the problems in the market today There was discussion about the utilities being required to purchase on a spot basis through the PX and passing those costs directly to consumers With the spikes over the summer consumers in San Diego revolted against such substantial increases without notice Because the retail market was essentially undeveloped consumers didnt know they had somewhere else to go for relief Nancy asked why the retail market has not developed Rick responded that some of the authors of the legislation either believed that competition at the wholesale level would provide adequate benefits to consumers and therefore retail competition was not valuable or that the rate freeze insulation from price increases was an adequate quid pro quo to utility recovery of stranded costs Regulators have moved very slowly on cost separation issues allowing the utilities to continue to recover the costs of their retail services through distribution rates from all customers make their prices appear to be cheaper Lastly neither the legislature nor the Commission determined what the utilities role in the new restructured environment would be are they a pipeswires company are they facilitators for direct access are they competitors We explained that we believe there is a strong reason to define the utilities obligation to serve residential and small commercial customers now Large customers can take care of themselves Why is this important As the utilities enter into contracts they need clarity on for whom they have an obligation to purchase This minimizes any potential for future stranded cost claims any claims that the utilities could make absent such direction up front Secondly it reduces the utilities ability to charge an exit fee or other financial claim on departing customers who decide to go direct access The next piece of the puzzle would be to define the default service for residential and small commercial customers The utility would provide a fixedrate product to small residential and commercial customers for a transitional period of time Based upon the San Diego experience it is politically imperative that smaller customers have rate certainty This also provides a target against which other service providers can compete The utilitys price is a fixed price with no trueup The utility would have purchasing flexibility to meet the target price The price could be set by the CPUC A certain portion of the utilitys purchases will still be met through spot market purchaes Customer migration res and small commercial should not be an issue The last piece of the puzzle would be to encourage competition for the default provider role ala PECO where of the residential customers went through an auction process This issues is important to Shell and The New Power Company She seemed very interested in the issue recognized that no one else was talking about it and she may want to follow up with individuals later Getting customer affadavits would be another indicator of value for developing a retail market that would be helpful for our PR efforts with ARM and Edelman and for responding to press inquiries Forwarded by Mona L PetrochkoNAEnron on PM Fairchild Tracy on PM To Aaron
